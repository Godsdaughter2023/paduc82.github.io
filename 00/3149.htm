<h2>            Office Lens not working</h2>
                    Exporting to Word, PowerPoint, or PDF does not work. It remains stuck at transferring or you get the "Couldn't upload (tap to retry)" error. I have attempted to retry the transfer and it simply does not work. This application is a great idea if it only
 works, which it does not.

<p>Hello Mayra</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>• What are the size of the documents that you are trying to transfer? – Its about 1.2 MB in size. Even other wise, anything I scan, I don’t get to the part where it converts it to a .pdf or move it to the cloud or export it to OneNote irrespective of the
 size ☹</p>
<p>
</p><p>• Can you check if the date and time of your device is properly set up? – Yes, the Timezone is set to India and its not set up as 24-Hour time.
<br />
</p>
<p>• Did you perform any changes prior to the issue? – Nope, this App was on my iPhone all this while and when I wanted to use it for something, it just didn’t work and I spent a lot of time researching it but then gave up coz I didn’t find too much help on
 this one ☹<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this helps, I have Intune Setup on my iPhone and I did check with my team and they say none of the Intune settings will cause Office Lens to stop working though.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
To isolate the issue, we suggest exporting or converting a file with a small file size. You can also try updating the application to see if there is an update available that have improvements and fixes for it.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, if the troubleshooting steps above did not work, we recommend uninstalling and reinstalling your Office Lens to have a fresh copy of it that can eliminate the error that you encounter.<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your feedback.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know more about this issue to come up with a resolution. Did you recently updated the firmware/OS version of your device? If so, there could be a compatibility issue between the new firmware/OS version and the current version of Office Lens.</p>

                    <p>I just installed the latest version of OneNote Mac which is enabled for OneDrive for Business. Yet providing valid credentials returns the message "There is a problem with your account. Please try again later." I also tried to launch my notebook from OneNote
 online and click on Open in OneNote but it prompt for my credentials and return the same message. Any ideas or other workaround to suggest from anyone or is this product not ready for business yet?</p>

            <p>Mhm. I thought, NMS was disabled back in October 2014 already. However, I never used it, to be honest.</p>
<p>Anyway with a Nokia N95, you are able to setup your E-mail provider directly. Does that work? If not, which E-mail provider do you use?</p>

<ul>
<li>3rd Edition Feature Pack 2,</li><li>5th Edition, and</li><li>Nokia Belle.</li></ul>
<p>Your Nokia N95 is based on the too old Symbian/S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1. Therefore, if you want to stick to a non-touch phone, I recommend
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/93186a12-4cd2-4f57-81bf-d071627cf0be?threadId=08c1d9ff-33ae-4575-815f-09836a505ec5">
one of these…</a>&nbsp;Nevertheless, I am happy about feedback of your findings. Therefore, let us have a look at them, one by one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My Nokia N95 don't support [<a href="http://dl.nokia.com/ns/symfix/networking_improvements.SIS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Network Improvements.sis</a>].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is expected because that file is just for Nokia Symbian/S60 3rd Edition feature Pack 2 devices. Newer support this out-of-the-box. For older phones, we do not know of any workaround.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have not ‘Trusted site certificates’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Do you mean, you do not find that menu-path? Or do you mean you do not have any certificates listed there? The latter is more than OK because you end-up with a certificate there only when you accepted a certificate warning/question – which you should not
 so actually. Therefore, it is more than OK not to have any certificates there. However, if you do not find that menu-path, please, reply again and tell us where the path differs/ends in your Nokia N95.</p>

<p>Mhm. That is surprising because that works with my Nokia E90 Communicator and Nokia E66 – just double-checked. Let us concentrate on ‘GoDaddy Class 2’. Did you download it with the internal ‘Web’ browser? Which network operator do you use, in which country?
 Which firmware version do you have: Please, dial *#0000#.</p>

    <title>OpenForm Data Mode and Window Mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spq28  say:</h3>
<h2>            OpenForm Data Mode and Window Mode</h2>
                    <p>I am using Microsoft Access 2010 and trying to create a Command Button that opens a form in Data Mode Add and Window Mode Dialog.</p>
<p>I added the Command Button to a blank form and added the OpenForm function to the On Click event, setting the Form Name, Data Mode to Add and Window Mode to Dialog.</p>
<p>I then changed the view to Form View and tried clicking my new button...</p>
<p>The form appeared, but it was not a dialog, it was a separate tab, and it wasn't in Add mode - it was displaying the first record in the underlying table and allowed me to edit that record.</p>
<p>After a little experimentation, I learned that the button was merely bringing the already open form to the foreground (so to speak - excuse me if this isn't the usual terminology) in whatever mode it was already in. If I closed the form then pressed the
 button again, the form was re-opened in Dialog mode with blank fields.</p>
<p>My question is: how can I make a command button that opens a form in Add mode as a Dialog, regardless of whether the form is already open, and without disturbing any instances of the form that are already open?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Ian</p>

            <p>Thanks for the detailed background; it puts your questions into context.&nbsp; Let's look at a few specific points.</p>
<p>&lt;QUOTE&gt;<br />
This final screen should be "full screen" and could be modal, though there is no need for it to be a pop-up window and, I suspect, might make best use of limited tablet screen realestate if it were a regular window rather than a pop-up window.<br />
&lt;/QUOTE&gt;</p>
<p>It seems to me that you don't in fact want dialog mode.&nbsp; Modal would work for you, or you could present a form that occupies the whole Access window (which may or may not be full-screen, as you choose), and can only be closed by making a selection or clicking
 a Cancel button.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&lt;QUOTE&gt;<br />
In this particular instance, I don't think I need to deal with multiple instances of a form being open.<br />
&lt;/QUOTE&gt;</p>
<p>I agree; from your description, I don't see why you would need multiple instances of the same form.&nbsp; I've used that technique in applications where one wants to see multiple related entities of the same type together, as for example an employee and his supervisor,
 or a school child and each of his parents.&nbsp; But so far as I can see, your application drills down to a single specific question, then displays it -- one question at a time.</p>
<p>&lt;QUOTE&gt;<br />
I don't even know if it is practical / possible to have multiple instances of a form open at the same time in Access, but I have done so in other application frameworks and, if it is possible, I would like to know how to do it in Access and, as much as possible
 write my applications to open forms in a way that is independent of whether or not there are any instances of the form already open.<br />
&lt;/QUOTE&gt;</p>
<p>It is both possible and practical, under the right conditions, though you have to manage the forms yourself.&nbsp; However, you mention using SharePoint and web deployment, and I don't think you can do it with Access web forms.&nbsp; I could be wrong, but the only
 way I know of to do it involves forms with VBA code behind them, and Access web forms can't have VBA code, so that method won't work.</p>
<p>Since you asked, the non-web method for opening multiple instances of an Access form only works for form's with VBA code, because forms with VBA have class modules, and you can create what is called a non-default instance of the form -- or any number of
 such instances -- by using VBA to create a new instances of that class module, as with code similar to this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim frm As Form_MyFormName</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set frm = New Form_MyFormName<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; frm.Visible = True</p>
<p>The form instance will close automatically and be destroyed when the last refernce to the class instance goes out of scope.&nbsp; This generally means that you need to maintain a global collection of form references, adding each new instance to the collection
 when you create it, and removing the reference from the collection when you want to close the form or when you detect that the user has closed it.</p>
<p>To locate a specific instance from among several, you could either assign a specific key to each instance when you add it to the collection, or else loop through the collection members checking properties of each instance, such as the .Caption property,
 until you find the one you want.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as I said, this method creating multiple instances won't work with Access web forms.&nbsp; If there's another method that you could use with web forms, I don't know about it, but I haven't yet spent any time working with the new web features of
 Access 2010.</p>
<p>As for writing your application "to open forms in a way that is independent of whether or not there are any instances of the form already open", I'm not sure that it's worth stepping outside of the built-in functionality of Access unless you really want
 to allow multiple instances of the same form open.&nbsp; Access assumes that, if you say "open form X" and form X is already open, all you want to do is bring form X to the front.&nbsp; However, you can easily write your own form-opening routine that determines whether
 the form you requested is already open, and if it is, does whatever you want to it:&nbsp; close and reopen, or filter to a different record, or set various properties, or whatever.&nbsp; It's simple to tell if form X is already open;&nbsp; just write:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If CurrentProject.AllForms("X").IsLoaded Then</p>
<p>If you need to determine what "view" the form is open in, you can check properties of the form for that.</p>

<h2>            Season Pass - How Long for New Episodes to Become Active&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>How long after the original air date are new episodes made available with a season pass? I purchased the pass for season two of Animal Kingdom, which airs on Tuesday nights. The latest episode has yet to be made available in my account. Is there a regular
 schedule in which new episodes are uploaded? As a first time subscriber, this is awfully discouraging, especially for the cost of this service. If content isn't reliably made available in a timely manner then what's the point...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts? Your help is much appreciated!</p>

<p><span>Hi ParishClerk1,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you post this thread on outlook /office 365 for business category, my understanding is that when you send emails from outlook client that you received the error code, please clarify if I misunderstand your text.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this case, first please help check if you could send emails in your email web side. For example you are using office 365 account, please sign into
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Outlook Web App (OWA)</span></a> and check if you could send emails there.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you could send emails from the web side, this indicates that the issue is likely related to your outlook client. So it is recommended that please double check your email configurations settings(POP/IMAP) in the outlook client, especially the Outgoing(
 SMTP) <span>&nbsp;</span>and incoming server addresses. If you are using office 365 account, we don’t recommend you configure the office 365 account to outlook client with POP/IMAP protocols, we recommend that you can directly use your office
 365 account and password to sign into outlook. If you are not using office 365 account, you may need contact your email provider to help you check your email account configuration settings in the outlook.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, if you have confirmed that your email configurations are OK, you can try to run the office repair and check if it can make any difference. For more information, please refer to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I’d like to collect some more information for further investigation:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What types email account you are using in the outlook client and can’t send emails (like office 365 account, Gmail, Outlook.com account etc.)? And how do you configured it to outlook client, POP or IMAP?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The version of your outlook client, please go to File &gt; Office Account and take a full screenshot about it to me.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Please take a screenshot about the full details of the error message you got to me, thanks.</span></p>

<h2>            Old style widgets for Belle &#40;hate the new clock, calender and e-mail widgets</h2>
                    Why does Nokia have to ruin everything :-( On Anna I had the combined clock/profile/calender widget that took less space that the new clock widget AND had shortcuts to clock, profiles and calender AND adapted to theme color. On Anna the calender widget
 showed several appointments. The new Belle variant show ONE appointment and is WHITE (nice on a dark theme ehhh) and takes up just a much space. On Anna the e-mail widgets showed several mail in one widget slot. On Belle they show the same but take 3 time
 the space AND they are BLUE and WHITE and does not follow theme colors (nice for dark themes and for battery saving - not). On Anna I had room for clock/profile, calender 3 e-mail widgets and shortcuts on the same startscreen. Now just 2 e-mail widgets takes
 a shole screen (and does not show more). I have managed to save some space with the "ComingNext" calendar-widget (<a href="http://comingnext.sourceforge.net/)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://comingnext.sourceforge.net/)</a> but still I have to use a extra startscreen
 for the mail. And I don't like that. Now I can't see my mails on the main screen - but must swipe to another. I general I think many things take more "click" on Belle than on "Anna" :-( Wish I hadn't updated :-( Is there a way to go back to "Anna"?

<p>&nbsp;Did you not do any research before updating to Belle? Just a quick Google search would have given you plenty of information plus screenshots to show you what it's all about. And no, you cannot roll back to Anna I'm afraid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            The screenshots and articles talked about many more variants of widgets. And about possibility to change size. Belle has none of that as I can see :-( And the stupid HUGE calender and e-mail widgets I didn't see anywhere. Why couldn't the old stype widgets
 be there as an alternative? (in new Windows versions you can still go back to the old look)

<p>LarsErik - I completely agree with you. The new widgets might 'look' nicer but the functionality has been removed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also dislike the email widgets being so large, the Social v1.5 widget now takes you right into a particulat post, rather than just open Social, and as you say the combined Clock/Profile I really miss - the new 'Profile' widget looks awful and takes up
 more space!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not looking to go back to Anna, but some things should have been left as they were - or the user given more choice in possibly keeping older style widgets. I can see right away what I have lost in useability and know that it isn't just a case&nbsp;of 'getting
 used to the new widgets'. I will actually have to revert back to icons rather than widgets for most things - a backward step in my view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They use of space of the new widgets in terrible and as LarsErik says, results in more home screens, which I think many other users will dislike over time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as for your comment RayHipKiss - how long can one practically stay on an older OS, especially given that over time apps will increasingly swicth over to Belle-only variants.&nbsp; You surely aren't suggesting the only way to get decent widgets is to snub
 a new OS and stay on old tech? The new tech shouldn't be a step backwards.</p>

<p>Widgets do exist that are better than the ones that we've been given in the official Belle rollout.&nbsp; I flashed a couple of leaked Belle releases to my N8 during the past couple of months and there was a larger calendar widget plus smaller clock and music
 player widgets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tonight I went on a hunt to find them and located the .sis files. Unfortunately when I tried to install them I got "certificate error". Guess I'll be installing the newly&nbsp;hacked Belle to make these work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;My response to the OP did not suggest for him to stay on Anna but merely that he should have carried out a bit more research before updating and he wouldn't have had cause to complain. Also, if he had waited a bit longer he would have been able to read
 other peoples comments and views about the update and then waited for Nokia to release any further updates to iron out the bugs in the initial release. As it stands at the moment,it's not worthwhile updating to Belle as the OP has found to his cost.</p>

<p>I thought I'd done my research, I seen the screenshots - but I was more swept along by the 'thats looks nice and new and shiny' more than any practical thoughts. and thats the way the world is going - 'Update this' and 'Update that' - the status quo is never
 enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll be honest, even if I knew some features were (to me) a backward step, I'd still have upgraded because the promise was for a slicker, faster, more stable OS. Its just unfortunate that to reach that bigger goal we are expected to sacrifice something we
 really liked. And no-one can blame me for upgrading for that reason, buyt still being disappointed with other major features....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And there seems to be a growing concensus out there that the new widgets really are annoying a lot of people.....</p>

<p>&nbsp;Of course, it's usually presumed that an update is exactly that and you wouldn't expect to face the sort of issues people are facing but, there's not a lot that can be done about it now. Better to wait for a further update/bug fix to see if these issues
 can be resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have stated more than once in other threads that I had no intention of updating to Belle just to get an Androidesque UI on my N8 but many forum users who were running the leaked version stated that it was more than just a fancy UI and was a significant
 improvement all round to the OS. How much of that was Fanboyism is anyones guess, so I'm back to my original opinion of not being too bothered about "updating" my N8. For the time being Anna will suffice even though I don't think much of that version either.</p>

<p>Hello Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to your description, we understand the problematic Office 365 account cannot be added to the Outlook client. However, if the user can login to the Outlook Web App (OWA), it says this hosted on cloud Office 365 account is valid.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this situation, based on my experience, the issue may be related to the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Autodiscover</span> record, because we need the Autodiscover service to configure our Office 365 account to Outlook client. Please let your admin check if the Autodiscover record is configured correctly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the admin reference:&nbsp;</p>

            Aaron, I know this is an old thread, but you can use Find to search out individual tasks. &nbsp;Type Ctrl + F, and you will get a find box that will search among the tasks for you. &nbsp;It highlights the term you sought - and can be a little too subtle until you
 get the knack.

<p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>Good advice if you send one to the MS Teams Uservoice, but there seems to be no action on the MS side in Planner. There are at least a dozen requests for search there with not one response. AAMOF, I don't see but a few interactions from MS. The Teams Uservoice
 has an active MS presence and that's very useful.</p>

<h2>            Strange Error Message when Updating Links</h2>
                    <p>I have a file that has been rolled forward for years. When I first open it up, I get this box (because it is linked to other workbooks):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b84bcbf-fbb4-4cfe-87d1-ff7dbaac974f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b84bcbf-fbb4-4cfe-87d1-ff7dbaac974f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I hit "Update", I get a long delay, probably 20 seconds, and then this error message:<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb2db652-5eb7-4d32-a6f7-82dba2fa6046?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eb2db652-5eb7-4d32-a6f7-82dba2fa6046?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Using all forms of Ctrl+F doesn't find anything. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Going to Data --&gt; Edit Links doesn't show that I'm linking to that file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted every named range that isn't within this workbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm stumped. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks. Unfortunately that first article you referred to doesn't help. My document is linked to many external references, but it does not show that it is linked to the workbook that appears in the error message.</p>

<p>Hi Jake,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I break the links one by one, but I find that only when I delete all the links, the error message will not appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the external links in the error messages are in the locations like your server, could you please try break the links from your side to see the result? (Do a copy paste to backup first)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, we are not the creator of the workbook, it may be a bit of a waste of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you contact the creator of the workbook and confirm the resources in the error message with him/her?
</p>
<p>The resource files may be moved or deleted, if he/she can find it, it will be easy to avoid the error message.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Why are imported slides sideways and how to fix it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>SO I find Onenote and am thinking "this is the greatest software ever, I can use it for everything note-related". Then it gets better when I find out I can import whole slideshows so I can write notes on them, underneath them, and everywhere really.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I go to import a slideshow, and to my dismay, everything is sideways....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it might just be that particular slideshow, but nope, it does if for multiple PDF files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way&nbsp;to fix this so I get properly oriented slides?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Before you suggest it, I can select the image, but can not rotate it using the Draw tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!!</p>

<h2>            Apparently I have to ask the question, because there is a solution for Excel being slow.</h2>
                    <p>There is none I could find.</p>
<p>Simply Microsoft Excel 2013 is junk!!!</p>
<p>I just upgraded to version 2013 from 2010 in the morning. All files which were perfectly fine when used in 2007 or 2010 are slow. Excel constantly goes into (Not Responding) mode.</p>
<p>Calculations are off as the spreadsheets are big. Every few moments I add new information and have to wait 15 - 30 seconds for Excel to come back from another world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone there at Microsoft fix this? You are not paid for people to lose money by wasting time!</p>
<p>I did not start using Excel in the morning. It is not the computer being slow. Xeon W3680 on Dell Precision T3500 with 12 GB of memory and plenty of SSD room. Network is not an issue, because I disabled it to see if that's the case. It was not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix this damn Excel!!!!</p>
<p>I spent thousand of $ to purchase the licenses and install on users computers but, as I am reading on the Net now, you simply ignore users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not hiding and you, Microsoft developers, please do not hide either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help with fixing this application is greatly appreciated by thousands.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, even is MS is listening, they exceedingly rarely reply to questions and complaints. So don't hold your breath waiting for a reply from MS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: MS is not doing any significant work on Office 2013. They are only providing "bug fixes" now. All of their efforts are conentrated on 2016 and "Vnext".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, Office 2013 is notorious for having slow performance. There are a few commonly used fixes that sometimes help. The underlying problem is that MS changed the programming that "draws" the application (Word/Excel) on the screen. Unfortunately it has a
 bad "interaction" with some hardware/software. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Great, you did "all possible" fixes, so what do you expect from us?&nbsp; If you tell us what fixes you used, we won't waste our time (we don't care about wasting your time, like you apparently don't car about wasting ours) providing duplicate suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here are the fixes that have worked for other people.&nbsp; Maybe there is one that you haven't tried yet ...</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<strong><span>Office 2013 Slow - Turn Off Onedrive Sync</span></strong>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps uncheck the “use Office to sync files faster...”&nbsp;setting in Onedrive.
</span></p>
<p><span>Reference: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_home-office_install/microsoft-office-document-cache-sync-client/6b011698-e0d8-4cc0-b3c2-674ba2565fc3?page=1">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_home-office_install/microsoft-office-document-cache-sync-client/6b011698-e0d8-4cc0-b3c2-674ba2565fc3?page=1</a></span></p>
<p><span>I looked at the Settings of the&nbsp;Onedrive desktop application and I saw that the option “Use Office to sync files faster and work on files...” was checked. I unchecked it and everything went normal, my CPU is now under control and there’s
 no CSISYNCSLIENT.EXE process in the background... Somehow, this started when I used OneNote via Outlook 2013 for the first time.</span></p>
<p><span>What this process does is build a very large cache of indexed Office files on your local drive. &nbsp;For me, the cache was ~5GB, or about equal to the combined size of my Office files. &nbsp;That would be fine provided I had extra space available
 on my SSD, but I don’t. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I discovered that simply turning off this option does not automatically delete the cache and free the space. &nbsp;To recover the disc space I closed the Onedrive&nbsp;application&nbsp;and then deleted everything in C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\15.0\OfficeFileCache.
 &nbsp; Keeping the “Use Office” option turned off has resulted in a much smaller cache.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>MS needs to document the cause/effect of this option so people understand the impact it has on their system.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<div>
<strong><span>Slow Word 2013</span></strong>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Sluggish response in my office 2013 Word document editing was due to using the navigation pane only. I use navigation pane often since I typically work on large documents. Once I turned off the navigation pane, response is as expected.
 No other settings or features caused this poor response in Word 2013 because I tried them all! This “fix” proved to work on all my installs and a colleague’s office 2013 install.
</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>I have found that switching between all page viewing modes: read mode, outline, etc. and going back to print layout fixed the lag problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>I experienced a similar issue with slow typing speed in Office 365 Word. I edit a substantial number of Word and Excel documents for work and found the Onedrive storage incredibly beneficial for working remotely.</span></p>
<p><span>I realized though that documents which are being edited from Onedrive, not a local copy, experience the slow typing speed issue.</span></p>
<p><span>The fix: &nbsp; From word: &nbsp;File, Options. Word Options has an advanced tab on the left labeled ‘advanced’. About 3/4 of the way down, a category for ‘Save’ options exists. The default setting has ‘Allow Background Saves’ checked. I uncheck
 this option and instead check ‘Always create backup copy’ and ‘Copy remotely stored files onto your computer, and update the remote file when saving’.</span></p>
<p><span>I assume that if you’re storing the files on Onedrive, or Dropbox, or web, or maybe even some external drive or flash memory this background save could be lagging and result in typing slowness. Either way, I changed the advanced options,
 and no more problem. Maybe it’ll work for you.</span></p>
<p><span>Excel didn’t have the option, and I usually save a local copy anyways due to the working file size.</span></p>
<p><span>*I run windows 7 with office 365 and windows surface pro with win 8 and office 365. 4gb memory each.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/58936717-95a0-42a8-ab0e-0fffe1344e17">word 2013 is typing very slowly again</a></span></p>
<p><span>Answer</span></p>
<p><span>I have had the same problem on many computers and tried every solution I found on the web and nothing worked(registry changes, office settings(save display and more)).&nbsp; As a test&nbsp;I copied the files from my Onedrive folder to the desktop
 and everything worked well - typing was as fast as office 2010 - the slow typing&nbsp;was a one drive problem. &nbsp;Wanting both the benefits of Onedrive and the ability to type without lag I did the following:</span></p>
<p><span>1.Created a folder outside of Onedrive call Onedrive-Local.
</span></p>
<p><span>2 Downloaded MS SyncToy to sync Onedrive-Local to the Onedrive folder which uploads to the cloud.</span></p>
<p><span>Now I only work out of the Onedrive-Local folder and things are fast.&nbsp; The files get synced and I have access to them on the cloud.
</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>I had DisplayFusion installed on my machine. Quitting DisplayFusion immediately resolved my issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After quite a bit of experimentation, I found that many of the solutions proposed helped (marginal improvements) with the speed of the text entry in Word (I am using Word 2013 - delivered with Office 365 subscription).
</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, I thought the issue may be with performance or hardware compatibility related to Windows 10 (I am using a &nbsp;a preview version of Windows via Bootcamp dual-boot setup on a new Macbook Pro with Office 365 installed).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the end, I found that the main problem was change tracking!...I was editing an excerpt of a larger document which had “Track changes” activated. I can only imagine that the tracking of deletions was causing some sort of efficiency issue
 in the processing. </span></p>
<p><span>I have about 80% free RAM and a Quad core i7 system (16Gb of memory of which 80% is free, 100MB reserved for Word, so not a memory usage issue - must just be inefficient code)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I confirmed the Track Changes setting was main issue by activating all the animation etc (the other fixes proposed). Those factors did not cause the original issue to re-occur.</span></p>
<p><span>Interestingly, when my word locks up with this issue, the performance of the remaining applications is relatively unaffected.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<div>
<strong><span>Hide Track Changes</span></strong>
<p><span>I found that if I set the tracking drop down to "No Markup", the lag goes away.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This way you can continue to track changes, just not see them in real time.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<div>
<strong><span>Slow Excel 2013 - Rubber band effect, delayed Response time when typing – Disable Excel Animation feature</span></strong>
<p><span>In Office 2013 MS added a funky new UI feature called “Animation”. It is supposed to “smooth out”, or some such nonsense, cursor movement in the applications. I first noticed it in Excel 2013. I found it so annoying that that “feature”
 alone was enough to completely turn me off from using the whole Office 2013 bundle. Fortunately, or not (?), I found these fixes.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt; Hi, I have exactly the same problem, Excel2013.</span></p>
<p><span>Just opened a new spread sheet, typed the nr 1 in cell A1 to A22, took me about 10 seconds.</span></p>
<p><span>Took excel 55 seconds to display, looks like slow motion.&nbsp; &lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The article in the first link has a link to another article with a downloadable file that will make the change without you having to edit the registry manually</span></p>
<p><span>There’s an easier fix for the “rubber band” animations in Excel - just turn them off

<p><span>Alternate, related solution</span></p>
<p><span>I’m using Windows 8, and found a different solution there:
</span></p>
<p><span>To disable Windows animations (this is secondary IMHO, but may be required):</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>On the metro start screen type Edit,
</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>&lt;tab&gt;, &lt;down Arrow&gt; to then move the search results down 1 to “Settings”</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>“Edit system environment variables” is the first thing in second column on my search results, yours
 may vary </span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>double click on it</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>provide the admin password to display the “System Properties” dialog</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>In the “Advanced” tab, Performance section, click on the “Settings...” button to display the “Performance
 Options” dialog</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>Personally, I prefer to select the “Adjust for Best Performance” option to get rid of the frilly
 “bells &amp; whistles” that do not contribute to efficiency of my system.</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>At a minimum, confirm that the “Animate controls and elements inside Windows” option is disabled/unchecked.
</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>Click on Apply</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>OK out</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span>boot the computer</span></p>
<p><span>Under options &gt; advanced &gt; turn off<span>&nbsp; </span>
“allow editing directly in cells”</span></p>
<p><span>Here is another idea worth looking at :&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>I have had this problem also when authoring user guides.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Eventually I found that if I switched off the “Maintain compatibility” check box in the Save As dialog the problem disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span>Word may be scanning each element to make sure it maintains compatibility.</span></p>

<p><span>Hello Jacques,</span></p>
<p><span>I just saw this, and I can explain it. In 2013 we went to a more secure algorithm across Office - not just in Excel. Excel 2013 uses SHA-512. It makes only milliseconds of difference with one call, but in those cases where code runs, protecting
 and unprotecting many sheets, it all adds up to a terrible performance issue. </span>
</p>
<p><span>Because it is considered a security risk to modify that, all request for a change have been turned down. The development team will never do anything to make Office less secure. See

</span></p>
<p><span>Is Microsoft Excel 2013 running slow on your machine? Tired of the lag when switching cells? You’re not alone. Many people that have recently upgraded from Office 2010 to Office 2013 have noticed that the application performance
 when using Excel is subpar. Don’t worry. There’s a solution that should improve your experience.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1) Go to the “Start Menu” and select “Control Panel”</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>2) In the “Control Panel”, select “Ease of Access”</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>3) Select “Use the computer without a display”</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>4) In the “Adjust time limits and and flashing visuals” section, check the “Turn off all unncessary animations&nbsp; (when possible)” checkbox.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The next time you launch Excel 2013, you should notice that there is no longer a delay when switching cells while using the arrow keys or using your mouse. I hope this eliminates some of your frustration.</span></p>

<p><span>I changed the recommended settings &amp; have a single coloumn of 994,148 unformatted data it didn’t help.</span></p>
<p><span>BTW -&nbsp;I can do it on my older 2010 excel running on Windows 7 Professional.</span></p>
<p><span>I can’t on windows 8.1 64-bit HP laptop processor with installed RAM of 8 Gigs.</span></p>
<p><span>BINGO! I found the solution went to File- Account - Office Updates &amp; appended.</span></p>
<p><span>There must have been a patch undocumented but I can sort a million rows.</span></p>

<strong><span>PowerPoint Slow - update video driver</span></strong>
<div style="margin-left: 9.35pt">
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>&lt;snip&gt;</span>As well as what Steve said. On one PC a new Windows 10 update insisted on installing a "<span style="color: rgba(34, 36, 38, 1)">Standard VGA Graphics Adapter" driver which caused lots of problems.
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>I had to download the correct driver manually and install it.&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>And just to add a few bits to the whole video driver issue, some of the hardware drivers come from the hardware manufacturers, and by the time they make it through incorporation into a shipping version of Windows, may be out of date and
 not include the latest fixes. &nbsp;So in addition to disabling hardware accel as a test, it's worth looking to see if newer drivers are available from the manufacturer of your video card.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>And, odd though it may seem, PPT wants a reasonable printer driver installed and set as the default printer driver. &nbsp;You'll want to be sure you've done that, even if it's just the XPS driver that ships with most recent Windows versions.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Turn off Hardware Acceleration</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Visio 2013 x86 was super slow on a Dell Vostro machine running Windows 7 Professional x64. After a series of troubleshooting, I traced the problem to the accelerated graphics. Just disable the it. Here’s how:
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>File menu, </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Options command </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Advanced option </span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Scroll down to the Display section of the dialog,
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
<span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>toggle the check the box for “Disable hardware graphics acceleration</span></p>
<p><span>This issue is most noticeably on machine with dual video chip set.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>******</span></p>
<p><span>I have found slowness with Visio 2013, and found that turning off Snap to Shape intersections fixed the issue. ( View \ Visual Aids \ Snap &amp; Glue \
<strong>Shape Intersections )</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>********</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>UPDATE: I have gained a slight performance boost by disabling the “Animate Controls and Elements inside Windows” option in System Properties &gt; Advanced System Settings &gt; Performance Settings. &nbsp;Still not quite on par with Visio 2010, but
 we’re getting there.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<strong><span>NVIDIA video card fix</span></strong>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/8b902353-6fb7-49e7-9cee-36ee9fc0c471">Visio 2013 VERY slow</a></span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Anyway, this might not apply to everyone, but I saw a few other comments from people who also have Optimus-enabled laptops.</span></p>
<p><span>Basically, I’m forcing Visio to be rendered by my Quadro, instead of allowing it to be rendered by the Intel.</span></p>
<p><span>Go to the Nvidia Control Panel and open check the “Manage 3D Settings”</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Under the “Program Settings” tab</span></p>
<p><span>Add a reference to Visio if needed</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Set to use the discrete graphics</span></p>
<p><span>It’s working way better for me now, no more weird lag when moving the main window, and now more lag during pan/zoom.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p>The "plan" is you are you download a trial, use it for 60 days (or less) they PAY MS to BUY a license ...</p>
<p>If they can figure out that you have downloaded a trial they won't let it work.</p>
<p>One thing you can try is using a different email address. If that works, (it should) you still may have a problem installing it if MS recognizes that you have had a trial installed previously. In that case you will have to restore your computer to a backup
 (you do do periodic backups, right &lt;sigh, not likely&gt;) or re-install windows. Is a free trial worth the bother, you decide.</p>

<p>Apparently I didn't, sorry. OK, lets try again.</p>
<p>You have never installed trial, now the download is failing. Can you clarify exactly when you the &lt;snip&gt; " sorry, this key is not accepted due to earlier downloads, which may be too many"&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/snip&gt; messege.&nbsp; To me it sounds more like an activation error
 rather than a download.&nbsp; ahhh. By "download" do you mean copying the file from the web site to your HD&nbsp; ... OR ... do you mean after copying the file to the HD you double clicked on the file and "Installed" it. I think of the first option when you say download.</p>
<p>One thing that can help with my definition of download problems, Clear your temp folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>open the run window: &lt;win&gt; R </li><li>enter the word "%temp%" (without quotes) followed by &lt;enter&gt; key </li><li>Windows Explorer opens in the temp folder. </li><li>delete everything. Anything that is in use, just skip it. </li></ul>
<p>Just for the "hallibut", download one of these product key extraction tools and run it. That will give you an indication if WINDOWS&nbsp; "thinks" you have had a previous trial installed.</p>

            I know this is old but I just wanted to post incase anyone else has this problem. When you are trying to activate MS Office you should be in the activation wizard and it will tell you you can either activate through the online process or by telephone.
 If it denies you telling you it has been activated too many times, you can change the activation process to telephone and call the number it provides you, it will ask you to verify how many times this copy of office was installed and if you verify it correctly
 it will activate your software. <br />

    <title>external microphone for word audio notes&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            external microphone for word audio notes&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I'd like to use an external microphone to enhance the sound quality of the recording when I take notes in class. Using the Macbook Pro's built-in mic is ok, but sometimes the clicking sound of the keys drowns out what the teacher is saying. It can
 take me several playbacks to figure out what he/she actually said.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't find a definitive answer using google about whether the audio notes feature can be used with an external mic. I know the Macbook Pro can. But one post I read said that audio notes didn't recognize that an external mic was plugged in.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know anything about whether external mics can be used with audio notes, if any settings need to be changed when you do. Which mics would you recommend?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />

            Hello Dan,&nbsp;
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks for posting in the Microsoft Answers forum! After installing your microphone and selecting it as you device for sound input in System Preferences, you should be able to use it for your audio notes. You can set up your device using the steps in the

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Preventive measure. Do this every couple of days.</p>
<p>Internet Options&gt; General tab&gt; Browsing History&gt; Delete&gt; uncheck "Preserve Favorites website data" then delete Temporary Internet Files. No reason, yet, to delete cookies, history,&nbsp; passwords, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May help anytime IE becomes painfully slow...</p>
<p>Close all IE windows, then check Task Manager and close any IE processes still running.</p>

<h3> nobbyfrodo1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 920</h2>
                    
<p>Just picked up my Lumia 920 today and need help! Firstly, I couldn't transfer my contacts from my C-7 even though I had the transfer Data app and bluetooths were all on. It only downloaded preconfigured helpline numbers. I had already activated my google
 mail account and tried to sync with my outlook account which also wouldn't work. Deleted and started again and still no joy. The only way I could access phone numbers was through FB which had syncd but obviously not everyone on my Contact list is on FB. So
 I manually entered those numbers and now they are all stored on the FB 'hub'. Is there any other way to access contacts without having to revert to FB?? Also, every time I added a new contact an error message came up; hotmail contacts are currently hidden
 from your list, to show the contact you'll need to change your people settings'. Firstly, I am Gmail and secondly what exactly am I supposed to change in the people settings? I have read the online manual and it show's nothing pertaining to this problem. Is
 there no normal contact list without having to access a hub? Any help/ideas is appreciated.</p>

<p>If you go to 'Settings' within the Peple hub, there's an option called 'filter my contact list'. You'll then get a list of contacts by type. Hotmail is the default set of contacts that you'd add to manually.</p>
