<h2>            Xbox One Headset Adapter Problems</h2>
                    
<p>So i bought the OFFICIAL XBOX ONE &nbsp;headset adapter for my astro a40s and expecting astro a50s on monday, well it turns out when i speak in game or part chat my friends here a static sound !
<br />
<br />
THIS IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE FROM MICROSOFT AND XBOX MAKING A HEADSET ADAPTER FOR A PROPRIETARY &nbsp;CONNECTOR THAT DOES NOT EVEN WORK!!! To make it even worse all the proud ASTRO &amp; Turtle Beach users will probably have to wait ages before any kind of patch is put
 in place to fix this, It looks like my Astro A50s will start &nbsp;to gain dust just like my A40s have been since XBOX ONE LAUNCH.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It seems like microsoft has picked up the habit of having nothing work right out of the box....... &nbsp;Truly disappointed in Microsoft and Xbox today!</p>

<p>It is amazing and truly frustrating. &nbsp;Starting to wish I could go back in time and purchase a PS4 instead of XB1 and I have been a live member since the original Box. &nbsp;I believe we all wanted a gaming system not an entertainment system. Which would we rather
 have a system that works or being able to change your TV channels with your voice? &nbsp;Wow. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I recently purchased the turtlebeach xp 510 because turtlebeach confirmed them to work with the xbox one adapter. They even had a promo months before the adapter was being released as a buy a current gen headset and update to next gen for free. So I picked
 up two adapters from Game Stop, one for myself and a friend of mine who owns the xp 400 (also a confirmed working along with promo). After updating everything all work well but I quickly noticed the problem even though the adapter provides the intended game/chat
 volumes. The issue is that this adapter was made for wired headsets that dont have their own game/chat controls. The xbox one handles the sound processing and the adapter handles the levels for the wired headsets. The xp 510 are a wired or wireless headset
 but also processes sound both analog and digital through an RF transmitter. Which works with the adapter but the issue arises because now both the turtlebeaches and xbone adapter are handling the game volumes. This creates a sort of hall sound effect in the
 headset. If I turn down the game volume on the turtlebeaches (its a small wheel on the left earcup) and use the adapter for the game volume, the sound is not great. It sounds almost the same as using the headset on the xbox 360. That is not good as I want
 the best sound quality from the xbox one using the optical port to the transmitter. To achieve the best quality I do the opposite. Turn down the adapter game volume, turn chat all the way up and use the turtlebeach game volume. Makes sense right? No. When
 doing this in a party I noticed the chat level is lowered in the headset even though its at the max setting on the adapter(it beeps) so to fix I have to turn down the game volume level on the headset. Once I exit the party the volume levels increase. What
 this boils down to is I cant get the right chat/game volume mix, one is louder than the other and vice versa. This is because both the headset and adapter both have game volume settings. I see two options for fixing this. Microsoft can and should have made
 the adapter like the xbox one chat headset which only has chat volume or release an update with the option to disable the game volume through the adapter and allow headsets with game volume settings to be used to get the best audio settings. It seems as if
 Microsoft fixed the major issue and that was not being able to have chat through to the headset but created a new problem with the game audio which was fine from the beginning. Why do we need to control game audio from the adapter when most headsets people
 are using already handle this. Even if they dont have volume controls, either the tv, audio reciever and in game menu settings can be adjusted. This has turned out to be way more complicated than it should be and with Titanfall lauching in a couple days, I
 wont be able to use any custom sound presets or have the full immersive experience I was looking forward to. I should have just bought a cheap stereo headset that would work with this flawed accessory.</p>

<p>I See.... Yeah I find my self fiddling with my audio controls on the mix amp can't seem to get it how I want it. They should of just included a actual physical switch on the adapter, to switch on and off the sound management through the actual adapter or
 something. but I guess they were only thinking about there offical stereo headset when they were developing this..</p>
<p>I hope they acknowledge this problem quickly and start working on a fix for this quickly!</p>

<p>I have a turtle beach px21 headset and purchased the xbox one headset adapter. The stereo sound is coming through really well, but the mic isn't working with it. Is this a known issue or is my headset mic not compatible with the xbox one?</p>

<p>I have no idea, how do you hook them up does it go through a receiver or something ? This is the first I have heard of a mic not working. everything sounds perfect on my end but the damn adapter also manages sound and chat so it screws with my mixamp and
 it also causes static for other people when I talk. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I just really hope Microsoft is looking into this problem already and we don't have to wait for another monthly update......</p>

<p>Do you guys think Microsoft is even addressing this issue with any concern? Do they even care! I have not seen any thing of them even acknowledging this problem.
</p>
<p>Am pretty sure they will shrug and just release it with next big update! If they keep following there current track record.... &nbsp;Damn It's times like these when I think the Xbox glory days are behind us :(

<p><span><span>Hello, I searched many forums and threads about this and I know many people have very similar(or even the same) problem, but I still have not found any solution
 that would work for me. I am getting desperate...</span></span></p>
<p><span>I have headphones (a4tech hs-50) plugged in into the correct jacks (green for sound, pink for mic/both rear) and sound works just fine, but microphone somehow does not record anything. The
 thing is that when I go to Control Panel-Sound it shows me that both are plugged in, working properly and are set as default devices. Still, microphone doesnt record anything and it doesnt matter in which program I try it. It is not muted and is set to record
 level 100. I tryed boosting it...doesnt work. At first, I tought that mic is broken, but when I try it on brothers computer(Vista64) it works just fine. Any ideas? Thanks everyone I am really stuck on this. I am using windows 7 x64 and custom build computer.
 I will write specs if requiered.</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Refer your Motherboard manufacturer website and download the latest sound driver for Win 7 and check.<br />
Or check which sound chipset is used and refer their website and download the latest driver and check.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope that will help<br />

Thanks!

<p>I bought it and it has a blue star in the top right wich i think that means a update is needed so i click on it and it says you are early you must wait until the 27th now this happened with saintsrow 4 and gat outa hell and when it unlocked it had to redownload
 the games from scratch and i dont want that i want it downloaded and ready to play midnight monday not have to full install at that time all over again . Also i tryed to move it to my internal drive from my externall and it keeps saying you must finnish installing
 the game before you can copy or move it&nbsp; but as i said when i click it the thing says i am early and&nbsp; it does not install.</p>

<p>That's exactly what the problem is. Dying Light is not released until the 27th, but you are able to pre-download games on Xbox One so they are ready to play on release. You should be able to play starting on the 27.</p>

<p>No this is what happened to saintsrow 4 and gat out of hell and resident evil all pre ordered all pre downloaded same thing showing a star and not letting me move them to my internal drive then on release it re downloaded the whole game even though it was
 instaled and now dying light is doing everything step by step so its not because its not out as i own 70% of games on the x1 and there digital versions as i hate disk versions. I do understand how it works but now it has happened to 3 games in a row and this
 is the fourth and every detail is the same from not being able to copy or move the game to the game saying finish instaling and then it releases and it re downloads the whole game from scratch , if it was the first time i would say ok but 3 games prior and
 now this one also .</p>

<p>I found some other users online reporting this issue with other games. They said a hard reboot fixed it and for some reason the download stopped but said that it was finished until they did this. The fact that it has happened with 3 games in a row makes
 me doubt that this will help though.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire Collection MARATHON Award</h2>
                    
<p><span>Perhaps you can tell me why in the Microsoft Solitaire Collection, the Marathon Award/Achievement is not awarded even though I have Played each day for four (4) months completing all challenges. All that is required for this
 award is completing at least one (1) Daily Challenge for a month? </span></p>

<p><span>Thank You. </span></p>

<p>You must complete one challenge, each day, for a month. &nbsp;Which means playing it every day. &nbsp;Which is often confused with completing each day's challenges. &nbsp;So if for example I logged in today, and played all of the challenges for this month, it would not
 count towards this achievement. &nbsp;I would have to login and play a daily challenge every day.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft App Store requires Windows Firewall to be enabled.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Microsoft App Store requires&nbsp; Windows firewall</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently wiped my laptop and while re-installing everything, including my antivirus solution which includes a firewall, I realized that I never got prompted by my antivirus solution to disable the windows firewall, which it usually did. In all fairness,
 it's been a while since I've had to wipe a machine so I thought maybe things had changed but so I still went to check it out, and there it was, still enabled, so I disabled it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately since disabling it&nbsp;I'm no longer allowed to install apps from the MS app store. I get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"This app wasn't installed - View Details" </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the app itself, I get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The app could not be installed because the Windows Firewall Service is not running. Please enable the Windows Firewall Service and try again".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In all fairness to Microsoft, this is a pretty clear and concise message but what I don't get is why does a) a firewall needs to be enabled for the Windows app store and b) why the Windows Firewall service. Surely my firewall (from Bitdefender) is good enough,
 better properly!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone knows&nbsp;what's the story here and why does it need to be enabled. I've got 2 major issues with that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The Windows Firewall service is that it's blocking communication between my laptop and my printer, so I'd really like to disable it.</p>
<p>2. I've got 2 firewalls running now! My Bitdender and the Windows Firewall service which doesn't make sense!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thierry</p>

            <p><span>Hi Thierry,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When you install 3rd party firewall and antivirus, it will turn the Windows Firewall and Windows Defender off.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">However; while installing the apps from Windows Store which is inbuilt in Windows 8, it needs permission from Windows Firewall.</span></p>
<p><span>The</span><span> Windows Firewall service needs to be set to automatic and running for Windows 8 Store Apps to work. It’s also required for a lot of other functionality in Windows 8 and so should not be turned off for any reason.</span></p>
<p><span>If you use a 3<sup>rd</sup> party Firewall product, then we recommend to configure Windows Firewall to not block any inbound or outbound traffic.</span></p>
<p><span>For further information, refer to the articles:</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the feedback. I'll go through the links when I get home and while I'll accept it as I don't have a choice, you've got to admit that it doesn't make any sense having 2 firewalls running at the same time. If windows firewall performs other functions
 that aren't related to "firewall", the should be moved in a separate service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for my printer issue, it's an HP 6510 inkjet. No errors. Just telling me that the printer is offline when it's not the case. The minute I switch off the windows firewall, it works again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely enough this doesn't occur on my other machine which is running Windows 7 pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Are you using a network printer?</p>

                    Curently if I have several overlapping windows and I move my mouse cursor over one of them then it automatically brings the background window to the foreground instead of waiting until I click on the background window. How do I change the settings so that
 a window will only come to the foreground when I click on it?

<br />
<br />Just checking, did you insert a battery in that mouse and turn it on?
<br /> (I know, but you would be amazed how many users actually forget this)
<br />
<br />If so, and your PC is still not detecting that mouse, it may be defective and need to be returned to the retailer . . .

<h3> jaimepalacol  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows is not detecting my usb headset</h2>
                    hello i just bought a logitech g430 usb headset. When plugging in it says it detects the usb headset and updates the necessary drivers required for it. Thereafter, I downloaded the g430's dedicated driver. But when i searched it in the playback devices
 it does not appear, even if I untick or tick the show disabled devices and disconnected devices it does not show. The usb headset works on my laptop but not on my pc. What seems to be the problem? I have windows 7 x64 bit as OS. Pls help. Thank you

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do you get any error message? If yes please specify.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First you need a video cable for making the physically connection. For better picture quality, you should connect the computer to the TV using standard VGA ports or via the DVI to HDMI cable provided your TV supports these ports.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the "display settings" in the computer and activate output to the TV screen. You can either mirror content of your computer on the TV or extend the display just like a dual monitor screen.</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pick up your TV remote and switch to "External Inputs" from the menu. You will need to change the default "Video 1" to a different selection which may be "HDMI 1" or "Video 2" depending on how you have made the connection.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span> Make sure you connect the cable to the TV before turning on the computer as sometimes it may fail to recognize external display.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If your computer's video card has been designed to work well with HDTV, it might come with its own software for setting screen resolution to match the 16:9 format.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer the links and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>What should I know before adding TV tuners to use with Windows Media Center?</span></b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3&nbsp;:</span></b></p>
<span><strong>Connect your computer to a TV</strong></span>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What is the make and model number of your system?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer to the computer or device manufacturer website and check if you Windows 7 drivers available for the sound card.</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try running the Windows updates to check for the drivers.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 check</span></p>

<h2>            Window 10 Phone Automatic Bcc emails</h2>
                    Just changed from Window 8 phone to Windows 10 phone. Looking for the automatic bcc setting to allow all my sent mail (from the phone) to be collected on my main computer. This was available on windows 8 but I can not see where it can be done on the windows
 10 phone.

            Am i being stupid here? The original query related go a Win10 phone, not a computer. The phone doesn't need the computer switched on to send an email. I have the same problem, it used to be possible to automatically bcc yourself when sending a mail from
 the phone. Just in case of an u informed comment, nog all of us use (or want) cloud services.

    <title>Taskbar not hiding... Multiple screens, different sizes. Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charliewine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar not hiding... Multiple screens, different sizes. Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Please read the whole question before answering.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Please don't tell me to check the "Hide Taskbar" box.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Please don't tell me about windows explorer (It isn't running), or notifications (I've tried turning them off).</p>
<p>I have 3 screens.&nbsp; Screen 1 is 2560x1440.&nbsp; The other two are 1920x1080 and are to the left and above.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The display adapters are dual NVIDIA NVS 310s.</p>
<p>The taskbars are on the bottom. </p>
<p>I want the taskbar on screen 1 to hide.&nbsp; It won't.&nbsp; The other 2 taskbars work correctly, and do hide.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The screen 1 taskbar doesn't show the stuff on the right nor the search box.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem relates to the taskbar being in a region that doesn't exist on the two secondary screens.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If I move the taskbars to the right, then move them back to the bottom, then the autohide starts working, but without the stuff on the right and the search box.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is:&nbsp; What is the fix, if this is a software bug? &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>An alternative question is:&nbsp; If this problem isn't a bug, but is something I've configured incorrectly, what can I do to fix the problem?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your attention and help. </p>

<h2>            Product Key Code for Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>There are times I have to ask for Tech Support over the phone.&nbsp; Occassionally, the Tech employee will ask for my Product Key Code.&nbsp; I've looked almost all day for a way to verify if the Product Key Code number.&nbsp; I have a Product Key Code number that I wrote
 down when I installed this version of Office.&nbsp; There has to be a way to verify the number I wrote down matches the number I keyed in at the time of installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I find my Product Key Code number for Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2016?&nbsp; I can find the Product Key Code number for Windows 10, so why is it so difficult to locate the Product Key Code number for Office?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I search for how to locate this Product Key, using support.microsoft.com, one area said I would not be able to find that Product Key on my computer for security reasons?&nbsp; &nbsp;Really, is that the answer I should give the Tech Support person, because unless
 I can verify my Product Key and I have just one of the 25 characters in my Product Key incorrectly written down, I won't get the help I need.&nbsp; Whos security is being protected if Microsoft customers can't locate that Product Key</p>

            Hi Ruth.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Normally when you buy Office you get a Product Key in the packaging, or if you buy it online you get the key in your Account or an email.  Did you not buy Office this way?
<br />
<br />Once it's installed and activated you can sometimes read the Office Product Key by installing this small tool and running it to see if it finds the Office key:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/206329/how-to-find-your-lost-windows-or-office-product-keys/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/206329/how-to-find-you...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Office Professional Plus is a volume license product, normally distributed through the Volume License Service Center or through Home Use Program if you got the license through your employer.
<br />
<br />If Office Professional Plus 2016 is installed, I recommend you use one of the following key finders to detect and find the key.
<br />
<br />Here are four utilities, all of which will may display your product keys if they are still there:

</p><p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is everything so hard to find or do in Windows 10?&nbsp; Isn't there a place where I can just find the Product Key Code without installing yet another program?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I'll just have to use the Product Key Code number I jotted down and hope it's the right group of 25 characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying to help,</p>

</p><p>Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You gave me 4 websites with programs I could download and Iif my product keys are still there they might be displayed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft requires information during the installation of a Microsoft Program, it should be on this computer.&nbsp; Like I said, the product key for my window 10 operating system is always available.&nbsp; There should be an easy way to find the product key for
 my office.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Customers can just add trying to find product keys the the list of things that are wrong with windows 10 because microsoft doesn't want customers to access their own information.&nbsp; I'd like to know what microsoft is so afraid of, and there must be something
 or this operating system wouldn't have been designed to keep customers in the dark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your help and suggestions.</p>

            Hi Ruth. 
<br />
<br />It's always been this way with the Product Key because it's encrypted to protect it so it needs an app to decrypt and report it out to you.  
<br />
<br />Many prefer Belarc Advisor which will also do a complete audit of all your hardware, software, Updates and installed Product Keys.  <a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html</a>

</p><p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure that the information required to install Microsoft software has always been encrypted, but if that's true they need to change that practice.&nbsp; If they don't want to change how that information is handled, then no one at Microsoft should ever
 ask for a product key code.&nbsp; Micorsoft will have to accept the fact that the customer did purchase the software.&nbsp; While I was still trying to find an answer for this problem at support.microsoft.com suggested that I buy a new product key code from the Microsoft
 Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sick and tired of how poorly every aspect of Windows operates, and it's the customers who are paying the price of an Operating System that never should&nbsp; have been release until these major problems were corrected.&nbsp; When Bill Gates was still President
 of Microsoft these things didn't happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greg while I can't say I was happy to hear that this informaton was encrypted, as I continually say, I get better information from the volunteers in the Community than I ever get from Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to tell me it was encrypted.</p>
<p>

            Hi lyanmj
<br />
<br />If you are using Windows 10 Home, you will not have Group Policy, that is only available in the Pro and Enterprise versions of Windows 10
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App, go to System - About, what Edition of Windows 10 is listed there, is it Home, Pro . . .etc.

            Yes, it comes with Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 S which you can upgrade to Pro for free.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 S can only run Microsoft Store apps:

<h3> kennydowner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mail Calender Apps in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago my mail and calender apps stopped working. I have tried to uninstall them various ways with no success via systems in settings via powershell but they do not uninstall . When i go to the store to reinstall these apps it says they are already
 installed on my pc i have tried using wsreset.exe but that does not work either. when i loook at my apps via settings neither of these apps appear so it seems there like ghost ones. i had endless problems with windows 10 when i first installed it so went back
 to windows 8 and waited for the update 10 version before installing it and untill this week it has worked fine. I have checked I have all the windows updates so i am hoping somone may have a suggestion for me to solve this issue</p>

            Hi Well today I turned on my laptop and the mail and calender apps opened but the store app would now not open. I did a restart and the store app opens but the mail and calender apps now do not open. i get no error message and when i try to update these
 apps from the store nothing seems to happen but it shows in the store that the calender mail app is already installed. The only changes to my laptop are ones made by windows updates. i find this very frustrating as I have much info in my calender which I can
 now not access. Any help you can give will be much appreciated as this is a windows issue as all my other apps work fine.<br />

            Tried several times to do a clean reboot but at the end of the procedure task manager just says it is not responding. I decided to restore my laptop to a date when every was fine and for a while all apps opened ok but when accessing the store it tried
 to update my apps but failed reason was error code 0x80070490 and now my laptop will only open the store app or the mail calendar app feel I am going round in circles here as all things I have tried do not solve this problem. regret updating from windows 8
 as had no problems with it. Any suggestions you have I will be glad to hear.<br />

            Hi Tried all this nothing changed. Over the last few weeks to try and resolve these problems I have set up a new user account and all was fine for a while then the apps stopped working. I then restored my laptop and again everything was fie for a while
 but two days ago the store mail calender and photo apps stopped working again. All the rest of my apps are fine so why just the relevant important microsoft apps give me problems. Of course over time I suppose more apps will not work as I cannot update them
 as my store app does not open. Very disappointed with this free windows 10 wish i could go back to 8 as I had no problems with it.<br />
