<h2>            Problems installing Windows 7 SP1 64-bit&#58; &#34;Installation was not successful&#34; DS_S_SUCCESS&#40;0x0&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I am unable to install the Windows 7 SP1 to my laptop.&nbsp; I am running Win 7 64bit, and have attempted to install the 64bit SP1 first via the automatic updates feature, and then manually with the SP1 download (windows6.1-KB976932-X64.exe).&nbsp;&nbsp; The SP1 installer
 progresses to the point where it shuts down the system and reboots, but when I log back in I get the SP1 installer dialog reporting "Installation was not successful".&nbsp; Clicking the show error link reveals DS_S_SUCCESS(0x0).</p>
<p>I have followed the troubleshooting steps of 1) using the troubleshooter to "Fix Problems with Windows Update" and 2) installed the System Update Rediness Tool, but installation of SP1 still fails with the same error.</p>
<p>I have successfully applied SP1 on a different system.&nbsp; No ideas why I am having problems with my laptop.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thx. C</p>

<p>And the winner is.... Andre!</p>
<p>Windows 7 Service Pack 1 finally installed successfully.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did a bunch of stuff all at the same time, including:</p>
<p>1. Updated the chipset drivers for my laptop by downloading the latest from Intel for Windows 7</p>
<p>2. Updated the wireless network drivers by downloading the latest from Intel for Windows 7</p>
<p>3. Updated the wired/ethernet network drivers by downloading the latest from Intel for Windows 7</p>
<p>4. Re-downloaded the standalone Win 7 SP 1 install package, however I compared it with the previous, same size, same signature...</p>
<p>5. I removed the only additional thing I could, which was a SATA hard drive in the second bay of the laptop.</p>
<p>When I rebooted after the driver install, the previously failed SP1 install "kicked in" after the "log off" process.&nbsp; The PC rebooted and Windows now acknowledges that SP1 has been installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; My gut feeling is that the chipset driver update made all the
 difference.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help chaps.&nbsp; Hopefully this post will be of value to other users who are experincing Win 7 SP1 installation problems.</p>

<p>Did you check your hard disk for errors? Another obscure thing you could try is disabling User Account Control temporarily.</p>
<p>Its possible you might need to do a BIOS update if one is available for your ThinkPad T60p. Also, check for any updated chipset drivers.</p>
<p>Also, disconnect any non-essential devices you might have attached to the system.</p>
<p>Its possible the SP1 download might be corrupt, I would download another copy and try again.</p>

<h2>            Windows Installer issues- unable to uninstall silverlight </h2>
                    
<p><span>I'm trying to stream video to my PC via Netflix, I get an error code: N8156-6013. I looked it up with google and found that other users had received the same error code after updating Silverlight to the current version. The other
 users have fixed the issue by uninstalling the current version of Silverlight and then installing version 3.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I try to uninstall Silverlight through the control panel I get this error:</span></p>
<p><span>The feature that you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable.</span></p>
<p><span>Use source:</span></p>
<p><span>c:\802916df17399c5251\</span></p>
<p><span>I suspect that there is an issue with windows installer, but I'm not sure and I do not know how to proceed.<br />

<h3> paincausingnick  say:</h3>
<h2>            DRM for CoD&#58;Ghosts on 360&#47;One</h2>
                    
<p>We all know Call of Duty: Ghosts is to be released several weeks before the release of the new Xbox One console. So far Amazon and Gamestop have "stepped in" to bridge the gap allowing gamers eager to hone their skills to swap out
<em>physical</em> copies of the 360 title for the One title...for a fee!</p>
<p>My question then is:</p>
<p>Will Xbox-loyal CoD fans be punished for their patronage? Or will Microsoft allow transfer of CoD:Ghosts licenses from Xbox 360 -&gt; Xbox One free of charge? After all.. we already bought the game/license once!</p>
<p>Any feedback is appreciated!</p>

<p>There is no order... yet.</p>
<p>To further clarify my question: Whether 'Gamer A' buys the <em>physical</em> 360 title, or the
<em>digital</em>&nbsp;360 title.. Will 'Gamer A' be able to, once plugging in the Xbox One, transfer the
<em>digital</em>&nbsp;license to the latter console?<br />
<br />
Such capability could only bolster Microsoft's position in digital content.. a topic we've heard so much about since talks of Xbox One began. Not to mention, the move would further mitigate concerns surrounding the DRM debate.</p>

<p>There is no license. You get the Xbox One copy of the game and use it on the console. That will not allow you to use it on the Xbox 360 as it doesn't work that way. If you want a 360 copy, you'll need to get a 360 copy on top of a One copy.</p>

<p>There has been no mention of buying a 360 game digitally and it transferring over to an xbox one game, however DLC is another issue

<p>As far as that link states, If the publisher agrees to it (meaning its potentially not for all games) if you buy one season pass you get both, however you still need to buy both games, there is no mention anywhere by anyone yet that if you buy one game you
 get the other and I doubt it would, they are separate consoles, it would make no sense for them to give you two games for the price of one</p>

<p>I guess my trouble in accepting this stems from what I've heard about other Copyrighted media.. For example, if you own "The Big Lebowski" on DVD, you are allowed by law to store a digital copy of that movie on your computer. If your ISP sends you a
<a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/img/8600/Comcast-Takedown-Letter.jpg?1241332121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DMCA notice</a>, you can appeal (you'll win).</p>
<p>I can't be the only person put off by this! If you own "CoD: Ghosts" on ANY system (X360, PS3, Wii, Xone, PS4, etc..) you should be able to FREELY exchange licenses between systems, LET ALONE between systems of the same family, as in this case!&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management#DRM_and_computer_games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">PC
 gamers can do this</a>, why not us?</p>

<p>I'm not expecting BOTH games.. in fact, I could give 2 poops about the 360 once my One arrives.. but I can't stand the thoughts of:</p>
<p>A) losing 3 weeks of new CoD while my friends all prestige, and I sit on my thumb waiting for the One.</p>
<p>B) having to spend any more than the price of 1 game for JUST that.. ONE game, ONE license for the identical "artistic work" carried over to the new console!</p>

<p>Just as you said though, games are not exchangeable / usable across platforms now ie. ps3 and xbox360, nor have they ever been in the past, ps2/pc or pc/xbox360, when you purchase a DVD it is different, with a DVD any device able to play DVD can play them
 they arnt made to by played by just a single DVD player type, But games are different they are designed to be used by a single platform (ps3,xbox360,pc) and they work only on those devices hence why there is a nice shiny emblem at the top or side that says
 PC Xbox or Playstation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand your point but at the same time this is how its always been</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you are asking for would be similar to asking if you buy COD black ops for the 360 it should play on your ps3 or on the PC. Although Microsoft makes both the 360 and the xbox One they are different consoles, The same thing happened with PS2/PS3 .. games
 were made for both consoles but there was no converting them over (although now it can play older games but I think you understand my point with this)</p>

<p>For games that are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_game_exclusives_(seventh_generation)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
exclusively licensed for a given system</a>, your point makes absolute sense! But what about the countless other cross-platform titles, like: Madden, Battlefield, Call of Duty and NBA to name a few. If a game is available for another system, gamers deserve
 the right to transfer their license. This is not to say gamers should be allowed to play with ONE license on TWO systems at the same time, as that may be grounds for infringement unless the gamer bought TWO licenses/copies. Like PC gamers are accustomed to
 doing, one would first Uninstall the game from the out-dated system, and Reinstall on the new system (using the same License Key).</p>
<p>Microsoft should adopt a program for upcoming releases that, if purchased digitally on Xbox 360, can be downloaded/installed to the Xbox One upon its release, free of charge.. in "good faith" of Xbox gamers' continued allegiance to Microsoft's products.</p>

            <p>Hello Sagnik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response but I was able to figure out what was going on at least for the issue mentioned in the topic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Cisco VPN installed on my Surface when I attempted the first upgrade.&nbsp; I uninstalled it as well as the Bitdefender antivirus just for safe measure and began the upgrade process again.&nbsp; This upgrade completed successfully and I am not enjoying the W10
 environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However now my Cisco VPN will not install even in compaitability mode but I am fine with that, moving to a Palo Alto VPN in less than a month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Couple things I've found. Cisco Anyconnect client is working now.&nbsp; Also&nbsp;Hyper-V seems to not take the upgrade well. I had to remove the V-switch and re-add to get internet through the Surface Ethernet adapter. Its L2 with Microsoft right now, stay tuned.

            <p>Sorry for your hassle.&nbsp; Same here too although I found out through extensive research and finally discussion with Microsoft that the Windows 10 upgrade does not work with Surface Pro3 and much of the installed devices.&nbsp; And worse, there is no way to update
 the devices.&nbsp; Microsoft technical support advised that this is a known issue that neither the installed wireless adapter or the Ethernet adapters work and there are currently no updates/solutions.&nbsp;&nbsp; They recommended that I rollback to Windows 8.1 and I did
 ...without problems that I can see at the moment.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's important to note however several things:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Microsoft states that you can only rollback within 30 days of upgrade...so don't delay too long.</p>
<p>2. Upon&nbsp;rollback, Windows immediately checks for updates and starts downloading Windows 10 again.&nbsp; You should stop this process and not accept this update ...for "at least several weeks" as the Microsoft representative advised me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In conclusion, while I realize that significant rollouts are often riddled with issues, I didn't expect Microsoft hardware and software not to work with the Microsoft upgrade....and for Microsoft to advise that I must rollback to have a useable Surface Pro
 3.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this advise helps you.</p>

            the last thing I expected was my docking station ethernet would not work - that is poor given this is Microsoft hardware. Wireless is fine though. But I will keep my eye on the 30day rollback.

            <p>I called Microsoft Support on Aug 11 2015 regarding Surface Ethernet Adapter not working after Windows 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated above, the technician acknowledged a problem with the Adapter not working properly after the upgrade, and informed "they are working on a solution"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tech's recommended fix was to roll-back to Windows 8.1 and reinstall. She also stated they've seen success with this process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just don't have the time to devote to the recommended process to restore - my estimate is approximately 4 hours or more (roll-back, download, reinstall).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't imagine how such a flaw could find its way to user platforms - platforms that Microsoft completely control.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm further astonished that 2 weeks after the release, we're still struggling with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much love for you Microsoft, however, my experience with Windows 10 so far has been like "one restoring an old car". Problems here and there accompanied by waiting for parts. Not my expectation, and this experience&nbsp;certainly doesn't bolster confidence in
 MS and their ability to&nbsp; really get&nbsp;things done - where things just work, and you're empowering your users to become more productive.</p>

            <p>Hi Malcolm.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've read much on this subject and experienced similar issues to most reported relative to the Surface Pro3.&nbsp; While most I read relates to deleting the Cisco VPN driver from the Device Manager ...this also did not work for me and I would not
 remotely consider re-installing all software/drivers (as I also read others stating this did not work for them which makes me more curious why MS would make such a radical recommendations with proven cure).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, my main point is that I did have success
 though in network connectivity (both wired/wireless &amp; all connected devices) once I rolled-back to 8.1 and uninstalled the Cisco VPN client application which was installed natively on your Surface Pro3 you received.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: This is a different measure than
 deleting the driver from Device Manager and certainly had a 100% positive effect for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to try and help a bit further and in case you're not aware, you should see the Cisco VPN client when you open installed programs through the Control Panel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Double click on this application and say yes to Uninstall.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once this is complete....reboot...and
 then upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp; As mentioned, this worked for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hope it helps.</p>

            <p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding! I read and searched wide regarding the adapter issue, and unfortunately, the only success story centered around the Cisco VPN. I didn't have Cisco VPN installed so this was not applicable to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very capable in maneuvering around Windows - just about all versions (I do so professionally). The roll-back was not an option for me. In my years of experience, major upgrades bring problems along with them. Quite a few people prefer clean installs
 to an upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than rolling back and re-installing, I opted for a clean install. I'm afforded a clean slate, and a clean registry with this approach. I've completed the clean install, and am happy to report everything is 5 by now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, all my data resides on my NAS and this allowed me a zero loss of my work. It's because of everything being located on my NAS that this was such a big issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for responding!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Malcolm</p>

                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just wondering if there is a fix or a way to make the touch keyboard in Windows 8 bigger. For some odd reason mine keyboard has shrunken down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They only way for me to get the usual "big size" keyboard is to change the font to Medium - 125, log out then log back on, revert back to Small - 100, log back out again then back in which then the keyboard is back to normal. But then it looses it config
 and reverts back to a small touch keyboard again.</p>

            <p>I noticed on my Surface RT that they keyboard shrunk when I added a 4th row of icons adding:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Scaling]<br />
“MonitorSize”=”12.1″</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and then going Settings -&gt; Tiles -&gt; Show More Tiles</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I turned off show more tiles, and they keyboard was still small.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, I deleted the registry entry (restoring it, essentially, to the way it was before), and the keyboard came back to its proper size.&nbsp; I haven't experimented, but I suspect that if you
 try different sizes with the entry, the keyboard size will change (smaller number should be bigger touch keyboard).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12.1 is a string.</p>

            Hi <span>Bigwill773,</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span>DEP is a security feature that can help prevent damage to your computer from viruses and other security threats. DEP can help protect your computer by monitoring programs to make sure they use system memory safely. If a program tries
 running (also known as executing) code from memory in an incorrect way, DEP closes the program.<br />
</span><br />
How long have you been facing this issue?<br />
<br />
Did you make any software or hardware changes to the computer before this issue occured?<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Firstly, I would recommend you to do a thorough Virus and malware scan if your computer is infected.</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span>Then we can try placing the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue re-occurs in a clean boot state, to boot the computer in a clean boot state follow the steps below:</span><br />
&nbsp;
<p><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fkbgraphics%2fPublic%2fEN-US%2fVistaStartButton.jpg" />, type
<span>msconfig.exe</span> in the <strong><span>Start Search</span></strong> box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fkbgraphics%2fPublic%2fEN-US%2fSecurityShield.jpg" />&nbsp;If you are prompted
 for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click <strong>
<span>Continue</span></strong>. </span>
</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<strong><span>General</span></strong> tab, click
<strong><span>Selective Startup</span></strong>, and then click to clear the
<strong><span>Load startup items</span></strong> check box. (The
<strong><span>Use Original Boot.ini</span></strong> check box is unavailable.)
</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<strong><span>Services </span></strong>tab, click to select the
<strong><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span></strong> check box, and then click
<strong><span>Disable all</span></strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points.
 Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Restart</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><br />
<span>Once you restart the computer in a clean boot state check if the issue re-occurs. If the issue does not occur then follow the steps in the article below:</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista</span></strong><br />

<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>If the same issue occurs in clean boot as well, we may have to follow other steps.</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>When exactly did this issue start?</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>If the issue started very recently, you can try a System Restore, to do a System Restore follow the steps below:</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fkbgraphics%2fPublic%2fEN-US%2fVistaStartButton.jpg" />, type

 prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.
</span></li><li><span>In the
<strong><span>System Properties</span></strong> dialog box, on the
<strong><span>System Protection</span></strong> tab, click
<strong><span>System Restore</span></strong>,
</span></li><li><span>In the
<strong><span>System Restore</span></strong> dialog box select
<strong><span>Choose a different restore point</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Next</span></strong> </span>
</li><li><span>Select the restore point that you want to use, and then click
<strong><span>Next</span></strong>. </span>
</li><li><span>Confirm your restore point, and then click
<strong><span>Finish</span></strong> System restore restores the selected Windows Vista or Windows 7 configuration and then restarts the computer.
</span></li><li><span>Log on to the computer. When the

<h2>            Vista - local only problem</h2>
                    Ive recently been having a problem connecting to wireless networks. It will allow me to connect but only "local only". Ive been searching through some of the forums and have undertaken some of the 'solutions' none of which have worked. I'm not good with
 technical language so I have not been able to carry out some of them. I have removed Norton 360 with no success. I have also tried the 'regedit' method to no avail. Another couple have not worked either and I'm at my wits end that I'm paying for an internet
 connection I cannot even connect to. It isnt a problem with any of the actual internet connections on the wireless networks as on some I have been able to get online by putting the ethernet cable into my computer and friends have been able to get on the internet
 whilst I have not. Any help would be fantastic as I am struggling to get on any networks e.g. in pubs or coffee shops.

<p>I had a similar problem - my Vista laptop was usually often very slow to connect to wireless networks, both at home (WAP2) and at free-wifi locations. At home, it could be 6 feet away from the wireless router and would not connect easily; even though my
 phone connected up fine</p>
<p>I have run the fix it.</p>
<p>I also found this elsewhere in the forums and followed it</p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>Click<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;and
 type <strong>services</strong>. Choose the correct result in the list.</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>Find
 the&nbsp;<strong>Network Location Awareness</strong> service, right click on it and choose<strong>Properties</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>Click
 the<strong>Dependencies </strong>tab and look under "<em>The service depends on the following system components:</em>". Make a note of all the services listed (which should be Network Store&nbsp;Interface&nbsp;Service, Remote Procedure Call (RPC), and TCI/IP Protocol
 Driver). </span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>Hit<strong>&nbsp;Cancel</strong>&nbsp;and
 locate each service listed, right click it and choose<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>Set
 each service's<strong>Startup type</strong> to <strong>Automatic</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>Click
 the<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;button for each service. </span></p>
<p><span>You may have to start the dependent services of Network Location Awareness's dependent services, so it could take a bit of leg work.</span></p>
<p>I worked through&nbsp;both of these (there were two RPC services - I had to start one - the local one)</p>
<p>Since then, connection has been much quicker (although it is early days)</p>

            Hi oilygirl 
<br />
<br />Is this a clean-install of Windows 10 or a new PC you are setting up?
<br />
<br />The best option would be to reset Windows and start the process again so you can enter the correct credentials . . 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

<h2>            Checking for updates, forever</h2>
                    <p>A friend told me he had wanted to upgrade from 7 to Windows 10 but he never could. I looked at his update history and saw the last update was January 2016 which no doubt explains it. I set it to check for updates but after running it for a few days nothing
 happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I'd better check my Windows 10, it seems this doesn't update either, it's still version 1511, build 10586.494. Or rather, there have been updates including for Office and Defender but none since early September 2016 for Windows which is as far
 back as the update history shows. I set this also to check for updates but it's also in the same endless loop as my friend's. 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if related but curiously Windows Update is not an item in my Control Panel. Another oddity sometimes I can't open Settings or most other items in the start menu until rebooting (regular apps open OK).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This checking for updates forever appears to be a very common problem affecting 7, 8 &amp; 10, and involving a wide range of potential solutions. Are there any tools or utilities available to fix these problems?</p>

            Instead of waiting for Windows update to find your upgrade, you can simply manually upgrade at this

Click on the 'Update now' button to start the process.

            <p>The upgrade to Windows 10 was far from simple so I'll keep your suggestion to reinstall as a last resort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I described appears to be very common, so before reinstalling Windows I wonder if there's not a much simpler solution. About items like 'Setting's sometimes not loading from the start bar, I see this has also been reported many times and seems
 related to the Windows update problem. So if I can just fix that....</p>

            <p>Well, there's<a href="http://www.askvg.com/fix-windows-update-problems-using-automatic-reset-script/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> this batch file
</a>you can try. Scroll down the page a bit and download 'Download Windows Update Reset Script', then follow step 2. I've used this myself. It worked and nothing bad happened.</p>
<p>By the way, you don't have to do a clean install, I just thought it would prevent a possible carry-over of problems. If you get Update to work it will update you to the latest version of Windows 10 which is what you can get at the link I provided (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>),
 so same diff. Clicking on Upgrade will let you keep all your programs and files.</p>
<p>I'd recommend uninstalling any third party antivirus using the specialized tool from the vendor. Or run
<a href="http://support.eset.com/kb146/?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this tool</a> from eset. And disconnect all peripherals except keyboard and mouse before the upgrade.</p>

            <p>I followed all the instructions and ran the batch file (as administrator), rebooted. I did 'Check for updates', after a few hours it reported:</p>
<p>"Your device is up to date. Last checked 09-08-2016, 06:13" dd-mm-yyy so that's August</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to Update history which now reports</p>
<p>"No updates have been installed yet"</p>
<p>I assume that's because the batch file deleted (and backed up) the history</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have Version 1511, build 10586.494</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only AV is Windows defender, internet connection is fine, not set to 'metered connection, &nbsp;have been trying through ethernet too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate what you say about updating / upgrading Windows but I'm not confident all my settings will remain as-was. When this machine was upgraded from Win7 to Win10 it took a lot of time and frustration to get it all working correctly, including finding

            <p>Well I'm stumped. I'll throw out a few random things.</p>

</p><p>Does&nbsp; Windows Defender get updates at least? Open Defender and choose 'UPDATE' tab to see when it last updated. Click on 'Update definitions' and see if it's working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the Windows update troubleshooter again and also the network troubleshooter.</p>

<br />
give us the names of the devices listed there if any. Also double click on each and give us the driver dates<br />
and versions. <br />
<br />
While there click on Update Drivers. This may or may not help , even if it does help come back here and<br />
post the info so you can get you drivers that will not cause this and other errors.<br />
<br />
If the Update did not help, DELETE/REMOVE each device under sound, not the category, by RIGHT CLICKING<br />
on them. APPLY/OK you way out and reboot.<br />
<br />
Come back here and post the info I asked for or --&gt;<br />

<br />
You should look at BOTH System Maker's Sites and the actual device maker's site.<br />
<br />
System Maker to get a rollback, device maker's to get latest drivers.<br />
<br />
Disable Antivirus/spyware programs after downloading the drivers and before installing them.<br />
<br />
Download Driver - SAVE - go to driver - RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Reboot after each driver even if not asked!<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 wont install software or installing to unknown folder</h2>
                    Im fairly new to windows 10, ive always had 7. On a brand new laptop, ive tried to install several programs and they dont appear anywhere. Program files or the start menu/desktop and when i search for it it shows the original install exe and the app istelf
 is nowhere, even if i specify where to install and ensure it gives me a shortcut. Its acting as if its not installing at all, but im unsure if its simply my knowledge or something up.

                    <p>I'm receiving error code c004c003 when my desktop has previously been activated for months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft told me that this was a known issue affecting many many people.&nbsp; They said to wait 24-48 hours for it to be automatically fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've waited, and now my desktop won't communicate with the activation servers at all error code 0020036</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been disconnected or otherwise hungup on by multiple support people after they remote to my machine and tell me that my license is a volume commercial license key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please Microsoft, i need real help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't reformat this desktop just because of activation issues, its just not an option with whats installed on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you to everyone that responded quickly to help me. I've now fixed the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been extremely frustrated by this but I'm glad you all took the time to try to find the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue was that my desktop wouldn't communicate with the activation servers first and foremost.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The watermark left by windows when the desktop was considered invalid caused problems when running games, so in an attempt to fix it I changed the value mentioned below to a '4' (recommended by another internet post) instead of a '2':</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; SYSTEM &gt; CurrentControlSet &gt; Services &gt; sppsvc. Then in that folder near the bottom there is one called "Start" right click on that and click "modify" make sure it is in "Hexadecimal" and
 change the "value data:" to "2". After you have changed that restart your computer and go to your settings to re-type your product key and it should work.&nbsp;</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>(solution URL https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/problem-activation-error-0xc0020036-windows-10/85126b3c-8476-4310-83bf-4d9c7801d39b)</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>That prevented my desktop from communicating with the servers, but since changing it back to '2' I've seen all my problems go away.&nbsp; Why microsoft tech support wasn't able to identify this within several phone calls is beyond me,
 but I realize that it was my own change that caused the problem.&nbsp; Nobody listened to the "can't communicate with activation servers" part, but I digress.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My license key is now activated, and I hope nobody else tries this solution to remove the watermark as it will result in your PC being unable to communicate with the activation servers.</span></p>
<p>But I will reiterate that I am NOT a pirate of licenses and my license was valid all along (greg...).</p>

            Hey Noxo.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What is the Status shown at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?  If it says it's Volume Licensed for an organization's server, that means  someone has activated Windows with a Volume License Key meant only for business or organizations that activate a large number of PC's, which need to check in with the organization's server regularly to reactivate.  
<br />
<br />Sometimes this is done by shops unnecessarily because the PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated for free Upgrade and would have reactivated after a reinstall had they given it the chance and not interrupted this by installing the illegal key.
<br />
<br />If you know Windows was originally activated legitimately by one of these methods then to fix the problem what I would do is go offline to remove the Volume License key and then restore the Generic Product Key that is used to activate with the Digital License issued by Upgrade or Factory install.  Then we'll see if it activates:
<br />
<br />1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.  
<br />
<br />2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter:  slmgr -upk
<br />
<br />3) Restart PC and then insert Generic Product Key for WIndows 10 Pro from here:    <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>
<br />
<br />This sets everything back to default so that if there is a Digital License issued during a proper Upgrade it should reactivate within a few days.  If not we will need to try something else:  
<br />
<br />What Windows Operating System came on that exact model PC originally - you can google it's make and model to read the specs to find out?  If it says Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Home version then that is a clue you need to reinstall Home instead of Pro to try to activate.  We might even be able to still activate it fresh with a Windows 8/8.1 Product Key read from the BIOS or on the Windows 7 COA sticker on the PC, or any of those retail keys.
<br />
<br />If nothing else works you may need to reinstall the licensed Windows edition that came with that PC, or buy a copy of Windows 10 Home to activate it.  I would buy only from a major retailer who backs their purchases or Microsoft here:  <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            Hi NoXoRist,
<br />
<br />Try with Troubleshooters, in the Activation page of Settings.
<br />If your Windows 10 version was activated before by Product key, in that way it will be reactivated.

            Recently there’s been a problem with the activation servers - it’s been affecting Pro users &amp; giving an error saying they have a home license.
<br />Microsoft are working on a solution &amp; slowly everyone affected are being reactivated, you can try running the activation troubleshooter to see if it reactivates.

<p>Greg,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to try these steps, but im VERY displeased with microsoft support right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The manager wouldn't even let me speak on the support call I just had. He was rude, and he talked over any explanation I had.&nbsp; I'm absolutely livid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in IT myself as Network Operations Analyst so I'm very aware of how support works, and the way these people have treated me is disgusting at best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This license key I've had for MANY years. I've gone through windows 7, transitioned to windows 10, rebuilt my pc, and all the while was able to get my desktop reactivated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now microsoft support won't even talk to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This week has obviously been a ploy to extract more licensing cash out of users who were told when upgrading to windows 10 during the free upgrade period.&nbsp; My computer is now being held ransom by Microsoft.&nbsp; There is a lot of important data here and I don't
 plan to wipe my PC because of incompetent support people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very displeased and I won't be letting up on this and i absolutely won't be paying anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been a long time windows customer and I've bought every xbox iteration imagineable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my key is no longer acceptable to microsoft, then I would like a valid pro key provided to me because I'm absolutely at the end of my rope.</p>

            We are not Microsoft Support but volunteers giving our time to help others.  Some of us are more experienced than anyone at Support.  They don't even hire experts except in the Store to compete with Apple Genuis bar, but no company does for support as it's too expensive.  Instead they're trained to read from scripts on a troubleshooting tree.
<br />
<br />From what you've described it seems you'd rebuilt the PC.   If this is retail then it can move at will.  But if it's Upgrade then it can't move if the underlying license is OEM.  
<br />
<br />We recently learned that the Activation Troubleshooter, while signed in with a MS account that was also linked to the previous hardware's activation,  will move an OEM license by making a one-time exception if all else is correct.  But that is only one time.  
<br />
<br />I don't know if any of this applies to you but it's what is catching up others So I thought I'd share it.

 Have not been able to get 12 remaining files to download using Start button Windows Update.&nbsp; Says it's downloading files but hangs with 0% complete, sometimes 15% complete, sometimes 32 % complete.&nbsp; Have tried clean boot, etc., normal methods of fixing.......no

            <p>Hi Kamal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In this case, you can upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 by going to the Windows 10 Software Download page to download the Media Creation Tool. The Media Creation Tool can be used to create a USB or DVD media to upgrade your current PC to Windows
 10 or install Windows 10 on a different PC</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the instructions on Windows 10 Software Download page: </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10</span></span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>When upgrading to Windows 10 using media, you must run setup.exe from within your Genuine and Qualified version of Windows 7 or Windows 8. If you want to boot from media, you must have upgraded to Windows 10 previously. Boot from Windows 10 media directly
 without upgrading to Windows 10 previously is not supported and will have activation issues.</span></p>
