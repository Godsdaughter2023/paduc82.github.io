<h2>            Help&#33; Sync Issue&#58; Now Reset to Level 1 on all 3 Word Games &#40;was at expert levels&#41;</h2>
                    Help!! Can someone help me recover my levels for Microsoft Word Games on Windows 10 ? Was at Expert Levels (Over 135 for Wordament, over 125 for Jumble &amp; 97 for Crossword as best I recall) until a few minutes ago.&nbsp; Was having the same sync issues a number
 of others are reporting on the forums and after trying numerous times to sync, I didn't realize what would happen when I followed the prompts to click on "work offline" and here was the problem... "reactivate work online in game options" - . As soon as I did,
 The game SYNC'D right up but put me back to level 1s for all 3 games, wiped all progress for 2007 &amp; 2008. The only thing I retained (so far) were my specific achievements: Those are all still intact (for now.)&nbsp; I know this was my mistake but is there anyway
 to recover my data? Thanks for any help. &nbsp;

            Hi, since you started the save again, then it would have saved over the save you have on the computer. The game might ask you which version you want to play the next time you log in (when the sync issues are fixed), if it does, then just choose the cloud
 save, and that should give you your save back.&nbsp; If it does not ask you, then you will have lost the save and have to start again.

<p>When i first&nbsp;made my xbox live account i accidently put in the email for my parents windows live ID incorrect. I was unaware of this until I wanted to change the windows live ID on my account. After entering everything in it says to enter the password of
 the parents email. I dont recal the password so i requested a password change email. Because I entered the email incorrect when i made the account, I wont be recieving an email any time soon. Is it possible to change the parents information on my account?
 I dont want my account child blocked forever and would like to use some of the features on xbox live.</p>

<p>I'm confused as to why you would create a parent account for your own child account. In any event, if you don't have access to an account, you should call phone support in your region (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/pages/contact-us.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../contact-us.aspx</a>),
 verify ownership of the account, and they can return access to you. </p>

<h2>            Digital signature for wdsmgfw.efi has expired</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to fix our pxebooting for UEFI secure boot devices, but the wdsmgfw.efi file we have expired 2 days ago. I have tried removing the windows ADK and WDS, then reinstalling, but this file doesn't appear after searching my mapped remoteinstall folder
 for MDT, and %windir%/system32/reminst. I have also trawled around boot.wim files and original 1709 / 1803 ISO files, but none seem to have this file available (or the ones that are, have expired).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone offer any assistance as to how I could resolve this, or at least where it's documented? Really not impressed with how these expire without any warning, despite updating the OS and its components regularly.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you ask Asus that question as they are the ones who support the operating systems that are installed on their hardware, not Microsoft..</p>

<h2>            Skype for Linux doesn&#39;t detect my webcam, other programs do</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I'm on Fedora 27 trying to use Skype for Linux, but underneath the Camera section of the audio and video settings it says, "No device found. Learn more about fixing this issue." Clicking on the Learn More link just takes me to the
 call quality guide for the Microsoft version.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I'm using a Logitech C615 webcam. It's listed in lsusb and using guvcview I can use it without a problem. Browsers are able to use it as well; Vivaldi, Firefox, and Chrome are the ones I've tested so far and none of them has a problem
 opening the webcam. Detection of my headset is intermittent as well - sometimes my Logitech G430 headset is detected by Skype, sometimes it's not. The sound test in audio settings never works, even if it has detected the headset and I have it selected as the
 audio output device. Again, this is something that no other program I use has a problem with.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">The Skype web client isn't much better. In Vivaldi, I am able to send video, but not receive video (the call will connect but I only see a loading spinner instead of the other person's video, but they can see my video). In Firefox,
 the Skype web client doesn't request access to the camera and microphone at all, so it's completely unusable. Chrome is the only browser I've tried where the Skype web client works properly.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Using the web client is not only not ideal, it's not practical. Is there a way to get the desktop version of the Skype client to detect my webcam?</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Just to be extra thorough, here's the output of&nbsp;lsusb:</p>

<p>I figured I'd post an update since I have solved this problem using the answers from
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/skype_linux-skype_callms-skype_audioms/the-latest-skype-for-linux-update/ca8573cd-bc9f-4ba2-a49f-1f65831f9852" title="Super helpful thread that fixes the problem on Fedora 27">
this thread</a>.</p>
<p>As a more long-term solution than just downloading that one rpm file, you can add the Skype stable repo and automatically get updates. There is also an unstable repo that may work if you are still experiencing issues with the newest stable Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://repo.skype.com/rpm/stable/skype-stable.repo</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The skype-unstable repo will no longer show up using&nbsp; "dnf repolist" unless you add the "--disabled" option.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">From here it's a simple matter of installing skypeforlinux. Note that if you just run "sudo dnf install skypeforlinux" like I did when writing this it will update whatever version you are running to the current version. The current
 version (8.14.0.10-1) is the camera-breaking version. Until an update is released, you can downgrade to the latest working version (8.13.0.2-1) by doing the following:</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">You don't have to use vi for this, just use any program capable of editing a text file. On Fedora 27 GUI applications are not allowed to run as root for security reasons (you can make it work with some tinkering, but it's much easier
 just to use vi).</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">And that's it! You should now be able to avoid this update and have a working version of Skype.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Edit: After further testing, 8.13 also does not work for me. 8.10.0.4 is the most recent version that works. I have also tried the most recent packages on the skype-unstable repository and those don't detect my camera either. 8.11
 will allow me to make a call, but then it gives me an error saying my audio device has failed and I need to update the driver. My microphone works but my headset speakers don't. 8.10 restores full functionality. This really needs to be fixed because it seems
 like it affects a lot of users.</p>

    <title>What does the Wi-Fi Speed statistic mean under Network Statistics&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rainbow evil  say:</h3>
<h2>            What does the Wi-Fi Speed statistic mean under Network Statistics&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>After waiting 5 hours for a 5.5GB game to get to 70% and fail on a connection tested at well over 100MB/s (using the 360 S's built in wifi adapter) I tried using ethernet which ended up downloading the game in around half an hour. Looking at the network
 statistics page I was trying to work out what the statistic Wi-Fi speed (which read 5mbps) meant, as over wifi the console had full bars signal yet wouldn't get a decent download rate. The only thing I could think of it meaning is that 5mbps is the max speed,
 however on the test results upload speed indicated around 10mbps, although download speed was below 5mbps. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Network statistics are an average speed. Microsoft likes to cap every individual download as to not overload their servers.
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>. Ethernet will always be faster and more consistent than WiFi. You have a lot of wireless interference even if you don't know it. OTA TV, Cell, Microwaves, Satellite TV, Cordless Phones, Other wireless APs around you. That and
 the 360's built in adapter is pretty basic cheap adapter so don't expect amazing speeds out of it.</p>

    <title>Top of Screen Cut Off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> computer inept  say:</h3>
<h2>            Top of Screen Cut Off</h2>
                    First of all looking at this most people are going to say I have a screen resolution problem, I can tell you that that is not the case. On to the problem, for some reason the top of my screen is being cut off ; but not in the usual way. Its like there
 is a buffer as if explorer thinks that it can't go as high as it can (restating&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;explorer&nbsp;solves the problem for a little bit but then it goes back to being cut off. I have a dual monitor set up, with a 20' monitor via vga and a 22' tv via hdmi, no&nbsp;matter&nbsp;which
 I make the primary display this happens and only on the primary&nbsp;display. You can still see the back ground&nbsp;explorer&nbsp;just wont go on top if it at the top of the screen. I've tried a clean boot but that didn't work, I'm not sure what causes the problem it just
 seems to happen on its own. The resolution of the 20' monitor is 1600x900 and the resolution of the tv is 1920x1080. Any one have any ideas?

            Well I just&nbsp;inadvertently&nbsp;solved the problem...it turns out that this had nothing to do with screen resolution, but it was all dell's fault! Dell set the default theme to one that changed the log on back ground, before i restarted, I changed the theme
 to the landscapes theme. When I logged back in and the screen didn't get pushed down I changed back tot he dell theme and sure enough everything was cut off. So i just have the stay away from that dell theme then.

<h2>            Rosetta Stone Mic issue. &#40;Very weird&#41;</h2>
                    So, I installed RS with French Lessons 1-5. Instantly had Mic complications. I thought I was having the same issue as this guy.
<div><br />

<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-sound/help-with-getting-rossetta-stone-to-locate-my/a0c63529-dd7b-4b2d-8b4c-2c90ea7a8e81">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-sound/help-with-getting-rossetta-stone-to-locate-my/a0c63529-dd7b-4b2d-8b4c-2c90ea7a8e81</a>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But, I'm not...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I checked in cPanel. Everything is fine there. My headset works fine in every other program I use it for-Steam, Vent, Skype, Google Voice, and so on.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In Rosetta Stone however... The RS Mic Setup sees, and hears my Mic. I do the little 1,2,3,4,5 and continue. It displays sound levels. Everything looks good. In RS lessons the Mic doesn't seem to pickup anything. I've made sure that my&nbsp;pronunciation&nbsp;is
 good. My friend checked it out, he speaks French fluently, it's his first language. Still nothing. Something isn't right here. Just not sure of the issue...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I emailed Rosetta Stone and complained about this to them.. They said "Uninstall and reinstall." Tried that, 3 or 4 times, nothing. Then they said "Maybe your Mic is broken." (Not possible, as I have already confirmed this in the above stated programs.)
 Then they said "Drivers" but everything is UTD. I double checked just for my own possible slip up. They don't know what to tell me now. Debating on demanding a refund, but I know this software is the best possible choice...&nbsp;</div>

            Hi,<br />
Try contacting the manufacturer for more detailed support.<br />
This seems to be an issue with the “Rosetta Stone” application, as the Microphone works fine with other applications.<br />
Hope the information provided helps.<br />

<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Check if there are any settings within the Powerchute software to

<p>I already contacted APC support. They do not know what to do with this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Me:</strong></p>
<p>Good day,<br />
<br />
<br />
I have Windows 7 installed on my system. I bought APC CS 500EI UPS and<br />
connected it with USB. Installed PowerChute 3.0.<br />
Every time I start my computer Windows 7 UAC (do you want to allow<br />
this program to make changes) pops up because PowerChute starts at<br />
user logon.<br />
For me, administrator, this is not a huge problem, BUT for limited<br />
users, this is a huge flaw.<br />
PowerChute does not start (limited users do not have the right to<br />
start it). Computer is mostly used by limited accounts (90%).<br />
UPS automatic shutdown is absolutely pointless when Windows Vista/7 is<br />
installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>They:</strong></p>
<p>I apologize for any inconvenience this situation has caused. We actually have a knowledge base document available which addresses this issues and discusses possible work arounds. I will attach it below:<br />
<br />
Answer Title: User Account Control requires permission before APCSYSTRAY.exe will start upon login after installing PowerChute Personal Edition 3.0<br />

http://nam-en.apc.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/11148</a></p>
<p><strong>Me again:</strong></p>
<p>So the only thing I can do is to disable UAC for everything? This is so so NOT professional. It's like "Hello, I have problem with my computer", Answer "Buy a Mac". Why do we have Windows 7? Because it is safer? Yes. Why should a customer disable this "safety"
 to get another "safety". So we have a dilemma?<br />
<br />
a) Disable windows safety feature (disable UAC or make all users administrators)<br />
b) Disable safety that APS UPS should give (do not use PowerChute)<br />
<br />
How so? This is a huge flaw! This is not just a small problem. Almost every home user who will buy APC UPS (with PowerChute abilities) and uses (or starts using) Windows 7 will not be able to use APC product in its full potential?<br />
<br />
For me it is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Maybe APC should contact Microsoft?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>They again:</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the update. I understand your concerns. We are not recommending the work arounds but have made the information available for those that cannot live with having to click accept changes when logging in. Powerchute Personal Edition is used with
 a single PC and UPS system, so there is typically only one user accessing the system. We have Powerchute Business Edition available for business/networked environments.<br />

<br />
I have logged your concerns and they have been forwarded to the appropriate product management team for review.<br />
<br />
Thank you again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They think that a typical home user should have only one user account in Win7 and it must be administrator.</p>
<p>I highly suspect that they are wrong.</p>
<p>Ajay, this is not a typical problem about not working sound or mouse. This is Windows 7 UAC not allowing program to do its work.</p>
<p>I must disable it. Do you recommend it? Or do you recommend making account for children an administrator account?</p>

<h2>            Zynga - Farmville 2 - Can&#39;t purchase keys anymore</h2>
                    <p>Up until about a week ago, I was able to purchase keys for Farmville 2. &nbsp;Then all of a sudden I could not purchase them. &nbsp;The game came back with a ''Something Went Wrong'' Error. &nbsp;I contacted Zynga Support and they said to contact Microsoft Support as they
 were the ones handling the transaction. &nbsp; &nbsp;I've made several attempts to contact Microsoft directly, but have been unable to do so. &nbsp;My submitted query's seem to go nowhere, as I have yet to get a response. &nbsp;So now I turn to the good people in the community
 for aid. &nbsp;If anyone has any information that might help me it would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;There are plenty of funds in the account I'm making the purchase from and to the best of my knowledge nothing has changed in the settings on my computer that would
 block any purchases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, </p>
<p>The Beav.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>No AutoPlay dialog when connecting digital cameras - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikael_h  say:</h3>
<h2>            No AutoPlay dialog when connecting digital cameras</h2>
                    When connecting any of my Canon digital cameras to any USB-port on my computer the AutoRun dialog does not appear.<br />
The "Use AutoPlay for all media and devices" check box under the AutoPlay options is checked and the dialog appears when I for example connect a USB memory. When connecting a camera it appears in Windows Explorer and in the device manager but when right clicking
 on the camera in Windows Explorer the “Open AutoPlay” shell extension is missing. I have searched the registry for "NoDriveAutoRun"-keys without any results. This is driving me crazy so any help would be much appreciated!<br />
I am using Windows 7 Home Premium.<br />

            Thank you for your reply Bashit.<br />
<br />
1: I have a USB 3G modem with an embedded memory card. Each time the modem was plugged in to the computer the AutoPlay dialog was popping up. I therefore (in pure frustration) unchecked the "Use AutoPlay for all media and devices" check box under the AutoPlay
 options. This of course disabled the AutoPlay for the cameras to. After that the only change to the system I have made is to migrate from Norton Internet Security to Microsoft Security Essentials and Windows Defender.<br />
Now when I have rechecked the AutoPlay option the cameras are not recognized by AutoPlay as described in my first note. I have tried to disable Windows Defender without any progress.<br />
<br />
2: Yes, the AutoPlay for the cameras has worked fine before.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some more comments:<br />
The Shell Hardware Detection service is running.<br />
I have created a new user on the computer but the AutoPlay behaves the same.<br />
One of your links mentioned something about AutoPlay being restricted by Group Policies. This is new terminology for me. Is this only valid in a network environment or can this cause my problems?<br />

            After some internet serching I have realized that the NoDriveTypeAutoRun-key plays an important role in the AutoPlay behaviour.<br />
In all articles I have found this key is said to be found under <br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer<br />
but in my registry I find it under<br />
HKEY_USERS\"<span style="font-style: italic">long user ID containing a lot of digits</span>"\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer<br />
<br />
Is this OK or should I move/add the key to LOCAL_MACHINE.....?<br />

    <title>Conversion of gpt disk to mbr disk - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Conversion of gpt disk to mbr disk</h2>
                    I have a hard disk of 1 tb which is in the format of gpt. I want to convert it into mbr. Whenever I try to go through the computer management, I get the option for converting into mbr but it is disabled.
<div>Even if i tried command prompt, it gives error that conversion cant be done.</div>
<div>i tried external partition managers, they are not also working well.</div>
<div>Also if i could convert primary drive to logical in gpt format,I would like to know about that.</div>
<div>Thank You!<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82eed3f3-147b-4a40-8668-9dd76c6165b1" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eaf341c8-5633-4d08-8dd8-e2b23762612c" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2a8e5297-a327-42e3-8b81-05efa3d3486c" /></div>

            <p>Your monitor is on its way west. I had one recemtly with similar symptoms. In the end, it didn't produce anything on screen at all and like yours, the power light was 'on'.</p>
<p>From what I could find out, it may only be a couple of capacitors that have blown their caps, a side effect of using cheap parts which can only just do the job (no spare capacity - excuse the pun).</p>
<p>However, getting then replaced is not cheap, like $60 - 80 not cheap, and it is probably better to get a new monitor than to put good money into something where even more expensive problems are waiting in the wings..

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What it the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the methods listed below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Let’s test the issue in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Use the link mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Your computer's display consists of two pieces of hardware: a video card (also known as a graphics card or display adapter), which is installed
 inside your computer, and the video monitor, where you see all the text and graphics your programs display. Windows uses drivers to work with these hardware devices. The majority of display problems are caused by incorrect, corrupted, or missing video drivers.
 Hardware failure or incorrect installation make up another set of problems, and external factors can also cause video problems.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have just installed Windows, or have changed your video card and are experiencing problems, the most likely cause is a missing or incorrect
 video driver. Most video cards will come with a disk that contains drivers and other software. Before you install it, check the information that came with the video card to be sure it supports your current version of Windows. If not, go to the manufacturer's
 website and download the most current driver for your version of Windows</span></p>
<p><span>Use the link mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Try using the recommended settings and check if it works fine.</span></p>
<p><span>Use the links mentioned below.</span></p>

            Your TV will need to be on your network and support the DNLA DMR (digital media renderer)&nbsp;standard.&nbsp; If it's not you can get a device that hooks up to your TV that is DNLA certified as a DMR and that'll work also.&nbsp; Here's a list of devices that others
