<h2>            Keyboard shortcuts</h2>
                    <p>My Technical Preview was forced to do a large update last night, and today I saw some keyboard shortcut commands flash on my screen. Where can I find these listed? They are too hard to remember when they flash across the screen in that tip form. Please list
 them out for us somewhere. I can find them nowhere in the browser settings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your hard work I'm trying to integrate this stuff into my experience.</p>

<h2>            In Outlook 2011, is there a way to send as one of my alias addresses&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an Office365 exchange account with multiple aliases. When I use Office2010 or OWA and I create a new email, I just click the "From" field (assuming I've enabled it) and type any of my alias addresses to send as. It's usually just a hybrid textbox
 and drop down box. In Office 2011, the From field is just a full drop down box preventing me to type anything. It's forcing me to choose only between the accounts I've set up.</div>

<p>I do not believe there is currently a way to do that in Outlook 2011. I'd suggest you leave feedback with Microsoft. In Outlook, click on Help - Leave feedback about Outlook.</p>

<p>I installed a trial of Office 2010 and it didn't work out that well so I uninstalled through the Control Panel. &nbsp;However, there's still a Q drive showing up on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I searched the forums and there was previously a link to something that would remove it, but the link didn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's the simplest way to get rid of this Q drive? &nbsp;</p>

                    I have Microsoft 7.&nbsp; I use outlook for my email.&nbsp; I open an email that has a link. I click the link.&nbsp; sometimes the link opens, sometimes it does not. but in all cases the cursor (although it moves) will not open any other emails.&nbsp; email has frozen.&nbsp; I
 have to quit and reopen email.&nbsp; I can read all emails until I move the cursor over the link.&nbsp; Frustrating.&nbsp; any ideas?&nbsp; thanks&nbsp; Bill

<p>Hello Naga sai,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This thread has been moved to Skype for Business category. May I confirm with you whether issue still exists?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try to change PC resolution to see if it helps. In some cases gallery view related issue can be fixed via this way, you may adjust layout and resolution to recommended values.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try to clear Skype for Business caches to check it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Sign out Skype for Business, in prompt Sign-in page, click Delete sign in info, then exit Skype for business completely.</p>
<p>2. Right<span>-</span>click the Windows icon, search “<strong>Run</strong>” application and open it.</p>
<p>3. Copy the paste the following
<span>path</span> in the search field: <strong><em>%localappdata%\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync</em></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>4. Click <strong>
OK</strong> to navigate that<span> location.</span></p>
<p>5. Delete the folders
<span>which </span>name begin with <em>sip_</em></p>
<p>6. Delete all the sub-items under the
<strong>Tracing </strong>folder, don’t delete Tracing itself</p>
<p>7. Open the command prompt and run "<strong>ipconfig&nbsp;/flushdns</strong>".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue persists, to better know about your issue, I’d like to confirm when you said “I am not getting the Gallery view”, is the option grayed-out, or this option doesn’t show up at all?
 If convenient, please share a screenshot of issue symptom with us for checking. Any whether this issue occurs to all meetings? And the total number of all participants are no less than 3 and no more than 75?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Anna</p>

<p>Hi Diana,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Firstly, I’d like to know what type of email account you use. If you are using an Office 365 account, login to
<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/owa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a> to check if your contacts and calendar entries are still there. If so, configure the Office 365 email account on the Outlook client by Exchange and wait for the Outlook client download the contacts
 and calendar entries from Office 365 cloud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not using Office 365 account and you can’t find the contacts and calendar entries on the email account’s web application, the only way you find the contacts and calendar entries back is to import the backup file. I’d like
 to know if you have already backed up your data file before reinstalling the Outlook client:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Export-or-backup-email-contacts-and-calendar-to-an-Outlook-pst-file-14252b52-3075-4e9b-be4e-ff9ef1068f91" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Export or backup email, contacts, and calendar to an Outlook .pst file</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, find the pst file that you backed up, and refer to this article to import the file:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Import-email-contacts-and-calendar-from-an-Outlook-pst-file-431a8e9a-f99f-4d5f-ae48-ded54b3440ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Import email, contacts, and calendar from an Outlook .pst file</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Which Antivirus utility do you have installed? Can you try disabling it temporarily to see if the apps work?
<br />
<br />Also, try launching each Office application in safe mode to see if they work. If they do, its possibly a bad add in.
<br />

<br />
<br />If the problem persists:
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start

<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes

<br />Hit Enter

<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try running the applications again.

            This is the information and requirements from Quicken.
<br />Note (Last updated: 05/10/2018)
<br />
<br />Sync to Outlook requires a 32-bit version of Microsoft Outlook 2007 or 2010. A 64-bit version of Outlook will not work. To find out which version of Outlook you're using, start Outlook and then choose Help&gt; About Outlook.

            I appreciate the quick response, but I don't have the 64 Bit version of 2016. Office Are you saying that 32 bit Microsoft Office is not compatible and cannot synch notifications with Quicken?

            Not on the contrary, give you the information published by the official site of Quicken.

            The error message you are receiving may be an MS message but based on your description, it is being invoked by Quicken trying to connect to Outlook so the starting point for this is Quicken. 
<br />
<br />Not sure what "have been helpful" means especially since there is no reference to the actual version of Quicken being used, was Quicken working before (if not a new install) etc etc. In short, did you get an explicit statement from them stating that everything should work when taking things like Quicken version into account etc? 
<br />
<br />One thing to check - when going into Win 10 Settings --&gt; Apps --&gt; Default Apps --&gt; Choose Default Apps by Protocol --&gt; what is &lt;MailTo&gt; is set to? Outlook or something else?

<p>Karl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Her is the version of quicken I currently have installed:</p>
<p>Quicken Deluxe</p>
<p>2018</p>
<p>R11.18</p>
<p>27.1.11.18</p>
<p>
</p><p>The syncing stopped working last&nbsp; May because I had the 64bit version of Office installed. I have since gone back to the 32 bit version. I did as you suggested and went to the protocol default and it was set to Outlook.<br />
</p>
<p>I spoke with Quicken yesterday and, of course, they they advised me&nbsp; it was a&nbsp; Microsoft issue. Their support is left to finger pointing. Just sell more product. They said they have not heard of this problem before.(I know that is not true)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your effort to help me, this is frustrating</p>
        </p>

<br />The syncing stopped working last  May because I had the 64bit version of Office installed.
<br />&lt;&lt;
<br />
<br />Well that certainly would have caused the error. I don't use Quicken so have no way to test anything but FWIW - haven't found anything current related to Quicken 2018 / Outlook 2016 and this error message except for one instance back in April of this year with the same description - had 64bit installed / got the error / installed 32 bit / still get the error - with no resolution.
<br />
<br />All the above said, it sounds like there may have been something left behind by 64bit Office somewhere (i.e. Registry) that is causing the error to be triggered but the only way to confirm that would be to try it on a system where 64bit Office was never installed. If it works, the next step would be to determine what it is that Quicken is checking and what the remnant is, something I unfortunately have no way of knowing.

            Hello ChinaXinChao, 
<br />
<br />I understand that your account may have been compromised. This is very alarming indeed and I know how you are feeling right now. Don't worry! I am able to advise you on this. 
<br />
<br />Here are some articles I find may be relevant to you: 
<br />
<br />- How to determine whether your Office 365 account has been compromised: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/2551603/how-to-determine-whether-your-office-365-account-has-been-compromised" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/255160...</a>

<br />
<br />Essentially, you have to 
<br />
<br />1. change your passwords 
<br />2. manage your trusted devices 
<br />3. enable two-step verification 
<br />
<br />Hope it helps!

            The real issue is you can't fix the account until you change the security settings. The Security settings are locked because it was hacked and it wants to send a code to the backup email but that doesn't exist anymore. Catch22!&nbsp;

<br />
<br />Thank you for your response.
<br />
<br />If that is the case, have you tried to recover your account? You will need to supply a lot of personal and intricate security details of your account to prove your account ownership here » <a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/acsr</a>

<p>I used this link to recover my account but while it was successful in allowing a change of password I still can't get into the settings to restore email to normal operation.</p>
<p>

            Hello ChinaXinChao,
<br />
<br />Thank you for your reply.
<br />
<br />I know how frustrating you are right now as you are unable to access your account after submitting the recovery form.
<br />
<br />It is actually an official procedure that allows you to get your account  working again after it is blocked or restrictions are imposed. (See: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10494/microsoft-account-how-to-access-a-compromised-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10494/...</a>)
<br />
<br />I know that during this process it can be very difficult to you as it will be very disruptive to your work for not being able to log in to your account, but it is an inevitable process.
<br />
<br />I am sorry for all the inconvenience caused. :(
<br />
<br />Best regards,
<br />Sutharsan

<h2>            Trash Folder in Email</h2>
                    When I delete an email, it goes to the Trash Folder (pre-configured on Outlook).&nbsp; However, from the trash folder the emails seem to disappear on some schedule.&nbsp; For example, the deleted email may stay in the Trash folder for 2 or 3 months then just disappear.&nbsp;
 How can I stop the emails from disappearing from the Trash folder after a given amount of time - or how can I set what time that is?

<p>Hi Jennifer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The option to stop the emails from disappearing in the <strong>Trash Folder</strong> is currently not available in Microsoft. Usually, emails kept in the trash will be deleted after 10 days (maximum of 30 days). With that, I recommend that you do not leave
 any important emails in your Trash folder or retrieve it if it's still possible.<br />
<br />
If you are using Outlook.com, I'd suggest posting your query in the <strong><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/284136-outlook-com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">UserVoice</a></strong>. This site is being checked by the developer's team. They'll
 be receiving your request or suggestions that may help the improvement of Outlook.

 one set at a time, either objects or text, but it's nearly impossible to get the result to match the original.&nbsp; I put together publications that have sections that have to be approved by the submitter before publication.&nbsp; For instance I take one person's submission,
 format it as a separate file, and send it back for approval.&nbsp; Once approved that exact 2 page file has to go into a 10 page publication, with no changes.&nbsp; I can't find any way to make it work without basically having to start all over, formatting text and
 images and trying to make it match what was approved.&nbsp; And it never does match exactly no matter what.&nbsp; The current one I'm working on now, after much hair pulling, I've gotten t

            Word is not a page layout application. There are no 'pages' in a Word document, but a series of 'layers' that contribute to the whole. Imagine a pile of transparencies that when stacked produce a picture of the whole. This is then flowed into the area
 bounded by the margins. the elements are always going to be separate and independent of one another.<br />
<br />
Would printing the 'pages' to PDF work for you? That way there would be no change to the layout and you could produce a PDF of just the required pages.<br />
<br />
PrimoPDF works well.<br />

            <p>First I would make sure that proof publication I sent to the submitter for final approval has the same formatting as my main publication. This includes font, font size, paragraph settings, line spacing etc. In fact it might be to your advantage to send each
 submitter a formatted template to use for submittal to save time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you get those approved two page publications back then open that publication and your main publication.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Insert two blank pages into your main publication. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the first page of the two pages you want to copy and select everything on the page. There are several ways to do that. Ctrl + A is probably the easiest. You can also 'lasso' all the elements on the&nbsp;page by left clicking above and to the left of the
 page in the scratch area and then drag, draw a rectangle around the entire page by dragging down to the lower right of the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Group all the elements on the page together. Once again several ways to do this. Home tab &gt; Group (within the Arrange group of options) or just Ctrl + Shift + G is the keystroke shortcut. Grouping the elements together before you copy them will maintain
 the layout of the page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Copy all the group of elements. Home &gt; Copy. or Ctrl + C.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the main publication, a blank page, Paste Special &gt; Publisher Object. or Ctrl + V. The page from your submitted publication should paste on the page and be aligned. If not drag the group around until it is aligned as you want it. Once you have it where
 you want it, ungroup all the page elements if you want. (Home &gt; Ungroup or Ctrl + Shift + G again)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Repeat for the second page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This workflow should work for you but the key will be that the final proof you send to the submitter must be formatted the same as the main publication. If it isn't then the line spacing, fonts, etc can vary when you paste the elements on the blank page.

            I'm sorry, I was talking about Publisher.&nbsp; Guess I forgot to specify that.<br />
<br />
I might be able to use printing to PDF, but I have to end up with one single document that has multiple submissions in the right order, and I don't know how to insert pdf pages into a single document.&nbsp; Will PrimoPDF allow me to combine multiple inputs into
 a single document?<br />

            Thank you for the very detailed workflow.&nbsp; It sounds like what I've already been doing, except for the Lasso selection method.&nbsp; The first time I tried it just now, it worked! objects and text both.&nbsp; But the second time and every subsequent time, no dice.&nbsp;
 Selects and copies just the objects, no text.&nbsp; What gives??&nbsp; What I've been doing is copying and pasting objects and text separately but I always end up having to struggle with the text wrapping around the objects all over again, and it takes forever to get
 it the way it was.&nbsp; Which is why I want to select and copy the entire page all in one.<br />
<br />
I have been trying to make sure that the proof I send is the exact same formatting as what I have set in the main publication but even so it's been giving me fits.&nbsp; With this current project, I've gotten everything to line up exactly right, after much fussing,
 but the last paragraph still falls off for some reason.&nbsp; All formatting and spacing and everything is the same, but the last paragraph doesn't fit.

            <p><span>Hi Patrick,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Who is the manufacturer of the MP3 player?</span></p>
<p><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does it have an option to play videos on it or is it just a simple MP3 player which can play music files alone?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We need a third party downloader software to download videos from Youtube. The files that we download from Youtube are “.FLV” files. So, the player that you are trying
 to play videos on, has to support .FLV file format to be able to play Youtube videos on it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Disclaimer</span></b><span>: Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can
 cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that is just an MP3 player, you will not be able to see videos on it as it is designed just to listen to music. If the device can play videos, you will have to download
 videos from Youtube to your computer and then transfer them to the player connecting it to the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps.</span></p>

                    I have Office 2007 installed with Windows 7 Pro 64-bit. I have been unable to insert page numbers in Word documents, and the help document only gives instructions for Vista and XP. Also, although can find the U.S. locale folder 1033, I cannot find the
 Building Blocks.dotx template (with or without the space).

<br />
<div>I really don't understand the above statement. The method of inserting a page number into a Word 2007 document does not depend on the operating system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Double-click into either the header or footer area to initiate a header/footer editing session. The quick way to insert a page number is to position the insertion point where you want the page number and tap
<i>Alt+Shift+P</i>. When you are in a header/footer editing session, the <i>Header &amp; Footer Tools, Design</i>&nbsp;menu provides additional options in the right-most
<i>Header &amp; Footer</i>&nbsp;group.</div>

            I know of no standardized shortcut for&nbsp;<b>{</b>&nbsp;NUMPAGES&nbsp;<b>}</b>&nbsp;or the entire&nbsp;<i>Page X of Y</i>&nbsp;text field string but you can use
<i>Ctrl+F9</i>&nbsp;to insert a new set of <i>Field Braces</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;specify&nbsp;the NUMPAGES field. Try typing this,<br />
<br />
P·a·g·e·&lt;space&gt;·<i>Alt+</i><i>Shift+</i><i>P</i>·&lt;space&gt;·o·f·&lt;space&gt;·<i>Ctrl+F9</i>·N·U·M·P·A·G·E·S
<div><br />
<div>Tap <i>F9</i>&nbsp;to <i>Update Fields</i>&nbsp;while the insertion point is still in the NUMPAGES field to update the field code to a numerical field value..</div>
<div><br />
<div>After you create the Page X of Y header, you can select it, click the Header button (on either the Insert tab or the Header &amp; Footer Tools tab of the ribbon), and choose
<i>Save Selection to Header Gallery</i>. That makes it a "building block" (roughly equivalent to the old AutoText).</div>

<h2>            Outlook 2016 Error 0x800CCC13 after upgrading</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>after updating Office I get this error when sending. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I read something on the Community about Sfc scannow but it didn't help. I also tried to disable my firewall/antivir but nothing changed.
</p>
<p>The only method to let it work is to run Outlook in admin mode, but this will disable other useful Outlook feature.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this could be resolved</p>

<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to know what type of account you are trying to configure in Outlook. (POP3, IMAP, Exchange ActiveSync or an Exchange account)</span></p>
<p><span>Meanwhile let us open Outlook in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>To do that, close Outlook. Click on Start – All Programs – Accessories – Run, and in the open box type in Outlook /safe and hit ok. (Note: There is a space between Outlook and /).&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>If the application works fine safe mode, try disabling the add ins for the application and check the result,</span></p>
<p><span>Click the File tab. </span>
</p>
<p><span>Go to Options.</span></p>
<p><span>Click Add-ins.</span></p>
<p><span>In the Manage section, select COM Add-ins and click on Go.</span></p>
<p><span>Now uncheck the Add-ins and click on OK.

<h2>            Calendar Printing Assistant for Outlook 2007 and SharePoint Calendars...</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>
<p>I have setup some SharePoint 2007 calendars as part of a diary system.&nbsp; As the users open the calendars in Outlook 2007 anyway, we thought it simplest that those who needed a nice looking hard copy made use of the Calendar Printing Assistant.</p>
<p>The problem is that the Assistant cannot use the SharePoint calendars on all computers bar one.&nbsp;<br />
The Assistant can see the calendars and allows them to be selected for use.&nbsp; However, instead of a tick box there is a red circle containg an x.&nbsp; If you click on the icon you get the following message repeated twice: "Cannot retrieve events from folder [Calendar
 name].&nbsp; Original Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 error message: 263040"</p>
<p>On one computer there are no problems.&nbsp; We cannot see any differences in setup.&nbsp; We have tried running fixmapi.exe and switched Outlook cahing on and off. There are no problems using using other personal or shared calendars</p>
<p>Has anybody come across this before?</p>

    <title>PERSONAL.XLSB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geoff budd  say:</h3>
<h2>            PERSONAL.XLSB</h2>
                    <p>I have just installed Office 2007 onto my new HP computer (model h8-1070uk), running Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>I copied across some Excel VBA macros from my old XP machine onto the new machine (via a USB stick) and saved them in PERSONAL.XLSB, because I want them available to all Excel workbooks that I work with.</p>
<p>While this works perfectly in Excel 7 under Windows XP, I am getting some strange behaaviour on the new machine under Windows 7.&nbsp; On the new machine, tthis is what happens:</p>
<p>If I just launch Excel, then it starts up PERSONAL.XLSB but shows a blank workbook - exactly as it should.&nbsp; I can then open&nbsp;Excel workbooks and&nbsp;everything behaves as normal, with the PERSONAL.XLSB macros available when I need to use them.</p>
<p>However, if I open an Excel workbook by double-clicking on the file name&nbsp;(thereby automatically launching Excel), the PERSONAL.XLSB file is not included when Excel launches, and if I try to run one of those macros, I get a VBA error number 400 (presumably
 meaning that it cannot find the macro).</p>
<p>I have looked at various folders to see where Microsoft Office and PERSONAL.XLSB are stored, and this is the result:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<span>
<p><span>"C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Excel\XLSTART\" contains PERSONAL.XLSB</span></p>
<p><span>"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office12\" doesn't contain an XLSTART folder</span></p>
</span><span><span>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office12\" does contain an XLSTART folder but that folder is empty. (</span></span><span><span>I've tried copying PERSONAL.XLSB into this folder, but it makes no difference).</span></span>
<p><span><span>The normal application startup file for Excel appears to be the first of the three paths above (according to the "?Application.StartupPath" command).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Does anyone have any idea what is going on here.&nbsp; I am new to Windows 7, and don't understand why Microsoft Office appears in so many paths.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I must say that the new pc came with Microsoft Office 2010 starter version pre-loaded, and I uninstalled that before installing Office 2007, but not sure if that would have affected things.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Regards,</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Max Meng.</p>
<p>I've managed to solve the problem!</p>
<p>I had the preview&nbsp;pane open in Windows Explorer, so when I selected the Excel spreadsheet ready to double-click it to open it,&nbsp;the preview window was showing the spreadsheet.&nbsp; It would seem that Windows Explorer probably has to launch the appropriate application
 (Excel in this case)&nbsp;somehow to show the preview and, in doing so, the PERSONAL.XLSB file was presumably opened in the background..</p>
<p>So...when I double-clicked it to open it, it opened, but because PERSONAL.XLSB was already open (in the Windows Explorer "preview" version), then it didn't open it a second time.</p>
<p>It's one of those problems that, when you find the answer and think it through, then it makes some sort of sense.&nbsp; But trying to figure out why it is happening in the first place is fiendishly difficult!</p>
<p>So, the answer is - don't have the preview pane open in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Geoff</p>

                    <p>Hey all:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my first build for Win10 on my nokia, and the upgrade went seemingly ok, but ran into the black screen after saying it was done.&nbsp; I did a phone reset as I could get to the notification bar, and that brought it back to life.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Huge issues I am seeing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Performance - WOW.. stutter lag all over, scrolling stutters, stutter slow to get back to the home page and so on, all really random</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Live tiles - I pin live tiles to the front, and it goes through the animation that it is putting the tile there, but then no tile.&nbsp; I find if I reboot sometimes the tile will then be there, or if I try again after reboot it works.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Phone tile - the initial phone tile was wonky.. it would only show dial numbers, but once I removed it and put it back from the app list, it shows call history, and all of the other normal functionality.&nbsp; (after three tries to get the tile there live)</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Microsoft maps - if I click on the tile, it takes me seemingly to the store to download the app.&nbsp; The app only fails again and again on download.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is just the start but man this is a rough build.</p>

            <p>Did you do a hard reset or soft reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what you said about the pinning &amp; performance&nbsp;issues&nbsp;sounds like you haven't done a hard reset and I would suggest you try that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Maps I discovered is an issue with the download not completing and having to hit retry over and over until it fully downloaded. The downside is it's 1.2gb so it only incremented bit by bit on my device to accomplish this.</p>

            +1 on Pair-A-Dyce's comment.&nbsp; With earlier builds it was more or less a requirement that you do a factory reset first, then do the upgrade.&nbsp;That was my experience on my 1020 as well; the phone was completely hosed until I did the factory reset.

</p><p>So yeah, definitely didn't do a factory reset prior to upgrade so that was one thing for sure.&nbsp; I am seeing just bizarre behavior though, which may be beta related of course.</p>
<p>

<p>Interesting because for me 10080 was sluggish and this runs really smooth (before and after hard reset) but my app issues disappeared after the reset. The problem with Maps, Music, &amp; Extras + Info is they arent downloading fully. You have to keep hitting
 retry until the package fully downloads. Huge pain but no issues after, I have seen anyone respond from Microsoft about it yet. I can tell you music is about 200mb, Maps 1.2gb, and I'm still working on extras at 1.1gb so far. Hope this helps</p>

            <p>Again, my first exposure to Win10phone beta, so some of the things I am seeing maybe known, or behavior that hasn't been resolved yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, I am exMSFT and was on the winphone beta internal team for a long time.. *smile*</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a really rough build, which may be expected, but more behavior I am seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; App crashing - I see app after app, not just third party crashing all the time.&nbsp; I launch the applet or program, the tile flies away.. then... back to home.&nbsp; Try again.. fly away.. and back again.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; notice bar dropdown - If I have a notice on the dropdown bar, say an outlook email, if I click on the email itself it will launch to the email UI.&nbsp; If I click on the Outlook name itself (as to launch the app, not the specific message like Win8.1) the
 phone will freeze up for 10+ seconds.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Outlook email tile -&nbsp;I have pinned an outlook tile on home.&nbsp; When I click on it, it launches to Yahoo mail though as the main view?&nbsp; I can select through all three email accounts (yahoo, Live, Gmail), but outlook is primary and launched as primary, but
 goes to yahoo?</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; MMS attachments - Tested an attached MMS pic, which I received and can launch to full view, but if I save it I get a message the file is damaged or cant&nbsp;be located?</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Swipe to apps - this seems inconsistent.. swipe.. works.. swipe.. doesn't work, swipe again, doesn't work.. then Nth try, it works.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Where are saved IE favorites stored?&nbsp; File explorer will show all of the normal directories, downloads, music, ringtones etc, but no way to browse deeper into favorites.&nbsp; (Since my phone is missing the 20+ URLS I have saved as favorites and are backed
 up on my PC, I would like to copy them back if possible)</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Outlook email&nbsp; - if you click on the ... bottom right, if you look at the bottom left of the bar that opens, there is a weird broken text/display next to "new mail" and shows "\ Cal"</p>
<p>
</p><p>and more as I run into them.. </p>

<p>1. I have this from time to time, usually on the second or third launch it runs, but if not a soft reset. If it totally doesn't work (this would be non-system apps) I uninstall and reinstall. Issues with the keyboard and attachments may still cause crashes
 though.</p>
<p>2. On the notification bar sometimes it works for me sometimes it doesn't on previous builds it was more consistent. Except on 10080 it was fairly known outlook would open the calendar but on 10136 message don't go to message, some notifications just clear
 and nothing happens at all.</p>
<p>3. Did you pin the app itself of the individual email boxes? I've found the tiles show no updates at all either way and opening an email from the action center may or may not take you to that email &gt;_&lt; How does it decide which is the primary to open, no
 clue. Wish I knew too.</p>
<p>4. I have not had that issue, I have had a group conversation suddenly switch to one of the individuals which is totally strange but nothing with attachments.</p>
<p>5. Do you mean swiping from Start?</p>
<p>6. errrr, no clue since IE was nuked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did have about 10 dropped calls yesterday, but I don't get too many calls lol so I don't know if that's from this build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Update the Music app is 289.7mb for anyone having issues downloading, keep hitting retry. Extras+Info is still at 1.4gb for me and climbing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Messages are pretty bad in this build which is funny because in Gabe Aul's post he said issues would go away. I now have issues I never had on any other build! Ha</p>

</p><p>I have purchased Microsoft Office Home and Student 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the following message each time I start word.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a685bdef-abed-477b-aff9-f72a9201e3da?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a685bdef-abed-477b-aff9-f72a9201e3da?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried repairing the Microsoft Office offline as well as online by following the instructions through control panel.</p>
<p>However, the message is still displayed. After clicking OK, the WORD functions properly but this process consumes lot of time.
</p>
<p>This happens only with word and not with other microsoft desktop apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please help me solve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and Regards</p>

<p>If you start Word in Safe mode, as part of troubleshooting, do you still encounter the error message? For instructions, see
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>If the error message does not appear in Safe mode, continue troubleshooting as follows: (1) Rename the Normal template, (2) troubleshoot COM and Startup add-ins, and (3) delete some of Word's registry entries. For assistance, see
