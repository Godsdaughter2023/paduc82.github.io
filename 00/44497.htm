    <title>Win10 pro reinstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom rossi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 pro reinstall</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I want to reinstallwin10 pro after problems with bad settings and a frozen system resulting afterwards. I am coming from win8 pro and did d the free upgrade, so my license is actually win 10 pr. I read that it is possible to proceed with a clean installment
 without having to insert the product key;</p>
<p>&nbsp;the one I have is win 8 and I knew that If I want to reinstall I have to repeat a normal installation starting a gain from my win 8 license, because the product key for win 10 upgrade is depending on the original win 8 license.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But actually one of your Italian personnel members on Microsoft community forum told a member that it is possible to proceed with a clean installment starting from the current situation, latest upgRade installed, without inserting the product key again.</p>
<p>when I finished the latest upgrade two days ago, I noticed that now on security and upgrade options it is Present the new option clean installments win 10. Thank you for your answer if you can help me</p>

<p>Let's try rebuilding the icon cache on your computer. Some users were able to restore the default system icons by rebuilding the icon cache. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>File Explorer</strong>.</li><li>Navigate to the <strong>C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer
</strong>folder.<strong><br />
</strong></li><li>In this folder, you will see a lot of files like <em>iconcache_32.db, iconcache_48.db, iconcache_96.db, iconcache_256.db, iconcache_1024.db, iconcache_1280.db, iconcache_1600.db, iconcache_1920.db, iconcache_2560.db, iconcache_exif.db, iconcache_idx.db,
 iconcache_sr.db, iconcache_wide.dd, iconcache_wide_alternate.db</em>, etc.</li><li>Delete them all to purge and rebuild the icon cache.</li><li>Reboot your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the custom icons still appear after rebuilding the icon cache, we suggest that you perform a repair upgrade using a
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Creators Update ISO</a> file. Performing this can repair broken operating system files while preserving your personal files, settings and installed applications. For more information and steps on how to perform a repair upgrade, kindly follow the wiki article

    <title>Xbox one x adding latency - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twizteddemise  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one x adding latency </h2>
                    <p>I have fiber optics 100mbps upload and download with 3ms ping and 6 jitter max all the time. I've have isp come out and check as well as the ookla speed test on the xbox all shows this. But in the detailed network statistics it shows 47ms latency all the way up to 80ms latency. Low band with on ww11 as well. I have all ports forwarded as well as a tcp and udp for everyport Xbox Support specialist stated. And all the ports for the ww11. Open nat type.... the issue is the 30 to 70 ms latency gain. Anyone able to find a way to confirm this as common or a possible hardware or software issue? Already wiped the hard drive.... cleared alternate mac adress and not plugged into a surge protector. Even Xbox Support don't understand what's going on. You can really feel the lag in all the games especially fps games. </p>

            it's because ... they keep adding trash apps to the dashboard that GUZZLE bandwidth like ALEXIS, and MIXER.&nbsp; Now they have also removed the xbox Live GOLD requirement I believe to stream broadcasts. So now every&nbsp;<strong>(Mod Removed)</strong>&nbsp;no talent
 ace clown is streaming as if anyone gives a <strong>(Mod Removed)</strong> about their game and what you have is the result....&nbsp; SATURATION.&nbsp; So you want this fixed? Start bullying the STREAMERS because they are the ones dragging it down next to AMAZON.

<h3> josephsalmieri  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I transfer files&#47;data from a ASUS tablet to my windows 8.1 PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My child's ASUS tablet touchscreen with Windows 8 was broken.&nbsp; It has a detachable keyboard that goes with it.&nbsp; Before we turn it in to be fixed (or if we chose to just replace it), we wanted to transfer some files over to our computer with Windows 8.1&nbsp;(like
 pictures, etc).&nbsp; I tried connecting an USB cable from the tablet to the PC but the connection wasn't recognized.&nbsp; I tried looking this up online but was told we needed to install a USB Drive(r?) into our PC.&nbsp; It was an automated message and with all the scams
 out there, I figured I would go here, instead.&nbsp; Even if we do need to download something from here, it won't be a fake thing with a virus attached.&nbsp; I tried looking through the questions already answered but none seemed to apply to our circumstances.&nbsp; Can
 anyone help?</p>

            <p>You have a lot of options.&nbsp; One of the most straightforward is to just drag the files to a USB flash drive and take it to the other computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also use the network.&nbsp; From either computer, open File Explorer and choose Network on the left.&nbsp; If your other computer is turned on and file sharing is enabled, you should be able to copy the files over the network to the other computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option is to put the files into your OneDrive online storage, so that they are backed up online, and you can go to the other computer and download them for even extra safe keeping.</p>

<h2>            previewing files in expression web using expression developmnet server</h2>
                    I have no trouble previewing .php files in expression web once the server is set up but i want to preview ALL files using expression development server because once I preview an HTML file, links to php files won't work because html files preview default
 to file:///C: location which does not display php files correctly. There is an option in Site Settings -&gt; Preview that allows all files to preview with expression development server. But when clicked, it unclicks itself when the dialog box is closed. Something
 is preventing "all files" option from working. Does anyone know what must be done to enable that option? Thanks.

    <title>Ban Keyword from Gamertag Search - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> unamused bunny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ban Keyword from Gamertag Search</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>after a disappointing result from my enforcement gamertag change (where I was acknowledged to be perceived as a racist), I would like ensure nobody makes the same mistake as I and be forced to spend $14 to change your gamertag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How do I get a keyword removed from the "Gamertag search" page as a viable new gamertag?</p>
<p>https://account.xbox.com/en-AU/changegamertag</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. How do I ensure any other gamertags with the same keyword suffer the same level of enforcement as I did?</p>
<p>Would I have to manually report each gamertag one by one, or is the enforcement team proactively identifying this list based on the results of my case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>- Anthony</p>
<p>

<p>1. I am not sure about what you're asking. Ban a keyword? The people search function in Xbox only searches for exact gamertags, as far as I know. I can't pull up people by partial gamert If you are worried about privacy,

you can control how</a> your Xbox Live account communicates with others.</p>

<strong>
<p><span>On start up I just have © Microsoft Corporation and a progress bar with a green bar crossing the screen endlessly.&nbsp;</span></p>
</strong></span><strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</strong>I'm not sure of the version of Vista I have running since I can't start up the laptop. I have run all the Windows updates.&nbsp;


<p><span>I have tried an f6 start and tried a Windows to fix the problem and it said that Windows could not fix the problem. I tried a f8 safe mode and, same thing, © Microsoft Corporation and a progress
 bar with a green bar crossing the screen endlessly.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>I don't have system discs - I bought the PC with the system installed.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>What would be great is if you could point me to a link where I could download a start up disc and burn it on another computer and then try to start up the laptop from a disc and repair it?&nbsp;</span></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p><span><span>We'll need to do a general troubleshooting to see if we can identify and resolve the problem.<span>&nbsp;</span>Skip any steps that require booting into normal mode for
 now and then reply with results. Use the disk or safe mode where required (if unable to boot into safe mode either, skip those steps as well).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps made on a different computer).&nbsp; This is NOT a boot disk - there is no such thing available (except with different operating systems which won't help us fix this problem).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.&nbsp; That's about all that can be done unless you can boot normally or into safe mode, so if you still can't post back at this point.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp;
 Here's how to use Event Viewer: </span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem
 (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp;</span><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search
 box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each
 for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should do any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp;
 In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span></span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span></span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; To do this you have to also be able to boot normally.<span>&nbsp;</span>Here's the procedure:
</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a><span><span>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Please
 reply before doing the next step as it is a radical option and I’d like to make sure we’ve ruled out all other options before taking that step.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work (or you don’t have the disk), then I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix</span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the
 Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 100 updates pending,...</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span>Good luck!</span>

<p>Contact the computer manufacturer and give them the information about the computer including the serial number (not the Product Key which they can't use and wouldn't tell us either but the serial number (or whatever they call it) of the machine - it must
 be somewhere on the side, bottom, back, or maybe even inside perhaps next to or under the battery).&nbsp; They should be able to tell you whether or not you have a 32-bit or 64-bit system with the version of Vista they installed.&nbsp; Does the receipt include the serial
 number of the machine?</p>
<p>If you can't find out, try the 32-bit version (that's the most likely) and see what happens.&nbsp; If&nbsp;it doesn't work or you have problems running the programs, then try the 64-bit version and see if it works any better.&nbsp; I'd much rather we use the correct version
 the first time, but if there's no way to learn what it is, then give this a try.</p>
<p>I hope&nbsp;this helps.</p>

<h2>            Calculator in Win 10 is showing only first 3 digits</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>please help me. I have one strange issue with win calc, which I use quite frequently. I had this issue on my old comp, i was not able to resolve it, even when I have followed all instructions which I found online [restart app, uninstall it, new user account..]
 nothing worked for me. At the end I gave up, but now I bought a new comp and I have the same issue. Win calc is always showing only first three digits... it's very strange and I have suspicion if it has something to do with my regional settings... really don't
 know how to proceed and what to change.</p>
<p>

<h2>            After update, xbox one won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t restart</h2>
                    After the initial setup, the xbox one says it has to update. So after it updates it asks to restart, but once the console turns off it doesn't come back on. And if I manually turn it back on, it makes me go through everything again. If anyone can help
 me I'd greatly appreciate it.

            <p>Hey there BRB! Let's see what we can do to get things sorted.<br /><br />Do you ever get any error codes or messages during this process? Or does the update appear to go through properly but the console just never powers itself back on after shutting down?<br /><br /><strong>In this situation, I suggest using the <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a> page to set up a support call with a specialist who will be able to work with you through the update process to make sure everything gets taken care of.</strong><br /><br />Let us know how that goes and we'll be standing by to hear back from you! ^_^</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t believe you can&#39;t macro keys on the elite controller...but why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought an elite controller today with the presumption that i could have macro keys. For example, in Elite Dangerous the are several menus or actions you have access to by having to press two buttons. For instance, i have LB+A for shield cell banks and RB+A for heat sinks. I poorly presumed it would be a no brainer that i could map both commands to just on paddle or button on the elite controller. After trying but failing multiple times, I goggled it and come to find out this feature is not supported. Two years ago people were dumb found as to why this was as i am today.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I get how remapping certain buttons to paddles maybe useful in twitch base FPS games, but come on! For a $150.00 bucks there should be more uses for an "elite" controller other than mainly appealing to FPS games. I am extremely disappointed. I may give the controller a few weeks to see if it grows on me but thankfully Gamestop is offering a full 30 days to return the controller for full cash ba

<p>Has anyone ever found a solution? do I have to go outside of Microsoft to find something credible? I should just speak to India to get the same solution.</p>
<p>Luckily this problem isn't on Internet Explorer?&nbsp; Please don't tell me to get rid of the history , been there done that.

            I think I found the solution, at least it worked for me. I signed out of my Microsoft Account under account settings and now Edge is running normally.

            <p>Honestly, I have bigger issues now on another home built computer less than 2 months old. &nbsp;So Edge or IE is not functional, nor is Start Menu. This is all after help from MS support, plus updates, etc.. The original problem on this unit is freezing with
 no <strong>ctl/alt/del </strong>just need to restart by shutting off the computer. &nbsp;Feel free to get involved that thread is a year old and 23 pages of complaints. &nbsp;As far as Edge, at this point I don't care, I use Chrome on both computers. That thread is</p>

<p>Esse problema está bem chato, já troquei pilha, atualizei o controle, não tem nada interferindo na conexão, já sincronizei denovo o controle com o console as vezes até para um pouco mas depois volta a acontecer denovo a luz do controle volta a ficar piscando
 constantemente, alguém já passou por isso? Soube como resolver?</p>

<p>Aqui não adianta, passei um bom tempo ontem jogando com um cabo e mesmo assim quando tirei só funciona quando o controle está a um palmo do video game, dei uma pesquisada na net e muita gente reclamando do mesmo problema, varias pessoas no reclame aqui &nbsp;em
 foruns e youtube espero que com atualização de fevereiro conserte isso, sei que é difícil pois provavelmente a culpa é da placa usada para wireless do xbox one que perde a potencia pois é de baixa qualidade, e só trocando ela =(</p>

    <title>COD Ghosts Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wickedlip  say:</h3>
<h2>            COD Ghosts Account</h2>
                    
<p>I have just chatted with Cate from XBOX One support and explained my issue with numerous attempts to get COD Ghosts to run on XBOX One. For the past 5 months on 3 separate XB1 consoles I have had nothing but issues with Ghosts only. &nbsp;Even a used console
 I just purchased from a friend that Ghosts worked perfectly under their account but would not run with my account.. &nbsp;I have included the detailed info I provided for her and she said I needed to post it here and hopefully I can get my COD/XBOX Live account
 reset/deleted &nbsp;for that game. &nbsp;I have no issues with the game on 360 but it will not run on my XBOX One. &nbsp;I understand that I will lose all rankings and I am totally okay with that even as I worked hard to get to prestige 6 but I just want to move on to XBOX
 One for playing Ghosts. &nbsp;I owned the physical copy for 360 and did the 10 dollar upgrade for the digital content for XBOX One. &nbsp;Please read the below troubleshooting story and PLEASE reset me account as this is my last hope. &nbsp;:)</p>

<p><strong><em>Hello,</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;I first bought the XB1 Day One&nbsp;<span><span>midnight</span></span>&nbsp;release. The Day One Edition then as you know was infant in patches and content.&nbsp; I had my 360 Ghost edition transferred over to
 the XB1 and was never ever able to play it on the new console.&nbsp; It looped at startup, crashed, barely let me play 10 seconds of multiplayer, etc...&nbsp; I got upset after hours of poor support from Activision and exchanged for a new console and the same thing
 was going on...same gamertag/account.&nbsp; I thought weird, maybe an account issue but since I could return it I did once more.&nbsp; The 3rd console did the same thing but this time I let it go and just continued playing Ghosts on 360 and gave up on playing on XB1.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Last week, missing the XBONE, I rolled the dice one more time and bought a used Day One console from a friend who has the digital download of Ghosts installed and worked perfectly for their account. Once I got the console home and setup with
 my Xbox Live credentials, Ghosts is acting the exact same way it did on the last consoles I have purchased. I wonder once I put my &nbsp;profile on there...somewhere in this MS "Cloud" is retaining some corrupt COD profile data maybe?&nbsp; I have seen similar issues
 with some people on You Tube with the same exact issue but no one at Activision seems to have a fix other than hard reset, uninstall reinstall, unplug power and brick to clear cache, etc...which I have tried everything numerous times. &nbsp; I am confident the
 console is solid but more of a game/account issue.&nbsp; I would also be willing to start all over on Ghosts with new stats if I could play it on XBOX ONE.&nbsp; PLEASE HELP!!!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</em></strong></p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Johnny</p>

<p>Hey Johnny,</p>
<p>Seems like there might be some import problems on COD. &nbsp;If you want to start over you can try and do &nbsp;the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; From the Home screen, select My games &amp; apps. </li><li>&nbsp; Highlight the game, press the Menu button on your controller, and then select Manage game.
</li><li>&nbsp; Scroll to the right, highlight the saved data for your gamertag under Saved Data, and then press A on your controller.
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; You will be prompted to confirm deletion of this game save data:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Delete everywhere will remove your saved data from this console, the cloud, and all other consoles you play on.
</li></ul>
<p>Hope that helps man!</p>
<p>Let me know either way!</p>
<p>Br,</p>
<p>Adgn</p>

<p>I tried that and did not work. &nbsp;I also removed it again...factory reset...reinstalled...added profile...no luck. &nbsp;I wonder if MS could do full reset. &nbsp;I appreciate your suggestion...I really thought that would have done it.</p>

<p>I should of said once I removed the profile from everywhere...it did work for about 20 seconds into a NP match. &nbsp;Then it flashed back to either the home screen of XBOX1 or back to match setup on Ghosts. &nbsp;Further than it has gotten before but still not working.
 &nbsp;Seems like something is pushing to my profile but I have no idea. &nbsp;I also double checked NAT was open and it is on both the console and Ghosts is seeing it ad open as well. &nbsp;Oh well...</p>

<p>What you can do is try and talk to Activision, I think the stats and data might be stored on their side, and beeing pushed to the Xbox one console. &nbsp;Talk with the and see if they can clean your slate, unless you can log in yourself on activisions page and
 clean it.</p>
<p>There is also this method which Activision discribes:</p>

<p>Yeah I started with Activision first and back several times and they told me they can not wipe anything that MS has to do it. &nbsp;Which doesn't make sense to me as when I deleted the game profile from everywhere...my stats were still current when I got into
 the game. &nbsp;I really appreciate your help and if I ever get it working I will post with a fix as there are several others out there with the same issue.</p>

<p>Hmm its to bad I'm not a COD player, or else I would sacrifice the 360 profile to help you out here.</p>
<p>Have you tried with another profile on the Xbox one ?</p>
<p>And its strange that it "started" on the XB1, and let you play for a match or two before it broke.</p>
<p>Do you have any extra content an addons? &nbsp;If so could you please just remove those and just have the CoD Game?</p>

<p>I tried other profiles but all under my Xbox live account. &nbsp;I wanted to log in to my friends console and try it but he wants my profile near his XBONE.... &nbsp;I have tried it without the additional maps and with. &nbsp;I am going to reset my router back to its original
 config and static the box and specifically forward the ports Activision documented on theier website. &nbsp;I doubt that will do anything buts it's worth a try. &nbsp;I also may take the console to my neighbors house just so I can rule out my network.</p>

<p>Update...bought a physical copy of Ghosts and the same issue persists. &nbsp;Here's a rundown and please...if MS has a way to completely reset my Live Account...please do.</p>
<p>1. Uninstalled/Reinstalled/cleared cache/NAT is open on Xbox and Ghosts side.</p>
<p>2. Previously owned XBOX with perfectly working copy of Ghosts installed until I signed in with my Live Account.</p>
<p>3. Factory reset...physical copy of Ghosts installed...same issue.</p>
<p>MS is there a way to credit me what time I have left on my Xbox Live and I will start a new account. &nbsp;Seems this would be a reasonable request...???</p>

 I click on the folder icon to go into explorer, eventually it tells me that path/location doesn't exist. I also can't get on the internet, which if I could, I could then hopefully do a restore from Google sync. And to add to the huge list of complications,
 if I can get windows to see my external hard drive, I should be able to restore from there too. Add to that, I can't find the recovery/rescue/boot disk to re-install.</span><br />

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />In cases like this, the simplest option is  to access the Windows Recovery Environment to repair your Windows installation.
<br />
<br />You'll need to use another PC to create a bootable USB drive by typing "create recovery drive" into Start, or by following the steps in the below link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/</a>...
<br />
<br />The USB drive needs to be empty and have at least 8GB storage space. Once you've created to bootable media, you can plug it into the computer that won't boot and set your startup boot options to USB. It'll load up the Windows Recovery Environment, and from there you can repair Windows. It might fix the error.
<br />
<br />If it doesn't, it's possible your hard drive is causing the error. Either way, please let me know how you go and I'll see what else we can try if needed! Thanks!       
        </p>

            If you can log into Windows:
<br />To repair Windows without losing any data then you can try an in place upgrade repair:

<br />
<br />If you can’t do this then use Kyhi’s boot disc to boot &amp; run one of the backup tools to create an image of your hard drive on an external drive so that you have a backup of your files &amp; then reinstall Windows.

<p>Hi Graeme, so very sorry its taken so long to reply.&nbsp; I work in hospitality and December was a crazy month and January is not letting up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right everything I've done to date</p>
<p>1. Got to repair, recover restore screen options - none work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. USB with bootmgr can't access it. Can see in safe mode, but won't start. Have tried to open USB from command prompt following "how to" instructions from Microsoft and other help pages - no matter which way I try either bad or path doesn't exist and worse
 response "No Operating System"&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried shift and keep hitting restart to display use device and takes me to recovery screen with no use device option</p>
<p>Have another USB with iso image to reinstall windows 10. I get to find software to install&nbsp; can't find it. Try to enter path to USB manually and still can't find.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Desperate measures was to completely wipe hard drive, follow instructions to create partition etc... But that is way beyond my capabilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not giving in, and I want to have exhausted (apart from the partition thing) every other possible way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help in the beginning&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andy&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS I have sent this to&nbsp; Time lady too as she too was very supportive&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Graeme,&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Think I've had a mini breakthrough&nbsp; Followed this website to try and fix exe file problem&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://windowsreport.com/exe-files-not-opening-windows-10/</p>
<p>
</p><p>And can now get to desktop and have limited access. I can't however uninstall my kaspersky antivirus which could be the problem. I have followed the instructions on this site too</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.groovypost.com/howto/repairing-a-broken-windows-10-installation/amp/</p>
<p>
</p><p>But can't uninstall kaspersky in Windows 10 and will try from safe mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue is not recognising .exe explorer&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will wait to hear back from you before attempting anything</p>
<p>

<h2>            Family Accounts&#58; Cannot link to my family&#39;s accounts &#40;Website not issuing email invite&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set up three MS Accounts. My account (let's say "NJ"), and two for each of my children (let's call them "1" and "2"). I control the email accounts for all three accounts (all of the type *** Email address is removed for privacy ***), each with the respective name for the MS
 account holder. The dates of births for all three accounts are correct (NJ is an adult, 1 and 2 are both entered with birthdates that make them less than 10 years old)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, I cannot set up a Family group.&nbsp;I log in to my account, navigate to the "Family" section, seek to add a new child, enter the email address that is linked to their MS account, and the browser updates to advise that an invitation has been
 issued to the child by email. The reality is that NO email is being issued... and as such the accounts remain unlinked / not in a family group (for the avoidance of doubt, spam filters are turned off, the mail is not going into a junk folder, and even through
 a browser based mail client, no email is there).&nbsp;I have waited at least 24 hours, as suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried removing each of my children and re-adding them. I have tried logging in to my children's accounts and linking with me as an adult (same thing happens). I have tried 3 different browsers on one computer, and 2 on another computer. I have spent
 an inordinate amount of time on MS LiveChat, phone lines, remote access and with emails..... and after over 2 weeks of relatively constant attempts, I seem to be no further forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The purpose for wanting to set up Family Groups is, in the first instance at least, around an Xbox One that they received at Christmas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody help me to resolve this please?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Hi Yashwanth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>and thank you for your post. Before I proceed as you have suggested, can you please clarify:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) If I set up new accounts, can I use my exisiting email address, or should I create a new email (e.g. temp1 - with my domain details). If I do create a new email address, can I later delete my current MS Account and use my current, permanent email address
 to link to the new MS Account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) One of the accounts that I have set up for my son is already linked, and live on his Xbox One. If I have to set up new accounts for my children, will his progress on Xbox One be retained, or will he have to start from scratch?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Your suggesting of "adding someone else to this PC".... I really only want to manage my children's accounts that they will use on an Xbox One. I am using a PC, but I'm not particularly interested in adding my children to the PC and giving them accounts
 on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside..... or perhaps as a related point, I note that I did not receive an email notification that you had responded to my origianl post. Any ideas what is going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could give me a steer on the above, that would be appreciated,</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Suggest you to create a new Microsoft account with adult level permissions. I mean, try to sign up for a new Microsoft account (I.e. New Email account)&nbsp;and use that account to configure&nbsp;the
 child accounts to see if they works fine. Once you setup the new Microsoft account, convert the existing Microsoft account to Local account on your PC and then configure the new Microsoft account for the same. From that new Microsoft account, try to add the
 child accounts. This is just to check the root cause of the issue.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay in responding, but I've now had chance to do what you suggested and ascertain what the results are. With my "old" account, I withdrew all of the family permissisons, to ensure that this didn't influence future invitations. I set up a
 new, adult MS account and made it a local log on on my PC. From my PC I tried to add child accounts, and again after sever days of waiting, there has not been any invitation email that has been received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could look in to this further, that would be appreciated. I am still not getting notifications of your responses to this thread too,</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I raised this issue towards the end of December 2015, and I have spent many hours on Microsoft phone lines, "chat" sessions and even remote access, and the best "option" that I have been given is to post my problems on here in the hope that someone will
 be able to provide me with a solution. It seems that after my first post on 8 Jan 2016, we are still not really any further forward. My last post was on 25 January 2016, and I note that today (4 February) there has not been any response to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you / anyone explain roughly what has been going on and why, or is Microsoft simply discriminating against me for some unknown reason. Please confirm either way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty disappointed in the efforts so far to resolve this. Perhaps you or one of your colleagues could make some time to consider and resolve my problems or provide me with details as to how to further escalate it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
        </p>

            <p>Would it be fair to say that MS Family accounts are not working? My complaint about MS and my problems with Family Accounts seem to simply be ignored, I can only assume that this is as a result of a fundamental problem with family safety settings that you
 are unwilling or unable to solve. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a solution to the family setting problem that I have set out, could you please let me know as a matter of urgency.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm staggered that, what appears to be such a simple problem (linking two accounts to create a family unit), is proving to be so difficult. I thought that this was the basic building block of using family settings. Without this, there seems very little point
 in having family safety settings at all. Furthermore, without the ability to set up family safety and family accounts properly, isn't MS in breach of misleading adverts or claims concerning its products functionality (surely here in the UK, as a minimum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This matter seems to have gone on for long enough (in a digital age, this has been rolling on for 2 months already, which seems farcical).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can I now have an urgent response?</p>

    <title>Windows 7, Adobe Flash Player, 32 bit browser - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> njcanderson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7, Adobe Flash Player, 32 bit browser</h2>
                    I recently got a new laptop with Windows 7, 64 bit system, and i love it, except for the fact that it can't run Flash Player yet.<br />
I didn't have a problem with this, because the 32 bit internet explorer, or any other 32 bit browser should have worked with flash player. However, when i get to a site where i would use flash player, even including the page on the adobe website where you test
 your flash player, the browser freezes up (i've tried IE, firefox, opera, safari, and google chrome), and it says that the browser needs to shut down.
<br />
<br />
I'm using an Inspiron 1545, from dell<br />
7600 windows 7 build<br />
Pentium dual core T4300 @ 2.1Ghz<br />
4 GB ram<br />
<br />
It would be great if someone could help me figure out why flash player won't work with these 32 bit web browsers, and if there is anything i can do to change this.<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You will notice that a bar appears at the top of the window to download an activex control. DO NOT click here. You don't need the Adobe Download Manager on your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Instead, go to the bottom of the page where it says:

If it does not start, <a href="http://fpdownload.adobe.com/get/flashplayer/current/install_flash _player_ax.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click here to download</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Download the file and save it to your hard drive. Then close Internet Explorer. Now go to the file and run it. Then, go to:
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/ software/flash/about/</a>&nbsp;to see that it has been successfully installed. It should show you that version 10,0,42,34 installed.</div>

            I figured out the answer for me. &nbsp;It was the power supply, wall charge thingy. &nbsp;It was probably putting out something, just enough to fool me. &nbsp;I have lots of those things around because I am afraid to throw one away without knowing what it went with,
 and most don't say. &nbsp;You could probably find a universal one (voltage switch and a variety of connectors) &nbsp;at a store somewhere or online, but I wanted to try a different charger quickly at no cost.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>It was 5v with the + connection in the center of the plug, so I scrounged and found a 5v. &nbsp;Wrong plug, too big. &nbsp;I had about 6 9v with the right connector, so I sacrificed one to combine with my 5v, being careful to make sure the center was + in the end.
 &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I pugged it in, and suddenly the USB connection woke up, and software started updating. &nbsp;It was soon working perfectly, and I am typing with it now.</div>
