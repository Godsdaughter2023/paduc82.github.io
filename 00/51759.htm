<h2>            Regedit.exe, Task Manager, and msconfig won&#39;t open&#33;</h2>
                    So, a while ago, my dad got really mad at me, and without me knowing he forced himself as an admin, and me as a standard user, I couldnt do anything, like Task manager, etc. but finally, I got admin rights back again, but then kept getting this error,
 "[PROGRAM] has been disabled by your administrator" Where program is Task manager, registry editing, and msconfig, I used GPedit and now I dont get that error, but they will now just open and close right away. I used HiJackThis and it told me to post this
 log.

<h2>            Microsoft Update installs outdated driver even if the newer driver was already installed</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I have a problem with automatic driver installation via <b><i>Microsoft Update</i></b>.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After I enabled <b><i>Microsoft Update</i></b> Windows installs&nbsp;<b><i>Intel HD Graphics 4000
<u>v.9.17.10.2849</u></i></b>&nbsp;inspite of the fact I have already installed the newer version of the driver â&nbsp;<b><i>Intel HD Graphics 4000
<u>v.9.18.10.3071</u></i></b>. In other words, <b><i>Microsoft Update</i></b> overwrites the newer version of the driver with old one. How can I stop it without disabling automatic driver update? Why Windows overwrites the official latest driver by Intel?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

<p>Personally I rarely install any Recommended update, and certainly not a none MS driver update.</p>

            Maybe due to the fact it is a 14 year old game that has not been updated to work on the newer versions of Windows? &nbsp;Doubtful Microsoft will release any patches to allow it to work either. &nbsp;If you cant get it to work via Compatibility Mode, then most likely
 you will have to use a VM of an older version of Windows to continue to play the game.

<p>I went to the Links Country Club site and paid &amp; downloaded the Links 2003 game there.</p>
<div>It took a little tinkering trying different settings but it does work on my SurfacePro 3 tablet.</div>
<div>Iâm still tinkering but at the moment its running well using Compatibility mode of Win. 7 with display settings at Scaling on high DPI, within the game I found graphics settings has to be set at 32bit, otherwise the cameras donât work and youâll have some
 pixilation, still there is a occasional artifacts but the game runs just fine.&nbsp; I think a little fine tuning will correct that.. Bottom line, the best ever golf sim does work on our tablets and I am thrilled.. the game and courses are priced very&nbsp;reasonably,
 actually are on sale right now.. </div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</span></p>
<p><span>Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your inconvenience that you are unable to find Cortana in your region.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to activate Cortana on Window phone please refer to the below steps and check if it helps:
</span></p>
<p><span>Cortana is now available in the aforementioned regions. However, users are required to make some changes in the settings to be able to get the voice
 assistant on their handset. Here are the changes you need to make:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Change the language settings (Settings &gt; Language) to any of the different English version -- English India / Australia / Canada -- in accordance with the place youâre based in.</span></li><li><span>You are no longer required to be living at US to have Cortana on your phone. Change the region settings (Settings &gt; Region) to India, Australia, or Canada</span></li><li><span>Similarly, you are required to make some amendments to the Speech settings (Settings &gt; Speech) as well.
</span></li><li><strong><span>For Australia</span></strong><span>: English (United Kingdom); For Canada set it to English (United States); and for India: English
 (United Kingdom)</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You will definitely be asked to restart the handset a couple of times.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do note that India, Canada and Australia are getting the alpha version of Cortana, which might not be as functional and certainly not full-fledged.
 Try it out on your handset, and let us know how you like it. Do mention the features that the Alpha version of Cortana is missing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For more information about Cortana, please refer to the below link:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. Kindly update the status of the issue, we will be happy to help you.</span></p>

            <p>Same old runaround, a question is asked and Microsoft gives an unrelated answer! You weren't asked about a phone...why is Cortana not available in Canada? Simple question that a company with all your resources should be able to answer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's set the record straight,</p>
<p>
</p><p>USA and Canada</p>
<p>- our governments get along rather well</p>
<p>- we share intelligence at the highest levels</p>
<p>- NSA and CSEC work hand in hand</p>
<p>- Canada does not Cyber attack the USA</p>
<p>- we are each others biggest trading partner</p>
<p>- we share the longest open border in the world</p>
<p>- we are signatories of NAFTA</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>USA and China</p>
<p>- China's military is constantly probing US networks for vulnerablities</p>
<p>- China has stolen highly classified material from Sandia, Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos</p>
<p>- China often vetos votes supported by the US in the United Nations, minimizing and negating US support to issues, countries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in short I call BullS#$t. US owes China a Trillion plus dollars, thus a communist country completely opposed to US beliefs and standards gets Cortana. Canada, always arm-in-arm with the US, not a chance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you are interested in getting Cortana in Canada as early as possible, I would recommend joining the Windows Insider program (if you haven't already.)&nbsp;
</p>

            <p>I find it almost laughable (if not so sad for Microsoft)&nbsp;that all replies to this question deflect the issue by referring to Canada as a "Region" as a "New Market" or "New Parts Of The World" and that in order to participate a Canadian must pretend they
 are from another country or become an "insider". For those of you that don't get it Canada is a country not a region and we were probably the 1st country outside the U.S.A. to start buying Microsoft products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's ridiculous the new Microsoft doesn't understand this. Then again I'm still waiting for&nbsp;their 8.1 upgrade for my HTC 8S and my wife's ATIV S. I don't know can you still buy a Windows Phone in Canada? I don't think even Microsoft knows&nbsp;if they do or not.
 Canada is a very big place in the world and if you don't even want to try maybe we'll just say the hell with Microsoft and hello to Android and Blackberry as operating systems.</p>

            <p>i so agree with all of you.&nbsp; We are a country with pride also. not just the USA that has troops fighting for their country,</p>
<p>So this is an equal opportunity, Canada feels like we are the last to receive anything,, Even movies and music.. the US receives it first. Canada is a great country to live in and we will not let any other country harm us, We Are Proud to be Canadians. BTW
 we are a country not a Region. Salut Canada!!! :)</p>

<h2>            Downgrade back to 8.1 from Windows 10 without the button in the updates tab&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, but I've decided that I don't like it as much as the older version. I've looked around for ways to downgrade, and ended up finding a couple articles like
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/220723/how-to-uninstall-windows-10-and-downgrade-to-windows-7-or-8.1/?PageSpeed=noscript" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this one</a>. However, when I go to updates and recovery (as shown in the article), I do not have the part that says "Go back to Windows 8.1". I only installed Windows 10 a few days ago, so I am well within the month limit, and I have checked: the Windows.old
 folder is in my C drive where it is supposed to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, how would I get the button to appear in the updates and recovery tab?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I cannot make it appear, is there any way that I can manually start the downgrade process? (A file buried somewhere that I can click or something?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for the help.</p>

    <title>The future of single player... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ii fozzer ii  say:</h3>
<h2>            The future of single player...</h2>
                    
<p>Are developers aiming to remove the days of playing single player (alone) from future games. Titanfall is a game that's going to be online. There will be single player objectives, but you will still be online with other players. &nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The Division... I don't know much about this game;but it does look as though it'll be online, with teams of people running around the map at the same time as you.... You can join them or fight them to survive.</span></p>
<p><span>Destiny..... Described as a MMO shooting game that again; let's you team up with other people to complete the objectives, while you can run into other teams.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The Crew... Basically, a car game that requires you to complete tasks.... Online (think Smuggler's Run).</p>

<p>Personally, &nbsp;i'm looking forward to these games because they're set to bring better experiences with online gaming. &nbsp;I can see the downsides to this and I'm sure a lot of other people do too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on this? Are you looking forward to "always online games" or do you prefer the Good old single player? &nbsp;</p>

<p>The problem with always online is well.....just look at Battlefield 4....GTA 5 and pretty much every other online game, its always a disgrace at start and sometimes takes weeks and weeks to sort. Brink had the same idea, blurring single player and multiplayer
 and while it wasn't the best game, i enjoyed it.</p>
<p>Single player games will always have a home, its the same old thing, some games just dont need multipayer and often suffer for having it shoe horned in.</p>

<p>I like a lot of campaigns and buy a lot of games primarily for the campaigns. I wouldn't have touched Gears if it wasn't for the story, I'm not interested in Guitar Hero or Forza online and Assassin's Creed, Bioshock and GTA/Bully never would have got anywhere
 without their campaign modes. I won't go in to the reason why RPGs like Fallout, TES and Fable should remain single player only unless they build MMOs from scratch.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>That said, game like Call of Duty and Battlefield are just fun to quickly play through when you can't really be bothered. Without their online modes they wouldn't be worth Â£5, let alone Â£55. I think it all comes down the the style of the game but at the
 same time, I think it's important that devs try to make their games appeal to everyone with both modes but without trying to distract themselves and make a game something it's not. It's all a case of balance.</p>

<p>I think/hope there will always be a place for a good single player game, if we ever got to the day where all games were "online only" would be the day I give up gaming.</p>
<p><br />
The trouble for me is I haven't played a MP game in recent years where I've said ... "Doesn't feel much better/much different than anything I've played before. Take Battlefield 4 for example, now when it's working it's great, finally have 64 players on console,
 even so, does it feel much different to any Battlefield game before? not to me it doesn't. I'm not saying this is all bad, people that are still into Battlefield will love it, I really enjoyed it for a while, trouble is the novelty soon wore off.</p>
<p><br />
I just hope games like Titanfall, Planetside 2, Destiny&nbsp;etc will finally give me a game that doesn't feel like I've played countless times before.</p>

<p>Tombraider multiplayer was just terrible... it baffled me even more than when it came to releasing DLC and it was all multiplayer, despite the many many requests for more singleplayer stuff. &nbsp;All I can assume is someone thought the future of gaming was in
 multiplayer and wanted a piece of the pie.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>To some degree I think GTA V proved that to be wrong, despite the later addition of GTA Online I 'm pretty sure most people bought it for the singleplayer experience.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>TBH I don't mind some kind of online mode being added so long as it fits with the spirit of the game... the online mode for RYSE for example goes well. When it's just tacked on deathmatch, etc for no reason it's pointless, even more irritating when it's
 poor multiplayer and half the games achievements are multiplayer based. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>That scene from an early Red vs Blue where they're discussing why they're fighting over a sealed off canyon with no tactical value kinda sums it up for me.</p>

<p>I need my single player and I don't think its going anywhere soon. I do however, like the direction they are taking with online only games. I think last generation was one of the best generations to date but it lacked MMORPG's. I know there were a few, but

<h2>            Strange mouse click focus bug - desktop steals focus&#63;</h2>
                    Hi!<br />
<br />
I have a very strange bug, not so easy to explain.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sometimes when I click on a window it will LOSE focus, and from that moment on every click will make any application lose focus.<br />
The only way to give an application at least keyboard focus is to alt-tab to it, or otherwise activate it only by keyboard.<br />
The moment there is a click anywhere, focus is lost.<br />
On the desktop I can't click on the taskbar, it's like it doesn't get the focus neither, but I can click on icons on the desktop and can "bring up" that selection rectangle.<br />
<br />
The only way I know of to get it back to normal (other than relogin or restart) is pressing ctrl+alt+del then click in that new "window" it brings up. It somehow makes the mouse "normal" again, then I can click cancel and continue work.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First experienced this problem on Sunday while playing with Windows Movie Maker. Back then the only method I knew was relogin, so I rather formatted hard drive and reinstalled Windows7 (professional), I was pretty shocked when realized it's still the same.<br />
<br />
Couldn't tell what makes it appear, it comes while using different apps etc., seems pretty random.<br />
<br />
I use a 2 monitor setup. Deactivating the 2nd monitor does not solve the problem, after it appeared.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any ideas what may cause this? Video card failure maybe? I don't think it's the driver because the error reappeared BEFORE reinstalling the latest ATI drivers.<br />
The only similar problem I could have found was a forum post from long long ago about similar problem in Windows XP, and there were no answers at all.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much.

            <p>Definitely not a hardware problem for me.&nbsp; Things behaved better when I killed the explorer.exe (using task manager).</p>
<p>In task manager I noticed that there were two instances of Flash Player running. Killing them didn't fix everything, but again the behavior was slightly less squirrely.&nbsp; It turned out that I had both Flash 12 and Flash 14 installed. So I uninstalled them
 both, and voila!&nbsp; Everything was jake.</p>
<p>All the bad behavior was gone. Totally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran for a few days like this, and then reinstalled Flash 14.&nbsp; Everything is still OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why didn't Flash setup remove the old version?&nbsp; Can't answer that for you. All I can say is that I'm happy again.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
No need to spend any money, just re-install Windows 10 on the drive you are using in that computer now. A Clean Install would be activated with the Digital Entitlement.

            Hi Dgardner_9 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. Only hard drive change is not considered a hardware change. So, you need not spend any money. Just clean install Windows 10 again. 
<br />
<br />If you had your Windows 10 license activated previously, you got a digital license. You will never need the product key again once you get digital license. Since, you have a digital license, hence when you do clean install, the license information is automatically picked up from Microsoft activation servers. Windows will activate your Windows license from this information.
<br />
<br />Make sure the version installed is same as it was previous. For example, if it was Windows 10 Home, you need to install Windows 10 Home only not Windows 10 Pro. If at any point during installation it asks for the key, choose you will do it later on / skip.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Dgardner_9, no, you do not need to purchase Windows 10 again, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />You should just clean install Windows 10 rather than upgrading from Windows 8.1. This will have 3 benefits, you can skip entering a Product Key, if you have to reset again, it will reset to Windows 10, not 8.1 and your system will be more responsive and reliable . . . 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />

<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<h2>            HP Deskjet F4580 Printer Software Download Problems</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; HP solutions centre for running Deskjet would not work - said it was only partially installed, even though worked fine before the Windows 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>Based on online advise uninstalled the drivers and then attempted to download the correct driver from the HP site.&nbsp; However, the download wont work - keeps saying download has failed.&nbsp; Tried both download options - using HP assistant and downloading directly.</p>

Capacitive VS. Resistive VS. SAW Touch Screens<br />
Capacitive<br />
Capacitive Touch screen systems transmit 90% light from the screen and deliver high quality image. Only touch the screen with finger or
<strong>a conductive device</strong>. Outside elements such as water or dust do not affect the screen.
<br />
Resistive<br />
Resistive touch screens transmit only 75% of light but cheaper than other two. Touch
<strong>supports any point able thing</strong> such as pen tip and finger. Outside elements do not affect the screen but sharp images can damage screen's layer.
<br />
SAW<br />
Surface Acoustic Wave touch screen panels transmit 100% light and deliver highest quality image.
<strong>Any point able thing</strong> can touch SAW screens. Outside elements can damage the screen. SAW Touch screen systems are the most expensive.

<h3> very interested  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intermittent Startup issues when bitlocker used without tpm, using password only in windows 8.1 pro in ultrabook with solid state drive</h2>
                    <p>I followed the instructions to activate encryption:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"(<span>Open the Local Group Policy Editor, press <b>winkey+R</b> type <b>
gpedit.msc</b> and press enter.</span></em></p>
<p><em><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the left pane, click on to expand
<b>Computer Configuration</b>, <b>Administrative Templates</b>, <b>Windows Components, BitLocker Drive Encryption, and Operating System Drives</b>.
</span></em></p>
<p><em><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the right pane, right click on
<b>Require Additional Authentification</b> <b>at startup</b> and click on Edit. </span>
</em></p>
<p><em><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>To Allow BitLocker without TPM</span></em></p>
<p><em><span><span>A)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select (dot) Enabled. </span>
</em></p>
<p><span><span><em>B)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></em></span></span><span><em>Under the Options section, check the Allow Bitlocker without a compatible TPM box."</em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>On startup the bitlocker start screen opens but the keyboard will not enter the password.</span></p>
<p><span>This is an inteermittent problem eg if I poer off, open bios and exit bios without making changes, the keyboard will then allow entering the password and allow booting into the computer which by the way is encrypted. I have seen other reports of this
 behaviour on acer and hp ultrabooks.</span></p>
<p><span>Is this an issue because the bitlocker is being used on a computer without a tpm, even though the non-tpm procedure is documented by microsoft?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I need to decide wether I need to change the configuration, or change to a computer that has tpm.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Addendum: I reset my computer back to windows 8 pro - I use factory reset which was not a major thing because it is a new computer, and bitlocker without tpm, using password only, seems to work intermittently ie at some attempts to startup the keyboard
 is not responsive.</span></p>
<p><span>I would be interested if anyone else has had any problems with encrypting a (ssd) drive with windows 8 or 8.1 pro (without tpm).</span></p>

            Two potential solutions depending on whether you can access windows via safe mode:
<br />If you can tthe solution is to turn off use sign-in info to auto finish setting up device after update or restart in Windows 10.
<br />For Windows 10 (Version 1709), select the Start  button, select Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in options, then make sure Use my sign in info to automatically finish setting up my device after an update or restart is turned off.
<br />For previous versions of Windows 10, select the Start  button, select Settings  &gt; Update &amp; security  &gt; Window Update  &gt; Advanced options, then select the check box next to Use my sign in info to automatically finish setting up my device after an update.
<br />Another potential solution is to remove any USB devices (wireless mouse, keyboard, external hard drive/s) &amp; wait to see if boot continues, if not then to restart with devices still disconnected (if possible).
<br />
<br />Many users are also reporting the same since Tuesdayâs CU &amp; one thought is that the user profile has become corrupt &amp; the solution is to create a new one within cmd prompt under task manager. 
<br />From the black screen press ctrl alt del to open task manager -&gt; file -&gt; run new task 
<br />
<br />type "cmd.exe" without quotes, and check the admin privileges box. 
<br />
<br />in cmd: 
<br />
<br />type: 
<br />
<br />net user /add [username] [password] 
<br />
<br />username and password without [] 
<br />
<br />press enter, then type: 
<br />
<br />net localgroup administrators [username] /add

            Sorry, my reply was for a different post.
<br />Iâll try to answer your question.
<br />How old is the program?
<br />Have you tried installing using compatibility mode?
<br />Have you tried downloading any updates for the program or tried downloading a fresh version from the developerâs site?
<br />This site: <a href="https://www.experts-exchange.com/articles/17490/PaperPort-14-Free-Upgrade-to-Version-14-5.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.experts-exchange.com/articles/17490...</a> shows an upgrade from 14 - 14.5 which may fix the problem.

            <p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.</p>
<p>Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.</p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Pro x64 freezes sometimes on wake from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phantomffr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Pro x64 freezes sometimes on wake from hibernation&#47;standbye when integrated Sierra Wireless Gobi 2000 UMTS Module is activated.</h2>
                    Greetings!<br />
<br />
I have a Fujitsu T730 Laptop. It has an integrated Sierra Wireless Gobi 2000 HS-USB Mobile Broadband Device 9001.<br />
<br />
When I send my Laptop to sleep with the Mobile Broadband Device activated it randomly freezes right after waking up.
<br />
That means: As soon as Windows 7 is restored (Desktop/Programs restored) it freezes completely. Only solution is to force a shutdown. The eventlog only shows the force shutdown as a critical error.<br />
<br />
This also does not happen every time I leave the Wireless Broadband Module activated prior to hibernation or stand-bye. I would guess the freezing happens about every third wake-up attempt.<br />
<br />
It appears to not matter what or how long I used the Computer prior to initiating the sleep mode.<br />
<br />
What is going on and how can this be fixed?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

            I believe I've had this issue since I started using the Mobile Broadband Device about 8 months ago.<br />
<br />
The troubleshooter did not find any issues that I would think relate to my issue. At least the three issues it found and fixed were along the lines of the screen not shutting off soon enough after being left idle.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid I fail to see the relevance of http://support.microsoft.com/kb/980869 to my issue.<br />
<br />
As far as I am aware I'm using the latest drivers/BIOS. At least neither Fujitsu nor Windows offer any kind of driver updates.<br />

<p>I don't think he wants to disable updates, but , like myself, be able to control when they happen. For those who particularly don't have their machines connected 24/7 or are on a slow connection, its a matter of having the ability to control when you take
 the updates so as to avoid clash with other tasks at hand.</p>
<p>People with "always on fast connections" would never experience this.</p>

            <p>Hi Vanessa,</p>
<p>this really is *bad*.&nbsp; As noted by others, there needs to be a way to keep the system up and running 24/7, uninterrupted by the reboots required to fulfill an update that just came about.&nbsp; Other scenario, same effect: there are users on heavily metered connectionsâBITS
 (Background Intelligent Transfer Service) eats bandwidth, if not told otherwise.&nbsp; So, these are bad defaults.&nbsp; There are workarounds, i. e.
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
on HowToGeek</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, these are *workarounds*.&nbsp; So, after these many years of Microsoft actually listening to customers, we are back again to dirty tricks and half-way solutions which are bad.&nbsp; This seriously needs to be fixed ASAP before an incarnation of a 1st&nbsp;Service
 Pack is released.</p>

<p><span><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you have a question about performing a factory reset after upgrading to Windows 10. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I would like to inform you that you will be able to do a factory reset incase his laptop manufacturer has provided the facility. If not the computer will go back to the previous operating system which came pre-installed on&nbsp;your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps you. If you have any other question with Windows feel free to reply us</span></p>

            This article, "How to Rollback to a previous version of Windows" https://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/how-to-rollback-to-a-previous-version-of-windows-from-windows-10/, was pointed to in an answer to a similar question. If you scroll down to
 the image showing "Update and Recovery" you will see the first option "Remove everything and reinstall Windows", resets to factory settings.

            So how do I factory reset the Windows 10 to a fresh Windows 10 if it gets ruined? Do I have to use an external device to back it up or will it re-install Windows 10 again as a fresh copy? If I upgrade for free I expect to be able to KEEP the upgrade even
 if the computer malfunctions. If not, then where do I go to replace my FREE Windows 10 upgrade when it gets ruined? I'm not going to pay for another copy when I already have gotten it for free and Microsoft says it's free for LIFE.

            <p>Hello Martmcd, nice to run across you again.<br />
<br />
Obviously, now that Windows 10 RTM is out, I/we are no longer "seeing through the glass darkly" as we were in our previous discussions in mid June under:<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/windows-10-to-windows-81-downgrade/a66b8125-15b7-4929-b850-af17ad7e197a<br />
&amp;<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_upgrade/questions-re-recimg-cmd-reset-and-refresh-now/1c98d530-6d9a-44ba-ac56-399a8025ffe8<br />
</p>
<p>and we now know what the Recovery Page looks like and the options it allows for OEMs that followed the upgrade path through either Windows Update or the upgrade through the Windows 10 MCT.<br />
<br />
Getting back to the OP's questions and some of the ensuing comments/questions:<br />
<br />
A.) Assuming we are only talking about pre-installed OS by OEMs, I see several options for returning to the original "factory default":<br />
<br />
1. Use the recovery media supplied by the manufacturer or the recovery media the user created using the manufacturers recovery tools.<br />
<br />
2. If #1 not available, then, if had Win 8/8.1, could select the "return to your previous version" option in Win 10 Recovery. Once on the previous version, could then go to it's&nbsp; Recovery Page and use the "Reset" option which returns to factory default. OR
 use the the instructions supplied by the manufacturer to re-install from the hidden partition.<br />
<br />
3. If for some reason, neither of the above are available, this will not give one a "factory default" but would give a fresh OS. User could download ISO of Windows 8/8.1 from Microsoft, but as I understand Windows 7 ISOs are no longer available from Microsoft,
 or borrow a friends installation media and use them to re-install, making sure they use the version that matches their pre-installed version. This MAY OR MAY NOT work as OEM keys are usually not accepted.<br />
<br />
B.) If the OP did not mean "factory default" but rather meant return to original version, then he has that option on the Recovery Page, or to use your favorite and BEST method of using a "System Image" to go back.<br />
<br />
C.) If he meant being able to have a fresh Windows 10:<br />
<br />
1. Using the "Reset" on the Recovery page will preform this function giving the option to keep or not keep personal files.<br />
<br />
2. Use the "System Image" that you strongly advocate, that should have been made immediately upon upgrading, that will have all files, apps, etc.<br />
<br />
3. As you have suggested, make use of the MCT to fresh install directly or from the ISO that one may have created from the MCT, which will recreate the same original image as given through the upgrade.<br />
<br />
Hopefully one has, again as you strongly advise, backed up EVERYTHING, "(installed programs etc) ... The installation files for the programs and any keys required" making it easier to bring themselves back to the way they want.<br />
<br />
We have several givens:<br />
<br />
We know "C" is good for whatever is to be determined as the meaning of the phrase "for the supported life of the device" as are the recovery methods.<br />
<br />
We know that once a genuine, qualifying Win 7 SP1 or Win 8.1 is upgraded through either upgrade path, or even a genuine Win 8 through the MCT, that it is a "free upgrade to Windows 10" as long as we accept the offer anytime during the "free" period of 1 year
 and that we have the "rights" to use it on the "foot-printed device" ANYTIME IN THE FUTURE as long as we are within "the supported life of the device" timeline, even after "rolling back" or selecting "go back to your previous version of Windows".<br />
<br />
What I believe is unknown is exactly at what point does our previous License, whether OEM or Retail, "morph", for lack of a better term, into a permanent Windows 10 License, negating the rights to usage of the License from which the upgrade was made?<br />
<br />
I haven't found anything that addresses this in particular, but logic leads me to assume that the point would be the end of the "month after you upgrade to Windows 10" as stated under the "go back to your previous version of Widows" on the Recovery page. Furthermore,
 the "windows.old" folder containing the previous OS, only has a shelf life of 28 days before it automatically disappears. Also lending credence to my assumption is what happened when Windows 8 first came out. Genuine Windows XP/Vista/7 owners were offered
 a chance to obtain an upgrade to a Windows 8 License at an extremely discounted price for a limited period of time. If they did not care for it, they had the option to return it, as long as they met some return qualifications and retain their WIN XP/Vista/7
 License rights. If they decided to keep it, they then had Windows 8 License rights and their Win XP/Vista/7 License rights were negated. And of course, there is Microsoft's stated intention of migrating as many users as possible to Windows 10 and keep them
 there, which they could not count on if they allowed &nbsp;"rolling back" for more than just a limited time.<br />
<br />
Do you have any input on that or have you seen or found anything through official channels to support or disagree with my assumption?<br />
<br />
A long way of saying that if I were one who wanted to downgrade back to my previous OS, I would do it within the "month after you upgrade to Windows 10" in order to make sure I still had a genuine, legal, and still activated, previous OS.<br />
<br />
As an aside and off topic, I did join the "Insiders Program" and took your warnings, disclaimers, and advice seriously. Boy did I receive an education! A good education. I wanted to put the preview on my old spare Vista, but didn't want have the hassle of re-installing
 Vista if something went wrong, or if I opt out of the program, or when the build or program expired. I decided a VM would be the way to go. I read many articles, educating myself about VMs. One article pointed out that my processor had to have virtualization
 enabled. I found mine wasn't and found it was not an option for my chip. I had heard about dual booting. so I educated myself about that as well as partitioning a drive. I downloaded the ISO for Build 10162. I now have th1_st1 10240 Pro as a dual boot along
 with Vista.<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for all your advise and help, I was still an infant when we last had a discussion, I now feel I'm almost ready to enter Middle School. :&gt;)</p>

<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: Apparently my assumption above is wrong and my information concerning the Windows 7 License being negated by the discounted upgrade to Windows 8 License was completely incorrect. Oh well, at least I have proven half of the "assume" theory, I made
 an **** of myself. :&gt;(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pertinent post found in another thread in response to someone, not me, stating "Yes, but you can only revert back in 1 month after upgrading".</p>
<p>

<br />
One can always revert to the prior qualifying o/s. &nbsp;The one month window applies to an upgraded Windows 10 device's ability to use the saved prior o/s files and recovery feature retained and available respectively for 30 days after upgrading. The saved prior
 o/s files are automatically purged after 30 days.<br />
<br />
The above does not, nor has it ever like in past o/s upgrades, preempt the ability to use personally created recovery media, restoration disks created per the OEM pc provider instructions, imaging software (3rd Party), or the backup image created on the prior
 o/s using the Windows included Backup/Restore/System Image features.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
i.e. thus it is important to understand the difference and also when commenting about reverting to a prior o/s differentiate amongst the limited and alternative options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 2: Ignore "and my information concerning the Windows 7 License being negated by the discounted upgrade to Windows 8 License was completely incorrect." under "UPDATE". My original assertion was correct as evidenced by the following contained in the
 EULA for retail Windows 8:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The software covered by this agreement is an upgrade to your existing operating system software, so the upgrade replaces the original software that you are upgrading. You do not retain any rights to the original software after you have upgraded and you
 may not continue to use it or transfer it in any way. This agreement governs your rights to use the upgrade software and replaces the agreement for the software from which you upgraded."</p>

<p>Use a Disk Imaging program.</p>
<p>I recommend <a href="http://clonezilla.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Clonezilla</a> - I use it to take disk images of Windows 8, 8.1 and 10, and Linux, using the same software.</p>
<p>It's free, and it means you can replace an OS in about 20 minutes, exactly how you left it.</p>

            <p>Hello Mike, nice to know that you are now an expert in virtual machines / dual booting.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I believe is unknown is exactly at what point does our previous License, whether OEM or Retail, "morph", for lack of a better term, into a permanent Windows 10 License, negating the rights to usage of the License from which the upgrade was made?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I haven't found anything that addresses this in particular, but logic leads me to assume that the point would be the end of the "month after you upgrade to Windows 10" as stated under the "go back to your previous version of Widows" on the Recovery

<p>
</p><p>I have not seen anything from Microsoft that would clarify this, however I am not really surprised, Microsoft want people to stay with windows 10 and if you haven't decided to roll back within a month you probably wont.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 'assumption' differs from yours in as far I expect to be able to reactivate the previous OS (instead of windows 10) on the same machine whenever I want, whether that is from original installation media, recovery drive or disk image, even if that is in
 2 years time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>on a slightly disjointed note, I had a problem upgrading a brand new acer laptop (upgrade worked, windows 10 didn't, apps missing, drivers missing/claimed to be not available etc), I decided to try the Reset option to clean install and found the option to
 use the factory recovery partition to reset it to windows 8.1, worked fine back to how it was when it left Acer, with bloatware and everything. Subsequent upgrade went without issue everything works.</p>
<p>point is the recovery partition does still work and no mention of it only working for a limited time, it is just hidden. You will of course lose everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the only real question is, when you roll back (if after the 1 month) will it remain activated? I expect the answer is Yes. and you will be able to reinstall windows 10 if you wish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my assumption, nothing official.</p>
