<h2>            Pre-order outfit on Sea of Thieves</h2>
                    I pre-ordered Sea of Thieves a while back and I never got my pre-order outfit. I didn’t really care at first because I thought it was just a bug with the game. Is there anyway I can get it????

<h3> dalerodriques  say:</h3>
<h2>            FSX Activation</h2>
                    <p>For some reason, I fail to get an activation screen when I installed FSX on the Windows 10 platform. I have the discs and codes. I also need to install the Acceleration Pack. The discs worked flawlessly from earlier platforms and they are in pristine condition.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Presently, I can use the game for 30 minutes then it asks for me to activate the game but does not take me to an activation screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I activate by phone? I</p>
<p>If so, what's the number?</p>

            <p>You can try phone activation, however, since FSX is no longer supported, I believe that phone activation is all but non-existent. &nbsp; The only fix that is known at this stage is as follows. &nbsp; But be aware that this is not a guarantee, but worth a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First exit FSX completely and then follow these instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. &nbsp;Run Registry Editor (press Windows key + R and type &nbsp; regedit &nbsp; &nbsp;and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. &nbsp;Expand the following registry key (but be careful when adjusting values in the Registry)</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4d36e967-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. &nbsp;After you find the folder, double-click Upperfilters on the right side.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>4. Change the value from 0 to &nbsp; PartMgr &nbsp;(note, this is case sensitive) and delete any other word that may be next to it and click &nbsp;OK. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>5. &nbsp;Close Registry Editor and reboot Computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>6. &nbsp;Start FSX and check whether the Activation box comes up.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Hopefully, this may also be the solution when it comes time for you to install the Acceleration pack, but don't worry about that for now. &nbsp; Get your FSX activated (if possible), then go for a flight(s) to make sure everything
 is as it should be. &nbsp;Of course, you won't have SPs1 &amp; 2 installed, so there may be some graphical glitches in the Sim. &nbsp; But make sure that FSX works well (i.e. it looks okay and you can fly for more than 30 minutes) before you attempt installing Acceleration.</span><br />

<h2>            Windows 10 cut off the top &#40;sometimes the bottom&#41; of the screen.</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone!<br />
<br />
I have a problem with the Windows 10. It seems it cuts off the top of the screen when I put a window into fullscreen. Its really annoying and I know I can reset the video driver by a key, but its not a solution. I linked a picutre what happening. I have an
 AMD GPU (RX Vega56) and I installed all the latest drivers for the hardwares and all the Windows 10 updates. When this happen the top of the windows is not clickable, but when I click there and there is an Icon in the desktop there, or something behind it,
 that is opening. It is happening with the file explorer and the browser too.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />A temporary fix is to use the key combination Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />I think it resets the graphics driver. Note that your screens will go blank for a second.
<br />
<br />I recommended to update computer's drivers.
<br />
<br />
<br />Also I would suggest you to follow these Methods: 
<br />
<br />Method 1: Run the SFC.
<br />
<br />Follow the below steps:
<br />
<br />	1. Open Command Prompt.
<br />	2. Select “Run as Administrator”.
<br />	3. Type “sfc /scannow” without quotes and hit Enter.
<br />Now check for the issue.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Run the DISM Tool.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, I would have you run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.
<br />
<br />	1. Click on 'Start'.
<br />	2. Enter 'Command prompt' in the Search box.  
<br />	3. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command prompt, and then tap or click 'Run as administrator'. 
<br />	4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.
<br />
<br />Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it.
<br />
<br />Method 3:
<br />
<br />Type the following in a Windows PowerShell as Administrator:
<br />
<br />1.Launch PowerShell 
<br />2.Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3.Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />
<br />Restart your device.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope the information provided is useful. If the issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you.
<br />
<br />Angel.

<p>I didn't bother with the Medal of Honor purchase, but its nice they are still holding to it. &nbsp;I wonder if UBISOFT will do the same with the beta of Ghost Recon:FS for the people who bought Splinter Cell:C.</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope it is easy to join up in the "beta" for everyone else. &nbsp;I got a feeling they are confident in their product (enough to release 2 weeks before MW3) that if everyone tries the "beta" everyone will most likely love it &amp; purchase it.</p>
<p>_</p>
<p>I'll be sure to get all my COD friends on the beta with me to show them how it is done in BF.</p>

            <p>Most programs created for earlier versions of <span>
Windows</span> also work in this version of <span>Windows</span>, but some older programs might run poorly or not at all. If a program written for an earlier version of
<span>Windows</span> doesn't work correctly, you can try changing the compatibility settings for the program, either by using the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter or manually choosing compatibility settings.</p>
<p>If changing the compatibility settings doesn't fix the problem, you can go to the program manufacturer's website to see if there's an update for the program.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 will not install as it will not boot from the CD.</h2>
                    <div><i>Windows 7 install issues</i></div>
<div><br />
</div>
I'm trying to do a clean install of Windows 7 on a brand new hard drive after my old one died.&nbsp; I have checked BIOS and it's set to boot first from CD/DVD.&nbsp; When I put the DVD in the drive and start the computer I get to "Boot: CD/DVD" and no further.&nbsp; The
 DVD drive sounds like it's trying to read it and will speed up then slow down repeatedly.&nbsp; I'm not getting any errors and currently it just sits at "Boot: CD/DVD" and won't go any further.&nbsp; The BIOS sees the new hard drive as well as the DVD drive and I was
 able to boot using Linux.&nbsp; What can I do to get Windows 7 to install?<br />
<br />
Edit: I was originally trying to install the 32 bit version, I decided to try the 64 bit and had no problems with installing Windows 7.&nbsp; I don't know if the disc was faulty or if there was something else causing the problem.&nbsp; Either way the problem is now resolved.<br />

<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>﻿You need a DVD drive, a CD drive will not work.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you have another DVD drive available try using that drive in your computer instead.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you have another computer available try the Windows 7 disk using that computer and see if it can read the disk, or if the disk can't be read and is bad.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Also, if you bought the retail version of Windows 7 try putting in the other bit type disk of Windows 7 disk and see if that works properly.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you can't boot from the Windows 7 install disk, can your computer boot from other bootable disks?</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you're using the 64 bit disk - can your computer run 64 bit?</span></p>

<h2>            Error&#58; &#34;SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION STOP&#58; 0x0000003B </h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: Windows 7 Home Premium - SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION BSOD; may be related to video/screensaver</p>
<p>original title: Error: "SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION STOP: 0x0000003B (0x00000000C000001D, 0xFFFFF88000000000, 0xFFFFF8800BC38160, 0x0000000000000000)".</p>
<p>Hi.&nbsp; I've had Windows 7 Home Premium installed since mid-November, without many problems (except for one caused by my idiocy; I doubt it's related to this though).&nbsp; About 3 days ago, I rebooted my computer after it having been on for about 5 weeks.&nbsp; And
 that's when the trouble started.</p>
<p>First, a bit of background, and why I think the problem is related to video.&nbsp; Before the restart (and BSODs), a couple of months ago, my screensaver started freezing up.&nbsp; It's a screensaver promoting the features of this Acer computer, which is an Aspire
 5739G, and a little ways into it, it activates the webcam.&nbsp; That's the point at which it freezes.&nbsp; I had to Ctrl+Alt+Del out of it every time, and when I unlock the computer afterwards, both Acer Screen Saver and Acer Video Conference Manager give the "has
 stopped working" message.</p>
<p>Okay, so after that reboot, everything seemed fine...&nbsp; until I walked away from the computer for awhile (presumably enough time for the screensaver to start).&nbsp; As a rule, I always use WindowsButton+L to lock the computer when I walk away, taking me to the
 login screen.&nbsp; Well, when I came back, the login screen was still there, but when I logged back in, it was as if I was just logging in.&nbsp; While I can't prove it, per se, it's highly likely a BSOD occurred while I was away.&nbsp; And, I think, it was related to the
 screensaver.&nbsp; This happened a few more times over the next couple of days, until I decided to disable the screensaver yesterday.&nbsp; I then went to work (<strong>without</strong> locking the computer), and when I got home, the computer was just fine; it hadn't
 rebooted or anything.</p>
<p>However...&nbsp; after using the computer for a while again, I went away and <strong>
did </strong>lock the computer, and when I came back, the same issue described in the above paragraph occurred.&nbsp; I logged in, and less than a minute later, a BSOD occurred.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wasn't idle or anything; programs were just starting up when it happened.&nbsp; The error
 was SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION, and while I'm not completely certain of that number, I think it was 0x0000003b or something.</p>
<p>So, after that auto reboot, I logged in again, with no problems.&nbsp; After a while, I went into a Tinychat room... or at least attempted to.&nbsp; A BSOD occurred, of the same error and number as the previous, before the room loaded.&nbsp; When I logged back in, I went
 back to Tinychat.&nbsp; Same thing happened.</p>
<p>And that is everything as it occurred, to my memory, up until now.&nbsp; As for minidump files...&nbsp; The latest one it has is from 2 days ago, for whatever reason.&nbsp; Here are the past two:</p>
<p>http://www.mediafire.com/?x4erdtgcvs72n1f</p>
<p>http://www.mediafire.com/?w7lw4oiq2tl0ozp</p>
<p>I'd love to get this resolved ASAP.&nbsp; Thanks in advance!</p>

<div>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Update:</strong> </span>&nbsp; I plugged in my iPod Touch to charge it, and boom.&nbsp; BSOD.&nbsp; When it rebooted, I pressed the button on the iPod to make sure it was charging.&nbsp; Another BSOD.&nbsp; No new minidump files, still.&nbsp;
 And my iPod's button is basically the trigger to a loaded BSOD gun.&nbsp; I'm scared to disconnect it now, might get another BSOD.&nbsp; Sigh...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Update 2:</strong> </span>&nbsp; I tried to install an updated driver for my graphics card (NVIDIA GeForce GT130M), and before it finished, the ol' BSOD reared its ugly head.&nbsp; This happened multiple times.&nbsp; Good
 thing is, I got the exact details of the stop error:</p>
<p>STOP: 0x0000003B (0x00000000C000001D, 0xFFFFF88000000000, 0xFFFFF8800BC38160, 0x0000000000000000)</p>
<p>Still no new minidump files though.</p>

============================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong></p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video/display driver and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.<br />

    <title>Laptop keeps connecting to Telstra Air - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don-e  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop keeps connecting to Telstra Air</h2>
                    <p>Help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Telstra turned on the Telstra Air network, both my family laptops keep disconnecting from our home wifi &amp; connect up to the Telstra Air signal coming from next door. We are NOT Telstra customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have “forgetten” the Telstra Air hotspot many times, it is not in the list of known networks, but it still turns up in available connections and the laptop connects up. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Telstra basically said bad luck and sent me to Microsoft. I dont see why i should pay money to fix an issue Telstra has caused. We had no issues until Telstra air got turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have an Asus and a Dell both running Windows 10 and up to date. The WiFi troubleshooter cannot find any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea where to even look for a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any help anyone can provide! Thanks</p>

            Hi  Don-E
<br />
<br />If you see that network in your list of available networks and you untick 'Connect Automatically, does your PC still automatically connect to that network?
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command (replacing NwName with the exact name of that network) and then hit Enter
<br />
<br />netsh wlan delete profile name="NeName"
<br />
<br />Close Command prompt
<br />
<br />Does that network still appear in the list of available networks?

<p>Dave, thanks for the response!</p>
<p>I followed the instructions, but got the message</p>
<p>Profile “Fon WiFi” is not found on any interface.</p>
<p>Got the same message for Telstra Air</p>
<p>These are the network names as they appear in the list of WiFi connections if i click on the WFi icon in the bottom right of the screen. Could they have another name somewhere that I need to go looking for?</p>
<p>Had the same response on both laptops.</p>

<h2>            rome total war and barbarian invasion installed smoothly, run perfectly on xp, but not at all on windows 7</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>

<p>just bought rome total war and the expansion (barbarian invasion) today. &nbsp;i installed the game and expansion on my windows 7 laptop and my family computer which runs on windows xp. &nbsp;on my windows 7 laptop everything installed smoothly, but the game
 won't run at all...meaning i click on the desktop shortcut and nothing happens. &nbsp;the only way to open the game is by going to my computer, selecting the cd-drive, and then opening the romeTW.exe file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>however, doing this only gets me to the main menu of the game and this is where the real trouble starts. &nbsp;once there i click "play rome total war" or in case of the expansion pack "play barbarian invasion" which instead of leading to the game itself
 it just crashes me out of the menu and leaves me back at the desktop. &nbsp;</p>
<p>on the up side, i encountered NONE of these problems on my family's windows xp computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>i've tried making the game compatible with windows xp (service pack 2) which was recommended and i even gave windows xp (service pack 3) a shot, but neither made a difference. &nbsp;</p>
<p>i will now attempt to uninstall and install the game for a 3rd time and this time i'll try to install it under xp compatibility. &nbsp;if&nbsp;you could&nbsp;please leave a post instructing me on how to do so that would be immensely helpful</p>
<p>thanks</p>

You may be using a 64bit Windows 7 Operating System. Rome total war - barbarian invasion is not compatibile with Windows 7 64bit Operating System. However, it is compatible with a 32bit version. Click

    <title>permissions win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikey the magnificent  say:</h3>
<h2>            permissions win 10</h2>
                    <p>I initially installed Win 10 freeware and later purchased win 10 pro and installed it without problems.&nbsp; BUT then I discovered that I had 540 Meg of disk space consumed by "windows.old"&nbsp; Normally this would not be an issue except that&nbsp;the file was protected
 by "SYSTEM" permissions and I was helpless against it with simple administrator permissions.&nbsp; I also had issue with "Windows/system32/macromd/flash" which had permissions of "TrustedInstaller."&nbsp; Once again I as administrator could not work with this file because
 it had all of the extra permissions in the world... stuff I had never heard of.&nbsp; So what is a poor old user/administrator to do?&nbsp; I want that **** out of my system but who do I call?&nbsp; Ghostbusters?&nbsp; I need help cleaning this stuff out of my system.&nbsp; Is there
 a person who can do it?&nbsp; And why are there permissions that the administrator cannot change or eliminate... is this coded in China like Norton and Apple?&nbsp; Help ya'll</p>

<p>This is pure bravo sierra!&nbsp; I have been trying to recover 450 meg of disk space for over a month.&nbsp; Sorry but your answer to the problem is nfg.&nbsp; How is it that some faceless human can control my systems by using permissions that I cannot control! This is
 worse than big brotherism.&nbsp; Why does System and TrustedInstaller have such powerful permissions that any hacker can use them to control my system?&nbsp; And trust me the hacking community knows that these permissions are there for their use. &nbsp;So how do I free up
 disk space?&nbsp; It has been more than 30 days now and Windows.old is still there...Please help me....</p>

</p><p>The windows.old is still there and cleanup does not work.&nbsp; Furthermore I am the owner of my system not some faceless human somewhere on the planet. I do not like people having permissions above GOD and capable of capturing all of my data and my machine.&nbsp;
 Super users are not necessary.&nbsp; I ask someone, a human preferable, to delete Windows.old and remove super user "System" and "TustedInstaller" their permissions are so high that I would have to low level format to get rid of them so please help me not criticize
 me or talk down to me just resolve the issue.&nbsp; I have spent a lot of time talking to the Philippine technicians and am just fed up with them... how do I know they are from the Pi... I ask them.&nbsp; I lived there for a coupla years, hunted on Mt. Pinatubo and

    <title>The XIM Edge and LIVE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darkhaven3  say:</h3>
<h2>            The XIM Edge and LIVE</h2>
                    So hey. <br />
<br />
I've been playing around with the XIM Edge for a while now on my offline Xbox; got through The Demon King on SDLQuake, and I have to say this little gray box feels pretty great to use with my RAT 7 and Razer Lycosa. It's not quite one to one, but it makes me
 pretty comfortable with the idea of using an adaptor like this to get back into shooters on Live I suppose.
<br />
<br />
But there's the problem: where does the XIM Edge come into play with the Terms of Use and all that good jazz? Is using the XIM Edge on LIVE something I can reasonably do without expecting a ban, or should I stay away from using it with my online Xbox?

In short, it's an expensive peripheral that is doing nothing more than a Controller to begin with. It is a User's End Interface, not one of System Input.

<p>It is clearly a violation to use XIM as it gives the player an unfair advantage. &nbsp;If you want to play PC games, get the game on PC and play against those ppl. &nbsp;If you are going to play on Xbox, use the controller. &nbsp;Below was cut and pasted from the account

<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but if you can go into any department store and buy one, isn't it legal? I've seen Xbox 360 kb/m combos in store being sold in a handful of department stores, like Sams and Shopko.

<p>I don't see how it's unfair. Some people are good with controllers, some people are good with KB/M. Everyone should be able to use what's right for them. I tried to play some games on Steam with a controller and none of them would work with it. I can't use
 KB/M very well because I've (like most of you) trained my thumbs for controlling videogames.</p>

<p>"Utilizing unauthorized hardware". &nbsp;You can debate whether or not it should be legal all day long. &nbsp;The fact is, it is not legal and if they catch you, they will suspend or ban you. If you are so bad with the controller, you should return your Xbox and play
 a PC game. &nbsp;I have a BF3 server and I can instantly tell when someone is playing with XIM from their game play. &nbsp;I ban them from the server. &nbsp;As far as I am concerned it cheats everyone out of gaming on an even playing field. &nbsp;Oh, and I also report them to
 Dice and Microsoft. &nbsp;So game on...</p>

<p>There is where you're wrong. It says "unauthorized". If you can buy it in a store like SAMS or GameStop, it is authorized, just like how they sell some rapid fire controllers at GameStop. Now, I'm not sure what the XIM is, but I know I've seen kb&amp;m set ups
 for the 360 being sold in stores. That is authorized. </p>

<p>Just because it is sold in a store DOES NOT make it authorized. &nbsp;It must be authorized by Microsoft/Xbox. &nbsp;It is not! Look at the forums where ppl are getting banned.</p>

<p>The only reason to have consoles is because there are few games which are not available on PC.</p>
<p>Eg: RDR or GTA V.</p>
<p>Consoles sucks otherwise. I hope no one ever plays on your BF3 server.</p>
<p>Pc gaming is always better than some consoles.</p>

<h2>            Sporadic 100&#37; Disk Usage &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded from Windows 8.1 to 10 today and while almost everything has been going well, I've had a bit of a problem where disk usage will suddenly spike to 100% when doing things such as downloading games off of Steam and when loading certain programs
 like Google Chrome. It's especially prominent on bootup and for a good bit of time afterwards. I really have no idea what's going on with it and I don't want to downgrade back to 8.1 just yet. Any kind of help would be appreciated, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my specs if that helps any:</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 Home 64-bit</p>
<p>CPU: AMD A6-5200 APU 2 GHz</p>
<p>Video: AMD Radeon HD 8400</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My MS Lifecam Cinema stopped working. I have it for about 6 months and it worked fine. Since yesterday I only get black screen. I have installed the latest drivers and when I run Microsoft Lifecam software all I get is black screen but the blue LED on the
 camera is switches&nbsp;ON. I have then repeated the insatall procedure on my laptop that also runs Windows 7 and I got the same result: black screen. Is my webcam dead?</p>
<p>Thank you for your help</p>

            Hi elliott
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To find and remove duplicate files, you need to download and work through a third party utility. Microsoft Store provides several free apps to do the same and they are safe to download as they are from Microsoft Store. Few recommendations -
<br />
<br />Duplicate File Remover - <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH4SQNP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLG...</a>
<br />
<br />Duplicates Cleaner - <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PMXPZ18CZ49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PMXP...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.
