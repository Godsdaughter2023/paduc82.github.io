<h2>            my custom legacy domains.live.com email address hosted on outlook.com stopped working in outlook and android and ios</h2>
                    <p>I have many legacy emails from the time of domains.live.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of them stopped working in outlook and android and IOS using activesync m.outlook.com server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the others seem to work fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The one with an issue does work correctly in the web page of outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the password and enabling disabling 2 step authentication did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Access &#40;version 1808, build 10730.20304 Click-to-Run&#41; crashes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Access &#40;version 1808, build 10730.20304 Click-to-Run&#41; crashes when running&#47;editing&#47;creating any report in a file</h2>
                    <div>I have Microsoft Access (version 1808, build 10730.20304 Click-to-Run) installed on my machine.&nbsp; It is the latest in our ProPlus Semi-Annual subscription series.&nbsp; When I attempt to run a report or go into report design view in a particular file, it becomes
 non-responsive and has to be terminated with Task Manager.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Things I have tried:</div>
<div>1. Creating a new database and going to create a new report.&nbsp; This causes the crash described above.</div>
<div>2. Opening an existing database and going to run or create a new report.&nbsp; This causes the crash described above.</div>
<div>3. Installing 64 bit Access instead of 32 bit.&nbsp; The crash behavior is the same as described above, although task manager seems to terminate the application much more quickly in the 64 bit version.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also noteworthy:</div>
<div>1. I had build 1808 installed about two months ago.</div>
<div>
<p>2. I was able to open and edit reports in this file as recently as Friday last week.</p>
<p>3. Crashes have been happening since at least yesterday.<br />
4. I cannot think of any configuration changes I made to my system this week.<br />
5.&nbsp; The problem happens even when I open an older version of the file that was working last week.</p>
<p>6. The last release in our subscription (1807) is still installed on some other machines.&nbsp; It does not crash when viewing/editing reports in this file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I go about diagnosing and resolving this issue?</p>

            I believe my issue has been sorted out.&nbsp; I have been unable to install a newer graphics driver; however, in the course of trying to do so I learned that several recommended updates dating back a fewer years had not been install to my system.&nbsp; Once I installed
 all recommended updates, the performance issue disappeared.&nbsp; Updates in my organization should be automatic and pushed centrally, so it did not occur to me to check this sooner.

            Hi GPrice2728,<br />
<br />
Generally, you can right-click the Skype for Business icon in your taskbar and choose
<strong>Unpin from taskbar</strong> to do the trick.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi GPrice2728,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please share a screenshot showing the page when you right click the Skype for Business client in the taskbar.</p>
<p>Additionally, share your Skype for Business client version details and update it to the latest version to see if the issue persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I'd like to know whether this issue happens to other users in your organization. Try

            Could be a glitch, try reinstalling the app to see if it corrects the problem:
<br />
<br />Press Windows Key+X 
<br />Click Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />
<br />Enter the following command then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />  Open start menu
<br />    Type in "powershell" 
<br />    Right click on "Windows PowerShell"
<br />    Run as Administrator
<br />
<br />Then paste the following command
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage -AllUsers Microsoft.SkypeApp | foreach { Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml" }
<br />
<br />Press Enter
<br />
<br />After the install process finishes, you have the Windows 10 Skype app back

<p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of our users has no more storage space on his documents folder.</p>
<p>The Manage storage property shows that he has 1GB Storage on his Documents library. How can i increase that, because the are still 900 gb free, but not on his documents library?</p>
<p>Regards<br />

<p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>For the OneDrive for Business library, the storage metric is 1024 GB. To check the usage, you may follow the steps below:<br />
Let the user open his OneDrive for Business library&gt;Click the gear on the upper right corner and select
<strong>Site settings</strong>&gt;Under <strong>Site Collection Administration</strong>, click
<strong>Storage Metrics</strong>.</p>
<p>For the folders in the OneDrive for Business library, they may not be full until you run out the 1024 GB storage metrics. Here is an article for your reference:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Manage-your-OneDrive-for-Business-storage-31519161-059c-4764-b6f8-f5cd29f7fe68" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Manage your OneDrive for Business storage</a></p>
<p>Moreover, for further investigation, I'd like to collect the following information:<br />
1. For "The Manage storage property shows that he has 1GB Storage", you may share a screenshot of the symptom.<br />
2. You may share a screenshot of the user's OneDrive for Business <strong>Storage Metrics</strong> you checked above.</p>
<p>To upload screenshots, you can click <strong>Use rich formatting</strong> and then click the icon of
<strong>Insert/Edit Media.</strong></p>
<p>Please share updates when you have time.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi Felix</p>
<p>Sorry I was out of office for some days.</p>
<p>The storage metrics were ok, there was enough free storage. One problem was, that the folder path of one document was to long, so it couldn't be synchronized. The other "problem" was, that within the storage metrics the documents library showed about 99.58%,
 even if there where only 3gb within this folder. So the user thought that there is not enough storage. By resolving the document path problem everything works fine.</p>
<p>That leads me to another question:</p>
<p>Why does the documents library always show 99.x%? That was the same for another user with only 300mb within the documents library. This is a little confusing for end users.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Peter</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are facing. We will help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better, I suggest you to answer the below questions.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are you using Office Outlook, if yes which version are you using?</li><li>Are you accessing the account through browser or through Outlook Mail App?</li></ol>
<p>You should regularly backup the content that you store on the services. Having a regular backup plan and following it can help you prevent loss of your content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have lost the emails in Inbox Folder then I suggest you to refer the below link and check if it helps you recover the emails.</p>
<p>You may have to select one by one which is important for you to restore and recover from the deleted mails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook.com will recover as many messages as possible and put them in your <strong>
Deleted</strong> folder. When they're back in your <strong>Deleted</strong> folder, move the important ones back to your inbox or other personal folder because the

<h2>            Excel - VBA Dim</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been learning VBA code not for too long and I am getting used to the terminology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I find confusing is where we store a variable after Dim</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me tell you what I understand so far.&nbsp; We store a variable and then ask Excel to retrieve this variable so we can do something with it.&nbsp; &nbsp;There are a few variables to do with amount of memory it can hold.&nbsp; There is integer for numbers? and string for
 text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is as much as I know.&nbsp; Can I ask someone to explain how we are suppose to use these variables.&nbsp; Please can I ask you to go a bit slow as I find this part of VBA a bit confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Zia</p>

            I am not sure what is your specific question but this should be the first area which you should master. There are a lot of good literature on internet.  I just googled and I believe this should provide you a start.
<br />
<br />If you have specific question, do ask.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>VBA does not require variable declaration, it will automatically assign variables as type variant when needed. But this approach has certain risks. Say, I have following statement:</p>
<p>
</p><p>JP_Ronse = 1</p>
<p>JPRonse=JP_Ronse+1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, VBA will know 2 variables namely&nbsp;<span>JP_Ronse (1) &amp;&nbsp;</span><span>JPRonse (2) where you may have expected&nbsp;</span><span>JP_Ronse = 2.</span></p>
<p><span>It is good practice to use Option Explict in each module, you can set this in the VBA options.</span></p>
<p>This option requires explicit declaration of each variable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option Explicit</p>
<p>Dim JP_Ronse</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">JP_Ronse = 1</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">JPRonse=JP_Ronse+1</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The debugger will now pop-up a warning that JPRonse is not declared.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It is also a good approach to use early binding. Early binding means that you also define the type of the variable at the declaration level.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dim JP_Ronse as Integer</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">JP_Ronse="s"</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Will pop-up a type mismatch warning because "s" is not an integer.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If I had wrote:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Dim JP_Ronse</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">JP_Ronse="s"</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It would have been accepted because it was declared as a Variant. But it can cause issues in your further code when you expect to have an integer value and face a string.</p>

</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">While debugging, you know immediately at which level it was declared.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Early binding can also significantly speed-up the execution of the code because the memory to read depends on the type. An integer is f.i. only 2 bytes.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Nothing wrong with it but it implies that VBA at the declartion level doesn't know what type of object you have in mind. You have to define it in the statement CreateObject.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But even then after defining it is the Outlook object, VBA will not assist you in the methods and properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<h2>            Windows Media player issue</h2>
                    I have an o2 xda atom exec running wm 5. Whenever I turn the phone off, windows media player ceases to operate. Both soft and 'hard' resets prove futile, being annoying as i cant use it to listen to music on plane flights. Is there any obvious solution?<br />

            I'm surprised that the Hard Reset didn't cure the issue.&nbsp; After a Hard Reset, you had to reinstall anything you had&nbsp; previously loaded ... coeerct?&nbsp; I'm just asking to verify that a hard reset did really occur.

<p>I think this is a default behavior. You should switch off the screen instead to keep the music playing. I downloaded a nice utility that lets me shutdown, restart and switch off the screen on my device. I blogged
 about it some time ago - <a href="http://pocketpcmauritius.blogspot.com/2006/10/psshutxp-turn-off-display-off-and.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://pocketpcmauritius.blogspot.com/2006/10/psshutxp-turn-off-display-off-and.html</a>. After you install&nbsp;it, make sure you run the software and check the Today icon. This will put a shortcut in the system tray on the Today screen.</p>

    <title>WMDC Errors, Now Canot Uninstall WMDC Driver Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rpatchet  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMDC Errors, Now Canot Uninstall WMDC Driver Update</h2>
                    I have a laptop with Vista Home Premium SP2. I have a T-Mobile (HTC) Wing with Windows Mobile 6.0.<br />
<br />
My WMDC suddenly stopped working after installing the WMDC Driver Update. When I connect my phone WMDC tries to connect and then gives a red X with the informative message "Error" and no path for more information. My phone reports and error number of 666 but
 have found no thread talking about that. I have read many threads on many forums. Most suggest removing WMDC, WMDC Driver Update, all sync profiles on PC and phone, remove the device from Device Manager.<br />
<br />
I successfully uninstalled WMDC through Programs and Features. I successfully removed all sync profiles from PC and phone. I successfully removed the device and driver from Portable Devices in Device Manager.<br />
<br />
I cannot uninstall WMDC Driver Update. When I click Uninstall in Programs and Features, it fills the progress bar once as it "configures", fills a second time as it tries to uninstall, then backs down the fill and ends! No unistallation!<br />
<br />
How do I remove WMDC Driver Update so I can try to reinstall the whole mess from scratch?

            I tried removing the Update first, it would not uninstall. I tried removing WMDC first, the Update would not uninstall. I tried reinstalling what I could, the Update would not uninstall.<br />
<br />
I read on another forum that an undcumented service must be stopped in order to remove the update. I figured if it was a service, booting to safe mode should solve the problem. It did. Once in safe mode I could remove the update. I have not had time to try
 reinstalling WMDC to see if that solves my original problem of not being able to sync.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Currently, when I right-click in a room calendar, the "New meeting request" is grey and not accessible.</p>

            That's not the proper way to book meetings - they should add the meeting room to a meeting as a resource - the resource can be configured to auto-accept the meeting. 
<br />
<br />If you use Exchange 2013 or 2016, direct booking may be blocked. If its not blocked at the server level, users read/write permissions on the calendar (keep in mind this also means they can delete meetings to free up space for their own).

            <p>Depends on what you want.</p>
<p>For standard and public releases you have to get the upgrade advisory app (from the store on your phone) and update your phone with that app.</p>
<p>That is the normal procedure for upgrading to windows 10 mobile.</p>
<p>For insider builds, sign in&nbsp;at the insider program, select&nbsp;which ring you&nbsp;want to test (slow. fast, Production&nbsp;preview) and&nbsp;get the build by using the update options under settings.</p>

<p><span>Hello
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Skype Community forum</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is correct that there is no option to manage your chat history from Skype for Web. However, if you do download the Skype application on your device, for Windows or Mac, your
 messages will be synchronized there and then saved locally on the device as well.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the links below for steps on how to manage your conversation history:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>

</a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also in Skype, conversation history are only stored for 30 days in the cloud, this is for synchronizing it in our servers so that you can access it even on other device using
 the same account.</span></p>

                    I closed OneNote to update the app on my Mac and when I opened it back up all my notes from the past month are missing from my notebook. The notebook still has all the tabs labeled in it but no notes in the section. My notebook is supposed to automatically
 sync with OneDrive. I checked on OneDrive and the sections of my notebook are empty there too. Is there anyway I can recover these notes?

            Hi Sammurphy11,<br />
<br />
OneNote 2016 for Mac lets you recover single pages or entire sections of notes that you have recently deleted. While viewing recently deleted notes, you can restore their pages or sections by moving them back to their original notebook or to another location
 you want.<br />
<br />
OneNote keeps deleted notes for a period of 60 days, after which they are permanently erased.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To view recently deleted notes, in any notebook, do the following:<br />
<br />
1. On the View tab, click the small arrow next to the Deleted Notes button, and then click View Deleted Notes.<br />
2. In the Deleted Notes view, click the tab of the deleted page or section that you want to look at.<br />
3. When done, exit this view by clicking the curved arrow that appears just to the right of the Deleted Notes section label.<br />
<br />
Restore recently deleted notes&nbsp;<br />
<br />
While viewing any page or section in the Deleted Notes view, do the following:<br />
1. Control-click the tab of the page or section that you want to restore.<br />
2. On the menu that appears, click Restore To.<br />
3. Select the destination where you want to move the deleted notes, and then click Restore.<br />
<br />
Note: When you restore a single page of notes from the Deleted Notes view, it is moved to the section in the notebook you choose. If you restore an entire section, it will be moved to the notebook you choose, along with all of the previously deleted pages in
 that section.<br />
<br />
If the pages are not in recent deleted pages list and not be synced to OneDrive, they may be deleted permanently and we can’t restore.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Shirley&nbsp;

            <p>I copied your code block onto a Excel2010x32 Win7x64, and set the two ranges equal to two sheet ranges of 10 cells each, with rand() in each cell. I didn't get any errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it gives you that error, I suggest going to the immediate window and using debug.print to grab as much information as you can;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>debug.print app.name</p>
<p>debug.print r.address</p>
<p>debug.print r.value</p>
<p>debug.print rSubtrahend.address</p>
<p>debug.print dMin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and see if you get any unexpected values.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or, just for troubleshooting, break out the components of that line:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Each r In rMinuends</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rval = r.value</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rSubSum = application.Sum(rSubtrahend)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'I'm not sure why you need&nbsp;to app.sum r.value, if it is a single cell isn't that&nbsp;the same as r.value?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AbsValue = Abs(rval-rSubSum)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>If AbsValue &lt; dMin Then<br />
</strong></p>
<p>That way, you may be able to narrow down where the problem is.</p>

            I guess the issue is somewhere in the outside world, e.g. the given range objects contains non numerical values (errors, strings, etc.) or merged cells or something like that.<br />
<br />
BTW, your function is very slow, did not cover any error situations and using Application.Sum is superfluous.<br />
<br />
To find the closest value to a given set of values use a formula like this:<br />
&nbsp; {=INDEX(A1:A1000,MATCH(SMALL(ABS(A1:A1000-$B$1),1),ABS(A1:A1000-$B$1),0))}<br />
Where the list of values is in A1:A1000 and the value to search for is in B1. <br />
<br />
I assume the scenario that column A contains the numbers from 1 to 1000 and B1 the value 512.5 The formula needs 0.00132 seconds to calculate.<br />
<br />
Your UDF =udf_Min_Abs_Diff(A1:A1000,B1) needs 0.04846, that is a significant difference.<br />
<br />
A more safe but similar UDF looks like this:<br />
<br />
Function ClosestR(ByVal Where As Range, ByVal What) As Variant<br />
&nbsp; 'Returns the value from Where that is closest to What<br />
&nbsp; Const MaxDouble = 1.79769313486231E+308<br />
&nbsp; Dim Diff As Double, Min As Double<br />
&nbsp; Dim R As Range<br />
&nbsp; 'Be sure What is a number<br />
&nbsp; If Not IsNumeric(What) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ClosestR = CVErr(xlErrNum)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Function<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; 'Convert a range object to double<br />
&nbsp; What = CDbl(What)<br />
&nbsp; 'Assume failure<br />
&nbsp; ClosestR = CVErr(xlErrNA)<br />
&nbsp; 'Compare each<br />
&nbsp; Min = MaxDouble<br />
&nbsp; For Each R In Where<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If IsNumeric(R.Value) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Calculate the difference<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diff = Abs(R.Value - What)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Diff &lt;= Min Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ClosestR = R.Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Min = Diff<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; Next<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
That UDF needs 0.01477 seconds, 4 times faster then yours, but 10 times slower as the formula.<br />
<br />
We can speed up the code if we use an array instead of the range object:<br />
<br />
Function ClosestA(ByVal Where As Range, ByVal What) As Variant<br />
&nbsp; 'Returns the value from Where that is closest to What<br />
&nbsp; Const MaxDouble = 1.79769313486231E+308<br />
&nbsp; Dim Diff As Double, Min As Double<br />
&nbsp; Dim Data<br />
&nbsp; Dim i As Long, j As Long<br />
&nbsp; 'Be sure What is a number<br />
&nbsp; If Not IsNumeric(What) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ClosestA = CVErr(xlErrNum)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Function<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; 'Convert a range object to double<br />
&nbsp; What = CDbl(What)<br />
&nbsp; 'Read in all values<br />
&nbsp; Data = Where.Value<br />
&nbsp; 'Only one value?<br />
&nbsp; If Not IsArray(Data) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ClosestA = Data<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Function<br />
&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp; 'Assume failure<br />
&nbsp; ClosestA = CVErr(xlErrNA)<br />
&nbsp; 'Compare each<br />
&nbsp; Min = MaxDouble<br />
&nbsp; For j = LBound(Data, 2) To UBound(Data, 2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For i = LBound(Data) To UBound(Data)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Be sure we compare numbers only<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If IsNumeric(Data(i, j)) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Calculate the difference<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Diff = Abs(Data(i, j) - What)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Diff &lt;= Min Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ClosestA = Data(i, j)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Min = Diff<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next<br />
&nbsp; Next<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
That UDF needs 0.00148 seconds, nearly the same speed as the formula. Keep this results in mind before you develop other UDF's.
<br />
<br />
BTW, this a good example that a larger code can execute faster then a shorter one, not what the most people would expect.<br />

            <p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used debug.print in the intermediate window and had an error number below</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>debug.print app.name =&gt; 424</p>
<p>debug.print r.address =&gt; 424</p>
<p>debug.print r.value =&gt; 424</p>
<p>debug.print rSubtrahend.address =&gt; 424</p>
<p>debug.print dMin ==&gt; ok</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have one more question. In the original code that I posted yesterday, I don't understand what it means by
<strong>dMin = 1E + 99. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got this whole code from one of MVP in this website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For one note, I inserted this code ahead of other code.&nbsp;So they are in the same modue with&nbsp;a dividing line.&nbsp;I am not sure whether this is causing a problem.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The intent of dMin is to set it equal to a very large number, so that in your loop any new evaluation of
</p>
<p><strong>Abs(app.Sum(r.Value) - app.Sum(rSubtrahend)) </strong></p>
<p>will certainly be below the original dMin value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1E+99 is scientific notation, but you might want to go with Andreas' suggestion of
</p>
<p>1.79769313486231E+308</p>
<p>as that should be an even larger value (whether that matters for your data depends on the size of the values you are calculating)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for all the 424 errors, I don't have an explanation for that, it would probably require seeing your workbook to give a specific answer. I would suggest looking at Andreas' overall solution, or if you want to stay as simple as possible, break up the line
 that is erroring into smaller component lines, as I show in my first response- then you might be able to at least identify one problem at a time.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, use the smallest source range(s) possible where you can recreate the issue. If you can post just a few cells of data that we can paste into Excel and replicate your error, then it will be easier to help figure out what is being passed in the range
 (or /as/ a range) that the macro doesn't like.</p>

<h2>            Unable to deactivate DirSync</h2>
                    
<p>G'day!<br />
<br />
I'm encountering an issue where I'm unable to deactivate DirSync. I'm needing to turn it off so I can perform a cut-over migration for exchange, after which I'll be planning to switch it back on again.<br />
<br />
I'm attempting to switch it off through Powershell, using the command:<br />
Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled -EnableDirSync $false<br />
<br />
However, this is just giving me the following error message:</p>
<p>Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled : You cannot turn off Active Directory synchronization.<br />
At line:1 char:1<br />
+ Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled -EnableDirSync $false<br />
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
+ CategoryInfo : OperationStopped: (:) [Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled],<br />

+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : Microsoft.Online.Administration.Automation.DirSy<br />
ncStatusChangeNotAllowedException,Microsoft.Online.Administration.Automati<br />
on.SetDirSyncEnabled<br />
<br />
<br />
I have used this command successfully in the past, so not sure what is wrong here.<br />
<br />
Any insight would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Thanks<br />

<h2>            Office 2008 opens multiple files at startup with Lion</h2>
                    Since I installed Lion I've had a problem with Office 2008 that I can't find a reference to in any of the recent announcements or discussions about compatibility problems.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The issue is that when Excel or Word start they open multiple files that have been open in previous sessions. The problem is getting worse with cumulatively more files being opened. I found reference to this problem in Office for Windows but no reference
 for Office 2008 for Mac. Can anyone offer a solution?

 which has a fuller description of the possible solutions to this problem. I don't need any programs to restart the way I left them so I've tried turning off the feature for all programs in the General System preferences which again seems to have worked but
 time will tell.
<div><br />
<div>For those who want to try the solution for individual programs and can no longer like me find the username/library folder see this page&nbsp;http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/909/cpsid_90947.html which explains how to make the library visible again, Apple have decided
 to hide it for some reason.<br />

In case like me you try the solution for all programs please note it doesn't work the first time you use the program after changing the general system preference setting but after you open and close the program once it works from then on. Actually doing this
 deletes the individual program folders that were created in the&nbsp;/username/Library/Saved Application State/ &nbsp;folder.

    <title>Upgraded from 7 to 10... then downgraded right back again - here&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jinkies  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgraded from 7 to 10... then downgraded right back again - here&#39;s why</h2>
                    <p>So I did the Windows Update upgrade to Win10 from Win7 then rolled it back to Win7 about 8 hours later and thought I'd share why in case anyone is thinking of doing an in-place upgrade or in case anyone from Microsoft is reading this forum and wants feedback.
 I'm aware that this is a TP with unfinished components so perhaps MS will choose to change some of these by the time of final release, but I'm noting the problems here anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an extremely tiny company where I am both IT and end user, meaning I have enough tech savvy to setup and maintain my own server and server products but also behave just like any other end-user when it comes to using my PC and getting my work done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMHO, Win10 is a total failure. I'd divide end-users into two basic groups: people who like to understand the operating system well enough to customize it exactly to their liking and people who couldn't care less about customizing and just want it to work
 the way it always has. Win10 does neither. Here's my experience:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The awful mashup between Metro and desktop that MS got slammed for with Win8 is still, shockingly, present. Like all those nice new Live Tiles but want them on your Desktop - you know, the place they'd be most useful? Forget it. For some bizarre reason,
 MS has decided that the place people want their Live Tiles isn't right in front of their faces but, rather, in the Start menu. Flat-out weird. Personally, I still use the Sidebar (despite the fact that MS discontinued it for security reasons) because having
 bits of information such as upcoming appointments, unfinished tasks, etc. always accessible without having to minimize down to the desktop is incredibly convenient for me. I was hoping MS was going to replace the Sidebar with more secure Live Tiles. Nope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you're a customizer, forget it because, while there are all these shiny new toys, they are locked down and useable only MS's way and no other way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're the other type of person, well, good luck, because MS has decided that the best thing is for you to toss out 20 years experience with knowing how to use its operating system and learn something completely new. Used to doing things the old way?
 Too bad. Aren't computer savvy or don't have the time or interest in learning a new way? Too bad. Oh you want your Start menu to look like the Win7 Start menu? You have to download a 3rd party app for that. Why, after the Windows 8 debacle, MS decided that
 shoving a new UI down the throats of people who had zero interest in learning a new UI was a good idea is beyond me. The worst part is that the new UI bears just enough resemblance to the old UI to be completely confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me, this is the weirdest part of MS's strategy. Basically, it has an entrenched userbase primarily because most companies aren't really interested in change because they're not interested in retraining people and don't want to get a million calls and
 people not liking the colors of the look or whatnot. Win7 looked an awful lot like WinXP and functioned similarly enough that a user could jump in with little to no training and go directly to work. Not so with Win10. MS if you're reading: create a skin that
 looks and functions exactly like Win7 and offer that as an option to those who want to get to work immediately and will explore the new functionality down the road at their leisure (instead of the way things are now where MS just jams the new UI down user's
 throats and too bad).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this lack of integration between Metro and desktop, this terrible UI that seems to be designed by different groups and that functions in different ways precisely what MS has been slammed for for the past few years? Did they hear nothing their critics
 said or do they somehow think that by calling this awful, unintegrated OS "Win10" instead of "Win8" that people will now think it's awesome?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. On what planet does any business person want to tie themselves to and MS account? I have multiple Exchange accounts plus some IMAP access to Google; I don't want or need an MS account, and I certainly under no circumstances want it to ever replace my
 Windows logon. However, if you want to use an of the Live Tiles such as Calendar or Mail, you MUST have an MS account first which then proceeds to replace your Windows logon everywhere with absolutely no way to disable or revert it (or at least I couldn't
 find it quickly on Google). I'm running a small office here. I don't want new MS account. I don't want MS involved in my business other than the areas I choose, like my OS for instance. It's unimaginable to me that any business of any size will want to upgrade
 to something that forces all of their employees to create new accounts. Who would want that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Windows Update automatically reboots without warning. Yep, it doesn't care what you're doing. MS has decided that the only thing that matters is rebooting your computer and screw your work or (in my case) your 35gig file transfer that was almost done
 or whatever the user is up to; MS has decided that the computer will reboot and tough luck for the user who's getting work done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm aware this is a TP but, given that it's a TP that allows for an in-place upgrade (meaning MS wants bleeding-edge end-users to test try it out on their systems), this behavior is unacceptable. It is never okay to reboot a computer without a user's approval.
 MS tries to get around this by allowing you to schedule a time - as if anyone is going to remember the time they scheduled the reboot. And what if your boss emails you with something urgent 5 minutes before the reboot you've forgotten about and you're frantically
 trying to get it done when, boom, reboot. This is seriously atrocious behavior and, actually, is the thing that made me roll it back to Win7. I have no intention of scheduling my life around MS Windows Update when, in fact, MS Windows Update should actually
 be scheduling itself around me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there you have it. This was a huge disappointment to me as there are some features in Win10 that I was interested, but no dice. I don't want to learn a new OS and I certainly don't want to learn one where, at the end of it, I can't even customize it the
 way I like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, the rollback to Win7 (which you can access on reboot) worked almost flawlessly, though my startup programs were messed up for some reason, so, if you're like me and want to test it but turn out to hate it, you can get your Win7 back no prob (though
 remove the Win10 KB from your updates or you'll keep getting the nag to install it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My verdict: Win7 is a winner.</p>

            <p>That reboot behaviour is a definite deal breaker.&nbsp; Not that I doubt the post, but I am trying to get confirmation on that right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, good post up there, <strong><em>jinkies</em></strong>.&nbsp; Microsoft folks ought to be showing some appreciation for your effort.&nbsp; Right here would be a good place for a Microsoft employee to offer a thank you.</p>

            <p>Reboots after Update: Sometimes it does it by it self and at others it gives a schedule.</p>
<p>Lately for me it has been set at 10 PM but there are spaces so you can change the time.</p>
<p>Also it maybe something in the Settings because not all of my 6 laptops that I am using for testing did the automatic reboot.</p>
<p>I found it!!!!&nbsp; There is the ability to schedule the install of the update even though the download is automatic.&nbsp; This is under Advanced Options.&nbsp; Instead of "Automatic" you can set it to "Notify to schedule restart"&nbsp; under "Choose how updated are installed:"</p>

            <p>That sounds interesting, but to take this a step back, the actual updates are still installed in some sort of auto manner?&nbsp; In other words, we can't pick and choose which updates we want?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT</strong>:&nbsp; I was just looking at a screenshot over in the thread where I asked about this,
<em>Lawrence</em>, and I am afraid that the "Notify to schedule restart" doesn't seem to have a choice of just that.&nbsp; You know, the restart won't happen until you tell it to WITHOUT a previously scheduled time set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you explain what you view as being the way we control the restart APART from a schedule set up in advance?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I, for one, can certainly appreciate the views you expressed. All the ****, er, APPS, tiles (alive, whatever that means, and dead), cartuna, etc, etc are a bunch of unneeded foolishness that are out of place, whether in business, or any other place where
 common sense use of computing is needed/desired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am stringing along with this win 10 development thing because I have the hope that, under all the ****, there will be developed an OS of some value. But, I have no bets riding on that outcome ... I can go back to 7 or 8.1 in a few minutes whenever I see
 that there's no reasonable hope left for value in the finished OS. </p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, the OS is doing a pretty good job for me (with the crapware removed or disabled); however, in my thinking, one shouldn't need to spend a lot of time cleaning out crapware ... he should be able to just install the programs that he wants use,
 period. Then, if it's for a business with many computer stations, he can image that for as many installations as he might need.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me make clear that I don't intend to sit at my desk talking to some digital advertising agent to operate my computer; further, when I turn on my computer, I still see the same desktop that I saw in in win 7, 8, and 8.1. I see no tiles (live or
 dead). I only see the wallpaper (not from Microsoft) and my shortcuts for the programs that I use; and, I'm pleased say that when I click on one of them, the program pops open rather quickly, ready to perform it's functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never see the start menu that so many complain about .... I start my programs with shortcuts on the desktop. And, when it's time to reboot or shut down, I right click on the start button and select the desired action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I sold my last Microsoft stock just before win 8 was released to the public.<br />

            <p>The Insider programme is for people who are willing to give the new OS a serious try, install software on it, and use it for at least a number of test activities, if not for daily tasks, and then to provide feedback to MS on their experiences. Installing
 Win 10 TP for 8 hours and then uninstalling it because you don't like the way it looks is hardly giving it a fair chance. Nor is your feedback very useful, because you didn't make any effort at all to try out the OS and its features in a serious way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS explicitly stated that during the preview, auto-update would be enabled and all installations of updates would happen by default. This is not a "deal breaker", it's just a condition of providing feedback under this programme, so that MS can be sure it
 is receiving feedback on the latest version from everyone. Clearly in RTM you will have the option -- as you always have in Windows -- of choosing which updates to install and whether to install them manually or automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your views on the interface, making such a fuss about an unfinished product before you have any idea of which elements will be customizable in the future is rather pointless. It is most likely that you will be able to turn off all the live tiles if
 you don't want to see them, leaving you with your traditional Start menu. And if you want to use your desktop as your launch mechanism, there is nothing to stop you pinning your icons to it, and never having to see the Start menu again if you don't want to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The underlying system is very similar to Win 7, only it is leaner and runs much more efficiently on portable devices. All the rest are bells and whistles that you will be able to change easily or else revert to a Win 7 Start-menu look with a free third-party
 add-on such as Classic Shell.</p>

            <p>Agree!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give it time and patience.&nbsp; W10 is looking very good from where I'm sitting.&nbsp; Yes some rough edges but I've got it setup in our test lab on a dedicated PC (and soon to build a test server as well once some hardware I'm expecting becomes available).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Agree the Update issue would be a deal breaker if this is final release version but we're not there yet.&nbsp; Also, I cannot see how in the final version (and this is just my personal opinion) you will be tied to just a MS account.&nbsp; Local accounts are available
 now for use, I would assume (on the basis they are too widely used to throw away) that domain based accounts will also be possible in the enterprise environment.</p>

<p>These two things do not go together. If MS wants a program tested as a daily driver then it can't reboot in the middle of my work. Period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, if it wants to be tested as a daily driver, the consequence of testing its features can't be to replace my local login with a hotmail account, which for me, because of the particulars of how my network is set up, completely screwed things up
 and, as I noted, was irreversible at least as far as I could tell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And criticizing an unfinished product - which is the exact same criticism that's been leveled against its existing product for years - is far from pointless; it's presumably the reason MS wants people to test Win10 at all, so it can maybe make some changes
 based on feedback. The fact that people on this board recommend Classic Shell should be setting off alarm bells for MS that it still has serious useability issues with its product OOTB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be curious to find out what OS MS employees use as their daily drivers - Win7? Or did they force everyone to use Win8? Because my belief is that, if MS rolled out the Win10 TP to its own employees, the company would grind to a halt from the UI issues
 alone.<br />
