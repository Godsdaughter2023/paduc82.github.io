<h2>            Microsoft Home Use Program --&#62; Offine Installers for Microsoft Office 2016 Products --&#62; Why does Microsoft make things so difficult&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Microsoft Home Use Program --&gt; Offline Installers for Microsoft Office Products --&gt; Why does Microsoft make things so difficult?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have purchased Microsoft Office for use at home as part of the Microsoft Home Use Program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want access to an <strong><em>offline installer</em></strong> for Microsoft Office products that I can install without an internet connection.&nbsp; Instead I am greeted with a useless "click to run" bootstrapper installer which the software industry has a
 fascination with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not like the idea of bootstrappers to install software.&nbsp; Give users the option to download a full installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has a TechNet Evaluation Center where you could download the full offline installers but there isn't one for
</p>
<p>Microsoft Office 2016 Professional Plus only for Microsoft Office 2013 Professional Plus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does Microsoft have to find creative ways to anger their users?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has a Media Creation tool to create an ISO image of Microsoft Windows and it works
<strong><em>without a product key!</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I see very simple solutions to these problems:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Put Microsoft Office 2016 Professional Plus <strong><em>full offline installer (MSI, ISO, Disk Image or EXE)</em></strong> in the TechNet Evaluation Center</li></ul>
<p>OR</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Make a media creation tool for Microsoft Office Products that makes an offline disk image or USB stick offline installer like the Microsoft Windows Media Creation tool.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Why do you guys have to complicate the simple?</p>
<p>
</p><p>LibreOffice has simple offline MSI installers for their office suite and not bootstrappers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix this as soon as possible.</p>

<p>wow. &nbsp;I just wasted 15 minutes of my life trying to get an answer on this from "Jamar" on the MS Office Support chat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After eventually realizing this poor fellow is under trained to even understand the *question* much less provide a solution, he told me to contact Pro support.&nbsp;</p>

            You can't, but you can if you don't copy - select what you want to copy, hold down Ctrl-Shift, and click the selection border and drag to where the insertion indicator is properly position and drop, and do that repeatedly (with the newly dropped range
 as the selection to Ctrl-Shift-Click).
<div><br />
<div>If you need to go between sheets, then use Alt-Ctrl-Shift-Click and drag to the other tab before positioning the insertion point.</div>

            <p>I would use the same steps as the answer previously to insert blank rows. </p>
<p>--&gt; highlight the cells you want to insert below (all of the data below this will move down so make sure you highlight all the way to the end of your data entries, but you cannot select the entire row) --&gt;Click on the selection border on the bottom right
 of your selection, hold Ctrl + Shift</p>
<p>--&gt; Drag down as many rows as you would like inserted</p>
<p>--&gt; Copy the data you would like repeated and paste it in your first row.</p>
<p>--&gt; Use the same selection border and drag to the bottom row you want repeated.

            How did you specify the page number format in the document? You must make use of the Page Number Format dialog box (section by section); you can't add a formatting switch to the page number field.

            <p>I don't know how it is possible to happen. You cannot install anything to your device unless it is from the store.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you are having an issue then hard reset your device. It will wipe it and return to factory defaults. Then you set it up again BUT do not restore from a backup. Just start fresh and your contacts and calendar will return. Then add back your programs.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Frankly I have only heard of it on PCs and&nbsp;the add on&nbsp;can be removed. It just makes no sense that it can possibly be added to your device.</p>

<h3> nacnudddd  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to locate a string within the body of an email message&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Using the version below.&nbsp; (Sorry it's an image, but for some unknown reason the text in the "Account" screen can't be selected and copied, so I have to either try to fat-finger the information, or resort to a screen capture.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have located an email that contains a given string, by entering the string in the search bar at the top of the Outlook mail window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I want to find the string within the email.&nbsp; How do I do it?&nbsp; The only thing that seems to work is to copy the entire content of the email into a text editor, and then search there.&nbsp; Surely there's an easier way...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second question: Why is it not Ctl-F?&nbsp; That is what most applications, including other Microsoft applications, use to search.&nbsp; However, in Outlook that seems to launch a follow-up email.&nbsp; I guess it's&nbsp;F for "Follow-up".&nbsp; But no, that's not going to be obvious
 to most users.&nbsp; </p>
<p>

<p>Hi Duncan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to search a given string in a certain email in Outlook, you can refer to the steps below:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 13px; color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">1. Select and open the email message which you want to find specific text from.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 13px; color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">2. In the&nbsp;<strong>Message</strong>&nbsp;window, please click the&nbsp;<strong>Find</strong>&nbsp;button in the&nbsp;<strong>Editing</strong>&nbsp;group. See screenshot:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 13px; color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">Or you can press the&nbsp;<strong>F4</strong>&nbsp;key on the keyboard to activate the&nbsp;<strong>Find and Replace</strong>&nbsp;dialog box.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 13px; color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6813578c-7bcf-425a-93b6-7a1c3fa1a56d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6813578c-7bcf-425a-93b6-7a1c3fa1a56d?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 13px; color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">3. In the&nbsp;<strong>Find and Replace</strong>&nbsp;dialog box, please type the texts you want to find in the&nbsp;<strong>Find what</strong>&nbsp;field under&nbsp;<strong>Find</strong>&nbsp;tab. And then click the&nbsp;<strong>Find
 Next</strong>&nbsp;button.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 13px; color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">4. After clicking the<strong>&nbsp;Find Next</strong>&nbsp;button, the texts that you have specified which existing in the email body will be selected immediately.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 13px; color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">5. If there are multiple same texts crowded in the email body and you want to find them out all at once, please click&nbsp;<strong>Reading Highlight</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Highlight All</strong>&nbsp;in
 the&nbsp;<strong>Find and Replace</strong>&nbsp;dialog box.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 13px; color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.extendoffice.com%2fimages%2fstories%2fdoc-outlook%2fdoc-find-text-in-opened-email-body%2fxdoc-find-text-in-email-body-3.png.pagespeed.ic.gmrup8YbK4.webp" /></p>
<p style="margin-left: 13px; color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">Then you can see all the relevant texts are highlighted.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 13px; color: rgba(10, 1, 1, 1)">
</p><p>About the second question, I totally understand your feeling. I also think it is better to map Ctrl - F to search. Given the situation, I suggest you vote on the feedback below to push the Outlook team to improve the desktop Outlook 2016 experience.</p>

    <title>Frozen &#39;white screen&#39; on XDA reboot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnpaddon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Frozen &#39;white screen&#39; on XDA reboot</h2>
                    
<p>I changed my contract sim to a PAYG and asked O2 to retain my original number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the day of the changeover (today) I changed the sim card and rebooted the XDA. The reboot stalls after the phone details show on the top blue bar. All I get is a white screen with no change at all - even when the hardware buttons are pressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've used soft reset and hard reset (holding in reset button whilst switching on?). Problem persists. I managed to synchronise with my laptop (still with white screen showing) but no change throughout the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this was a PC I'd boot in Safe Mode and then reboot again. Is there a similar command to F8 in Windows Mobile?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help. I can usually sort these things out but this has me foxed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>John</p>

<p>Greetings John!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of PDA ROM sequences have a provision for "Safe Mode", which is usually detected when you perform a soft-reset multiple times in a short duration (say 3 resets in&nbsp;4 minutes).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this option is not available on your PDA, I would recommend removing the battery for a while, which should cause your device to reset to factory defaults.&nbsp; The duration to leave the battery out is dependant on how long your internal battery
 will last.&nbsp; Some users can leave their device unplugged for a couple of hours, but most need to be left out over night in order to properly reset the device....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still have problems after performing this step, either your new SIM is the problem, or the PDA has suddenly developed a problem that might require you have it serviced...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Try rebooting the phone without the SIM and see if you get the same issue. I doubt it's the SIM though.

<h2>            How can I buy&#47;install apps from marketplace using Zune on PC and sitting in small country like INDIA&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>HI, I bought a Samsung Omnia W last week. Since there was no information brochure in the box, on how to begin with WP 7, I logged into the phone with Window Live ID with UK as my location. After installing 50's
 of apps I have to reset my phone just to be able to buy an apps from Windows Marketplace in Indian rupee (Fruit Ninja). I may have survived the “Reset” shock, but it appears that Zune on PC does not support marketplace in India.</p>
<p>I have been looking for an answer to understand how the marketplace is active in India but Zune software does not display marketplace in its interface! Even I can’t install any app if I change the regional setting
 of PC to US or UK, because Zune would not let me sign-in in the Windows live account of India.
</p>
<p>There is no option to choose a different Windows Live account from the phone which is locked to just one Windows Live account.</p>
<p>Everywhere it’s written to either buy/install apps from your Windows Phone or use home Wi-Fi. Does that mean a WP device is designed for people with Wi-Fi at their home? I guess that was not the minimum system
 requirement.</p>
<p>Now I am left with a ZUNE software which does nothing more than synch my collection to my phone (I hardly us my phone for music/video, FYI, you need data connection to synch documents and contacts). I wanted
 the whole apps experience when I thought of going against the current and buying a Windows Phone. I am still sure that Windows Phone is next big thing for Windows PC user. However, lack of support and updates has brought to my knees. So I request someone to
 answer a simple question –</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I buy/install apps from marketplace using Zune on PC and sitting in small country like INDIA??</p>

            It's a known issue with the Zune software in India.<br />
<br />
if you have no WiFi at home, connect your phone to your PC and open the Zune software. When Zune is open on your PC and the phone is connected, the phone will use the PC's Internet connection. You can verify this by turning off your WiFi and cellular data connections
 on the phone and then trying to browse to a website on the phone.<br />
<br />
Once that's done, go to the <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/marketplace" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">marketplace website</a> and use that to buy apps. The website will send a signal to your phone to download the app and the phone will use the PC's Internet connection to do so.<br />

<p>Will it be released before Windows 10 becomes available to the public?&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is after that it is a&nbsp;moot point.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you keep up with what is happening with the Windows 10 insider preview at some point in the next few months the preview will be the final release and if it is download through the Windows Insider App it will first download and install denim and then Windows
 10.&nbsp; I did this with insider 10166 but felt I did not feel it was ready for prime time and so I backed off to 8.1 Cyan.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke with Microsoft today and they have no control over ATT releasing Denim.&nbsp; I have been told when 10 comes out the control of all releases will be up to Microsoft and so they will be on a much more rapid pace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest that you download the Windows 10 Insider app but do not run it yet.&nbsp; The current version of 10 is 10512 and I run that on a Lumina 635 with no problems, however that is a fairly basic phone so I can't test every thing.&nbsp; I am hoping for one or two
 more updates before I install it on my 920.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I &nbsp;would suggest you to test the issue by manually copying a single photo and save it. Check if it works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would also suggest you to check if you have permissions to the folder to which you are importing the photos.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to follow these steps and give permissions to the folder:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X </strong>on the keyboard.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on <strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>At the command prompt, type “<strong>takeown /f &lt;foldername&gt; /r /d y</strong>” without quotes and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>. (Replace &lt;foldername&gt; with the path of the folder).</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Then, type “<strong>icacls &lt;foldername&gt; /grant administrators:F /T</strong>” without quotes and hit enter. (Replace &lt;foldername&gt; with the path of the folder).</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Using the above mentioned commands, we took the ownership of the folder and then assigned the Administrators group
<strong>Full Control</strong> Permissions for the folder.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this helps.<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> For further assistance, you can post your query in Microsoft Community</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;

            <p>Windows Phones do this from time to time. Why? Probably to make you used to being pissed off so you'll accept it. Because not only does voice to text not actually NEED the internet to work, it often fails while Cortana, which DOES need the internet, continues
 to work flawlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it's a deliberate attempt to **** you off, and Microsoft has refused to deny this allegation.</p>

<h2>            Fed up with your X6 anyone&#63; Add your bugs...</h2>
                    
<p>X6 owners - fed up with your terrible quality phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please have a read and add your own bugs if you want - I want to write to Nokia with some of the main ones that need to get sorted, and soon. Surely with enough support / evidence they can't ignore us (although I'm not holding my breath!). You know, I'm
 struggling to find a thread on this forum which isn't about an 'issue', 'bug' or 'problem' with the phone. I'm fed up with it. We all paid a lot of money for the phone (whether it was part of a contract or not) and I just want it to WORK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It is without doubt the worst phone I've ever owned. Anyone else with me?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Glitchy, buggy, slow and unpredictable don't even begin to describe it...I'm now on my second one, with the first one deciding to pack up a few months back with a dropping signal problem (from full bar to no bar in about 5 seconds, and then back to
 full back about 15 seconds later) - Nokia deemed it BER and after a letter from me, replaced it with a new one...the fact that the second one has exactly the same issues as the first confirm to me just how terrible the build quality of the phone is.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Any of the below issues sound familar to anyone? Some are phone related, others app/Ovi/Nokia related :</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>* Ovi Maps freezing during navigation, even when you're not interacting with the phone or running any background apps. Literally just spontaneously. Requires hard restart most of the time as you can rarely force it to close.<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* iPhone 4 style signal issue whereby holding it in a normal 'phone grip' fashion results in signal dropping completely or nearly completely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* General signal drops during calls - anyone else notice you can be on a phone call in a full signal area (with 3G etc) and calls will just drop; take a look at your phone and you have no signal? Give it 30 seconds and you'll be back up to full bars again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>* Spotify (if anyone has it) just randomly crashing ALL THE TIME, again without any background apps running (ironially it seems to be more reliable with a few things running in the background)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Facebook app thinks stuff that happened two weeks ago is the latest news that it wants to tell me about. Hit refresh and it still thinks old news is new news. Reinstall and wiping of all user data to no joy (same issue even post-phone reset)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* "Realplayer" able to play about 3% of videos I want to watch on the internet - basically a few MPEGs...don't even think about a low-res MP4 stream (where we get the dreaded "Trying to play partially" message). Any UK owners tried running a stream off m.tvcatchup.com?
 Good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>* (Just a general gripe here but) Lack of widget support for the homescreen and general lack of integration support for 3rd party apps to the OS - why oh WHY in this day and age of smart phones are S60v5 Nokias unable to have apps like Facebook spider
 in to some of the phone's functions? E.g. notifications on the homescreen (the original iPhone was able to do this in January 2007, its now September 2010 Nokia - wakey wakey) and profile pictures linked in with the phone's address book (my friend's HTC Desire
 does this VERY nicely; I'm jealous).<br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>@muirio: I do not know what you are complaining about. I have had my X6 16GB since 1st May 2010 and am more than happy. The build quality (my phone was made in China) is rock solid and the programmes and apps all work well. The only criticism I have is with
 navigation using ovi maps which quite frankly sucks. Other than that I am more than happy with my X6.</p>
<p>Perhaps the problem lies with you and not the phone. Before buying this phone did you do your research? Have you read the online manual or faq's? Have you installed some programmes or app's which could be causing a problem? Do you know how to use the phone?
 Are you trying to get the phone to do something it is not designed for? The list goes on.</p>
<p>I have not experienced the signal strengh problems you are talking about.&nbsp; I always hold the phone in the normal way and it works fine. Do not get any drop outs like you mention. Perhaps the problem here is with your network operator. We used to get a lot
 of reception problems where i live until the networks upgraded their infrastructure. Now these sort of reception probs only occur in weak reception areas.</p>
<p>Sorry I can not agree with you. My X6 is great and I would not swap it at all.</p>
<p>If you are not happy then get rid of it and go buy an overpriced, overrated iPhone4</p>

<p>On balance I agree with bazyeo, I am another long term X6 owner (Dec 09) and on the whole I am fairly pleased with the phone. Sure it's not perfect and one of my major personal gripes with the phone is the relatively poor RAM allocation that Nokia decided
 upon during the hardware design but it's hardly a show stopper for me. I guess I was spoilt as my previous phone was a Nokia N82.</p>

<p><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff"><span>* Spotify (if anyone has it) just randomly crashing ALL THE TIME, again without any background apps running (ironially it seems to be more reliable with a few things running in the background)</span></font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff">* Facebook app thinks stuff that happened two weeks ago is the latest news that it wants to tell me about. Hit refresh and it still thinks old news is new news. Reinstall and wiping of all user data to no joy (same issue even
 post-phone reset)</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff">* "Realplayer" able to play about 3% of videos I want to watch on the internet - basically a few MPEGs...don't even think about a low-res MP4 stream (where we get the dreaded "Trying to play partially" message). Any UK owners

<p><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff"><span>* (Just a general gripe here but) Lack of widget support for the homescreen and general lack of integration support for 3rd party apps to the OS - why oh WHY in this day and age of smart phones are S60v5 Nokias unable
 to have apps like Facebook spider in to some of the phone's functions? E.g. notifications on the homescreen (the original iPhone was able to do this in January 2007, its now September 2010 Nokia - wakey wakey) and profile pictures linked in with the phone's
 address book (my friend's HTC Desire does this VERY nicely; I'm jealous).<br />

<p>Ovi maps does hit hard on resources but I personally haven't suffered the issues you speak of.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can get my X6 to drop maybe a bar (at the very max 2 bars) of signal if I wrap my hands around the handset. Again for me, not a big issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm afraid I don't use Spotify or Facebook so can't comment on those issues of yours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Knowing what codecs to use helps with video playback using Real Player. A search here should give you the required information. I can run MP4, FLV &amp; WMV quite happily provided they have the right codecs that the X6 can handle. If you want to enjoy m.tvcatchup.com
 then try installing the 3rd party web browser called Skyfire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are quite a few alternative 3rd party homescreens that can add widget functionality to the homescreen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck with your letter to Nokia, I'm afraid I won't be signing your petition. As I said right at the top of this post, sure I have niggles with the X6 but none of them are show stoppers for me and personally I can forgive the X6 most things because I
 really enjoy the quality of the screen and the capacitive touch interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*EDIT* I almost forgot to ask... is yours a SIM free X6 or a network branded X6?</p>

<p>I guess out of ten I would give mine say 8/8.5.</p>

<p>@bayzeo and steve_p:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your comments guys. Not going to lie, I did write that post last night after a 4-hour drive plagued by crashing Ovi Maps every 10 minutes so maybe I was a little harsh. Perhaps I should rephrase: "It's definitely the worst
<em>Nokia</em> phone I've ever owned". 3210, 6230, (a couple of Sony Ericssons), an 5800XM (which had a faulty aerial and was refunded) and now this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless, I'm glad you both love your X6s. I'm happy for you. You certainly seem to have gotten lucky with yours - the sheer volume of problem threads on this forum testifies to the contrary. The main thing I just can't understand is how Nokia can be the
 world's largest seller of mobile phones in the world (or so Wikipedia tells me :smileyvery-happy: ) and yet develop an phone that has more glitches, teething problems and hardware issues than a three-year-old iPhone (1G). Come on, the X6 was a flagship model
 a few months ago?!</p>

<p>Network branded - T-Mobile UK. Oh and Steve your point about the fact this is a user support forum is well noted...I'm hardly expecting people to be posting thank you comments to Nokia :smileyhappy: . What I should have put is that

<p>Ahh... I can well understand the frustration and the need to 'vent' some if you'd just come off the back of a 4 hour drive from hell with Ovi Maps.Believe me, I know the feeling my X6 was suffering frequent 'White Screen Of Death' incidents around February
 time and that was the height of frustration.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be honest I think a lot of problems that users see with their circa 2009 Nokia phones (and I include the X6, N97 and N97 mini in this sweeping generalisation of mine) is the fact that the design teams felt the need to scrimp on free RAM installed on the
 handset. Just my two penneth. In a number of ways my N82 is a superior phone to my X6 but I can forgive most things because I adore the screen image quality and the capacitive touch interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also to be fair the firmware updates have also improved performance by quite a margin... I do realise that there's the old addage that a product should only be released to market once all the major development has been sorted but I'm afraid that's never
 been the case, even back in the old days of the N70 or N80, heck I even remember as far back as my 7110e getting a performance hike from V3 to V5 firmware. Certainly Nokia aren't the only company guilty of this habbit but at least they continue the development
 cycle to try and help customers get the best from their phones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be interesting to do a side by side comparison of how T-Mobile's firmware compares to Nokia's original firmware. That's traditionally a notorious way to cripple or handicap a mobile phone too. I've always had Orange UK branded handsets in the past
 and in a lot of cases the issues that cropped up were down to network branding, pure and simple. That's why I promised myself for this latest phone that I would go SIM free and buy direct from Nokia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heh LOL infact I have seen attitudes here turn full circle. Back when the N70 was first released there would always be posts titled 'How can I remove Orange HomeScreen', and it caused quite a stir at the time. Now today I see posts where people have extracted
 and ported the X6 Orange branded HomeScreen so that others who aren't on the Orange network can install it to use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well I hope you can learn to like your X6 if not love it like some of us :p and hopefully issues and problems will improve as the firmware matures and gets updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep us informed as to how you get on :) even if it is ultimately that you buy a different handset.</p>

<p>Have to agree with you on reception. Leave it alone and it had full signal, hold it and you're on 1 bar sometimes. However a lot of this is down to how the bars are represented. Download nokia energy profiler and see what signal loss you're actually getting.</p>
<p>An iphone 4 will drop 20db from holding it. That means if like me you're on -90 on average in your home, holding it will drop it to -110 and cut the call. To put that in context, a HTC evo drops 17, and my n95 8GB drops 10db from doing the same thing. Never
 tried it with the X6. Might be an interesting experiment. With some phones (depending on initial signal) 10db can be a big drop. (2-3 bars).</p>
<p>The reason your reception varies is full bars is round about -80 on nokias, but you could easily have a signal of -60. If you have a very strong signal bars will not drop! If you have a signal thats -90 (5/7 bars still) you're far more likely to cut the
 call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem I had with the x6 was texting, use 2 hands, cup your left hand around it and reception often dropped to zero in areas where signal was weak (3 bars or less) to start with.</p>
<p>The antenna is on the bottom of the x6 so reception is much better in landscape mode or if holding phone by its edges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Poor reception and bugs, atrocious GPS reception were reason for selling my x6 and going back to N95 8GB.</p>
<p>The main problems as everyone points out is that it has just 128MB ram. Thats not enough given the OS uses up to 100MB on bootup! &nbsp;Load anything memory intensive and it'll freeze or crash. Forget to shut down an app and it does the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got fed up of my X6. It was a flawed GEM, could have been so good but whenever I wanted to rely on it let me down. GPS refused to lock onto signal (would sometimes do it no problem), reception was very iffy sometimes, free wifi abroad usually didn't work
 (no problem with sony satio which runs same OS!). It was an unreliable let down. When they bring out the X7 needs more RAM and ideally a more streamlined touch screen OS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>@muiro - Agree with everything you said, particularly the streaming audio / video problem. There is a stoney silence from Team Nokia when this is mentioned, so this fault is probably being perpetuated by the bean-counting dept. Coupled with random crashing,
 freezing, out-of-memory, and a really **bleep** map search - will find lots of ads and everything bar the kitchen sink, but cannot find "Pitt Street" in Sydney!</p>
<p>The final straw is this week when my battery gets drained overnight for no valid reason, and I can't even find basic email settings to fix it. For that matter, even if I change internet or email settings then the phone goes crazy and nothing works.</p>
<p>The camera is pretty good, I'll give it that much. However the night shots are spoiled by a white smear from the light of the flash.</p>
<p>I certainly won't be getting another Nokia after this one!</p>

<p>Well I think I've solved the mystery of the draining battery - looks like it happens whenever I leave my camera and/or picture gallery running in memory. Battery seems to be lasting so long as I close the apps when I've finished takling pics. Must be something
 to do with the GPS or WIFI connection for certain apps, who knows! It's pointless asking about these defects because everyone is burying their collective heads in the sand and hoping that they will somehow magically be fixed. Well don't hold your breath, I
 haven't seen any sign that Nokia has even acknowledged these problems, let alone working on them.</p>

<h2>            Excel 2013 will not start</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; Reinstalled Office 365.&nbsp; Checked updates.&nbsp; All portions of Office run fine except Excel 2013 which will not start.&nbsp; Tried starting in safe mode-no start.&nbsp; Excel provides notice that&nbsp; it is not the default program even though it is,
 but shows up as "Excel (desktop)".&nbsp; Error message is that there is a problem sending instructions to the program.&nbsp; Repair does not work in either the quick mode nor on-line mode.</p>
<p>Excel 2007 runs fine and open files that Excel 2013 will not.&nbsp; However, it does not appear as a choice for setting default programs.</p>

            1. You may login to Windows with a new user profile and see if it helps.<br />
<br />
2. Review following link - https://community.office365.com/en-us/w/manage/office-365-and-windows-10-problems-and-solutions<br />
<br />
3. Repair the office installation - https://support.office.com/en-NZ/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b<br />
<br />
4. Follow the instructions given on this page to make older programs compatible with Windows 10 - http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows&nbsp;<br />
<br />
5. For Ready Only Problems - Review the response of E. Harter at following link where sharing has solved the problem - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-excel/2010-office-docs-all-open-as-read-only-after/31a64e6b-60e1-4d51-a897-9f8958660859<br />

<br />
6. Install latest Windows 10 cumulative update KB3081438 (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3081438) which is released on 14-Aug-15. If you want to download standalone KB3081438 then you can download from http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Thanks.aspx?id=140.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
7. Turn off Hey Cortana and reboot your computer (useful particularly if Excel performance is slow).<br />
<br />
8. Right click on your Excel shortcut &gt; Properties, In Compatibility tab, uncheck all options. Start the Excel again.<br />
<br />
9. Right click on your Excel shortcut &gt; Run as Administrator<br />
<br />
10. Review the following thread - http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-excel/cannot-open-some-office-files-after-upgrading-from/c103ee49-2e87-4421-ad96-f433ec77ec54<br />
<br />
11. Sometimes, this is caused due to excel not being able to access the default printer. Close all office applications and change your default printer through1 Start &gt; Devices and Printers to another printer. It may be some physical one or One Note or XPS or
 PDF or anything else. If this is the problem, then you will need to update your printer driver for default printer.<br />
<br />
12. If above don't, re-installation of office may (and may not also) solve your problem. Remove MS Office completely by downloading Fixit tool and from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2739501 and running it. Make sure that you have license keys ready before
 you attempt re-installation. If you don't have license keys, please do not attemp re-installation. You can also install MS Office by logging into www.office.com/myaccount if you have registered your copy.

 open that location. It might not exist or you might not have permission to open it" and a link. When I key the link I get 404 file not found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file is still perfectly useable in Onenote on my laptop but it wont sync. Can I re-save it from one note with a new file name and then sync my other devices from the newly created file? Alternatively how can I get the file off my pc and somewhere central?&nbsp;

<p>Angela,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps to extract a URL that (hopefully) will allow you to go directly to the Outlook sign on page (and bypass the annoying "blue" page.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click the outlook shortcut you currently use. You should see a page that looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/638d9650-15dc-4b84-a8ad-46fa117006c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/638d9650-15dc-4b84-a8ad-46fa117006c0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Click the "Sign in" button (shown above in a red rectangle).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. You should see the Outlook sign in page that looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b3882164-2ea7-4d78-bdf8-9e1f127db6ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b3882164-2ea7-4d78-bdf8-9e1f127db6ba" /></a></p>
<p>4. Look at the URL shown in your browser's address bar (enclosed in a red rectangle in the above image).</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Use your mouse to highlight and select the ENTIRE address. You should be able to do this by hovering your mouse pointer in the browser's address bar and then doing a single (left) click with your mouse. This should highlight the entire address bar. Note,
 the URL will probably be too long to see the entire address in your browser's address bar, but by doing a single left click with your mouse pointer in the address bar, you should be able to select the entire URL (even if the URL is too long to be fully shown
 in your browser's address bar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Once the ENTIRE address is selected (highlighted), do a CTRL-C (to copy the URL to your clipboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Open a Notepad window, place your mouse cursor into the notepad text box, do a single left click and then do a CTRL-V (to paste the contents of your clipboard [which is the URL you copied] into notepad. You can save the notepad entry you just created
 for later reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Go to the shortcut you currently use to start outlook (or create a new shortcut), and replace the URL in the shortcut with the URL you just copied into your clipboard. You can do this by deleting the URL that is currently in the shortcut, then placing
 the mouse pointer in the text box used to contain the shortcut's URL (that text box should now be empty), single left click, then so a CTRL-V (to paste the URL into the shortcut. Save the shortcut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Close your browser. The re-open your browser, and try the new shortcut to see if it takes you to the outlook sign in page (and bypasses the "blue" page).</p>

<p>Sorry, I am running out of ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is one more URL you can try:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=13&amp;ct=1496795143&amp;rver=6.7.6640.0&amp;wp=MBI_SSL&amp;wreply=https%3a%2f%2foutlook.live.com%2fowa%2f%3fnlp%3d1%26RpsCsrfState%3d3a6e9dfe-296c-4925-8856-f3997cec78e8&amp;id=292841&amp;CBCXT=out&amp;fl=wld&amp;pcexp=false&amp;cobrandid=90015
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The above URL is all on one line. Highlight the entire URL, copy it, paste it into the address bar of your browser and hit ENTER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it works (bypasses the "blue" page and takes you to the outlook sign in page), then make a shortcut using the URL.</p>

<p>None of your solutions have worked.&nbsp; No matter what url I save it eventually goes back to the annoying upgrade page.&nbsp; I give up and am thinking of switching email providers.&nbsp; There should be an opt out option on that page.&nbsp; If there is, I sure don't see
 it.&nbsp; I do not want to pay for my email and the ads that are on the side do not bother me.&nbsp; Please figure out an option.</p>

            Yes...I ran Defender yesterday because of the wacky performance of build 10049...and it found nothing...so I ran Malware and of course it found "one" bad thing...and it's always been like that with all my other systems...oh well...still like defender because
 it does sometimes warn and catch stuff in real time browsing...but not in Win 10.*john

<h2>            File Association for Office 2016 removed when I reinstalled on Mac...</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently had to reinstal Microsoft Office 2016 on my Macbook Pro. Now, when I click on a Word icon in an email (to launch it), the icon sort of blinks but nothing happens. The extension is docx. I don't seem to be able to locate how to reassociate the
 file extension so the doc will automatically launch. I find instructions for Windows, but not for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>If you are pointing to the 16193 Sources, you need to specify the install.wim or install.esd file and index number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look in your 16193 ISO and find if it is install.wim or install.esd. At a Command Prompt, check what indexes are in that file using DISM. It may have both Pro and Home Editions, so you need to point to the right index.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">DISM /Get-WimInfo /WimFile:H:\Sources\install.esd</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have found your Edition index in install.wim or install.esd you have to specify it:</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The download of iso from Microsoft contains both versions. You can download separately for x86 and x64 builds but Pro and Home builds are in the download. That's why you must specify an index of :1&nbsp; for Pro and :2 for Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if <strong>install.wim:1</strong> does not work, then use <strong>install.wim /index:1
</strong>in Don Cuthbert's command lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hi, I tried some commands:</p>
<p>1) I created a dvd from iso image of windows 10 build 161993.</p>
<p>2) in sources folder of dvd I found install.wim.</p>
<p>So, in an admin prompt I ran: </p>
<p>dism /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth /Source:WIM:E:\sources\install.wim:1 /LimitAccess</p>
<p>I receive an error: 0x800f081f</p>
<p>Origin not found. </p>
<p>So, I tried to reinstall windows 10 build 161993 from dvd I created, but, at 11% of installation, it exit.</p>
<p>I have no idea...</p>

            After running DISM /RestoreHealth check your CBS.log. If the only error is about a FlightSigning package, then Windows is OK. Try running
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>.

<p>DISM, sfc, update troubleshooter, modifying regedit, deleting temp/distribution files: those things WON'T WORK, regedit. I tried everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that finally worked for me was to do an inconvenient clean install of build 16193. The trick (probably?) was to disable the wifi adapter just after the 16199 update download finished. Then it will prompt you to install it, and after probably
 2 hours (the longest I've ever had for an update) it finally finished. Microsoft simply is bad at updates. For every bug they "squash" they introduce 10 more. I doubt they even do simple testing on these buggy test builds.</p>

<h2>            Filter excel 2010 pivot table for dates after or equal to today</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a pivot table which looks at the number of appointments different staff members have had/ have coming up.&nbsp; I have dates in the row field, names in the column field and a count of staff id in the data/value field.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know there are dynamic date filters; but they don't meet my requirements here.&nbsp; I'd like to dynamically&nbsp;filter the dates to show today's date and any future date.&nbsp; I've tried the custom filter and have discovered that I can't use =today() or&nbsp;=(now) as
 a criterion, unless I'm missing something.&nbsp; I've also tried referring to a cell containing the =today() formula as my criteria; but it seems I can't do that either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know I could add a field to the source data which checks if the date matches my criteria and then I could add that as a page/report filter field; but I don't want to confuse the users of the workbook.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible to create a custom filter from the date field to satisfy my requirements?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Karen</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>At row label, if you use the drop down then as you said there is date filter. In Date Filter use "After" and there choose yesterday's date. It will show the list which is equal to for dates which are after or equal to today.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks very much for that.&nbsp; It makes sense.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Will I need to change the filter on a daily basis though as yesterday's date will change?</p>
<p>I'm looking for a way to set up the filter so no matter what the current date is it still works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thansk for your prompt reply.&nbsp; It is appreciated.</p>

            I found that the date filter built into Excel 2010 Pivot Tables does not appear to adjust automatically using the method suggested.&nbsp; Is there a way to have it automatically adjust for today and after so this does not need to be done manually each day on
 dozens of pivot tables?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did use the Users -&gt; Deletes Users from the Office 365 Admin center.. And everything was looking ok. But somehow the Exchange would not seem to restore properly. After some while the user could login to his account using Webmail. But the rest of the company
 was not able to send him emails.</p>
<p>We got the following error:<br />
</p>
<p>550 5.1.10 RESOLVER.ADR.RecipientNotFound; Recipient *** Email address is removed for privacy *** not found by SMTP address lookup&nbsp;<br />
AM6PR0102MB3143.eurprd01.prod.exchangelabs.com</p>
<p>
</p><p>When checking the Exchange Admin page I could not open the settings for the mailbox because it gave the following error.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">The operation couldn't be performed because object '25601c83-6d70-4cf1-9665-37669a7f9f24'
 couldn't be found on 'DB3PR01A002DC01.EURPR01A002.prod.outlook.com'.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>During the time the user had webmail he was able to backup the emails. So I created a new Office 365 account (with different email address). When that succeeded I deleted the original (restored) account again. Then I added an alias to the new email address
 and that seems to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the problem is gone, but it took some time and a lot of work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the information, but because it is working now I will not try any other things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will close this thread (if possible).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Johan</p>
