<h2>            Desperate </h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;My HTC tilt stopped working about a week ago. I recieved a replacement today. I went to the web site and downloaded the program in the new phone. Next I performed a sync to retrieve my info on the new phone. Instead of that happening, the info was replaced
 by whats on the current phone. And thats almost nothing. how do i retrieve the pictures, contacts, messages, and documents that were on the original phone.

            Before someone comes around with a better answer I'd like to ask what was wrong with your first phone e.g. if the device is still available to you and it can be started, perhaps you could access the content by connecting it to your pc with a usb cable?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I myself wouldn't know if it's possible to retrieve the data from the online myphone service. You might want to check how I solved a similar problem and see if there is anything in that thread that can help you to avoid a similar disaster in the
 future:<br />
http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsmobilehelp/thread/91795445-6a8f-428c-b929-95ff2fbea959
Two essentials: 1) Store as much as you can on the memory card instead of on the device; 2) in addition to using back up software, connect the phone by USB occasionally and just do a copy paste of all folders to your pc hard drive.<br />

<p>Hi GuidoStrotheide,</p>
<p>The refresh button in <a href="https://outlook.office.com/owa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook Web App</a> has been removed in the new version.</p>
<p>If you want to refresh, you can click the refresh button from the browser, such as F5 for IE.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks,<br />

<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, I find that the Refresh button briefly appears right after I refresh the Outlook web page with F5. I have to get the timing just right. A few seconds later and I only get the settings panel.</p>

    <title>Cannot resize embedded Excel sheet in PowerPoint or Word when using - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bretthodges  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot resize embedded Excel sheet in PowerPoint or Word when using Windows 10 Display scaling above 100&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've come across an isssue were an Excel embedded table in PowerPoint or Word cannot be resized. Double clicking to activate the sizing controls for the embedded sheet instead opens Excel to edit the data with no way of increasing the range area to be displayed.
 The issue seems to be related to Windows display display scaling if any display scale is set above 100%, eg, laptop display scaled to 125% (Recommended) or higher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This affects multiple builds of MS Office in our environment, but the one on my system is version: 1902 (Build 11328.20158 Click-to-Run)</p>
<p>Windows 10 version: 1809 (OS Build 17763.348)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a laptop connected to multiple displays with the laptop display scaling set to 125% (Recommended). I've also tested this on 4k displays where the scaling is set to 200% (Recommended) value and can reproduce the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to reproduce the issue:</p>
<p>In Word/PowerPoint choose Insert &gt; Table &gt; Excel Spreadsheet or</p>
<p>Copy a range from an existing Excel worksheet and Paste Special as Microsoft Excel Worksheet Object</p>
<p>
</p><p>Expected behaviour:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cf381a8-45d5-4896-8b58-1204d358d78c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cf381a8-45d5-4896-8b58-1204d358d78c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The mini Excel view shows resizing handles allowing resizing to the required number of rows/columns. Deselecting and then double clicking the object shows the same resizing function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Behaviour if any screen scale is set above 100%, eg, laptop is set to 125% (Recommended)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inserting an Excel table shows only 4 cells:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47eae098-8ffe-4b61-ba16-1ece075e6686?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/47eae098-8ffe-4b61-ba16-1ece075e6686?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The mini Excel view is not displayed. There is no way to resize the range to show more rows/columns. Double clicking the object opens Excel to edit the data. However, there is no apparent way of resizing the range to be displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way of resizing the range without resorting to adjusting display scaling everytime?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Brett</p>

<p>Editing embedded or linked content relies on OLE. OLE display is resolution-dependent. This is why you'll find a bazillion questions along the lines of "I changed my monitor and now I see a different number of columns in an embedded Excel sheet".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you're running a system with multiple resolutions, OLE doesn't know which resolution to use. But it automatically falls back to a workaround: instead of editing the file in place (the normal consequence of double-clicking on an embedded selection),
 Office opens Excel and allows you to change your selection there so you can repaste it into PowerPoint.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In PowerPoint, you can click on <strong>File&gt;Feedback</strong>, click the <strong>
Send a Frown</strong> button. And describe the problem in detail, including <em>all</em> steps to replicate the issue. Submitting will send the report to Microsoft programmers. However, since they've already programmed a workaround, it seems likely they're
 already aware of this.</p>

            <p>Sounds like a problem with the USB connection.</p>
<p>Try a different cable and/or a different USB port on the desktop.&nbsp; Remember, trying to connect via a USB hub is 'sketchy' at best, so it's always better to go directly to a USB port on the desktop.</p>
<p>Also, try connecting the phone to another computer.&nbsp; If it works there, then you've eliminated the phone and the cable as problem areas.</p>

            Thanks - but still a glitch :(<br />
<br />
After testing with 2 HTC cables both cables (OK).<br />
Then used MS Mr.FixIt - and My PC now recognizes the USB - and the connection in Device Manager is displayed as 'working' - latest Driver installed OK - a W7 Phone.<br />
<br />
Took the phone to my local Testra Shop and they managed to connect my phone via their Desktop to Zune no problem - but their rules would not allow them to update my software !!.<br />
<br />
So all smiles came back and tried on my ACER Desktop - the USB was recognized as W7 phone (device Manager &amp; Computer) - but as soon as Zune opened (automatically) it cannot find a device to connect to ???<br />
<br />
Tried using every USB port on my ACER - and removing Zune (+ anything else it created using Advanced Uninstaller) - then reloading Zune and re-starting phone 3 times - same result - still no connection ?<br />
<br />
The only difference is now the Device Manager (Portable Device) is a T8697 and not just a W7 Phone.<br />
Even tried using a Widows start-up - without any other programs auto-starting - Device was recognized by ACER - but when I manually started Zune - same 'No Connection' !!!<br />
<br />
HOWEVER - on my Widows XP3 Vaio - using exactly the same USB cable etc. - and Device Manager showing exactly the same - I'm able to get Zune to accept the Phone and offer updates ??
<br />
<br />
So my phone is now updated - but still cannot get it linked to Zune on my Desktop :) - any ideas?<br />

            Hey Laura C - what a great post - I thank you sincerely for all your advice.<br />
<br />
Eventually I did however manage to get it all working:<br />
<br />
1st - went to the link&nbsp; Franois D provided in another post which was: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2410180" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2410180</a> = <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2468307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
2468307</a> (Error “Can’t connect to your phone” when you try to connect Windows Phone to a computer.)
<br />
<br />
2nd - I then scrolled down and followed the link located within 1 above: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2468307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
2468307</a> Error “Can’t connect to your phone” when you try to connect Windows Phone to a computer.
<br />
<br />
3rd - Once at this new page - I tried the top couple of recommendations - which did not work - then I went further down to:
<br />
<b>Create a new certificate and restore files</b><br />
I Disconnected the Phone - AND Closed Zune - and the following the manual instructions:<br />
a) - I found I had 2 X "S-1-5-21-"<br />
b) - so I renamed the older one .bak :)<br />
c) - then 're-connected' the phone<br />
d) - then I 'restarted' Zune<br />
<br />
and all then worked like clockwork :)&nbsp; :)<br />

<h2>            Office 2010 Starter Edition</h2>

<p>I find that MS 2010 Starter "interferes" when I am working on Office 2007. can I disable MS 2010 Starter so that I can work solely on MS Office 2007 (which I like and prefer), or, do I have to delete MS 2010 Starter. If I have to delete, can I reinstall
 OK at a later date. I am frustrated when I am working on an existing 2007 document either Word or Excel the document appears to "switch" over to MS 2010 Starter</p>

            <p>Hello Bruce,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to hear that due to the presence of Office 2010 starter you are facing some issues with working normally on Office 2007 applications. I will be helping you with this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Office 2010 Starter is already installed on your computer and as you have installed and want to continue using Office 2007 – you will have to uninstall Office Starter 2010. Please note, Office 2010 Starter is only a stripped down version of Office
 2010 trial version. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To get over this issue, uninstall the Office 2010 Starter edition from <strong>
Programs and Features</strong> in <strong>Control Panel</strong> and make sure to restart your computer after uninstallation. Uninstall Office 2010 using the Office 2010 FIXIT tool.
</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Download/install and run the Office 2010 FIXIT tool from the following link:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971179</a></span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Once you have completed running the FIXIT make sure to repair the Office 2007 installation from Programs and Features and restart your computer. Right-click on the Office 2007 program in Programs and Features (in the Control Panel) and then click on
<strong>Change &gt; Repair. </strong>Make sure to restart the computer after repair.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above helps to resolve your issue. Let us know if you need further assistance.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

<h2>            Watermark enlarges when printing and converting to .pdf - Word 16 for Mac</h2>
                    I inserted a watermark on a document. The size, font, and placement is perfect. Every time I print or save a document with the watermark. the watermark enlarges and only a portion remains on the page (because it is so large). I can't figure out how to
 print as it appears on the actual document when open in Word. Please help!!!

<h2>            Ford Compatibility&#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a question for Microsoft and Ford (I'll ask them on their site as well). My new 2015 F-250 Platinum truck has an amazing computer inside with all this great technology and it works amazingly well. Right next to the display is a little plaque type
 thing that says "Sync powered by Microsoft" which is great as I'm a total Microsoft fan and not an Apple person at all. The problem is this, the app Ford has to remote access my truck, or any other Ford for that matter, is only available for iOS or Android,
 NOT my Nokia Windows phone. Why??? Y'all developed Ford's computer technology and created their SYNC system for crying out loud so it would seem to make sense that my phone would have an app that worked with the car y'all partnered with!! Is anything in development?
 Like I said, I'm a Microsoft fan but the lack of apps is frustrating at best and not even being compatible with your own technology really sucks. I'm sure others have the same question, or maybe they don't, I don't know. It's an uphill fight being a Microsoft
 "fanboy" (I think I used that right) on an Apple/Google playground so please show me that my loyalty isn't for not. Thanks!

            Yes, it is Microsoft technology, made to Ford specs.&nbsp; Third party manufacturers for Ford have to supply what Ford specifies, they don't get a choice.

    <title>BitDefendercom.exe -- BDServices Folder -- they claim it&#39;s safe, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianszafranski  say:</h3>
<h2>            BitDefendercom.exe -- BDServices Folder -- they claim it&#39;s safe, but is it&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I found some malware on my PC by using SparkTrust PC Cleaner which was identified as Trojan.GenericKD.3298660. After I cleaned that I found I also had some weird software activated. I apologize that I can't remember
 the name of that second software, but I do remember that it had Christmas-tree-bulb icons. I was able to uninstall that software using its own uninstall file.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I subsequently found I have more on my PC. There's a hokey file folder in my Programs folder named BDServices. The uninstall file did not work, and after a few hours trying to get rid of the folder, its files,
 and its&nbsp;</span><span>executable</span><span>&nbsp;file (BitDefendercom.exe), I'm stuck with all of it (202 Mb).</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>All the on-line sites dealing with malware say that BitDefendercom.exe is safe. I DISAGREE.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I even tried Easy Remover to delete BitDefendercom.exe. After Easy Remover scanned my PC files for about an hour it found just one instance of BitDefendercom.exe. When I asked Easy Remover to delete it I got an
 error message "Cannot delete file, it's sort of locked" or something like that.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>BACKGROUND... As far as I know I acquired this malware while performing Google searches and after opening several webpages, so I don't know exactly where this malware was loaded onto my PC, I just know it happened
 last Friday (June 24, 2016) per the folder time stamps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Any software which will not allow its uninstall file to work, or not allow anyone to delete it manually, is suspicious. When I manually delete some of the files they automatically reload from a zipped file (as
 best I can tell). If I try to end the process BitDefendercom.exe it automatically reappears in a few seconds. &nbsp;As I said above, Easy Remover will not work, either. The software just will not go away. To me, that screams "NOT LEGIT."</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Could this be some sort of program looking for malware for a company which sells security software? That is, they're looking for malware so they can provide the means to deal with it to their security-software
 subscribers? That's my best guess, and it's not exactly an educated guess. I'd appreciate any suggestions. I'd especially like to hear from officials from www.BitDefender.com.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>FYI, I have an older HP desktop PC running Win-10/64 (free upgrade). I use Win Defender, and SparkTrust PC Cleaner. Other security software (e.g., Ed Norton) has always been so much more of a headache that its
 worth, so I've always avoided using that sort of software. Thank you in advance for your help!</span></span></p>

            <p>From what I could find that BDServices folder and the executable you found in it are related to a product called Digital Care Antivirus created by Digital Care Solutions.&nbsp; Searching for this product also finds that ParetoLogic, a company with a long sketchy
 history, seems to be involved in its distribution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the main executable for this program doesn't appear to have been signed, this is a clear indication that the developer doesn't follow best practices, so I wouldn't trust this application even if the company itself were well known.&nbsp; You may wish to
 investigate the company itself to see whether they offer any support for removing the program, but I'd warn that there's no way to be certain that this would be a safe direction to take.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found no specific indications that this application or folder were safe and instead only found others questioning it as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess would be that some sort of questionable affiliate software may have installed this on your PC without your knowledge, though it may have also tagged along with something else sketchy that you actually chose to install.&nbsp; This is why I personally
 never install anything on my PC that's not from a major name vendor and found either&nbsp;on their own website or in&nbsp;the official Microsoft Store.</p>

            <p><span><strong>UPDATE...</strong></span><br />
</p>
<p><span>I started digging into this much more deeperer. That is, I started asking questions, especially of the folks who publish SparkTrust PC Cleaner Plus. Asked if this new BDServices
 folder and the files in it (especially BitDefendercom.exe) where part of their PC Cleaner Plus software, they provided the replies below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><strong>2016-06-28&nbsp;—&nbsp;REPLY #1)</strong> &nbsp;</span><em>The BitDefenderCOM.exe File is what runs the Malware Scan of
 the PC Cleaner Plus program and is required in order for the program to function properly.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><strong>2016-06-29&nbsp;—&nbsp;REPLY #</strong><strong>2)</strong> &nbsp;<em>BitDefenderCOM.exe is quite new. We had third party assistance in upgrading the malware scan, so
 this file identifies itself as different from the program.</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I recommended that SparkTrust consider adding some sort of ReadMe file to the BDServices folder to identify the folder and its contents as being an integral part of the PC Cleaner
 Plus software.&nbsp;It's a shame that so much time had to be wasted on this issue when all the software publisher had to do was somehow inform their customers of the change to a different malware-scanning subprogram. It all falls back to lack of proper communication.</span></p>

            <p>Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is why any reputable company today will digitally sign their files, since this identifies the creator of the file itself as well as help to confirm that it hasn't become corrupted in any way.&nbsp; No other method including placing a text file in the folder
 can guarantee this, since anyone could have placed such a file there in order to make you believe that such a thing were somehow ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the file is truly unsigned, which you can confirm by right-clicking and checking the file's properties, this would be an indication that the developer of that module won't invest the time or money required to properly identify themselves as the creator.&nbsp;
 In such a case, I would typically choose not to use that software since digital signatures are now considered a best practice, especially when something as crucial as a security application is involved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, your own action is up to you, but now that you are aware of the situation you should at least consider whether the software that includes this is truly reputable and trustworthy to have installed on your system.</p>
<p>

</p><p>The problem is... it's a subcontractor who developed this malware subprogram, and I guess they're identified with it. But of course, I have no idea who that company is because they weren't identified as associated with the original SparkTrust PC Cleaner
 Plus program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to ask a dumb question, how is a software provider supposed to identify subprograms that they utilize? Should they re-identify them (or as you say "sign") as their own? I have to wonder how that would work with respect to copyright protection.</p>

            <p>Browse to the C:\Program Files\Windows Defender folder and display the properties for either the MSASCui.exe or MsMpEng.exe files, which are the GUI and Antimalware Engine executables for Defender.&nbsp; Both of these should contain a Digital Signatures tab which
 will give you an idea what would typically be expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the BitDefenderCOM.exe file was developed by Digital Care Solutions per the copyright field, they would typically compile and so also sign the file which they created.&nbsp; It doesn't matter who distributes the file, since as with the many Microsoft development
 API sets distributed with applications developed using their development packages, the pre-compiled Microsoft modules are signed by them as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A readme file might help an individual understand how a folder and files got there, the digital&nbsp;signing is the only way for the operating system and security applications to&nbsp;check this programmatically, since this is a standard method to detect, display
 and verify (via the file's&nbsp;signature), both the developer as well as the integrity (not corrupted or modified)&nbsp;status of a file.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Though not every file needs to be signed and even some Microsoft executables sometimes aren't, it's generally common to see the key executables for antimalware and other important security or key operating system files such as Explorer.exe for example&nbsp;which
 include them.&nbsp; In this case, the very fact that the additional modules are stored in another folder and unidentified is what both bothered you personally and makes the act of signing them&nbsp;even more important.</p>

Registry cleaners are extremely powerful applications that can damage the registry by using aggressive cleaning routines and cause your computer to become unbootable.<br />
Not all registry cleaners create a backup of the registry before making changes.<br />

            <p>Hi JulietNE,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to share your expertise with the post above. But I'm confused as to the point(s) you're making. Please know that I'm easily confused, so that's nothing new, nor anything with which to be concerned. Also, perhaps I'm not the
 only person reading this thread who is confused; I probably am, but anything is possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your first link above tells how to get rid of SparkTrust PC Cleaner Plus. Is that your recommendation? If not, what point are you making?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also mention registry cleaners, and the hazards they pose. Do some of the tools in SparkTrust PC Cleaner Plus fit into that category? If so, which ones? I can deactivate any of the individual scan tools, or just not utilize the other tools. For SparkTrust
 PC Cleaner Plus...</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Scan Tools</strong> are: Systems Issues; Privacy Protection; Malware Protection; Junk Files; and System Performance.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Tools</strong> are: Process manager; Startup Manager; File Manager; Defrag; and BHO manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies for my confusion but, with me, sometimes you have to state the overtly obvious. Please understand that I'm still trying to decide if I should recycle all my old IBM Basic &amp; Fortran punch cards, or donate my book&nbsp;<em>DOS For Dummies</em>&nbsp;to a
 local museum. Thankfully, my 1974 APL-based Snoopy printout turned yellow &amp; brittle and thus was discarded long ago. That is, I'm still making my way up the steep learning curve of today's basic computing technology. And that's "basic" with a lowercase "b."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, please accept my apologies for asking such obvious questions, and thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>What's causing the confusion here is the common practice in security forums&nbsp;of concentrating on the registry cleaning functions of such questionable programs, when in reality it's the complete program and the often shoddy development practices of the companies
 which create them that are the larger issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In truth, Windows itself has contained most of the functions just itemized which provide true value for decades, Microsoft either has made these operations automatic and invisible or placed them in management&nbsp;interfaces that few typical PC owners learn how
 to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By bringing these "utilities" together in a single GUI and making them apparent to the non-technical user, some products easily convince the less knowledgeable person that they provide some added value.&nbsp; Most technically knowledgeable users completely ignore
 such processes until we really need them and then simply use those built into Windows in most cases.&nbsp; Only the uber-geeks seem to care to use a handful of well known 3rd-party products, in most cases because they feel the products do a better job, most often
 again because they provide a more visible representation of what is supposedly happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The choice in such cases is between the supposedly more reputable products and those of less repute, but since in most cases this is splitting hairs I personally feel the entire genre of maintenance utilities are simply snake oil.&nbsp; If people wish to pay
 for something that Windows itself does for free, then more power to them for having the money to waste.&nbsp; For myself, I'll keep my money and let Windows take care of this maintenance or look up the tool built into Windows if I ever really need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you desire guidance to some of the Windows tools which provide the more important functions or the more reputable 3rd-party products which provide a more exposed interface, I'm sure JulietNE will have some recommendations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously this is my own opinion, so the decision of how to proceed on your own PC is entirely up to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside to this question, have you examined the executable(s)&nbsp;within the main SparkTrust PC Cleaner application folder to see whether these follow the best practice of digital signing?&nbsp; Beyond the reputation questions raised by JulietNE, if this company
 hasn't done something this basic then I question the true value of this application to provide security related functions like Privacy Protection and we already know that the vendor providing the Malware Protection has both ignored digital signing and has
 a questionable reputation as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rob</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt; EDIT &gt;&nbsp; Since you haven't replied to either Juliet or myself yet Brian, I'd like to ask you what exactly you feel is most important to you within the tools that the SparkTrust application supposedly provides?&nbsp; The reason I ask is that I'm not certain all
 the&nbsp;items Juliet has listed are good replacements, but then I was even surprised when I took a look at what the "Privacy Protection" actually does for example, since I don't consider most of the items mentioned there to have much meaning in terms of true&nbsp;privacy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the core problem with these questionable tools, since in many cases your own idea of what you are receiving from them might have no relationship to what they actually do, even if they really are doing something other than faking it completely.&nbsp; This
 is the most insidious side effect of the WYSIWYG interface, since just as with the common malware today that convince many to believe something untrue via social engineering, even apparently reputable programs can trick the unsuspecting user into believing
 they are doing something that they really aren't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I'm not saying this is what SparkTrust is doing, since I wouldn't ever install something like this to test it in the first place, just that the value of what you are receiving depends upon what you expect.&nbsp; So we need to understand this to provide
 the best advice as to what reputable and possibly even built-in Windows tools might do the job just as well.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a R9 380 and I've been trying to install the latest AMD driver on the latest Insider Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't install them however. As soon as it's going to switch to "Checking hardware..." it'll show me an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error I'm getting is "Detection driver error. Contact AMD for assistance".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not present on the latest "stable" build of Windows 10, it's working fine on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody got ideas?</p>

            <p>First, you must uninstall previously installed drivers. If that does not seem to work check the AMD web site for the uninstaller: amdcleanuputility.exe - it will search your system and uninstall everything AMD.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Excel 2007 ANSI E Printing Problem</h2>
                    Trying to print a flowchart in Excel 2007 on a HP DesignJet 500 plotter.&nbsp; I am trying to use ANSI E paper.&nbsp; When I set the correct printer and paper size and use print preview it will only let me preview to cell AO112.&nbsp; If I set the print area over AO112
 and then do print preview it is blank.&nbsp; The printer is working fine with ANSI E paper as I am able to print a Project 2003 file with no issues.&nbsp; I downloaded a new driver from HP but that did not help.&nbsp; I tried saving the file in 2003 and then print but got
 the same result.

<h2>            SMS notifications and sms icon blinking</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>I've solved almost all the problems of my nokia N8 with Symbian Belle.</p>
<p>Here are the last two :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- The SMS icon, in the top bar, is constantly blinking. I read on nokia help that it meant my inbox was full. Or it's not. It's almost empty (10 SMS).</p>
<p>How can i turn off that ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- A second problem is the SMS notification, that appears as a wild sequence of TV commercials would do during your favorite tv show : very annoying, whatever the circumstances.</p>
<p>The popup forbids me to do anything quietly and peacefully, i'm interrupted and have to click on it in order to make it disappear. (I don't care if Mr X is harassing me while i'm browsing the web)</p>
<p>I found on forums that they used tweaks but i would like an<u> official</u> solution to adress this problem !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;What's the rush? &nbsp;We've already waited the better part of 2 months, what's wrong with waiting a few more days? &nbsp;Personally I'd rather wait for them to "get it right" (whatever that entails) rather than ship out the likes of another 9926 build. &nbsp;YMMV</p>

    <title>Help With GPS options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nokasaurus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help With GPS options</h2>
                    
<p>I am using my phone and do not want any "data" transfer so the carrier doesn't pick my phone up as a smart phone.&nbsp; The phone is a 700.&nbsp; Note that I do have Mobile Data turned off and Allow Mobile Data Usage set to in home network only.&nbsp; Having the Data Usage
 settings configured that way might override how the following is set or should be set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am confused by all the "Positioning&nbsp; Methods" and other options.&nbsp; These are located under Settings/Applications Settings/Positioning/Positioning Methods.&nbsp; Here you have -</p>
<p>1- Assisted GPS</p>
<p>2- Integrated GPS</p>
<p>3- Bluetooth (self explanatory)</p>
<p>4- WiFi Network</p>
<p>5- Network Based</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are the differences in these options and which one or combination can I run for the best performance but without incurring any data charges?&nbsp; To further complicate things under Settings/Application Settings/Map Apps/General there are several additional
 options I do not understand exactly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1- Connection- either offline or online?</p>
<p>2-Network Destination- either Internet, multimedia message or WAP services</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a comment to Nokia, the manual sure leaves a lot to be desired.&nbsp; There should be an option by option explanation for these items along with a zillion more that I find on the phone but not in the documentation.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help all.</p>

<p>The attached User Guide should answer all the queries.. refer Pg. 6/7 for the First Part of query .. and Pg. 4 for the Second.. Network Destination should be 'Internet'</p>
<p>Integrated GPS&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;and Bluetooth GPS will give you Navigation without incurring any Data cost. But for the later you will need an external GPS receiver. The FIX will take much longer with the Integrated GPS.&nbsp;</span></p>
