<h2>            Error &#34;&#34;There are no backups available on this computer&#34; when trying to restore</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: there are no backups available on this computer</p>
<p>I'm trying to fix a Vista computer for a friend. I had to reinstall from original media after the HDD holding the system volume failed.&nbsp; We now need to restore user data from a Windows backup on external USB drive. I ran the Backup and Restore Centre, Restore
 Files (Advanced Restore) and selected "Files from a backup made on a different computer". The system responds: "There are no backups available on this computer".&nbsp; But there is one, of course - I can see it on the USB drive.&nbsp; How can I force Restore to read
 it?</p>

I use Vista myself, and these are certainly Vista backups - there are Catalogs, and the folder naming convention has the familiar Vista signature. &nbsp;The backups themselves are *.zip.
<div><br />
<div>I have had one lead (web search after a brainwave for a new search term). &nbsp;There's a critical file in the root of a drive holding backups called Mediaid.bin, and this can cause this problem (apparently) if missing or corrupt. &nbsp;There's a utility available
 which reputedly can fix this (from memory - sdutil.exe?). &nbsp;I'll be investigating when next on that machine.</div>

<div>Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;The truth is I can't quite remember now! &nbsp;However, it's overwhelmingly likely that I did try every combination of steps - each time I got the infuriating message "there are no backups available on this computer". &nbsp;I do remember
 thinking that Vista probably wouldn't recognise the backup has having been made on "this" computer, as it was a fresh install with (I'd guess) a different GUID somewhere than the original. &nbsp;I'd hate to think that I wouldn't have tested this assumption but
 a week or so later it's hard to be certain.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Nevertheless, progress is being made. &nbsp;I found some obscure references to <b>
MediaId.bin</b>, and also to a command-line tool called <b>wbadmin.exe</b>. &nbsp;After careful study of some rather rambling posts I found, I figured that I should try wbadmin.exe first, and only tinker with mediaid.bin if that failed. &nbsp;Problem is, this machine
 is Vista Home Premium, and wbadmin isn't available. &nbsp;I did try copying the executable from my own Vista Business PC, but I got a message saying "class not registered", which suggests that this has to be installed/registered/whatever. &nbsp;Didn't try any further
 - thought I'd get in more trouble that way...</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, I extracted a disk from the problem machine with a large empty partition and hooked that, and the USB drive holding the backups, onto my own machine. &nbsp;Bingo - the restore is proceeding as I write, with no glitches beyond the fact that I'll evidently
 need to take ownership and give myself permissions on the files restored, but I'll do that when the disk is back in the 'problem' machine, so that the user accounts used are valid ones.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I wonder how many people give up on a restore not knowing this is an option? &nbsp;Not impressed with this aspect of Vista, I must say. &nbsp;If anything needs to be robust, it's backup and restore of data.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'll post further if anything significant turns up, but for now it seems the problem is solved.</div>

            I did a sanity check, in case I <i>hadn't</i>&nbsp;tested my original assumption, and, as I thought, despite carefully trying every (!) combination the thing just insisted there were no backups available on this computer. &nbsp;Yet when I moved the drive to my own
 (running Vista Business) I was able to recover two separate "dates" - I've since repaired the all-important (6 GB!) Outlook.pst file, so he'll be happy...

<h2>            Windows Media Center&#63; &#40;discontinued&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Since Microsoft will no linger be supporting WMC, is it up for grabs? Meaning, is it available for an individual to&nbsp;purchase the rights&nbsp;so they can rewrite some of the coding, make it their own and remarket it as a separate program for resale?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems no one out there is into doing programs anymore and I think WMC would be an awesome resale product. I'd pay Microsoft&nbsp;or anyone else for that matter, if&nbsp;they had&nbsp;a product&nbsp;extremely similar to the WMC. There are a few companies out there trying
 but are&nbsp;far from a suitable replacement.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How to stop windows 10 downloading. MS support cancelled my - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to stop windows 10 downloading.  MS support cancelled my reservation and said that would solve the problem but it hasn&#39;t</h2>
                    <p><span>How can I prevent Windows 10 downloading automatically on my Surface pro 3 laptop?
</span></p>
<p><span>I have set updates to notify me before downloading and installing rather than installing automatically but even though I unchecked/unticked the windows 10 download update
 before going ahead with any downloads it still started downloading with the updates I did want and had checked/ticked. I stopped the windows 10 download but this meant I didn’t get the updates I did want.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have tried hiding the windows 10 update but still as soon as I download any update windows 10 starts to download and I have to stop it.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>I read on MS community support that removing KB3035583 from my installed updates
 would solve the problem but I don’t have KB303558 in my installed updates.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I contacted MS tech support and the tech person looked for KB3035583
 and couldn't find it.&nbsp; They then remotely cancelled my windows 10 reservation and said that would solve the problem but it hasn't, windows 10 still starts downloading every time I try to download other updates.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I asked tech support how to get rid of windows 10 which was still in the hidden updates (but unchecked/ticked) and they said it didn't matter as it wouldn't download.&nbsp;
 But something is wrong because trying to download any update starts windows 10 downloading.</span></span></p>
<p>The upgrade history shows windows 10 update failed several times which is probably because I keep interrupting it.&nbsp; But now I'm wondering if it has actually
 downloaded and is sitting somewhere trying to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can anyone throw any light on this?</p>

            <p>I have the exact same problem. Removed KB3035583 and I still have 20+ failed attempts to install it.</p>
<p>Didn't ask for and don't want it. This is my PC keep your f'n mits off it.&nbsp; KB3035583 should have never been installed as an important update that gets installed automatically. If it is the case though that means Windows 8.1 is a security issue and I should

            <p>There has been another thread on this which gives a solution - at least in my experience.&nbsp; Put&nbsp; 'How do I delay Windows 10 installation?' in the search box above and you'll find it.</p>

            <p>Please learn to read. That post is a rehash of how to do what the me and the original poster has done that does NOT stop Windows 10 from trying to install. For you people in the short bus here is a simple breakdown of what is happening.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>The get Windows 10 app was installed as an important update.</span></li><li><span>If you said yes, which most people did then changed your mind, the app still runs.</span></li><li><span>You can uninstall the app by removing KB3035583 and stop it from returning by hiding it.</span></li><li><span>Windows 10 still tries to install as an update 4 times a day down from 15+.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>So does everyone truly understand what is exactly happening now?

            <p>There's a registry hack which will fix the problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hit Windows key + R to open Run, type: regedit and click OK. Then navigate to the following key:&nbsp; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsUpdate\Auto Update\OSUpgrade</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the right hand pane, you'll see four values called respectively, <strong>AllowOSUpgrade</strong>,
<strong>KickoffDownload</strong>, <strong>KickoffSource </strong>and <strong>OSUpgradeInteractive</strong>. The values of each of these needs to be modified to read "<strong>0</strong>" (without quotes) as shown in the screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0b0571d9-bba0-4491-b034-f08b0ac9b932" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To modify a registry value, right click it and go to <strong>Modify</strong>. In the "Value field", change the single figure from a 1 into a
<strong>0</strong>. Windows will add the 0x00000000 itself. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After modifying the values in the right hand pane, you have to reboot in order for the changes to take effect.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you do any of this, create a manual System Restore point which can be used to wind back the clock to the time you created it just in case you inadvertently delete a key or a value somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To create a manual System Restore point do the following.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click the Start button and go to System.</li><li>In the left hand menu, click the link to System Protection.</li><li>Click the button at the bottom called Create and then give your Restore point a name, something you'll recognize later and then click OK.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you have to restore to that point, repeat steps 1 &amp; 2 and then click the System Restore button and find your Restore point.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running System Restore undoes any changes you made to the Registry. </p>

            Actually I am the original poster of this question and don't need to learn to read as I wrote the post.&nbsp; If you read to the end of the other post - How do I delay Windows 10 installation? - you will see that if you have cancelled your subscription, set
 updates to not automatically install,&nbsp; uninstalled KB 3035583 and hidden KB3035583 and windows 10 when they reappear when updates are checked for, then windows 10 will not download when you download other updates. It says it is downloading but doesn't in fact
 do so.&nbsp; It was someone on the other post who discovered that and I've since tried it and found windows 10 doesn't download with me either, it doesn't appear in the update history or in installed updates, even though every time I update it says it is downloading.<br />

            <p>I agreed with and have done everything in your original post short of contacting Microsoft because the I was on hold for three hours and had to be somewhere. My post was more of an opinion piece to get Microsoft to actually do something about it. So when
 I say "I have done that been there" and the next post points to an article telling me to do the same thing "rehash". I go under the assumption that person is not the original poster and has not read the context of my post. Now on the other hand Xircal has
 understood the context and provided a solution to our dilemma. You on the other hand need to understand what you are reading.
</p>
<p>P.S. Thanks again Xircal well done</p>

            <p>Well it's a potential solution for those who are happy to tinker with the registry.&nbsp; My experience is that this hasn't been necessary.&nbsp; I no longer have the 'dilemma' of windows 10 downloading when I don't want it and can install it next year when I may
 be ready for it and when IT at my work may be ready to support it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I posted this question I hadn't gone far enough in two ways.&nbsp; 1. MS support couldn't find KB3035583 to uninstall it but I've since looked in installed updates myself and found it and uninstalled it. 2. I kept cancelling update downloads because each
 time windows 10 said it was downloading with the other updates.&nbsp; For those who are not happy to change the registry settings it is worth at least trying the method that has worked for me and others (see 'How do I delay Windows 10 installation?) and at least
 finding out if it works for you. </p>
<p>Cancel your subscription to windows 10 (it seems you can reactivate it later if you wish within the year in which windows 10 is available for free), set updates to not automatically install but let you choose,&nbsp; uninstall KB 3035583 (search in installed updates)
 and hide KB3035583 and windows 10 when they reappear when updates are checked for, then windows 10 will not download when you download other updates. It says it is downloading (which is somewhat irritating, not to say unnerving) but doesn't in fact do so.&nbsp;
 If this works for you it is less drastic than altering the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be giving feedback to Microsoft technical support having now dealt with two of them in some hours of web chat during which time no solution was provided.&nbsp; It was a very unsatisfactory experience with every appearance that they didn't know what they
 were doing.&nbsp; The way windows 10 update has been handled leaves much to be desired.&nbsp; It's one thing offering a free OS 'upgrade' but users have to have clear options on when or indeed whether to upgrade.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you responded to DDriggs and I hope you won't mind me jumping in here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Something which has to be borne in mind I think and that is the fact that once installed, users only have 28 days (not a whole month) to downgrade to their previous OS. If they exceed that period, then W10 becomes set in stone and cannot be removed except
 by resetting the system. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are third party tools around that purport to allow a user to downgrade at any time, but Microsoft may well take steps to prevent that at some point in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now then, you said that W10 only gives the appearance of downloading again, but doesn't in fact do so. Maybe you're right, but the problem appears to affect users differently and in that respect if it were to redownload and the user had already exceeded
 their 28 day grace period, then they're going to be stuck with an operating system they don't want and can't get rid of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is indeed reprehensible on Microsoft's part to force another operating system on users without giving them the choice of whether to accept it or not. Furthermore, they don't seem to be all that concerned about it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Similarly, the rollback feature appears to work for some users, but not others which is where we are now in this thread.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To my way of thinking though, a registry key called "OSUpgrade" as part of the tree leading to WindowsUpdate\Auto Update speaks volumes. Couple that with a value called "KickOffDownload" with a value meaning "Allow" and you don't need to be a rocket scientist
 to figure out what that means.</p>

            <p>I'm also having this issue. I have contacted Microsoft 2 times now. The first time, the tech corrected the registry keys as shown below and told me to reboot my system. I did and the problem still persisted, so off I went to round 2. I got into touch with
 Microsoft again and this time the tech did some registry commands, shut off all non-Windows services, turned off a few Windows services (wish I'd have been able to take a screenshot, but she was controlling my computer the whole time and I don't remember what
 the services are), then ran a file she created called gg.bat with the following commands:</p>
<p>
</p><p>regsvr32.exe atl.dll<br />
regsvr32.exe urlmon.dll<br />
regsvr32.exe mshtml.dll<br />
regsvr32.exe shdocvw.dll<br />

regsvr32.exe wucltux.dll<br />
regsvr32.exe muweb.dll<br />
regsvr32.exe wuwebv.dll<br />
</p>
<p>After running that she turned the Windows services back on, rebooted, and checked Windows Update. Success! OR so it seemed. As soon as the Windows Updates were installed (everything except for KB3035583 which as you know is the nag program that asks you
 to reserve your copy of Windows) the nag box came back telling me my upgrade was ready and that I needed to reboot!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have to go through the whole 3 hour process again just to fix this and ask them to KEEP IT FIXED this time apparently.</p>

<h2>            Silverlight does not work after installing Windows 8.</h2>
                    I have recently upgraded from Win 7 to Win 8 but now I find that my Silverlight apps no longer work. I am prompted to install Silverlight, which I do, but then I get a message that Silverlight is already installed and I go back to square one.&nbsp; It is like
 groundhog day.&nbsp; I have also gone into Control panel and deleted Silverlight and reinstalled.&nbsp; It re-installs but my apps still do not recognise it and prompt me to install Silverlight.&nbsp; Is Silverlight compatible with Win 8?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting this question in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely try and help you in fixing the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may go through the steps from the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a> and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists you may start the computer in a clean boot state and check. Clean boot helps eliminate any third party software conflict.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items
 check box.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>f) On the ‘Startup’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup
 item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Step 2:</b> Enable half of the services</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span>Step 3:</b> Determine whether the problem returns</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally
 selected in the Service list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared
 in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem.
 Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span>Step 4:</b> Enable half of the Startup items</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service
 may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 5:</b> Determine whether the problem returns</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally
 selected in the Startup Item list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared
 in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is
 selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service
 may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span>Step 6:</b> Resolve the problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether
 the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span>Step 7:
</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Rohit,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have found that I can get full access to my Silverlight application if I go via the Desktop rather than Windows 8 Start Page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not attempted to do what you have suggested above as it is too many steps and I can get access via the Desktop.&nbsp; Not ideal, but it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe there is a compatibility issue between Silverlight and the new Win 8 interface and I will leave that for you folk to sort out.&nbsp; I have had a similar problem with accessing MSN Money/Investing, which is also a Silverlight application.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you can sort this out because I like Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>jon</p>

            <blockquote>I have recently upgraded from Win 7 to Win 8 but now I find that my Silverlight apps no longer work. I am prompted to install Silverlight, which I do, but then I get a message that Silverlight is already installed and I go back
 to square one.&nbsp; It is like groundhog day.&nbsp; I have also gone into Control panel and deleted Silverlight and reinstalled.&nbsp; It re-installs but my apps still do not recognise it and prompt me to install Silverlight.&nbsp; Is Silverlight compatible with Win 8?
</blockquote>
I had the exact same issue. It appeared that the client application was a 64-bit application. What gave me the hint is that, when I get redirected to Silverlight install page, it says that it will only work in 32 bits.
<div>I own the application, so I can re-compile it. Changing the target platform from "Any CPU" to "x86" fixed the issue for this app.</div>
<div>In the same way, using "Internet Explorer" in 32 bit mode should get you going. I did not tried.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Bottom line, no 64 bits Silverlight - which may break some applications. Also, I found this article:&nbsp;http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2010/01/why-microsoft-isnt-working-on-silverlight-64-bit/</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 update wiped out my email accounts in the Mail App.</h2>
                    Finally updated Windows 10 today to the version that came out in September 2017.&nbsp; When it came back online the Mail App was missing 5 out of my six accounts. The only account that stayed was the hotmail account. It also erased my bookmarks bar.&nbsp; Due to
 the fact that I have them deleted from the server when they enter the mail app I have lost ALL my emails.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; I did a recovery and the mail app showed my original emails briefly and then they disappeared again.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; I am so frustrated.&nbsp;
 And saying that the app doesn't store things is not completely true.&nbsp; As I made email specific folders in the apps all those folders and emails have also disappeared.&nbsp; The email addresses are from different servers as well, so it is not a particular server.&nbsp;
 Also, how do i get my bookmarks bar back?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two updates that occurred on September 2017 that fixes issues with Windows 10. The only know issues for one of the updates are with the performance of Microsoft Edge and something about the Windows logon registry key that conflict with the app
 readiness service. However, both of the issue has a fix already and shouldn't be an issue. That's why it's odd for the email accounts to be removed in Mail app, and also affected the bookmarks bar. Let us isolate your concern by providing the answers to these
 questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What do you mean when you say "<strong>Recovery</strong>"?</li><li>Have you tried re-adding your email accounts to see if it'll work?</li><li>What bookmarks button are you referring to?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<h3> mikewarren1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with backup and bootable media creator</h2>
                    In Windows 10, ver. 1709 (unable to install 1803) I am having problems with creating some sort of backup file, whether it be system restore, or system image.&nbsp; Also I cannot create some sort of bootable backup or repair drive, other than the DVD, which
 I don't use.&nbsp; Everyone uses flash or USB 'sticks' these days because they are cheap and dependable, and DVD was not.&nbsp; I have up to 32 mb on USB drive, so I should be able to create a bootup drive simply, or possibly store a system image file on this as well.&nbsp;
 Why won't this work?&nbsp; Has microsoft taken these features out or Windows, or hidden them in menus?

            First I am assuming you meant to say 32gb and not mb... because mb will not be enough space.
<br />
<br />Try this go to search and type control panel and open it.
<br />Then select Category in the top right.
<br />Go to system and security 
<br />Go to Backup and restore (windows 7)
<br />From there you can do a system image which will take a full copy of your machine, you may need more than 32gb for that however.
<br />You can create a system repair disc to boot to if you need to get a recovery environment but this does not protect you data or apps.
<br />As for the backup it is not working reliably so i would not recommend using that part.
<br />Look at Macrium as a solution or i just use onedrive for data backups.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have further questions.

            Yes, because the system restore from the old windows 7, is not working in my machine, but I just wanted to create a bootable USB drive.&nbsp; I bet there is an aftermarket app online that can to this.&nbsp; It seems that it was all in Windows at one time.&nbsp; Now,
 getting my Toshiba to boot from USB might be a problem, since it offers boot from disc, or LAN, but not sure about USB drive.&nbsp; I had one before, but Windows has changed too much, and some features are either not in the menus, or just very hard to find.

            Follow the steps in the link provided to get a bootable usb, i think this will work on CD as well.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-bootable-usb-flash-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Also just to let you know that windows 10 has a recovery built in. Basically you can force o force your machine to get into the recovery screen.
<br />To do this boot up and wait for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle, when you see that press and hold power button to shut down.
<br />Boot up again and do the same thing by waiting for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle then shut down, power up for the 3rd time and you should get repair screen.
<br />Let it run.
<br />You will then get a screen with the Automatic Repair, select the Advanced Options.
<br />See if that works too.

<h2>            File &#40;Windows&#41; Explorer freezes</h2>
                    <p>Just upgraded to a new laptop. Came with Windows 10 Home 64 bit and Office Home and Student (2016). My previous files were (are) all&nbsp;Microsoft Word 97 - 2003 Document (.doc).&nbsp; I have been saving my old .doc or .xls files in the new Office form as a .docx
 or .xlsx, but when I try to open the new files (doc &amp; xls), Windows (file) explorer freezes (Not responding). It only happens with the newer office file versions. The old Word and Excel 97 - 2003 files open no problem. I then have to use Task Manager to restart.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Using Same Account at Different Consoles</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. Me and my friends wonder, what if I log in from another console and try to download a game which I already purchased and downloaded to my own console? And another question, what if my account gets banned from Xbox Live and I have to download a game which
 I already purchased before (let's say I don't have enough space on my hdd and had to delete a game, now I want to re-download)?</p>

<p>hi you wont get banned, now there is something you would have to do:</p>
<p>you can transfer content licenses from one console to another once every four months.</p>
<p>If your console was recently repaired or if you’ve purchased a new console, use the license transfer option on your console to transfer content licenses. Here’s how (but works for this):</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;On your console, sign in to Xbox Live using the gamertag that you used to purchase the content.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don't know your gamertag? See Download, move, or delete your Xbox Live profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Need to find your Microsoft account? See Find your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can't remember the password for your Microsoft account? See Recover your Microsoft account password.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Go to Settings and select Account.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Under Your Billing Options, select License Transfer.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Follow the instructions to transfer the content licenses.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;After the licenses are transferred, you need to download the content again to update the local licenses. For information about how to do this, see Download content you’ve previously purchased(
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/downloadable-content/redownload-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../redownload-content</a>).</p>
<p>After you follow these steps, content can be used by other profiles on your console and when you’re not connected to Xbox Live.</p>
<p>hope that helps:)</p>
<p>(also not everything you do will get you banned, you can get suspended for like not paying the bills but it is a community report system)</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>You can log onto another console and download a game you already purchased so you can play it on the other console.. Keep in mind other users on that console will only be able to play the game if the content owner is logged into that console.</p>
<p>Redownloading because you don't have space isn't issue. It might be wiser to pick up a 32GB thumbdrive so you don't have to delete the content. Sometimes content gets removed and isn't downloadable anymore.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

    <title>How do I communicate with MICROSOFT Support&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I communicate with MICROSOFT Support&#63;</h2>
                    <p>2 days ago I had a Windows 10 update. Afterwards my laptop was unusable. It takes several minutes for the laptop to start. Then another few minutes for the login box to appear. Logging in takes a few minutes more but at least the keyboard isn't disabled
 at this point.&nbsp; The desktop when it eventually appears has the toolbar missing. Clicking on any Icon makes nothing happen but at least the touchpad is working at this point. After 20 minutes the google screen I was working on when the Windows update started,
 appears. That's it. The keyboard and cursor/touchpad are frozen now and nothing can be done except switch the laptop off.</p>
<p>I have tried following various instructions on various sites to reinstate the cursor and keyboard. However, as the Windows 10 update disables both cursor and keyboard at the same time, none of these remedies work.</p>
<p>I have telephoned Microsoft, left a message on the answerphone but nobody gets back to me.</p>
<p>I have emailed Microsoft but nobody gets back to me.</p>
<p>The virtual assistant tells me I have to buy a new laptop or pay for Windows 10 again. Was the Windows 10 update a form of ransomeware as these solutions both make me give money to Microsoft for something I've already got? My laptop is only 15 months old
 so I don't want to replace it.. In any case, Microsoft could do the same disabling actions to the new one as soon as I got it.</p>
<p>I have waited for hours in queues for Chat but I never get there. After waiting for 30 minutes, I get a message saying I have exceeded the waiting time and get thrown out of the queue and have to start again. I got to 4th in the queue once but the queues
 are to long for me to get to the front in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>I have tried to book a Call back but I always get ' An error has occurred - try again later' .</p>
<p>So, does anyone know a contact number that is answered or an email address that is answered or any other way to get in touch with a worthwhile person at Microsoft?</p>

<p>Thanks for your offer of help. However, the keyboard is&nbsp;so badly disabled&nbsp;that I can't get past the login screen now.&nbsp;I can't type in the password. I can't get as far as&nbsp;'type in winver'. All of the solutions I've seen to the issues require ability to type
 and/or use the touchpad but as the Windows 10 update has made this impossible, all of the solutions I've read about are impossible.</p>
<p>I'm beginning to see why the 'solution' recommended by the Virtual Agent is to buy a new laptop and throw my existing hundreds of euros worth of equipment in the bin.</p>

<p>Something to understand:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is installed on over 600 million devices worldwide. And that's just Windows 10. Microsoft has many other products that are still supported. Office alone is used by hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you really think it makes sense for Microsoft to hire enough people to sit in a room at their headquarters and take phone calls from that many users for that many products?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, what Microsoft has is a 'train-the-trainer' setup, whereby it trains third-parties to go out and provide the support that people need. That's who you'll be talking to, if you insist on talking to a live person. But those people need to support their
 families, so you should expect to pay for that kind of knowledge. Very many organizations do exactly that.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, there are many resources available to people at little cost or even no cost. But at that price, you and I should expect that more effort on our part will be required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The internet is a fabulous resource and it's free, but we have to do the work to get that information. There are also plenty of books to read, courses to take, and user groups (like this one) to join, but again, we have to invest the time and effort to get
 the most out of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Microsoft also hires third-party contractors to act as if they were Microsoft support technicians. But in reality, they're mostly regular people reading from the scripts and instruction materials they were give.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For someone who's not willing to pay, and not willing to make the initiative to learn, I don't know what else there is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not that I'm any kind of example to follow, but I have spent time and effort to learn on my own and for that reason I really don't have problems with Windows 10. There's plenty about Windows 10 that I don't like, I can assure you of that. But it works correctly
 for me and it can work correctly for you too.</p>

            I use my laptop for fairly basic uses. I read,send &nbsp;and answer emails. I do a little internet shopping. I use Skype to contact family and friends. I book holidays, flights, hotels. I store photos and music. I read news, weather, sports.&nbsp;
<div>To use an analogy, I have a car. Every now and then I get a recall.An airbag has to be modified or the assisted steering needs a tweak. I make an appointment and deliver the car After this work is done, I expect to drive the car away.</div>
<div>Compare the Micrsoft experience. Microsoft decided to change the version of Windows 10 on my laptop. I have set the update settings not to happen between 08.00 and 17.00. But as Windows 10 is on 600 million computers why should they care what I want. So
 at 10.00 they threw me out and dumped an incompatible mess on my laptop. Never mind that I was doing something important to me. Back to the analogy : I couldn't start the car so I have been given a link to an online manual explaining to mechanics how to adjust
 engine management systems. Great for those interested and know how to use the manual.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The rest of us untechnical idiots who had working equipment can go screw ourselves now that our access has been taken away.&nbsp;</div>

<p>After reading the many "fixes" that are out there and not being a technical person, this is insane.&nbsp; We all have machines that work perfectly.&nbsp; Windows does a download and everything goes out the window with zero support except self learning.&nbsp; If my car
 breaks down, the vehicle manufacturer does not send me a repair manual.&nbsp; Microsoft, essentially, is sending me a manual to do my own repair from something they caused.</p>
<p>I have lost confidence in Microsoft and their attempts&nbsp; to keep their non-technical customers happy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's time to investigate Apple.</p>

</p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That's where you're wrong, unfortunately. Your machine did not work perfectly. Perhaps it seemed to you like it did, but under the hood it was waiting for a straw to break its camel's back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An update from Microsoft does not 'cause everything to go out the window' when it's installed on a computer that's been setup correctly. Updates are written for computers that have a supported configuration. When they install on a computer with an unsupported
 configuration the results are unpredictable but usually bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, nothing created by humans is perfect so Windows 10 has bugs. But those bugs affect specific configurations under specific circumstances. They don't cause everything to go out the window.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/02/windows-10-fall-creators-update-reaches-85-percent-of-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ArsTechnica has reported</a> that the Fall Creators Update is installed on 85% of Windows 10 PCs. And since updates
 are cumulative, that means 85% of Windows 10 PCs are up to date. Where does that leave you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some people who just don't 'get it' and likely never will. Others are done in by their own attitudes ("It's
<em>MY</em> computer and Micro*** isn't going to tell me what to do" etc.) You don't sound like either of those people. All you have to do is to learn how to use your computer correctly. It ain't rocket science. Any fool can do it. (Proof: I did it.)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To follow your illustration: If you want a mechanic to fix your car, you expect to pay for that service. You should expect the same for a computer. On the other hand, you learned how to drive, so why not learn how to use a computer?<br />

<p>I get your analogy of a car but your response is flawed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer has worked perfectly for 2 years with ZERO problems.&nbsp; Directly, after the last "update", my computer is on Quaaludes.&nbsp; I can take a nap while it decides what it's doing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When an update causes problems like mine, I shouldn't have to hire a&nbsp; "mechanic".</p>
<p>I have many friends who have Apple products and do not have these issues...ever.</p>
<p>You may have time to spend hours learning you system, which, I admire.&nbsp; I don't have that luxury.</p>
<p>My business depends on a system that does not do what the W10 system is currently doing.</p>
<p>Especially when there is no easy answer from Microsoft.&nbsp; I know you want to castigate me for thinking that way but this is getting OLD and my business can't wait.&nbsp; It will be quicker for me to purchase a new system...just to get going.</p>
<p>I will check out Apple but I won't sell my Microsoft stock.&nbsp; The stock doesn't give me grief.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the exact and complete error message that you get?</p>
<p>2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the frustration when you cannot connect to WiFi. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Roll back to the previous version of driver was an apt troubleshooting step. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When a network problem occurs in Windows, the Network troubleshooter helps to diagnose and repair the problem. After diagnosing a problem, the Network troubleshooter will suggest ways for fixing it. Sometimes the troubleshooter can even fix the problem automatically
 without any intervention from you. The Network troubleshooter can also detect whether a computer's wireless networking capability is turned off.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Use the <strong>Network Troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p><strong>a:</strong> Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and tap <strong>
Search</strong>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, then click
<strong>Search</strong>.) </p>
<p><strong>b:</strong> In the search box, enter <strong>network troubleshooter.</strong></p>
<p><strong>c: </strong>In the search results, tap or click <strong>Identify and repair network problems</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Check for the latest Windows updates.</p>
<p><strong>a:</strong> Swipe in from the right edge of the screen and tap <strong>
Settings</strong>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the bottom-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, then click
<strong>Settings</strong>.) </p>
<p><strong>b: </strong>Tap or click <strong>Change PC settings</strong>, tap or click
<strong>Update and recovery</strong>, then tap or click <strong>Windows Update.</strong></p>
<p><strong>c: </strong>Tap or click <strong>Check now</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>d:</strong> If there are updates available, tap or click <strong>View details</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>e:</strong> Tap or click to select the updates you want to install, then tap or click
<strong>Install</strong>.</p>

            Sorry, you miss understood me.&nbsp; The problem is not resolved.&nbsp; I followed your instructions to check the device status in the device manager and it reports that 'the device is working properly'.&nbsp; However I am not able to connect to my work network as mentioned
 in my initial question.&nbsp; So far no progress has been made to resolve the issue apart from doing the checks you've asked.
