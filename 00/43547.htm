</p><p>When you're joining a group call, you may have grown to already love the window that allows you to select your video and mic settings before hopping in. We've made some small improvements to that screen that we'd like to share with you! Not only can you
 enter with your video off, but when you turn your video on, you can also turn on Background Blur before you even hop on the call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've also started to remember your settings. When you join calls with the same settings multiple times, we will automatically select those same toggles for you - making it easier to just get in the call!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Latest update of windows is causing numerous programs to fail to - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Latest update of windows is causing numerous programs to fail to launch</h2>
                    <p>After the latest Windows 10 update, I've had several issues with my PC. Several programs including GIMP (GNU image manipulation program), and the settings program will not launch at all. I get the "loading" cursor and nothing happens. Both applications were
 working fine prior to the update. In addition to this Google Chrome has been immediately crashing every time it encounters a website that requires adobe flash, for some reason.
</p>
<p>I don't know what the heck is going on here, but it has to be related to the update. Nothing else has been changed or downloaded in the last several weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PC is custom built and running Windows 10 Pro. Any help would be much appreciated!&nbsp;</p>

            Hi hqt
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If an update is not installing or making your system unstable, I rwould emove the update and block it from installation. 
<br />
<br />Due to the millions of configurations out there, some might not be fully compatible with a particular cumulative update.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart into Normal mode then check if stability/functionality is restored. If it is, proceed with the next steps.
<br />
<br />What I recommend you do is block the update for the time being and report it in the Feedback Hub so the Windows engineers are aware of the issue. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-submit-a-suggestion-or-bug-report-in-windows-10-using-feedback-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-su...</a>
<br />
<br />The update will try to install again, so use the following to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes. 
<br />
<br />Information in the above link is sourced from a trusted Microsoft MVP blog.

            Hi HQ.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Re-register the Start Menu and any otherWindows apps not working from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />2) See if any other installed apps/programs have a Reset available at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; App Name &gt; Advanced Settings.  If not try uninstalling fully, restart PC, reinstall from fresh download  
<br />
<br />3) If this was caused by a Version Update then you can roll it in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Update History, then uninstall them from the link there, and immediately hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here: <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2</a>...
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them: <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t</a>...
<br />
<br />System Restore can be run when WIndows will not start from Repair Mode reached by whichever method works here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If you want to further repair go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />5) Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />6) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            same problem. It isn't my computer that is screwed up. It was a load from cold to get rid of the STD called W10. The printer driver select window update button is the kiss of death.

<h2>            Windows 10 system image restore failure with brand new computer, including message &#34;A configuration change was requested to clear this computer&#39;s TPM &#40;Trusted Platform Module&#41;&#34;.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Subject: Windows 10 system image restore failure with brand new computer, including message "A configuration change was requested to clear this computer's TPM (Trusted Platform Module)".</strong><br />
<br />
Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already searched long and hard to find answers to this.... <br />
I am new to these forums, so apologies in advance if I haven't been looking in the right place.<br />
<br />
I have just bought a brand new laptop on 11 august 2017. The spec is:<br />
- Lenovo Ideapad 110-17IKB installed with Windows 10<br />
- Intel i5-7200U dual core 2.5GHz (3Mb cache)<br />
- 4Gb RAM<br />
- Intel HD Graphics 620<br />
- AMD Radeon R5 M430 (with 2Gb dedicated memory)<br />
- It was bought in France so settings/control panels comes up in french, and it has a french azerty keyboard.<br />
<br />
<br />
PROBLEM WITH FAILURE OF SYSTEM IMAGE RESTORE PROCEDURE:<br />
<br />
As soon as I collected the new computer and got home:<br />
<br />
1) I made a USB recovery drive (though I'm not sure if this was a "system image" or just a collection of recovery points).<br />
2) I also then made a set of "system image" DVDs and a "system repair" CD.<br />
3) I checked all 4 of the DVDs, and and I could see the files on the disks in explorer.<br />
<br />
4) Then I tried to reinstall the system image using these disks, to make sure that it was all ok. And this is where the trouble started.<br />
First there was a problem to recognise the DVD while using the wizard of the system image reinstall procedure, but then it seemed to recognise the disk ok.<br />
So when I tried to reinstall with the DVDs, it appeared to go ok until the computer couldn't recognise the 2nd DVD.<br />
I tried to reinsert and re-read the 2nd DVD so many times, but finally had to give up.<br />
I therefore was forced to abort this installation of the system image, as I didn't see any other possible way out.<br />
Then I tried to just let the computer reboot and repair itself, but this did not work.<br />
<br />
5) I then managed to reboot off the "system repair" CD that I had made, and did the following:<br />
5a) I tried to install again the image off the "system image" DVDs, but this time not even the 1st "system image" DVD was recognised.<br />
5b) I tried to reinstall from the USB recovery disk that I had made (in step 1 above).<br />
5c) I agreed to a reinstalltion of the computer, which then led to...<br />
5d)... "A configuration change was requested to clear this computer's TPM (Trusted Platform Module)" =&gt; I selected "NO".<br />
5e)... then "Installation de Windows - votre PC va redémarrer à plusieurs reprises" counting slowly up to 100%.<br />
(in english: Windows installation - your PC is going to restart many times)<br />
5f)... then the same screens came up as when first buying the computer (eg. country location, usual language for applications, etc.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">After the above failed reinstall episode with the "system image" DVDs, I would be very grateful for help with the following:</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Q1)</strong> Is the USB recovery drive that I made (in step 1 above) a complete "system image" or is it just a collection of recovery points?<br />
<strong>Q2)</strong> I am concerned that the system installation is now damaged on the computer. How can I know for sure whether or not the system installation is damaged?<br />
<strong>Q3)</strong> How can I know if the above reinstallation (in step 5e above) has repaired the problem properly, thus leaving me with a "good-as-new" Windows installation?<br />
<strong>Q4)</strong> How can I know for sure whether or not the set of system image DVDs I initially made (in step 2 above) are defective or corrupted?<br />
<strong>Q5)</strong> What might be the problem that stopped the system image disks to be recognised during reinstallation?<br />
<strong>Q6)</strong> Should I now make a new set of system image DVDs?<br />
<strong>Q7)</strong> Is it better now to save a further system image on an external hard drive? Is that feasible to do?<br />
<strong>Q8)</strong> After the reinstall, the airplane mode button on the keyboard wasn't working anymore, though now (after a few days) it appears to have fixed itself. What does this mean?<br />
<br />
My thanks in advance for your help.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions regarding failure of system image restore, you may refer to the following information:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>The USB recovery drive that you made is a complete system image.</li><li>Normally, you will receive an error message/code if there is a corrupted system files.</li><li>It is normal to&nbsp;count slowly up to 100% when installing Windows because it is loading not only your Windows components, but also the configurations that you have set.</li><li>You can use a third-party DVD checker app to check your burned CD/DVD.</li><li>If Windows encountered error during burning due to poor quality of the CD/DVD.</li><li>If you'll encounter any errors/issues when using the third-party DVD checker app, you may consider using a high quality blank CD/DVD.</li><li>Yes. It is better to have a system image/backup on your hard drive.</li><li>If you install any updates on your computer, there is a possibility that your drivers will be updated as well.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We would appreciate it if you could get back to us and provide us your feedback.</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do you have any 3rd party anti-virus installed on the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>If you have any 3rd party anti-virus installed on the computer, then uninstall it and check if it resolves the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><b><span>Disclaimer</span></b><span>:</span><span> If
 you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Turn OFF the Windows Firewall from the Windows feature, restart the computer and turn ON the feature and check if it helps to fix the issue. Refer to the link mentioned below and follow the steps to access Windows feature.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Turn Windows features on or off<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off</a><br />
<div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Start the Windows Firewall Services manually.</div>
<div><br />
You can start the Windows Firewall services manually as well as make sure it starts automatically in the future. To do this, follow the steps below:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Start button, then type Services in the Search box. </li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click Services. Note: there will be a cogwheel located next to it. Then click Run as administrator. If&nbsp; prompted, enter your administrator user name and password, then press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li><li>Scroll until you see Windows Firewall. Double click Windows Firewall.<br />
</li><li>Click the drop down menu next to Startup type, then choose Automatic.<br />
</li><li>Under Service status, if it is listed as Stopped, click Start.<br />
</li><li>Click Apply, then click OK.<br />
</li><li>Scroll until you see Base Filtering Engine. Double click Base Filtering Engine.<br />
</li><li>Under Service status, if it is listed as Stopped, click Start.<br />
</li><li>Click Apply, then click OK.<br />
</li><li>Restart Windows. Windows Firewall should be enabled.</li></ol>
<div><strong>Method 4:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would also suggest you to download and run the latest Microsoft Safety Scanner on your computer and check if it helps:

<div><strong>Note: </strong>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</div>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I liked it better then Fable 2 but it has some faults. It's just a little too easy (well both Fable 2 and 3) and a little on the "small" side. But overall, if it's cheap now (I'm sure it is), it's at least entertaining for a while.<br />

Don't let the Menu System turn you off to it. It's just another stupid gimmick by Peter M. All it really ends up being is another Menu in a Menu.</span></p>

<p>I liked Fable 3, but then again, I think I'm in the minority in liking the franchise. Even though the games have failed to live up to Peter Molyneux's bloated pre-release hype, I still think they're fun for what they are. Lighthearted, easy-mode adventure
 games. 3 included. The menu system does suck though, but you get used to it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm quite a long time computer user... pre PC ...and I am very reluctant to work on the registry.&nbsp; Too many dusty skills.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to "reserve" my copy of Windows 10 so that I wouldn't miss out. I am currently using Windows 7. The information given was that I could chose when I wanted to actually update, so I was very surprised when it was downloading and preparing for installation
 with no step to actually decide when I was going to chose to update. I was very worried when it gave me only a choice of 3 days!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem being that my back-up drive has failed and I do not have a current backup of my files. I have much work that is not replaceable and there is far too much to burn onto DVD. Some of the earlier stuff is backed up on another computer. But the more
 current work, not so much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am severely worried about shutting down my computer out of fear that it will install Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted&nbsp; a few update files and everything went okay after that installation time window. But my Action Centre says that the computer has to be restarted in order to complete installation of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I really have to dive into the registry? My system already is flakey and will not roll back to a previous saved version. Not sure why. (I've tried that to cope with one or two things.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether I have to go into the registry or not. I think it might be handy to have the complete set of instructions including what updates to search for and remove as well as what files to delete and what registery items to alter and how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that there won't be anything that forces a reboot of my system. Luckily it's a notebook so having the plug pulled or a power failure won't be a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Darrell</p>
<p>Programmer from the '70s</p>

            <p>I wish I could help you, but I think Windows 10 is already installed on your computer and just needs the restart to become active. &nbsp;I could be wrong! &nbsp;Good Luck! &nbsp;By the way, I got you beat, I started with computers in 1957. &nbsp;In 1990, I could not get a job,

            <p>I only wish I knew if I got past the tipping point where the danger of going forward was minimal for the installation. They were still recommending backing up before continuing though... so I fear that point hadn't been reached yet.</p>
<p>I'm not sure when I can get a back-up drive... and right now realize that I might have to do a restart to install the back-up drive even if it is an external one or even an external LAN one. :-(</p>

            <p>I know how you feel Darrell, 10 is quite invasive and that’s a big shame for MS. I would say the 10 is an update and not a clean install. The note in your action center all it means now is that the download is complete and after reboot you will get the option
 (among others which I forget) to keep your existing files and setting. I will let it install (it did not delete any files or change settings in my case) and after the 10 will be activated by registering your hardware with the MS servers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the 10 installation you can follow this thread on how to remove 10 if you decide to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest to try and locate the download in your laptop and keep it. Later you can copy it into a DVD and perform a clean install if you wish</p>

            <p>It's kind of confusing from the MS side. When my 10 was downloaded and I clicked install there was no option to backup to a DVD/USB so I clicked the install and save my files / settings and it installed and got my laptop approved at the same time. That is
 the upgrade and you must do this first to get you PC approved otherwise the 10 will never get approved and it will expire in 30 days at which time you must download again and repeat the above</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do the backup to a DVD/USB there is a utility at MS site to do so and after you download the uitility the options are to do a clean install or backup to a DVD/USB. I choosed backup to DVD and it did it. Then used the setup.exe from the DVD to do a clean
 install over my C:\</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 was working fine now my computer wont start up.</h2>
                    &nbsp;I installed windows 10 on my HP everything was working fine and today I go on my computer and the screen is black with a white sand bar spinning. I restarted my computer and the same thing happens. It will not allow me to do anything. It is like the Computer
 is in consist start up mode as in when you first turn it on and the little white circle appears and it is spinning. Not sure how to fix this or what I should do.&nbsp;

<h2>            Please allow users to make the &#34;SHOW DESKTOP&#34; button bigger.</h2>
                    <p>this is TOTALLY ridiculous. the show desktop button is TINY. i've used it since windows 98 and prefer to have it centered on my taskbar somewhere. your alternative of pressing the 'windows' key + w or whatever it was, is stupid too. i play games. the win
 key is in a horrible spot for that, you're in the middle of a game and u accidently press your win key and you're thrown out to&nbsp; your desktop. i simply remove them from my keyboard. please bring the option to have a BIG SHOW DESKTOP BUTTON back. if you dont....well..."i
 guess i could burn down the building" =p</p>

<h2>            Wireless Speed Wheel support&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>The Wireless Speed Wheel is VERY responsive with NFS:HP, NFS:Shift and NFS:TheRun, so i was wondering -
<strong>Did anyone play Most Wanted with the Speed Wheel?</strong> Does it have <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Rumble</span>? Responsive? No deadzone (NFS: Carbon, Underground and others have deadzones that make them unplayable with a wheel of any sort)?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Recore PC questions&#58; ultrawide 3440x1440, xbox controller and game streaming</h2>
                    
<p>Thinking about buying this. But does it support my ultra wide resolution 3440x1440?</p>
<p>Also can I use my xbox controller who is connected? Not the Xbox one but the normal one? Works fine for steam games.</p>
<p>Also one more thing. If I buy it through the windows store does it have some sort of streaming functionality? Like on steam I can stream the game from my gaming rig upstairs (R9 290 graphics card running windows 10) to my htpc (i5-6500 graphics running windows
 10) who is connected to my 4k (3840x2160) tv in the living room? So that It can use my gpu upstairs and play it downstairs?</p>

<p>Don't support well, i have a ultra-wide monitor (2560x1080) and selecting the right resolution it center the image in 1920x1080, i put in 192x1080 and it stretch lowering the image quality (pixels get bigger and fuzzy).</p>
<p>As for controller, if it works the same as the Xbox it should be fine.</p>

<p>Steam have an in home streaming functionality. All the games you buy through steam can use this.
<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/streaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">store.steampowered.com/streaming</a></p>
<p>If you have a gaming computer you can stream to your laptop or another pc using the power of you gaming rig.</p>
<p>I was wondering if the windows store has a similar functionality. I have no xbox, but several computers.</p>

<h3> joshglenn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 S 4gb system problems</h2>
                    
<p>Before I get into my System problems, I'd like to state that I enjoy the games I've bought off of the Marketplace. I just wish I could enjoy them offline and not just trials of them any help with this (I've transfered the license over and still can't access
 the full versions while offline)</p>
<p>My issues with my Xbox 360 S 4gb system:</p>
<p>This is my 6th Xbox 360 S 4gb system since November 2010.=/</p>
<p>It shuts off during gameplay.</p>
<p>It wont let me access my arcade games offline (I have them so I can play when my ISP doesn't deliver when it comes to Internet.)</p>
<p>I've had it show a red dot in place of the green one in the touch screen button.</p>
<p>I've had Customer Service reps tell me "You play your xbox too much" Why can't I have a dependable system like my laptop or PC? I usually only play 2-4 hours a day
</p>
<p>I brought my old system back to Gamestop last week because of the red dot and the system shutting down.</p>
<p>Today, my system shut down 3 times while I was trying to play online. I feel before you start being allowed to charge for an online service, You should be able to show that your system is powerful, dependable, and affordable. I've never had to replace my
 Playstation 3 and it's the 60gb. Of course there really isn't much to play on PSN Imo.</p>
<p>Gamers worldwide depend on being able to relieve the stress of everyday life by taking it out on others or with others. When MS goes and releases another system with the intention of the system being affordable perhaps it could also be reliable.</p>
<p>I'm not a genius and I don't claim to be, Just another guy looking for a better choice and not just another system with a horrible gloss and a bigger hdd that costs $100 more.</p>
<p>Not sure if I posted this in the right area but, whatever.</p>
<p>Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Unless it's been grossly exaggerated I find it very suspect that the 4GB Xbox 360 Slim has malfunctioned on you this many times, and to nail the coffin shut, all with similar problems. To date, the new Xboxes are very reliable, of course that goes without
 saying that it isn't prone to problems though.'<br />
<br />
However, the case of the system shutting down unexpectedly could very well be down to faulty and dodgy electrical wiring in your home. Which could also explain the Red Dot of Death problem.<br />
<br />
As for you not being able to play your downloaded games offline, you'll have to do a DRM license transfer of your entire contents to your new console, and you may need to&nbsp; download everything again from your download history.<br />

<p>Glad to hear it, mate. You should invest in a surge buster power board, my friend. Since not only do they protect your equipment from electrical spikes and surges, but in the event that your equipments do get damaged, as a result of using the surge buster
 power board, you'll be liable for a handsome compensation to the equipments value.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 64bit causing World of Warcraft &#40;WoW&#41; to freeze the entire PC requiring a reset via the power button.</h2>
                    I've been playing WoW for 5 years with no problems whatsoever, however now with Windows 7 64bit my whole PC will freeze during the loading screen or just after successfully logging in, I can't play at all. So far I've tried all the usual WoW fixes like
 deleting my WTF, Cache and Interface folders, playing with no addons, updating all my drivers, running the Blizzard repair tool etc and nothing has worked. This is a near fresh install of Windows 7 so there's very little installed other then WoW, Steam and
 a few essential apps.<br />
<br />
You can find a thread on the issue on the official WoW forums where many people have the same problem here: http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=11155530890&amp;sid=1<br />

            I've appeared to solve the problem. I had an optional update for my network card on Windows update. I was hesitant to install the driver since an earlier version completely crippled many peoples computers, this new version however seems to be working fine
 and has stopped my World of Warcraft from freezing.

<h2>            Screen flicker - more of it.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm startin to get beyond annoyed now. I play game in windowed mode, because otherwise the game crashes when I go on the web to check up things. No problem with win 7, but with win 10, I get this stupidly annoying flickering that voids keyboard commands
 while in-game, as if the window is minimizing itself for a fraction of a second and then re-maximizing. The only fix is to play in full screen, which means when I try to go online to check things up, my game crashes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even my Firefox browser flickers. Flicker flicker flicker...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Blender 3d for modeling and win 10 screws it up again with the flickering window. A lot of times, the screen flickers and then for some reason I can't click and move things because....well, I don't know why but again, that NEVER happened on win 7.
 I kinda like win 10 but now, it's got me pissed off because it isn't stable and nothing seems to be done about the screen flickering that a lot of us are experiencing. Getting win 10 for free should've been called Being a guinea-pig for win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made the mistake of giving win 10 one more chance to get fixed but guess what, now that I want to go back to win 7, I can't. I'm passed the 30 days limit and the option isn't available anymore. I regret it. None of the 'fixes' posted on this forum have
 helped and when I put my win 7 CD in my CD drive, nothing happens. Basically, I can't re-install win 7 and I'm stuck on win 10. Great. NOT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes. I AM venting. Yes, I still feel **** about switching to win 10. When win 11 comes out, I'm gonna say **** you to any invite to get it for free in exchange for being a test subject. So, who else is fed up with win 10? I just wanna go back to 7 where
 everything worked fine. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</p>

            <p>I am also thinking of going back to Windows 7. The only reason I have not done it is that I will have to pay at least $130 or more to get a legit copy. My Dell worked fine with window 8.1. I foolishly wiped out the restore partition when I did a clean install
 of 10. So now I have a choice of paying for an old OS or hoping for Microsoft to fix this bug. Maybe I should go to LINUX?</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you still have your win 8 key (and a flash memory card or sum) you can DL a win 8 ISO CD image directly from mycrosoft and reinstall. Which reminds me I need to get me a 4g card for win 7!</p>

<p>No vemos referencias en su cuenta para estos usuarios. Vemos que usted se ha referido y ha sido referido una vez, pero no por ninguno de estos gamertags.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Además, después de excavar en publicaciones pasadas y en tu cuenta de MyRewards, vemos que has sido ajustado manualmente para los créditos que faltan para la referencia de consola (<a href="https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/25223A83-9CF2-45A4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.xbox.com/en-US/thread/25223A83-9CF2-45A4</a>-8F1F-A83AE782D295). Esto fue colocado como pendiente y depositado como parte de su depósito del 30 de marzo.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sin embargo, no vemos ninguna referencia o envío de correos electrónicos para referencias de su cuenta. Es por eso que no ha recibido ningún crédito de referencia.</p>
