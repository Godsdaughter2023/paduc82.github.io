<h2>            Xbox One Triggers and Bumpers- how do you play&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all.</p>
<p>Basically, I want to know how you game. I'll be honest when I say that I've not found a really comfortable way to hold the controller yet, and I'd love to know your thoughts towards the new Xbox One triggers and bumpers.</p>
<p>1. Do you use your<strong> index (pointer)</strong> fingers on the <strong>bumpers</strong> and your
<strong>middle fingers</strong> on the<strong> triggers</strong>?</p>
<p>2. Do you use your<strong> index (pointer)</strong> fingers on the<strong> triggers</strong> and then move or 'roll' them back onto the
<strong>bumpers (</strong>Therefore, <strong>not using</strong> your <strong>middle fingers</strong> at all?).</p>
<p>I've been using option 1. on 360, I just find this very uncomfortable on the Xbox One, my middle fingers seem to overlap the end of the triggers, sending my button press accuracy down the toilet (I do have normal sized hands, not huge, not small).</p>
<p>Thanks for looking.</p>

<p>I use option 2. I do feel for those that like to use option 1 because it seems the x1 controller was designed for option2.

<p>I only ever use my index finger's. My one finger goes across the bumper and trigger at the same time, doing this mean's I barely ever have to reposition my finger. Using a finger on the bumper and another finger on the trigger feel's really wrong to Me.</p>

<p>Option 2 for me. I've had someone else post a similar thread to this one in the past and back then I was genuinely shocked that people actually played using option 1 - the idea of playing that way simply never occurred to me before. Because I found out about
 it, I tried it and just couldn't get used to it (although I'm sure I could if I put more time and effort into it).</p>

<p>Option 2. I did the same on the 360 but had to move my index back and forth. I like the 1 better becuase i never have to move my finger of the trigger to use a bumper. genius design

<p>I don't use either option. &nbsp;Seems like a lot of extra work.</p>
<p>The controller allows for one index finger on each side to click and pull both simultaneously without messing with the other or if needed, suing both.</p>
<p>just under the big joint is where i use pressure to it the bumpers and my second joint and finger tip is where I use pressure to pull and adjust triggers.</p>
<p>I don't have big hands but I'm an adult so maybe that's the difference.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Bending&#47;Separation Of Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dhruv srinivasan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Bending&#47;Separation Of Screen</h2>
                    <p>I have used my surface for about 2 years, and all of a sudden, I find that the side of my surface is bent, near the volume rocker, and teh screen is separated I know for a fact that this is not an accident, as I did not drop it, or put it under any strain.
 I spoke to a Microsoft representative, and they said:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Surface Pro 3 devices use a specially treated magnesium alloy case designed to help reduce weight, improve battery performance and because the treatment allows the case to be slightly
 malleable, improve durability in use. As a side effect of this treatment, devices can acquire a slight curvature.&nbsp; This curvature only occurs during the treatment process and does not change after manufacturing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">However, the post said that if the bending exceeds 0.02mm, then it is a problem from the Magnesium alloy in the frame, and may cause a separation, of the screen, which is what happened
 to me.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This is what another person replied in response:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">What you are calling a "side effect" is a defect period and the maximum allowed curvature in reality should be within approx. .002" max IMHO. This is achievable if not through better
 manufacturing post-manufacturing correction, in simple terms bend it straight prior to assembly and shipping to the customer. Rather in Microsoft's case they decided to accept this defect in manufacturing and ship bent deformed devices to customers. This defect
 in the geometry of the case may also explain why some are having screens crack for no apparent reason. The glass on the display was designed to take some stress but it was intended that it be installed in a frame or assembly that is flat and will allow the
 glass to also remain flat, as the case deforms along with the adhesive that is holding the glass in place it has the ability to impose stresses in ways that it should not be exposed to possibly damaging and yes cracking the glass.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I am very disappointed with this issue as I am sure are many others.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would like a Microsoft&nbsp;spokes person to follow up on this, as this was not a problem caused from an accident, but rather, from the surface pro 3 itself.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are facing issue with System restore, follow the methods listed below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong><span>Make sure the services related to system restore are started and set to automatic, to do this, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Services related to System Restore are:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>- Volume shadow copy</span></p>
<p><span>- Multimedia Class Scheduler</span></p>
<p><span>- Remote Procedure Call (RPC)</span></p>
<p><span>- DCOM Server Process Launcher</span></p>
<p><span>- Plug and Play.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Follow the instructions below and set all of the above services to Automatic.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click the Start button, and in the search box type in: Services.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Press 'Enter' to open Services window.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Find related services that are listed above, and check the Status (started) and Startup Type (automatic).</span></p>
<p><span>d. Double click the service to change the status to started and set startup type to Automatic.</span></p>
<p><span>e. If the issue persists, try this method.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:
</span></strong><span>Performing a System File Checker Scan (SFC) on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>SFC tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.
</span></p>
<p><span>Check the below link for details:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system
 files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7 </a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Disable your anti-virus software</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software</a></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try disabling your security software completely and then check if you’re able to run System restore.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><em><span> Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software
 is a potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security software after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the issue</span></em></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are facing issue performing system recovery, I would suggest you to contact computer manufacturer for assistance.</span></p>
<p><b><span>NOTE</span></b><span>: Please backup all you data before system recovery, performing
 system recovery will revert your computer back to factory settings.</span></p>

<h3> vbgirl1420  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Consider replacing your battery&#34; notification</h2>
                    I've had my computer for about 2.5 years.&nbsp; It started with Vista and I upgraded to Windows 7.&nbsp; The battery never had issues; in fact, over the weekend, I watched a movie that was more than 2 hours on a single charge.&nbsp; When I turned my computer on today,
 the battery icon had an X by it and said that I should consider replacing my battery.<br />
<br />
I know the battery is fine; I just want to know why it says its bad and how to fix it.&nbsp; I should note that I let my battery get down to 3% after which it hibernated for the first time yesterday.&nbsp; It seems odd that it would cause the issue, but it was the only
 thing out of the ordinary.

<h3> elzarg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost system reserved partition having moved from HDD to SSD</h2>
                    <p>I appear to have lost system reserved partition having moved from HDD to SSD and have now removed it from my old HDD, i migrated my drive over to the new SSD using the the provided tool from Samsung.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the migration was complete, I noticed that the new drive did not have a system reserved partition. When i went to look at the old HDD to reformat the drive to use as a storage drive, it was there. I know that it was only taking up 99 MB but i deleted
 it before i realized what it was. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this going to cause me any problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            This reply was not helpful and complete uselessness. The problem is not linked to a printer driver as my printer is not even connected to the computer. In fact I'm reading in many OTHER places, the problem is due to dirty heads. So asking the user to do
 anything with the computer is not only grasping for useless straws but you never tried this yourself which is horrible support help. :&lt;

</p><p>Cortana is asking me for me to sign in with a Microsoft account and I tried signing in, but it won't let me, saying minors are not allowed to use their accounts here. Does this mean that only adults can use Cortana? Because that doesn't seem right if only

<p><span><span>1. </span></span><span>Which version of Windows are you using (Windows XP, Vista, 7)?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2. </span></span><span>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the methods mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1: Perform safe mode with netoworking</span></b></p>
<p><span>Safe mode, starts Windows in a limited state, where only the bare essentials are started. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes</span></p>
<p><b><span>Start your computer in safe mode with Networking</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>Step 2: Perform clean boot</span></b></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. Article below describes how to troubleshoot problems in Windows 7 by performing a clean boot. This article also describes how to start the Windows Installer service and how to reset the computer so that
 it starts as usual. </span><span>To configure your computer to clean boot refer the following link.</span></p>

<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow step 7 in the article to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists follow the next method</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Let us try to reinstall HP connection manager and check with the issue.</span></p>

<h2>            Skype video and audio not working</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to windows 10 and my audio and video were not working. So I uninstalled it and tried to reinstall it. When I went to reinstall it wouldn't let me download the windows 10 version because it said "its already on my computer" but it had
 been removed. So I re-installed the "classic" version. However, the person on the other end of my calls cannot hear me and my video is also just swirling black. I have nothing else on using the camera etc. Under options and audio I only have one option drop
 down for my mic/speaker and they are all the way on high. I've never had problems with skype before until now having windows 10. Any suggestions?

<h2>            Need to delete old motherboard drivers on hard drive  to get to work with motherboard.</h2>
                    
<p>I built a new computer and when i moved my hard drive to the new computer i get a restart loop at the windows xp screen. My causin did the same set up but he upgraded from a old MSI motherboard to a new one. So the drivers under his windows xp where compatable.
 My old pc is a Asus motherbord with an intell processor. The new one is a MSI with a AMD processor. MSI told me to go to device manager in safemode on my old pc and delete the old motherboard drivers. But they couldnt tell me what exsactly to delete.&nbsp; Couldsomeone
 tell me what drivers i should look for to delete and under what group.&nbsp; I know i could also do a clean install but i would loose all my info on my 1TB hard drive and dont want to loose all my data. Also. I cant get my new pc to Boot to my windows cd to allow
 me to do a new install. ( i downloaded my windows cd from the microsoft website and burned a new disk. It dosnt see the disk as a bootable disk on the new pc.</p>

            WinXP is not available as a download from MS, except maybe if you have a Tech Net subscription account.<br />
If indeed you have a winxp installation downloaded you have to burn the iso image using an appropriate burning software that creates a bootable disk

<h2>            PowerShell is not working &#40;Found a Solution&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a hard&nbsp; time trying to resolve the two issues I have with PowerShell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I have a pop up informing that PowerShell has stopped working and "A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried sfc /scannow, downloading Malwarebytes etc thinking it could be a virus like Poweliks but everything came back clean and the problem still popping up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, when I do get into PowerShell it states "Cannot load PSReadline module. Console is running without PSReadline".</p>
<p>Again I tried a few suggestions from the web like downloading NuGet or PowerShellGallery but nothing is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MY SOLUTION - had to refresh/reset Windows 10 to my laptop from scratch&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Ruthie,<br />
<br />
This issue could be related to a corrupted user profile.<span> We suggest that you create a new user account with Administrator privileges and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to this support article for the steps on<span>&nbsp;</span></span>how to:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17197/windows-10-set-up-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set up accounts</a>.<br />
<br />
<span>The corrupted user profile does not function normally such as not launching Start menu, Cortana, Search bar, Store and other Windows applications. In such cases creating a new profile and checking for the same will help in identifying if the issue is
 specific to a corrupted user profile.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us an update on the result and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>

    <title>Battery Icon missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> splatt3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battery Icon missing</h2>
                    Hi I read the&nbsp; answer from Matt.&nbsp; I'm new to this computer stuff and having had to re-install everything reacently a little reluctant to muck around too much with my computer.<br />
<br />
I really would like my battery icon to show.&nbsp; But i'm not sure if I delete the&nbsp; driver for batteries, which one should i delete and how do i know which drivers to reinstall??? I did a search on the net and they said my drivers were up to date.&nbsp; I did not uninstall
 and remove them cos I was not sure if I would get them back and if I would be without a battery pack.&nbsp; I did change everything to Automatic as the Network connections were on "manual"<br />
<br />
Any walk through to get the battery icon to show would be great<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

            Hi splatt3,<br />
<p><br />
We can check to see if there is some interference from something else by doing a clean boot. A clean boot will allow us to start Windows with select programs and drivers turned off or on. By doing this through trial-and-error we can hopefully pinpoint a specific
 cause of the problem. To troubleshoot using a clean boot, do the following:</p>
<p><b><u>First Step: Perform a Clean Boot</u></b>
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Log on to your computer with an
<b>administrative</b> account.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <b>Start</b>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type <b>msconfig.exe</b> in the
<b>Start Search</b> box, and then press <b>ENTER</b> to start the <b>System Configuration</b> Utility.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<b>Continue</b>.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the <b>General</b> tab, click
<b>Selective Startup</b>, and then click to uncheck the <b>Load startup items</b> check box.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the <b>Services </b>
tab, click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box, and then click
<b>Disable all</b>.</p>
<p><b><i>*NOTE:</i></b><i> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these
 services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.</i>
</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <b>OK</b>, and then click
<b>Restart</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Second Step: Enable Half of the Services
</u></b></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start the <b>System Configuration</b>
<b>Utility</b>. <i>Refer to the steps above if you need to see how to do this.</i></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box. </p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click to select half of the check boxes in the
<b>Service</b> list. </p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <b>OK</b>, and then click
<b>Restart</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Third Step: Determine whether the problem returns</u></b>
</p>
<p>If the problem still occurs, repeat the
<b>First Step</b> and the <b>Second Step</b>. In the <b>Second Step</b>, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.<br />
<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat the <b>First Step</b> and the <b>Second Step</b>. In the
<b>Second Step</b>, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to the
<b>Sixth Step</b>. If no service causes this problem, go to the <b>Fourth Step</b>.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b> </p>
<p><b><u>Fourth Step: Enable Half of the Startup Items</u></b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform a clean boot by repeating step 1.
</li><li>Click the <b>Startup</b> tab, and then click to select half of the check boxes in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. </li><li>Click <b>OK</b>, and then click
<b>Restart</b>.</li></ol>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b> </p>
<p><b><u>Fifth Step: Determine Whether the Problem Returns</u></b>
</p>
<p>If the problem still occurs, repeat the
<b>First Step</b> and the <b>Fourth Step</b>. In the <b>Fourth Step</b>, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list.<br />
<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat the <b>First Step</b> and the <b>Fourth Step</b>. In the
<b>Fourth Step</b>, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to the Sixth Step.<br />
<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat the
<b>First Step</b> and the <b>Second Step</b> without selecting the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Sixth Step: Resolve the Problem</u></b>
</p>
<p>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration Utility, and
 then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u>Seventh Step: Resolve the Problem</u></b>
</p>
<p>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click <b>Start</b></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type <b>msconfig.exe</b> in the<b> Start Search</b> box, and then press
<b>ENTER</b>.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<b>Continue</b>.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the <b>General</b> tab, click the
<b>Normal Startup</b> option, and then click <b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>Restart</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Here is the KB article these steps came from:</p>

    <title>windows update failed - error 8080005 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniel roach &#40;daniel.roach&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows update failed - error 8080005</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;So - It seems I've got the windows update failed issue on my PC<br />
<br />
<br />
It's windows 7 home premium (SP1)., machines about 4 years old,<br />
<br />
<br />
It first started happening about a week ago, along with the pc hanging when restarting (on either "please wait for user profile service" or "wait for windows to configure" - I even left it overnight to see if it would complete, but no..), The last software
 installed before the issue started was microsoft .net framework 4.7.1, firefox v59.01, flash 29 and opera 51.something<br />
<br />
<br />
Fixes tried so far:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Sfc /Scannow ((fails due to "Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation" ?) - ran from windows repair and it said no problems</li><li>chkdsk/f/r - no issues</li><li>safe mode (shutdown even hangs sometimes from safe mode)</li><li>network troubleshooter</li><li>windows update troubleshooter (found 4 problems - fixed 3, couldn't fix 4th</li><li>rename software distribution and catroot folders</li><li>downloaded "stack servicing supdate" (https://support.microsoft.com/kn-in/help/3177467/servicing-stack-update-for-windows-7-sp1-and-windows-server-2008-r2-sp) - "not applicable to my PC"</li><li>STartup repair - found no issues</li><li>restopre point restore - seems I only have 1 restore point, from after the problems started<br />
</li><li>memory diagnostic - no errors<br />
</li><li>selective startup (only MS services)<br />
</li><li>disabled the firewall<br />
</li><li>registry tweaks - including HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\Version<br />
</li><li>a microsoft fixit</li></ul>
<p><br />
Any other ideas please?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Rundll32.exe overusing the cpu clock when running Hoyle Puzzle Games 2005</h2>
                    <p>Original title:rundll32.exe overusing the cpu clock</p>
<p>My parents are having an issue with their PC; while running one of their applications (Hoyle Puzzle Games 2005), their CPU will speed up and get very noisy, more than is necessary. Having recently built my own computer, I was aware that the computer was
 using more of the CPU clock than necessary, so when I opened up the Task Manager &gt; Processes tab, I found that 'rundll32.exe' was using up at least 45% of their CPU. They are still stuck on dial-up, so troubleshooting from that PC is not an option. Is there
 a patch for 32-bit Windows 7 that I can download that will resolve this issue? Thank you for your responses in advance.</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Is the issue confined to the particular application?<br />
2. Have you made any software or hardware changes to your computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to run an antivirus scan using Microsoft Safety Scanner to confirm that your computer is free of any virus infection. Please find the link below.<br />
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note</strong>: The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />
<div>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is not a replacement for using an antivirus software program that provides ongoing protection.</div>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Open the Performance troubleshooter<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Performance-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Performance-troubleshooter</a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Perform a clean boot to check if the issue persists by running the game in clean boot mode.</div>
<div><strong>Clean boot-</strong> It’s a process wherein you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please refer the following link to obtain information on<strong> how to configure Windows 7 to start in a "clean boot" state.</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<p>Check if the issue persists by running the game in clean boot mode.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Ensure you perform <strong>step 7 </strong>under “<strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong>”, after you check if the issue persists in clean boot, from the link mentioned above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Hope the information is helpful.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t delete important files out of shared folders</h2>
                    When I'm on computer management screen I hit the shared folders tab and under shares I have ADMIN$ folder path C:\Windows with remote admin. Also C$ folder C:\ as default share, also IPC$ no folder path with remote IPC as description. I have all my folder
 sharing on not share. What concerns me is that I have had a hacker as my neighbor and I have not placed these important drive info etc. at all. To top it off, the description tells me it's remote sharing and default. I won't have anything to do with remote
 sharing therefore this suggest someone is sharing to themselves my admin files and C drive info. I am unable to delete these shares. I have included a screen shot of the share folder. Can anyone tell me how to delete these items from my shared folder?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d26093fb-cdbf-4c50-a782-42f4f9ff14a8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d26093fb-cdbf-4c50-a782-42f4f9ff14a8" /></a>

            <p>Thank-you for responding. Like I said, I am positive I have a hacker in the building and have recently rebooted the OS 2x since my post. I think you answered the question for me. Yes, I am the administrator of the computer and there are no other users in
 my household. I don't think this problem still exist since the reboots. My big question now would be how to keep a hack off my computer. He has pulled off some unbelievable things and the police won't help. This guy has direct access to every electronic device
 I have including being able to read texts. He has even locked out my mac address from my own router and when it comes to security, I am kind of fanatical about it for I believe living in a free society grants us the right to privacy. I will post this question
 in another thread.</p>
<p>

    <title>Burning .AVI File to Blank DVD-R - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sfkc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Burning .AVI File to Blank DVD-R</h2>
                    I have created an .avi file&nbsp;that I would like to burn onto a DVD so that it can be watched on a DVD player.&nbsp; Essentially, I'm just trying to convert home movies that I have recorded on a DV tape into DVD format so that it can be watched via a regular DVD
 player.&nbsp; (In case it's relevant, I made the .avi file using a software called MotionDV Studio.&nbsp; It's a program that comes with the Panasonic camcorder model PV-GS150.)&nbsp; However, when I insert a blank Sony DVD-R disc into the DVD drive in my laptop, the drive
 does not seem to recognize there is a disc in there.<br />
<br />
The DVD drive that I have is an Optiarc CDRWDVD CRX890S ATA.&nbsp; I double-checked the specifications for this hardware on the internet and it should accept DVD-R discs.&nbsp; I also checked in Device Manager (from the Control Panel).&nbsp; The device status indicates the
 device is working properly.<br />
<br />
From the Windows Help and Support window, the topic to "Format a CD or DVD" seems to suggest that a dialog box should appear when I insert the blank disc.&nbsp; However, it does not.<br />
<br />
I tried to use Windows Media Player&nbsp;to burn the .avi file but it indicates there is no disc in the DVD drive, eventhough&nbsp;the blank DVD-R disc is in there.
<br />
<br />
I&nbsp;also tried using Windows Explorer.&nbsp; I located the&nbsp;.avi file that was on my hard drive and then&nbsp;pressed the "Burn" button while the desired file was selected.&nbsp; At that point, the DVD drive opened and a dialog box popped up requesting that writable disc be
 inserted.&nbsp; I inserted the above-mentioned disc but there is no further activity from the laptop.<br />
<br />
I have also tried buying a new set of DVD-R discs but encountered the same problem.<br />
<br />
What further steps can I take to burn the .avi file to the DVD?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for help on this matter.

======================================<br />
Without the proper software...burning an .avi file on a DVD <br />
will create a Data DVD...not a Video DVD.<br />
<br />
To create a Video DVD&nbsp;that will play in a free standing DVD <br />
Player...you need DVD Authoring software.<br />
<br />
If you are running Vista Home Premium or Ultimate...you <br />
have Windows DVD Maker and it should do the job for you:<br />
(if you do not have DVD Maker...scroll down for an alternative)<br />

To create a basic Video DVD that should play in a free<br />
standing DVD player...try the following...<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />
<br />
First...read the DVD Flick Guide to familiarize yourself<br />
with the program.<br />
<br />
Open DVD Flick and insert a blank DVD in your burner.<br />
<br />
If your computer's Autoplay window opens....just close it.<br />
<br />
Click the Project Settings button and go to...Video /<br />
Target format...residents of USA...choose...NTSC /<br />
Accept.<br />
<br />
Left click the Add title button and browse to your<br />
Movie Clips and select the ones you want on the DVD.<br />
<br />
You can arrange them by selecting one and then use<br />
the Move Up and Move Down buttons.<br />
<br />
Left click the Create DVD button / OK / Yes / Yes.<br />
<br />
Wait while the DVD is created.<br />
<br />
When the text "Finished Successfully" appears you<br />
may close DVD Flick. Now you can eject your DVD<br />
and play it in your DVD player.<br />
<br />
At some point you may wish to purchase more<br />
advanced software like Cyberlink, Nero, Roxio,<br />
Ulead, etc...but at least this is a start.<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

    <title>Ports icon disappeared - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rf engineer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ports icon disappeared</h2>
                    <p>The Ports (COM &amp; LPT) icon used to show up in Device Manager and&nbsp;now it doesn't appear. It used to show two RIM Virtual ports under Ports when I had a Blackberry and used Blackberry desktop manager. I think I deleted the RIM virtual ports when I traded in
 my Blackberry phone for an Android device last year. Bad mistake. Ever since then the Ports icon doesn't show up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still use serial COM ports to connect cell phones via USB cables to my laptop to use&nbsp;tools like QPST and CDMA Workshop which communicate with the modem chipsets in the phones. I am using the latest Windows 7 drivers for these devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to reinstall/restore the Ports? </p>

<h2>            Your PC&#47;device needs to be repaired issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned my computer off at the button after it froze up the other day, tried to boot it yesterday and I started getting the below errors:</p>
<p>
</p><p>File: PSHED.dll</p>
<p>Error code: 0xc0000102</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I turn my computer on it starts automatic repair and I get a blue screen with the above errors. I've tried altering the BIOS order to boot a new copy of Windows 10 from a USB but I keep getting an error message saying there is no operating system
 found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice? I'm a little stuck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks :)</p>

<h2>            PrintScreen stopped working</h2>
                    My PrintScreen button stopped working in Windows 10 and I don't know why. I also tried Keyboard on the screen utility, so I can exclude mechanical problem. It must be some software problem in Windows or with some application running background. Any ideas?

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community. I would be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate the time and effort you have put in to resolve the issue. I would like to assist you further from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To confirm whether the screen shot has been captured or if it is any keyboard fault, open the Paint/MS Word and press the shortcut key
<strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>V</strong> from the keyboard and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if there are any third party applications to be causing the issue. Follow below.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;1. </span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called
<strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Follow: <span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disclaimer: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may
 also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a
 clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;2. </span><span>To disable any 3<sup>rd</sup> party unwanted startup programs in Windows 8 and above, follow:
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20119.how-to-enable-or-disable-startup-programs-in-windows-8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span></p>
<p><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the above recommendation does not help, I would suggest you to see if the issue persists when logged in through a different user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above recommendation did not help, try to employ the System File checker and see if the issue can be fixed.</p>

<p>I had the same problem, I accidently tried this and my PrtScr started working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have Windows 10 you have OneDrive so go to your Start and find the app for OneDrive and open it.</p>
<p>Once it opens a file explorer for it, try hitting your PrtScr and see if it works now.</p>
<p>OneDrive must of lost sync with the PC is the only thing I come up with.</p>
