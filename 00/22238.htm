<h2>            Unable to sign in by using PIN on Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based System</h2>
                    Whenever i try to sign in using PIN on Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based System it shows "Your device is offline. Sign in using the last password used on this device." and another problem i am facing in sign in is that i have changed my password but
 i am unable to sign in using that password and able to login using old password only.

            This is not because you forgot your pin but to get in to Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a routine even if you use the same pin as before.<br />

<h2>            Format only Table Cell with custom color</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
<br />
I would like some help with creating a macro to select table cells with specific background color, but dont know where to start.<br />
My document is very long (200pags) all with tables.<br />
The issue was to select all specific cells, ex: cell (2, 2) in all tables and then i would apply my style and formatting.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The following macro shows how you might go about shading all such cells and applying your Style to them:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sub Demo()<br />
Application.ScreenUpdating = False<br />
Dim Tbl As Table<br />
For Each Tbl In ActiveDocument.Tables<br />
&nbsp; With Tbl.Cell(2, 2)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Shading.BackgroundPatternColorIndex = wdBrightGreen<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Range.ParagraphStyle = "MyStyle"<br />
&nbsp; End With<br />
Next<br />
MsgBox "Done!"<br />
Application.ScreenUpdating = True<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, you'll need to change 'MyStyle' to something valid. Note too that I haven't included any error checking for tables that don't have that cell.</p>

            Thank you for your answer.<br />
<br />
Its almost that, but what i would like to do is select all cells that had a specific color.<br />
For example black.<br />
Not specifiong the actual cell Tbl.Cell(2, 2) but the shading that the cell have.<br />
<br />
sorry if my english is not very clear<br />

            <p>The following will only work if there are no merged cells.&nbsp; It will move through each of the cells in the table and if the Shading.BackgroundPatternColor is black, the commands that you insert where indicated will be performed on that cell before it moves
 on to the next cell</p>

<p>Note that processing every cell in a document with many tables &amp; cells is going to take some time. The advantage the above has over Doug's code is that&nbsp;the above&nbsp;works with merged cells also.</p>

            <p>I haven't heard anything about outlook not supported in free accounts - that was the case years ago but the policy now is all accounts can use outlook. Do you have a source for the information?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Deeply nested folders should be avoided (it makes it hard to find things), also use only alphanumeric characts for folder names. Avoid long folder names too.
</p>
<p>You may need to delete the local ost file (not the account, just the data file it uses) and create the folders that didn't sync up - do a few folders at a time and let them sync before adding more.
</p>
<p>To save the folder structure you could add a pst file to the profile and drag the top level folders to the pst - then drag them back into the hotmail folders after deleting the ost file it uses.

            <p>Thank you Diane,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the structure Inbox/3-Contacts/Finance/PayPal and that is the most deeply nestesd folder. Having things in catagories makes searches much easier as I have narrowed the search before I even begin it. Also with everything in a single folder like 2-Personal
 makes reviewing the emails daunting, so I created the rules to pre-sort the emails into thier slots which is itself daunting because so many emails have the header masked which means I have to look for identifying characteristics in the body of the message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having multiple .pst's makes backup more complicated and right now the email folder in Account Settings is grayed meaning I can't make copies of the .pst's. I also downloaded&nbsp;a backup plug-in and installed it but the Back-Up selection under the Files menu
 doesn't appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am determined to solve this, but I am now in the second week of organizing Outlook and can't afford much more time as I need to get productive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The folders all use only alphanumeric characters, except for the hyphen,&nbsp;and I try to keep them simple and short, no more than 10 characters, yet descriptive enough so that if I come back to them after not visiting them for 6 months they still have meaning
 to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem with deleting the .ost files is that the data resides with Outlook and not Hotmail and I need to get Hotmail up to speed before I can synch up the data. Sending each message to hotmail individually would be time prohibitive. Maybe I can delete
 everything in Hotmail&nbsp;and then synch Hotmail to Outlook so that the Microsoft Mail Server Account and Outlook are the same. Perhaps I can at least delete all the folders in Hotmail and let Outlook regenerate them and populate them with messages. I can always
 use Windows Live Mail to export the current (last week to present)&nbsp;mail from Hotmail&nbsp;to Outlook and then delete everything in Hotmail and let Outlook re-create everything. I know it was designed to go the other way, but since there is a synching processing
 going on I thought this might work.. Draging the top level folders to a new .pst file to preserve the structure is OK, but I need to preserver the data that is missing from Hotmail. I can't go through the process I just went through again. I just finished
 after a week of twelve hours a day looking through emails looking for unique identifying characteristics creating a rule that sorts based on those characteristcs that are present in all the emails, creating the folders running the rules and moving the messages
 to the folders. Outlook then began synching Homail, and moving the messages from the Inbox to the newly created folders in Hotmail on the Microsoft Mail Server which only half completed before error messages began appearing. But there were already folders
 in Hotmail with the same name as folder in Outlook so perhaps the problem is that Outlook is trying to sycn a nested folder in Outlook with a top level forlder in Hotmail meaning that perhaps I need to delete all the folders in Hotmail and then let Outlook
 re-create the structure. Since all of the operations are time stamped I'm worried that instead of the folders getting re-created in Hotmail, the deletions in Hotmail might percholate to Outlook and I'll end up with missing data in Outlook. This is all more
 problematic because I can't at present back up Outlook. I have cloned the entire RAID 0 volume just to provide some insurance.</p>

            <p>Are you serious. I used the hyphen because it was suggested in the Microsoft Office Outlook Best Practices Guide. I will remove the hyphen and update the rules. Someone should get a hold of whoever wrote the Best Practices piece and have the hyphens editied
 out of the suggested folder names.</p>

            <p>Hyphens are known to cause sync problems with the outlook connector. They work just fine in outlook otherwise.

            <p>Thank-You, should I delete the folders that were created in Hotmail by Outlook that still have the hyphens such as 1-Reference and 2-Personal and 3-Contacts, I already remaned them in Outlook to 1Reference and 2Personal and 3Contacts and Outlook propogated
 the name changes throughout the rules; now it is only Hotmail that&nbsp;has the hyphens. I&nbsp;downloaded everything from Hotmail to Outlook when I first created my Outlook profile, so I wouldn't lose anything if I deleted everything in Hotmail and then re-generated
 the messages from Outlook to Hotmail?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have renamed all the folders that had hyphens in Outlook Shortened the names and deleted all the folders in Hotmail, but my Inbox still doesn't download and Connector still crashes after uploading 20 emails from the Ads folder (There is no Ads folder created
 in Hotmail even though Connector reports that 20 emails were uploaded to the Ads folder). The last time Hotmail Connector successfully transfered email from Hotmail to Outlook was on 8/14. I installed Windows Live Mail at that time to get the lastest emails
 from Hotmail and then exported the mail to Outlook&nbsp;so that I coiuld copy everything to folders and then remove duplicates from each of the folders so that I would have one complete sorted Outlook directory. I didn't want to reply on Outlook Connector because
 it might see that the emails&nbsp;were deleted in Outlook more recently than the emails received in Hotmail and therefore might delete the emails in Hotmail.&nbsp;From that point on I had hoped that the rules would catch most of the traffic and direct it to the proper
 folders so that I would only have to do this once and the rules would take over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am still getting:</p>
<p><em>Time: 8/21/2011 11:24:23 PM<br />
Error in Mail<br />
There is an error synchronizing your mail account. Please verify your account is configured correctly by first accessing your mail on the web.<br />
Error: 4102. Client. For nested folders, parent must be declared before child. </em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also Is there a White paper that lists the naming conventions for the Hotmail Servers? Are these older servers that run Windows Server&nbsp;2000 or 2003 or are they up to date running Windows Server 2008 R2?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One other thing, all I want to do is dowload messages from hotmail to Outlook,&nbsp;I don't need to synch with Hotmail, though it wold be nice to have Hotmail organized like Outlook. I asked before would upgrading to a paid Hotmail account improve the situation
 as $20 per year is just a nominal fee. I'm still dead in hte water. I don't want to re-create my .ost file as it is currently 4.5 GB, but understand that it was only created three weeks ago. It is for this reason that I needed to organize what I have because
 I need to be able to go through message titles and scan through ones that look important. I have set the archiving schedule for each of the folders depending on the aging requirements of each. Some need to never archive and some need to archive every 3 months
 and Junk mail every month as the filtering processes should limit that folder to things I really don't want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know I have been long winded here, I want to provide the details so you can understand that it is important that I retain the .ost file. I have copied the directory in AppData so that I have a manual backup of the data in case something goes wrong. On
 top of that I have the entire RAID volume imaged and each of the partitions incrementally backed up at the file level and a weekly schedule tor the RAID volume image and a continuous schedule&nbsp;for the incremental file level partition bakups. So I can try a
 lot of things withoiut too much worry. I can write down hte folder structure save the contents of the folders individually somewhere else, delete the .ost file and let Outlook re-create it and then re-create the folder structure and copy all the messages back
 into the folders, but since I began this from scratch following the Best Practices Guide as I went I shouldn't be looking at another several day workd to get to where I should be now. Somehting is really broken in either Outlook or Hotmail or both.</p>

    <title>How to attach a .pdf to an e-mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bch238  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to attach a .pdf to an e-mail</h2>
                    
<p>Suppose I receive an e-mail with a pdf attached.<strong>&nbsp; I want to send the pdf to someone else, but I do want to forward the original e-mail.&nbsp;</strong> How do I do that?</p>
<p>With Windows Mobile (and most smartphones, for that matter), I click "attach file" then find the pdf to attach.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the mail client in WP7 doesn't work that way.&nbsp; The only thing I can attach to an e-mail in WP7 seems to be a photograph.&nbsp; I can
 send a Word doc or Excel spreadsheet from Office Mobile using "share," but there is no similar functionality in Adobe Reader.</p>
So, anybody know how to do it?<br />

<p>After doing a Bing search, Iam going to answer my own question and say IT CANNOT BE DONE.</p>
<p>According to Microsoft,</p>
<p>"You can attach pictures and documents (such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint files) to an email. To attach a file, it must be either stored on your phone or attached to an existing email that you received."</p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/howto/wp7/people/email-attachments-faq.aspx</p>
<p>Basically, if you are using WP7 and Exchange Server 2003, you are FUBAR due to the bug that exists with Exchange Server 2003.&nbsp; If you try to forward an e-mail, it is bundled as a .eml attachment that no mobile device can open.</p>
http://wmpoweruser.com/windows-phone-7-email-bug-causes-exchange-server-2003-problems/#idc-container
<p>How the heck did that get through the thousands of hours of testing that WP7 was subjected to?&nbsp; By the way, iPhone handles this issue flawlessly, so it's not an Exchange Server problem, it's a WP7 problem.&nbsp; Thanks, Microsoft.&nbsp; You need to get this fixed.&nbsp;
 How can we early adopters hope to convince office managers and IT people to permit WP7 at the office, if it causes problems Apple has already solved?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've just experimented a bit with this and it's true that there doesn't appear to be any way to email a PDF file that is stored on the phone.&nbsp; However, I was able to forward an email that included a PDF file as an attachment to myself.&nbsp; When I received the
 forwarded email, the forwarded part of the email (that included the attachment) showed up as an .eml attachment, but when I clicked the .eml file, the forwarded email opened up and it included the PDF file that I could then tap and open up on my phone, so
 I'm not sure what kind of email but the wmpoweruser.com website is referring to.</p>
<p>No matter, I agree that Adobe Reader should include a way to email PDF files, similar to the method that is used to email Office files.</p>

<p>Prof Julie,</p>
<p><strong>When you performed your experiment,</strong> <strong>did you use Exchange Server 2003 to send your forwarded e-mail?&nbsp;</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp; I sent an e-mail with a pdf attachment to my ES 2003 account using Hotmail.&nbsp; I was able to read the e-mail and open
 the pdf.&nbsp; However, when I tried to forward the e-mail and the attached pdf back to my Hotmail account, it arrived as an attachment to my forwarding e-mail.</p>
<p>When I tried to open the attachment on my WP7 Focus, I received this message:&nbsp; "<strong>Can't open attachment.</strong> &nbsp; There's no application associated with this file type."</p>
<p>However, when I received the same e-mail on Live Mail 2011 on my desktop, I can see that the forwarded e-mail and the pdf are forwarded as an .eml attachment, and I CAN open it on my desktop.</p>

 the dialog that opens, select the option "Change email sync settings". From here make sure that you have email sync enabled and that the "Download Email from" has the desired number of days of email being downloaded.</p>

    <title>Multi-Device Syncronization - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multi-Device Syncronization</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I've been testing the Windows 10TP 9926 since yesterday,and after looking it up through the changes,an idea hit me:</p>
<p>How nice would be if Windows 10 could actually be the <strong>one OS to rule them all</strong> (Jokes apart)? I mean having the option to fully synchronize my Windows Phone and my PC ,receiving notifications on both devices,be actually connected like one
 big thing! Yeah, I can have the same configuration,theme,one drive,email and stuff on both of them, but there's no actual integration! Windows Phone and Windows PC have been two things that are
<strong>alike </strong>,work together,but not the <strong>same</strong>!</p>
<p>If Windows 10 could be the OS that would revolutionize the whole concept of having a computer on your pocket, it would change the whole way to use your PC and Smartphone.</p>
<p>At least,that's the way I see it!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<h2>            Audio issues on Build 9926 and some shutdown&#47;restart problems</h2>
                    <p>I have been having two issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>The audio in both Windows and programs works only every one out of two times I boot. I have reinstalled the realtek drivers, and during testing with Linux the problem did not recur.</li><li>At about the same frequency, the shutdown sequence sometimes wont finish, and my PC stays powered with a black screen. In addition, whenever i restart, it never actually succeeds, it just state "restarting" and does not continue.</li></ul>
<p>I have tested my hardware with other operating systems, and these only occur with Windows 10.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for choosing Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. Let me help you with the issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Audio Issue.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 technical preview is a beta version and most of the drivers aren't available for most of the computers. I suggest you to follow the steps below and check if it helps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right click on the Windows start logo and select Device Manager.</li><li>Expand Sound, Video and game controllers.</li><li>Right click on the sound drivers and select Uninstall.</li><li>Apply changes. </li><li>Restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Black screen issue.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The possible reason could be any third party drivers, services or programs. I suggest you to place the computer in clean boot and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Steps to perform clean boot.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>‘Windows + R’</strong> key on the keyboard.</li><li>In the <strong>‘Run’</strong> windows type <strong>’MSCONFIG’</strong> and click
<strong>‘Ok’</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>‘Boot’</strong> tab and uncheck <strong>‘Safe Boot’</strong> option.</li><li>On the <strong>‘General’</strong> tab, click to select the option <strong>‘Selective startup’</strong>, and then click to clear the option
<strong>Load startup items</strong> check box.</li><li>On the <strong>‘Services’</strong> tab, click to select the <strong>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>‘Disable all’</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>‘StartUp’</strong> tab, click ‘<strong>Open Task Manager’. </strong>
In the<strong> Task Manager window </strong>under<strong> startup tab, </strong>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<strong>Disable’.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>‘OK’</strong>, and then click Restart.</li></ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Enable half of the services.<br />
a. </strong>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the <strong>Services</strong> tab, and then click to select the <strong>
Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the <strong>Service</strong> list.<br />
d. Click <strong>OK</strong>, and then click <strong>Restart</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</strong>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<strong>Service</strong> list.</p>
<p>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<strong>Service</strong> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the <strong>Service</strong> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items <br />
</strong>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box in either step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
</strong>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<strong>Startup Item</strong> list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<strong>Startup Item</strong> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</p>
<p>If only one startup item is selected in the <strong>Startup Item</strong> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box in either step.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 6: Resolve the problem</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the
 problem item.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</p>
<p>a) Press the <strong>‘Windows + R’</strong> key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>b) In the <strong>‘Run’</strong> windows type <strong>’MSCONFIG’</strong> and click
<strong>‘Ok’</strong>.</p>
<p>c) On the <strong>‘General’</strong> tab, click the <strong>‘Normal Startup’</strong> option, and then click
<strong>‘OK’</strong>.</p>
<p>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <strong>‘Restart’</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Please reply to us for any further help.</p>

            This error (805a01f4) usually indicates temporary problems with the store. Hopefully they are working to fix the certificate error 80070020 which affected hundreds of users. You need to wait for a few hours.

<h2>            Recover previous saved versions of a file, whose final &#40;saved&#41; version was corrupted</h2>
                    I was finishing a 30-page text in a word document, and all of a sudden, the text was fully converted to asterisks, and the file blocked. Thinking it was just a blockage, I saved the file to save the last things I had written, and closed it. When I opened
 it again it had saved the asterisk and I couldn't recover my text. Is there any way to go back to a previous version of this document? I had saved it over and over again.

            No, sorry, there is no way to recover previous versions other than using your backup (Time Machine or whatever).
<div><br />
<div>You have saved over the top of the previous version: there was only one file and the save has overwritten it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You should go to Help&gt;Check for Updates (in any of the Office applications). The update that fixed this issue came out about six months ago. &nbsp;Once you apply the update, the problem can no longer happen.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are not running Time Machine, you could give some thought to purchasing a cheap external drive to enable you to do so.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You might also go to Word&gt;Preferences&gt;Save and turn ON "Always create backup". &nbsp;That does nothing unless you manually save, but when you manually save, it saves the previous version as a file labelled "Backup of..." in the same folder. &nbsp;Had it been turned
 on, it would have protected you from this problem.<br />

<div>Sorry to be the one to deliver the bad news. &nbsp;Next time something like this happens, you won't be the victim!</div>

            Hi Maria:
<div><br />
<div>Yes, it will keep happening, quite often, until you&nbsp;apply&nbsp;the update that fixed it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes, you should update Office for Mac to version 14.2.4 immediately, because any document you open is at risk until you do.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes, the bug was solved in an update about six months ago (longer: it was solved before Christmas). &nbsp;But the fact that it happened to you means that the update that fixed it is not installed on your machine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This bug is uniquely diagnostic, and the fix for it is completely effective: the fix changes the internal code of Word so that this bug cannot happen under any circumstances.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Get thee to the Help menu and select the "Check for updates" option. &nbsp;Now!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Best cheers</div>

<h2>            Accessing Previously Saved Versions of a Word Document</h2>
                    <p>I have saved over a document, and I am looking to access a previously saved version. I am working on a Mac that is running Sierra version 10.12.6. My Word is version 15.32 for Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I tried to cut a part of one document and paste it into another document, but I must have gotten side-tracked and forgot to paste the information into the new document. I know I saved the document that had the information on it (before trying
 to cut the info out), I just have no idea to get back to that previously saved version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any and all suggestions would be helpful!</p>

<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><span><span>Installation Instructions</span>:
</span><span>Follow the instructions below to install this software onto your device.</span>
<br />
<br />
<span>
<p>Before you proceed, please confirm that this software upgrade is a newer version than what is currently installed on your device. If it is the same version and your device is operating normally, there is no need to reinstall the software.</p>
<p>To check what version is installed on your device, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Device Information &gt; Version tab, and note the ROM version, CPU, and Radio version.</p>
<p>Warning!</p>
<p>* This is a generic software update. Any additional software or settings provided by your mobile operator or company will be lost. If you require this customization, please contact your supplier first before upgrading.</p>
<p>* Please note that this upgrade will erase any data stored on the device.</p>
<p>Please back up your data first before upgrading your device. Before you run the ROM Upgrade Utility (RUU), make sure you check and do the following:</p>
<p>* The USB sync cable is connected to your device and PC. If your PC is running Windows XPR, ActiveSyncR will run automatically to establish a connection. If your PC is running Windows VistaTM, then Windows Mobile Device Center will establish the connection
 between your device and PC.</p>
<p>* All running applications on the device have been closed.</p>
<p>* Make sure that the battery level of the device is least 50% (tap Start &gt; Settings &gt; System tab &gt; Power).</p>
<p>* The update will take up to 30 minutes, DO NOT interrupt the update process, make/receive phone calls, disconnect the device from the PC, or press any buttons until the process has been completed.</p>
<p>Once the RUU is downloaded, launch the application on your PC and follow the instructions</p>

<p>I am sorry, but OCR in OneNote is very poor. MODI had the ability to transform the image in text, preserving most of the format into a brand new MS Word document.</p>
<p>Definitively OneNote does not replace MODI.</p>

<h2>            Nokia not turning on after the update</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My dad was recently was in UAE and he bought E72 in Al Ain. &nbsp;He has the receipt and warranty.&nbsp; I was updating the firmware through the official nokia updater but it froze midway and now its not turning on.&nbsp; I live in US and I've been told that there is no
 warranty in the middle east, etc.&nbsp; I can ship it to UAE to one of the friends but is that true?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I think I know what the issue is.&nbsp; Part of my email to a local nokia center:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The problem is that when I tried to update it through the official Nokia Software Updater (NSU), it didnt turn on after installing.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with the phone ie scratches, physical damage, etc. but its more of a firmware issue.&nbsp; I've been told
 that the NSU that I used was for USA, so it installed that firmware and thats why the fault occurred. "</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone please help me out with this.&nbsp; Have anyone else run into the same problem and is fixable?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imho, the problem occurred&nbsp;because you remove your phone from the pc&nbsp;when it&nbsp;hang&nbsp;up,</p>
<p>did you?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The firmware compatibility case (phone not from your country) has nothing to do with your problem, because NSU will only go on with the&nbsp;phone firmware update if it sees&nbsp;the phone</p>
<p>needs updating, and it always update according to the product code, where your phone</p>
<p>come from. and it will never have a problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now back to the froze or hang up during installation, the NSU will somehow exit and will</p>
<p>launch again, and will give you message do not removed your phone connection (because</p>
<p>this will damage your phone), that you have to be patient because it will take time for&nbsp;NSU</p>
<p>to reestablish the installation process. Its about 15 to 30mins.&nbsp; And it will eventually go</p>
<p>on with the firmware update with no problem.&nbsp; It happened to me, during my upgrade,</p>
<p>I browse internet , open so many windows and listen to music at the same time.. so the</p>
<p>NSU hang up and all apps exited, but NSU restarted itself and I just followed the instruction.</p>
<p>And all are&nbsp;ok :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your case, maybe you can go to Nokia service center,&nbsp;maybe they will totally format first your phone before installing the new firmware. ( I hope your phone really not damage).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Excel 2016 update KB4461542 update cannot save file</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm new to the forum here. I recently have my work laptop replaced and after the initial Office 2016 updates I am not able to save any Excel files. I keep getting the program not responding message and ask me if I wish to restart the program. After I chose
 restart the recovered files did not save the changes I made after the file was opened last time. I lost all progress worked on those files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have our IT department uninstall and reinstall Office the problem went away temporarily. However when the next batch of Office updates come around and finished installing the same problem happened again. I managed to pinpoint it to Excel 2016 update KB4461542.
 It is v1.0 came out in November 2018. I "fixed" the problem by uninstall this specific update every time it was pushed to my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our IT department would not turn off the auto updates due to security issues. Is there any other permanent fix that would work? Today is my third time uninstalling the same update and I got the new laptop just one week ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for all the help.</p>

<p>Hello Genevieve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the prompt reply and I did go thru most of the items listed in your linked article unfortunately none of them seem to be working. So far the only solution is to uninstall the said MS Office update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the test with multiple files in both local and network drive, with or without safe modes as well as saving in different formats. I have also tried with files that I created by myself so I definitely have full read/write access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I did not do was saving the files as HTML as these files will be used by others in the team so it must be in Excel format. I also was not able to disable the firewall and the antivirus as it can only be turned off by my IT department.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you again for the help.</p>
<p>

    <title>Incoming caller ID issues on TrueCaller app with HTC One M8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruslanmenezes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incoming caller ID issues on TrueCaller app with HTC One M8</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue with incoming caller id while using the True caller app on HTC One M8 for Windows. True Caller would not&nbsp;block or mark&nbsp;the spam calls like the way it did on my previous phone, Lumia 520. Even HTC support, pointed out that it could be an issue
 with the OS or the app. After a thorough study in to the matter I noticed that the app claimed the fault was with the Windows platform, which normally allows the Lumia phones to perform this function of caller id with the app, but restricts others. (refer
 to the picture below). I'd like to have this fixed ASAP, most specially in the forthcoming updates or in Windows 10.</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;I want Microsoft to be committed in giving every Windows user a reason to do more with their device irrespective of whether it is a Lumia or not. This phone is currently the best available flagship device for Windows phone OS and one of the reasons to avoid
 heading to iOS or Android, please don't disappoint me this time</p>

<h2>            Windowsbase.pdb missing after upgrade to 10041 so VC2013Debug NOT working</h2>
                    <p>C# Debug (PF9 breakpoint) was working correctly on 9926 but after upgrade to 10041 it fails saying Windowsbase.pdb is missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I cannot find it (BUT it is not present on a Windows 8.1 PC either) so how I correct the problem?</p>

<h2>            Inbox displays a email from an unknown sender</h2>
                    <p>I recently received a email in my inbox, but I cannot find the email address of the sender (browsed with Firefox; Windows 10 OS):</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1072037a-d499-4e2b-beb6-7bfa9fff8444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1072037a-d499-4e2b-beb6-7bfa9fff8444" /></a></p>
<p>The sender is not revealed even when I click the sender icon:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25389756-245b-4e99-9f21-ff6c6e0cdba7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25389756-245b-4e99-9f21-ff6c6e0cdba7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The email looks like a virus email, but I cannot be sure if I don't know the sender's email address. Is that some hackers managed to find a loophole in Outlook and hide the sender's address?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note, when I view the email using the Gmail app in my android phone, the sender's name is displayed as "我" instead of
<span><span>"&amp;#26446". The chinese character </span></span>"我" means myself, making me wonder whether I sent out the email myself and trapped me into clicking the link in the email.</p>
<span><span>"&amp;#26446". The chinese character </span></span>"我" means myself, making me wonder whether I sent out the email myself and trapped me into clicking the link in the email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really worry whether my email account is compromised. Any suggestion would be very much appreciated. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>

<strong>Deleted items</strong> folder. There are certain ways on how to help protect your Microsoft account, and we've created an article for that. The link to the article can be found
