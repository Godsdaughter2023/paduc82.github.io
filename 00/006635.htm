<h2>            Wifi &#40;radio&#41; not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not able to Switch ON the wifi router on my mobile NOKIA 830 running Windows Phone 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be an hardware problem (if yes then i will need to buy a new phone as no body repairs old nokia phones now)</p>
<p>or it could be due to a software issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            The point-total counter on my Microsoft Rewards account started freezing around 1230AM (EST), 18 December. Worked briefly after the normal midnight refresh....then stopped accruing points ever since. Same for my Mom's account on her computer. Server failure
 at Microsoft, perhaps?

            I emailed them saying that it was down so they should credit me for the points I would have received if it were up. They simply replied, yes it was down and now it's up, totally ignoring the fact that I asked them to credit me. I just emailed them again
 asking for a credit. Seriously, it's like an equivalent to $1. They are so stingy. I do not expect a credit from them because I know how they are, but it is rightfully due to all those that would have accumulated it. At least give it to those that ask for
 it.&nbsp;

<h2>            dim textbox control</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
<br />
This is my code:<br />
<br />
Sub MultiTxtbox(MyForm, TBoxNums, State As Boolean)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TBoxArr = Split(TBoxNums, ",")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TBcount = UBound(TBoxArr)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dim MyTxt As TextBox<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For tb = 0 To TBcount<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set MyTxt = MyForm.Controls("Textbox" &amp; TBoxArr(tb))<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With MyTxt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Enabled = State<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If State Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '.ForeColor = SystemColorConstants.vbWindowText<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .BackColor = SystemColorConstants.vbWindowBackground<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; '.ForeColor = SystemColorConstants.vbGrayText<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .BackColor = SystemColorConstants.vbGrayText<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next tb<br />
End Sub<br />
Sub multitbtest()<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Load UserForm2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UserForm2.Show modal<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call MultiTxtbox(UserForm2, "11,12", True)<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
It works when line <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Dim MyTxt As TextBox<br />
is omitted but fails with a Type mismatch error when it is activated.<br />
<br />
What is wrong?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<h2>            Office 365 - Onenote 2016 and Onenote &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have an Office 365 subscription, have updated to Office 2016 and to Windows 10. &nbsp;I have two different one note apps; one apparently is part of Windows 10 (the one installed says its Version 17). &nbsp;The second app [which I never really noticed before tonight]
 is labeled as Onenote 2016. &nbsp;I've been unable to find anything that discusses the difference between the two. &nbsp;I made the presumption that I should probably use the Office16 One Note. The plain "onenote" opened all the pages I had saved in "onenote&nbsp;2010".
 &nbsp;Onenote 2016 didn't &nbsp;find any of my existing pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do I have two onenote apps?</p>
<p>Which one is the best to use?</p>
<p>If it's Onenote 2016, how do I get all the work I've already done moved into the 2016 version?</p>

<p>The same thing happened to a lot of people, and the new version is garbage; it's microsoft trying to compete with all the other stuff out there such as snapchat, instagram, twitter, etc. They have forgotten that Skype's
 purpose is for people to be able to videochat. Also, a lot of people got updated to this version -including me- even though they refused it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After lots of googling and going around in circles with trying to contact skype support that I believe doesn't actually exist-because all roads lead back to the same community support page- I found a solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ignore the app on your device -just unpin it or whatever, and google "skype for web", where you can log in and you will find all your contacts. You'll have to bookmark it and have your browser save the pasword if you don't wish to keep having to
 log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, do as I did and if you use Chrome, click on the three dots in the top right corner of the screen on your Chrome browser, click on "more tools" and then "add to desktop" which will give you a shortcut on your desktop screen if you have one. You
 can then pin this shortcut (right-click) to your start menu and/or task bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time I get a new computer, I'm going to choose a Linux operating system (Mint looks good) because Microsoft has forgotten that we need things that actually work, and for the purpose for which they were meant.&nbsp; Good
 luck!</p>

    <title>IE8 - cannot update, uninstall, reinstall or upgrade to IE9 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marksturdy  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE8 - cannot update, uninstall, reinstall or upgrade to IE9</h2>
                    Several issues, all relating to my IE8 installation on Vista (SP2 / 32 bit).<br />
<br />
(1) Can't upgrade to IE9, either through Windows Update or using the standalone installer. I get the notification that it's been installed successfully, restart as instructed, start up IE... and it's still version 8.
<br />
<br />
(2) IE8 won't install KB2530548 (Cumulative Security Update), throws up error 800719E4 every time.<br />
<br />
(3) Tried to reinstall IE8 to see if it fixes either of the above issues, but get the message "Setup cannot continue because a more recent version of Internet Explorer has been detected on this computer" and can get no further.<br />
<br />
(4) Uninstalling IE8 from the "Installed Updates" menu doesn't work - as with IE9, I get the notification that it's successful but I need to restart to complete, and when I do this it reverts and IE8 is back.<br />
<br />
(In addition, KB2483185 fails with error 800719E4. Other Windows updates work fine.)<br />
<br />
I've tried the following things to get round the above issues:<br />
<br />
- Installing in Safe Mode<br />
- Installing in Clean Boot mode<br />
- Installing the IE9 prequisites as detailed at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2399238#bkmark2 - both updates hang on "Searching for Updates" progress box for a long time, and then state "This update does not apply to your system".<br />
- Running sfc /scannow<br />
- Running the repair script at http://iefaq.info/index.php?action=artikel&amp;cat=42&amp;id=133&amp;artlang=en<br />
- Running the System Update Readiness Tool at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821<br />
- Running the alternative IE8 uninstall command at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/957700#stepsforadv1<br />
<br />
Unforunately I can't reinstall Vista as I'm a laptop user with no original installation DVD.<br />
<br />
Any ideas....?<br />

            <p>Hello, thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The SFC scan says there are faults it can't fix automatically; when I check the CBS log it seems to be a problem with the settings.ini file for Windows Sidebar. However, the sidebar itself appears to be working without problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to remove IE9 as instructed. However, I'm still unable to uninstall or reinstall IE8 using any of the methods given in the KB articles linked to above. As before, it appears to uninstall successfully (using either Installed Updates or the command
 prompt), but then reverts when I restart. And I still get the "Setup cannot continue because a more recent version of Internet Explorer has been installed on your computer" message when I try to reinstall.</p>

            Original poster back here, different username.<br />
<br />
I'm still experiencing the same issues with IE8/IE9 as described above. In addition, I'm now unable to start Outlook 2007 as it gives the message "You need Windows Internet Explorer 4.01 or later to use this feature. You can download the latest version of Internet
 Explorer from http://www.microsoft.com" - despite the fact I have a functioning version of IE8 on my computer!<br />
<br />
I'm also unable to install the following updates:<br />
<br />
KB2530548 (Cumulative Security Update for IE8), throws up error 800719E4 every time.<br />
KB2483185 (Security Update for Windows Vista) fails with error 800719E4<br />
<br />
Could all this be traced back to some kind of faulty IE8 installation?<br />
<br />
I've uploaded my CBS.log, IE8.log and IE9.log files to my Skydrive <a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?cid=f43c8cce4bad038a&amp;resid=F43C8CCE4BAD038A%21128" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I'm using Windows Firewall and Microsoft Security Essentials. Presumably they wouldn't intefere with Windows Update?<br />
<br />
I've tried the steps above but I still have the same problems. IE9 and the other updates mentioned still fail to install, Outlook still won't start, and IE8 will not roll back to IE7.<br />
<br />
Any ideas? Any more information that I can give you to help pinpoint it?<br />

<p><span>An in-place upgrade is the final alternative before you have to reinstall the operating system.<br />
Note that it takes the same amount of time to do the upgrade as to reinstall the operating system. Also, some of your customized Windows settings may be lost through this process.</span></p>
<p><span>How to perform a repair installation of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2. Performing a repair installation will
 restore the current Windows installation to the version of the installation DVD. This also requires the installation of all updates that are not included on the installation DVD.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Note</span></strong> Performing a repair installation will not damage files and applications that are currently installed on your computer.<br />
<br />
To perform a repair installation of Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Close all the running applications.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Insert the Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2 DVD in the computer's DVD drive.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the Setup window, click Install Now.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span> If
 Windows does not automatically detect the DVD, follow these steps: </span></p>
<p><span>Click Start, and then type
<strong><span>Drive:\setup.exe</span></strong> in the Start Search box.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Note</span></strong> The drive placeholder is the drive letter of the computer's DVD drive.</span></p>
<p><span>In the Programs list, click Setup.exe.</span></p>
<p><span>In the Setup window, click Install Now.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Go online to obtain the latest updates for installation (recommended).</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type the CD key if you are prompted to do this.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the operating system in "<strong><span>Install Windows</span></strong>" page you want to
<strong><span>Upgrade</span></strong> or
<strong><span>Inplace.</span></strong>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong><span>Yes</span></strong> to accept the Microsoft Software License Terms.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<strong><span>Which type of installation do you want?</span></strong> screen, click
<strong><span>Upgrade</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When the installation is complete, restart your computer.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the advice - however, the problem with doing an inplace upgrade is that, as stated above, I am a laptop user and don't have an original installation DVD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a shame it's not possible to pinpoint precisely what is going wrong. Is there nothing that can be gleaned from the log files I linked to?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also on the subject of log files, I gather that the error code I get when trying to install certain upgrades (800719E4) simply means "log file full". Which log file does this refer to, and how can I clear it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A final thought - is it worth trying to uninstall and reinstall the Vista service packs?</p>

<h2>            How to read all the emails in Plain text format and set password to open email attachments in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Can I do THIS in Outlook 2013?<br />
<br />
Hi. I admittedly am looking for a shortcut to this answer. I have a security configuration question about OL2013 but upon looking at the MS support material about all the ways to configure security on OL2013 my eyes started rolling around in my head. Can someone
 just tell me this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are currently running OL2003. Would consider running 2013 if I could configure it to a) convert all emails to plain text (to eliminate the hot linking in included links), and b) require a password to open attachments (the ideal solution, or as a fallback
 have OL just not display ANY attachment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is our weak link in security... users clicking on things (darn users!). For all I know the above could be accomplished in OL2003 with addins. But I'm happy to pay for 2013 licenses if it does what want more efficiently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanx!</p>

<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.<br />
<br />
I understand your concern and let me answer your query:<br />
<br />
1) You can configure Outlook to read all emails in <strong>Plain Text </strong>format following steps mentioned in the article below:<br />

Note</strong>: The steps mentioned in the above article applies to Outlook 2013 as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span>open the email attachments. Like Outlook 2003, there could be 3rd party add-ins available for Outlook 2013 as well.

<h2>            How do I physically join multiple word files into one document--NOT merge, NOT insert</h2>
                    <p>I am looking for a way to take several Microsoft Word documents and join them all together to form one single Word document.</p>
<p>This should be a lot easier than it is. I've been all over the internet, and I've found split and join utilities, so you have to split a file and then join them back together using it's own code. That's not what I'm looking to do. I am also NOT looking to
 open the first file and then insert each consecutive file into memory to form one file, because (1) it messes up the individual formatting for each file, and (2) there are massive amounts of graphics and diagrams that are positioned EXACTLY in a certain way
 and even one micro-change in the format will render them unreadable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is there a way to join word (.doc) files with a utility program without paying a fortune? Not a "split and then join" utility, a "join file utility".</p>
<p>
</p><p>All doc files are the same, for the most part, so it does not matter what operating system I am using. I just need to know how to do it and what program or file utility exists that allows me to join word files from outside the program using the file explorer.
 I just want to simply chain about 20 files all together without merging them into memory and then saving the file that way, because I've already tried it with disastrous results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any geniuses out there? Much appreciated.</p>

<p>You don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As your own first post indicates, Word document can contain many objects and extensive formatting, including differences in page layouts, headers, footers, Tables of Contents, footnotes, endnotes, bibliographies, etc., etc., all bound together using a web
 of xml files etc. in a zip archive.</p>

<p>Chaining files. Like, a dialog box that opens up a window with .doc files that I can list in a specific order to output to one big file. E.G.,</p>
<p>
</p><p>document 001.doc</p>
<p>document 002.doc</p>
<p>document 003.doc</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>outputs to [filename], such as bigword.doc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, file 001 is the first file in the chain, and I want to be able to attach many more files to the end of each file in the listed order to make one big file. This way, the new, larger documents will retain the formatting of each smaller file without affecting
 each subsequent file. I have not found a way to do this with word. It's probably just a basic file utility. But I am not starting with a large file and then splitting them into smaller ones; just the opposite. Taking many small files and appending them back-to-back
 to make one big file. All this without inserting the files from within word, one file at a time, because it changes the formatting each time and the result is "disastrous" as I mentioned. For some reason, when merging files internally, going to the end of
 each document and then inserting each document, the subsequent files are somehow affected by the previous addition. That's not my goal. I simply want to chain a series of .doc files together to form one new .doc file in the order that I list them. That's it.</p>

<p>To throw a little technical light on what may seem an arbitrary refusal:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The internal structure of Word documents is entirely unlike a plain text (*.txt) document. What you see in the Word editor does not start at the beginning of the disk-based file and does not necessarily end at the end of the file. There are extensive components
 at the beginning of each document file that describe how to interpret the rest of the contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The older *.doc files, because they're largely a proprietary binary format, are especially complex. The "file header" at the beginning consists of tables of pointers to structures later in the file. If you tried to jam two or more of those together, with
 the second document's file header somewhere in the middle of the file, Word would just go belly-up and refuse to load it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The newer *.docx format is based on a specialized version of XML, with multiple XML files and other things held in subfolders, and the whole thing compressed into a zip file. (You can actually rename the file extension from .docx to .zip and open the archive
 in Windows Explorer to see the contents.) Again, if you mashed two or more document files together, the zip format wouldn't be usable and the document wouldn't open in Word or anywhere else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The closest you'll get to the "chaining" of documents is to build a sort of container document in which you put INCLUDETEXT fields, one for each source document, with a section break between successive fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your documents are so finicky that "<span>even one micro-change in the format will render them unreadable", then Word is probably not the tool you should be using (see, for example,&nbsp;<a href="http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/TextReflow.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://wordfaqs.ssbarnhill.com/TextReflow.htm</a>).
 You may need a publishing program such as InDesign.</span></p>

<p>So, just because I can imagine something being done does not mean that it can be done.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the Microsoft Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my workaround was to print all of my word .doc files and convert them all to individual .pdf files and then use a program called "PdfMerge" to merge all 20 files together to form one big pdf file, which was my original intent anyway. I already knew that
 .pdf files could be chained together, I was just wondering if there was a way to do it with .doc files, and I see there is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the good news is I reached my goal anyway, and that was to take all my smaller doc files, convert them to pdf, and then have one big pdf file in the end. So I just took an alternate route to the same destination.</p>
<p>

<p>Not so. This has nothing to do with any supposed operating system limitations, but everything to do with the structure of the files concerned. Copy the files to a Mac and you'll have exactly the same problem on the Mac OS. Try doing the same thing with Open
 Office documents on a Mac or PC and you'll have the same problem 'chaining' those.</p>

    <title>Lumia 950 Going in the dustbin because no one will take - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pats75  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 950 Going in the dustbin because no one will take responsibility&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I can now see why people buy the other brands and I am really disappointed with the service that both EE and Microsoft have provided. I purchased my Lumia 950 which to be honest is the worst phone I have owned in around 10 years. I have had an N95,
 N8, Lumia 800, Lumia 1020 and now the Lumia 950. From November 2015 the phone has been nothing but headache but i have stuck with it as i did like the brand and the difference. First problem was freezing up and having to reset and restore the phone losing
 my data twice. Then came my biggest annoyance i have had since owning the phone the unreliable Bluetooth connection which drops on and off, freezes up the phone forcing you to restart, or just restarts the phone by itself constantly or freezes and starts to
 heat up the phone. But my main concern is the overheating, which one of Microsoft's customer advisors said he had never heard of before, clearly he has not been on this forum. I would like to stress I have three Lumia 950's on a 24 month contract with EE that
 cost me £130 a month, One is my own, the other is my wife's and the third belongs to my mother.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All three phones suffer from overheating, but on the 26th of February 2017 when i awoke from sleeping i went to check my phone and my screen protector was shattered, i touched the phone which was extremely hot so i unplugged it straight away. Once the lead
 was out the screen began to fade until it disappeared completely and went black. I waited for the phone to cool down removed the shattered screen protector, and could see hair line cracks on the main phone screen. I removed the back cover and on removing the
 battery it had a bulge at the top of it. I put the phone back together plugged in the charger and nothing, the phone has been completely dead since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOW IS THIS MY FAULT? </p>
<p>How does this count as physical damage? </p>
<p>If the phone cooks itself through the night, how is this not covered by warranty?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My local EE shop sent the phone off for repairs but wanted to charge me £112 as physical damage is not covered under warranty, I found this out as physical damage was the only box ticked on the report form they sent with the phone. (extreme overheating is
 classed as physical damage)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then sent the phone off to B2X/Microsoft via DHL to a location in Hungary, on monitoring the repair online, it stated phone repaired on its way back to customer. It arrived back today with no repair done, saying warranty does not cover physical damage
 so i will have to pay for the repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a joke, i have not used my phone now for three weeks and still have to pay the contract, EE pass the buck onto Microsoft and the same vice versa. I have told my wife and my mother do not leave there phones plugged in over night as if they also go
 wrong EE or Microsoft will refuse to replace them. I have read a couple threads on this forum where people have experienced bulging batteries, and hair line cracks due to overheating, but EE and Microsoft accept no liability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would just like to say thanks and i will be moving onto another network and buying a different brand of phone come November. I have two PCs running windows 10, a tablet running windows 10, three Lumia 950 phones, not to mention the XBox's and Microsoft
 cannot replace or repair my phone. Great customer service.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Nokia 2520 wi-fi issue</h2>
                    <p>My Nokia 2520 tablet's wi fi setting disappeared. I can connect to ATT directly, however there is no wi-fi icon. From start up, the wi fi option is gone. It is also gone from the settings. I do not see any of the area wi fi connections, including the one
 for my home. The You tube direction say go to network, then Airplane mode.... you should see under wireless devices 1) mobile broadband, 2) Wi Fi, 3) Bluetooth, 4) GNSS, 5) NFC in the right column of the page. The WI fi option is missing!</p>
<p>Has anyone been able to resolve this issue?</p>

<h2>            Feature Request for Follow up Meeting</h2>
                    <p>It would be nice to be able to have a button that you can press when you are looking at a meeting request that you created to be able to create a follow up appointment to the same distribution list, and the same notes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be the same as the reply to all meeting participants, but would actually create a new meeting.&nbsp; Currently, the easiest way to accomplish this is to just change the date and time of the existing meeting.&nbsp; This however removes the original meeting
 from your calendar, and also the tracking of past meetings from your calendar.&nbsp; I don't believe this would be too hard, but I believe there would be quite a bit of use for it.&nbsp; Sure, there are ways to copy the meeting, and paste them to other dates, but that
 is clunky.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The feature could be called create follow up meeting etc.</p>

<h3> chase henry  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Project 2010&#47;2013 - Attempting to change font via the menu ribbon results in crash</h2>
                    <p>Symptom:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When attempting to change or list fonts via the "font" drop-down in the ribbon, the message "Microsoft Project has stopped working" is displayed; however, it
<strong>IS&nbsp;</strong>possible to change the font by selecting columns or specific cells and right-clicking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I DO know: &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. &nbsp;This issue is isolated to a specific computer. (all users on this computer experience the same issue)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;The problem originated in Project Standard 2010 and exists even after uninstalling/re-installing and even installing Project 2013.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;The issue just started yesterday. &nbsp;For some odd reason, System Restore does not show any restore points prior to the first occurrence of this issue so a restore is evidently not an option.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;There are no add-ins to disable.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;The issue exists only in MS Project. &nbsp;The rest of the MS Office 2010 suite is unaffected.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;All updates are applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Chase,</p>
<p>You say the issue just started yesterday on a specific computer. Was any new software, utility, update, etc. installed on that computer recently? If so, that would be a prime suspect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be a case of corrupt user profile(s). You might try creating a fresh new profile for yourself and see if that takes care of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say all updates are applied, I assume mean SP2 for Project 2010 and SP1 for Project 2013. Does it also include the June 2014 cumulative update for each?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Julie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It occurs for all users (profiles) on the computer, including my own. &nbsp;It is specific to this computer only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It occurs with all files. &nbsp;If I open a brand new project, it still happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No new software was installed. &nbsp;No changes took place that I can find but the fact that no system restore points exist prior to 2 days ago (when this started happening) has me befuddled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the global.mpt file. &nbsp;No luck. &nbsp; :(</p>

</p><p>I logged onto the computer for the first time (new profile) &nbsp;when troubleshooting and I had the same issue so it's not profile-specific.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No changes took place that I am aware of but I can't perform a system restore as there are no restore points prior to this issue coming about, which is odd to me.</p>
<p>

            <p>Chase,</p>
<p>That particular PC may be set up for automatic updates so it's possible updates were made without your knowledge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the version number of Project 2010? (Go to FIle/Help and click on "Additional version and copyright information" found on the right side in the middle of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You indicate you have SP2 installed but do you have any cumulative updates installed? Project 2010 had some crash issues that were addressed by the June 2013 cumulative update and that was released after SP2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is long shot, but what font are you using? Is it the default Calibri 11? If not, try setting the font to that and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another long shot, what is that computer's setting for legacy formats, File/Options/Trust Center/Legacy formats? I recall another poster who recently was having some weird issues. He apparently solved the problem by changing to allow the loading of legacy
 formats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet another long shot, have you done a virus or other malicious software sweep? Could be that computer is infected. Why it apparently only affects Project I have no idea, but we're running out of suggestions.</p>

            <p>Despite was appears a panicked rant, I am going to guess your default player switched from WMP to Groove. Try going to "Settings/System/Default apps" and see what is listed under "music". You can change it back to WMP there.</p>
<p>I have no idea how your music library could have been "robbed", moved, deleted, changed or anything else.

 I never used the words "deleted, changed or anything else" - as <strong><em>you have added

            <p>In the future, if you come to this community for help, try to accurately describe the problem (histrionics do not help) and read the suggestions. There are usually people here who know about these products and often have experienced the same thing in the
 past.&nbsp; Changing a default program happens all the time and has been an issue for decades. It pays to know how to restore whatever default you'd like. This can happen whenever you install something and quickly click on default settings, even if the defaults
 changed don't appear to have anything to do with what you clicked. </p>
<p>Common problem and can also happen with video, photos, etc.. Windows 10 (which you are using if using Groove) makes it really easy to see defaults for major file types without going into Control Panel (above), but either way works.
</p>
<p>Microsoft has never, ever documented their software well. Their support (and I pay for "Assure" which is, supposedly, their premier support) is pretty much worthless. You will probably come to rely on this and other communities for help. On this forum we
 are lucky to have a real Microsoft software developer present, but I can assure you that is a rare exception.

</p><p>Wondering if anyone has had any luck using the new HoloSketch app:&nbsp;<a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/case_study_-_building_holosketch,_a_spatial_layout_and_ux_sketching_app_for_hololens" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HoloSketch
 App</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've managed to upload PNGs and JPGs into OneDrive and those do appear in the HoloSketch app, but for some reason, none of my 3D asset uploads are working. I tried building assets as suggested in the page above through Unity and also uploaded normal .fbx
 files. The files show up on my Hololens OneDrive app but they don't show up in the HoloSketch app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tech specs:&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Using a windows machine</p>
<p>-Running Unity 5.6.0f3 Personal 64 bit</p>
<p>-Hololens is updated to most recent updates as of today April 23rd</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I see on the OneDrive app on hololens:</p>
<p>-There are three kinds of files: 1) a baseball JPG that DOES appear on the HoloSketch app, 2) a base_ball asset created via Unity using the steps suggested by Microsoft and 3) a standard FBX file bear-fbx.FBX I downloaded just for testing.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here's what shows up in the HoloSketch app, only the image:</p>

<p>tjorchard,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Given the status quo of the Symbian devices, it is expected that hardware parts for it may not be abundant or widely available as it is used to before. The other route I can advise is to look for another accredited Nokia Care Centre, in which repairs would
 likely be faster than the service centre of your network provider.</p>

<p>I can't unfortunately get the phone back off vodafone to send it to Nokia direct. The ability to contact the vodafone repair centre directly seems to be very limited. I think they're are trying to order a replacement phone from Nokia but unsurprisingly they
 are our of stock. I've been told also that someone has been waiting six weeks already for a replacement phone.</p>
<p>I tried chasing up the repair and was told that Nokia had said the phone was unrepairable. This seems very strange to me as it is only the headphone jack that has gone, everything else works.</p>
<p>I did contact a Nokia Care Centre by phone and gave them the IMEI code they did not have a record of a current job.</p>
<p>Feel very frustrated, seems like my phone is being held hostage and so far vodafone have not given me any other choices other than the Lumia 520.</p>

<h2>            Windows update cannot connect to internet but chrome does.</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10 build 10240 when I go to settings then update I get this message "We couldn't get online to download your updates. We'll try again later, or you can check now. If it still doesn't work, make sure you're connected to the Internet."
 Also Cortana and edge won't connect either, However firefox and chrome do connect to the internet and work fine. &nbsp;Is anyone else having this problem?

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could have occurred due to these reasons:<br />
1. Conflict between third party applications.<br />
2. Conflict between antivirus software.</span></p>

1) Please make sure to re-enable Antivirus software after troubleshooting steps.<br />
2) Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable or uninstall your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable or uninstall it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled or uninstalled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

</p><p>I have tried clean boot, disabled windows defender (the only antivirus installed), disabled windows firewall, cleared windows update cache per this page&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058 &nbsp;but the problem is still there. &nbsp;Google chrome and Firefox
 work fine but Microsoft products (edge, system updates, windows defender updates, cortana) all say "we cannot connect to the internet right now make sure you are connected &nbsp;internet". &nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>I would suggest you to manually reset the Windows Updates Components and check the issue status.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong> on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>net stop wuauserv</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>net stop cryptSvc</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>net stop bits</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>net stop msiserver</span></strong></p>
<p><span>c) Now rename the <strong>
SoftwareDistribution</strong> and <strong>Catroot2</strong> folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</span></strong></p>
<p><span>d) Now, let’s restart the
<strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</strong> and the <strong>Windows Update Services</strong>. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the
<strong>ENTER</strong> key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>net start wuauserv</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>net start cryptSvc</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>net start bits
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>net start msiserver</span></strong></p>
<p><span>e) Type <strong>Exit
</strong>in the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> to close it.</span></p>
<p><span>Now you may try running the Windows Updates and check if the above steps resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the information helps.</span></p>

            This can lead to a lot of lost time. . .so beware. I ran this through extensive MS LEVEL 2 tech support - which was excellent. &nbsp;At bottom, they tried everything - then did a clean install &gt;&gt; fixed! &nbsp;Then they took my livence keys and developed a new win
 10 key to preserve the free upgrade promise. &nbsp;In some cases - like mine - there's simply a corruption. &nbsp;A+++ to MS Support.&nbsp;

<h2>            Can N97 show who text is  from when you get text message and &#38;quot&#59;1 new message&#38;quot&#59; box pop up.</h2>
                    On my N97 when I get a text message I get the small pop up saying "1 new &nbsp;message" and show underneath, thing is it does not say who text is from until I click it ,&nbsp; on all other phones I've owned in the last 10 years it always shows who sent text on the
 alert, anything I can do?

<p>Hi I did that thanks but its pointless really as unless you stare at your phone every second you miss the preview showing when you get a text as its only 1 minute long at the most, plus what do you mean almost free, I downloaded it, hope im not paying a
 fee or anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything else I can do, its a silly bug but annoys the hell out of me, never had a phone in 15 years that didnt display the name of texter!</p>

            there is really no other way the sms preview is a nice free choice, you might want to google for some 3rd party apps but ia mnot even sure if they would be 5th ed. compatible. the n series never had that feature just shows you have a message. sorry mate

<p>That's a good point. I wish the N97 had that too. Man this phone is very disappointing. For the price tag, Nokia should have had all this covered. If this phone didn't look so cool, it would be in the trash.</p>

<p>you might want to look into this. it has a trial 14days option load it up on your phone and give it a go. i use it with all but one of my nokia phones and love this app. &nbsp;</p>

            Its annoying to hell and surely is a normal standard feature of a phone, all others have it. Where can I inform nokia of this so they may look at it and see if they can do owt.

            use the contact us button on the top right of this page. it will not change let me tell you. this is not a bug, this is what it is on nokia phones. perhaps in 2010-2011 with the new ui potential it might change tho i would not hold my breath.&nbsp;

<p>You can request the feature here:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://europe.nokia.com/get-support-and-software/download-software/device-software-update/feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://europe.nokia.com/get-support-and-software/download-software/device-software-update/feedback</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No S60 phone has ever had that feature, and series 40 nokia's only got the feature around 2 years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some (not all) manufacturers have used this feature for around five years now. I've certainly never seen a mainstream phone that did it 15 or even 10 years ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally I hate the feature, it's annoying when someone looks at your phones screen and sees who the message is from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not willing to consider 3rd party alternatives you have two choices:</p>
<p>1. Return the phone and switch back to your old brand.</p>
<p>2. Contain your excitement that few seconds longer whilst the message opens.</p>

<p>Why are you getting so defensive, lol. FWIW, it is a nice feature to be able to see who is texting without having to press anything. I sit in meetings most of the day and it would be beneficial for me to be able to see who is trying to get a hold of me.
 If it's someone who is important (wife, kids, etc), then I will see their name and I can step out of the meeting if I need to. It sounds like you are a loyal Nokia user, that's great, this is my first Nokia, and from an unbias point of view, this phone isn't
 that great. Nokia is behind the game and its pretty obvious. That said, the concept of this phone is great (prob why I bought it) but Nokia has a lot of work to do in order to get this phone's funcionality up to par w/ the rest of the competition.</p>

            5610 runs on S40 platform. 5th edition. You need to scour google to see if you can get a 3rd party application
