<h2>            Word 2013 on Windows 2012 R2 RDS high load</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>we have two Windows 2012 R2 RDS session hosts. On each of them Office 2013 is installed. It happens quite alot that Word of a User will freeze after opening a Word-File from a network share. The same Word-File will freeze the word of any user on any session
 host&nbsp;trying to open it from the network share. When copied to the desktop word will open the file just fine and not freeze. What I mean with freeze is that Word opens the file and you can edit the document, but a few seconds later cpu of Word goes up and you
 get the hourglass.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- turned off offline-cache for the network shares</p>
<p>- added the network shares to the Trusted Locations via GPO</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows what's happening I'd appreciate a little help as this happens everyday to a few users and once 6+ Users have a frozen word process the rest of the users cannot work anymore until everyone logs off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lutz Schildt</p>

    <title>About Solving a knapsack problem using excel solver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aurangzebahmed  say:</h3>
<h2>            About Solving a knapsack problem using excel solver</h2>
                    so basically i'm trying to implement an alternate version of knapsack problem that is to minimize the value such that the value system that I use is (1-best, 5-worst) that is opposite of the traditional one used(1-worst, 5-best) which is used to maximize
 the value of the problem. However, with my opposite approach of using this value system, I am unable to get values that minimizes the whole problem(which in my case actually mean to increase the overall value). the items chosen are picked just to cater upto
 the constraints however I want that the solver first uses the items with the least number( that is 1, which means of highest value) and then progressively work its way to bigger numbers but I am unable to do that. Do you guys have any idea on how to approach
 and I can even use a excel macro if you have any idea for the program?

                    <p>Since EI adopted to the internet standard, drawings made in Word webpages are verry blurry. as shown in the browser IE.</p>
<p>(it looks as if the resolution of the drawing is not correct made in a PNG-file)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I correct / install settings / options to make the drawing in a webpage look in IE as sharp as it was shown before march 2013?</p>
<p>Or is this something we may receive a patch for the comming weeks?</p>

            How did you insert the drawing in word and also what format the drawings are saved in. Would suggest you to save the drawings in jpeg format and then insert it in word.

            <p>Dear Barrett,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not about inserting a drawing in Word.<br />
I make drawings in Word, flowcharts as a part of a procedure&nbsp;and try to publish them on the intranet of an organiation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before march 2013 this worked good. After the update of&nbsp;IE however IE uses a PNG-file of the Word-webpage. This PNG-file is the blurry problem.</p>

            <p>Hi Magda,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure Word's image compression is disabled and that you set the required resolution to the highest possible (220dpi) - before saving. If that's not sufficient, you might try copying the original image over its replacement in the html file's image folder.</p>

            <p>Dear Paul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not an external image I insert in a Word-file.</p>
<p>I make a drawing (flowchart) in Word (using the Word drawing tool).</p>
<p>This way I can hyperlink a shape (part of the drawing) to an other webpage and publish them as a webbased manual .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before march 2013 this worked good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the update of&nbsp;IE however IE&nbsp;uses a PNG-file that Word created for the drawing in the&nbsp;webpage.</p>
<p>This PNG-file is the blurry problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of cause I could make the flowchart in an other program and then import it in the Word-file. But then it is imported as an "Image block" and I cannot make a hyperlink of a specific shape in the image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tnkas for your reaction any way,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>do you have the latest firmware for your phone?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>download NSU and connect your phone via usb cord</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>these are also some things you might try start with #1 read the whole thing carefully and make sure you have a back up of all your data</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
1. *#7780# - Restore factory settings - resets all the settings to the default ( you will not lose any data)<br />
Make sure you back up your data as you will lose all of it when you perform option 2 or 3 on this list. The default code for all operations listed here is 12345<br />
<br />
2. *#7370# - Reformat your phone<br />
<br />
3. This you perform as a last resort. Nothing else is working.If the phone is not showing any activity, proceed with hard formatting , turn off your phone, hold the following buttons while pressing the power button. (the default code is 12345)<br />
hard reset - hold the following buttons *, 3 (number button) and talk/green key. turn on the phone and do not release those buttons until you see the Nokia boot up screen. once you feel the phone power up you can let go off the power button while still holding
 all three buttons ( for Nokia 5800XM - use the following buttons to do a hard reset, GREEN/RED/CAMERA keys pressed all at once on power up. this will only work on 5800's that have firmware version 20... and up. )<br />
<br />
<p>If these codes are not working the only thing for you to do is contact your Nokia Care Center/Service for assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            SharePoint Excel Online</h2>
                    <p>I setup a document list and uploaded an Excel workbook into it, with Excel web part. I need for users to make entries on the workbook but not delete or edit any past entries. The excel workbook is a company gift and hospitality log for users to input information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, I copied the "contribute" permissions and restricted it by eliminating the "delete" option. The issue I am having is they still need "edit' permissions to make an entry into the excel workbook. With that said, with those edit permissions they
 can delete an entry they made or someone else made. Any ideas how I could lock down the excel workbook so users can't edit/delete past entries?&nbsp;</p>

            You can use an Update query for this. Without knowing the structure I can't be specific. But it doesn't make a lot of sense why would you need to cancel one record by entering a date in another. Knowing more about your database will help us help you.

            What is happening is we receive messages and write a record for them. After a while a new messages comes in and some of them cancel older messages. We want to be able to annotate on the current record what messages it canceled. And when we do, we want
 the annotation to be able to be annotated on the original message automatically,

            I would not do it that way. What I would actually do is have an Issues table. Then have a child table for all messages or other actions related to an issue displayed on a subform. This way you can see all the action on an issue.
<div><br />
<div>An alternative would be to establish a cross reference table. This will indicate all records that cross reference the current record.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your basic problem is how you identify the record that is being cancelled. That is not apparent from your description.&nbsp;</div>

            Maybe further information might help. We are receiving warnings that have three unique fields (Areas(5), Year and sequential number for that year). Some&nbsp;warnings&nbsp;&nbsp;will cancel previous&nbsp;warnings&nbsp; When I annotate on the current form/warning that we need to
 cancel a previous warning, after updating that field, we would like to update a field in the previous warning that it has been canceled.

            Here is an example, I add a new record with the number and year (blue) of canceled message. I want to transfer the current number, year and TOR to the old warning (red). The area doesn't have to be added, you can only cancel like areas, but the number
 and year together make it unique for that area. Thanks for the help<br />

            <p>OK, lets see if I got this. In the screen shot you have a record highlighted in Blue.&nbsp;You&nbsp; have a record indicated by an arrow.&nbsp;I'm guessing that Blue is the cancelled record and arrow is the new one since it has a later date.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I am guessing right, you want to populate the 3 columns underscored in red with the red circled values from the arrow record. And you determine its the blue record based on the 3rd, 13th &amp; 14th fields. (sorry can't read the headings)</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Outlook calendar invitations not compatible with Gmail &#47; Android</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
I still have trouble sending calendar invitations from my Lumia 930 and my Lumia 720 to Gmail/Android users. Gmail/Android is not able to work with the invitation/email format generated by the Outlook/Lumia calendar app. I assume that the email format generated
 by WP8 is corrupted as invitiations from Windows Desktop versions of Outlook and invitations send if I open my outlook account with browsers work fine. The problem appears sice the very first beginning with every version of WP (amber, black, cyan and denim).
 Could you please fix this bug or give me a hint how I can find a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I already tried the following to find out which combination works and which doesn't:</span></p>
<p>Invitation WP to Outlook for Desktop-Windows =&gt; works fine<br />
Invitation Android to Outlook for Desktop-Windows =&gt; works fine<br />
Invitation Outlook.com (operated in Browser) to Outlook for Desktop-Windows =&gt; works fine<br />
<strong>Invitation Outlook.com (operated in Browser) to Gmail/Android =&gt; works fine</strong><br />
<strong>Invitation WP to Gmail/Android =&gt; does not work<br />
Invitation WP to another Gmail/Android account =&gt; does not work</strong><br />

            <p>Hi Jean-Noel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A Full Scan is a full scan - you can't omit anything.&nbsp; That's why it's a full scan.&nbsp; The only exception, if you have&nbsp;them checked in Settings / Advanced, are archived files and removable drives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, you could exclude files or folders using Settings / Exclude Files and folders to remove scanning (including real-time protection) of anything there.&nbsp; Frankly, I strongly suggest you do NOT do this because everything added to this opens a hole
 in your security.&nbsp; The only real reason to put anything there is to handle false positives that occur rarely.&nbsp; I mention it only because it is possible - but cannot strongly enough suggest you ignore this or you are going to end up becoming infected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is not omitting files/folders, but rather speeding up the scan.&nbsp; There are many ways to do this depending on why it is slow in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are running it while nothing else is happening, then in Settings / Scheduled Scan, check the box for limit CPU usage and change it to 60-80% which will dedicate more resources to the scanning.&nbsp; On the other hand, if you run scans while you are working
 and do this, your system will slow to a crawl as little will remain available for your normal activities.&nbsp; In that case, try slowly increasing the number 10% at a time until you begin to notice a slowdown in how the system responds to you, then back off 10%
 and that's pretty much the best you can do with that unless you change your habits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another option is to do a bit of maintenance to improve overall performance (and increase space) as those can be factors in the speed of a scan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>****************************************************************</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my little blurb on improving space and speed in Vista or Windows 7 systems – and some can apply to XP as well but the reference articles and procedures will be different but you should be able to either figure out how to do what is suggested on XP
 or search Bing for an article which addresses that topic for XP or an equivalent program that works with XP (and it also suggests other things of value that you can consider or ignore - the choice is entirely yours). All of this is your choice, actually -
 I'm just presenting some options that may help and that have helped many others (and that I pretty much use myself though sometimes I do procrastinate I'm sad to admit and there are some things I won't do no matter how beneficial - for example, I refuse to
 delete my cookies (but that's a personal choice as I prefer the benefits of having them when going to previously-visited web sites over the limited amount of space recovered and speed gained given their small size)). Much of this should be part of normal maintenance,
 but that includes some other things (like creating periodic system restore points - probably at least weekly as they don't necessarily improve speed, space or performance and may in fact even do the opposite in some cases) not addressed here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A great many things influence the speed and performance and available space of your system - mostly the existence of various files and what's loaded on the system. There are ways to handle this (and you should follow all the suggestions) - and of course
 the amount and type of RAM and the speed of your processor and motherboard (but I'm just going to discuss software solutions here - you can go to your computer vendor/manufacturer for hardware solutions if any are available (I, for example, am maxed out at
 2GB RAM by my motherboard and there is no better motherboard available for my model of laptop but if your system can handle it, Vista 32-bit can use up to 4GB of RAM (well, almost 4GB, more like 3.5 actually) and the 64-bit version can use even more). If space
 is the issue, replace your hard drive with a larger one, add a second hard drive (if it is a desktop system), or add an external hard drive. Those are hardware answers (which cost money). We'll now discuss software solutions (which are mostly if not entirely
 free - at least the options presented here - there are 3rd party programs that provide additional options but they really aren't necessary).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One very important thing to begin – do NOT use any Registry Cleaner or Registry Booster or Enhancer, or Repairer or Fixer software (or whatever it calls itself) no matter what it says (scans will tell you have thousands of errors just to get you to download
 and install the program or worse, buy it) or where you got it (even safe sites sell these products but they are not worth the headaches they can cause). Most do nothing of value and some can do great harm (to the point where you need to do a clean install
 to fix the problem – and that’s not even counting the fact that many such programs are actually malware in disguise). Vista keeps the registry clean on its own quite well and doesn’t need any help.</p>

 harm your system in any way. This includes deleting the Temporary Internet Files. If you want to keep this from building, go to Tools / Internet Options / Advanced and check the box Empty Temporary Internet Files Folder whenever browser is closed and then
 that folder will always stay empty (except when you're using the program).</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Also do an Optimization: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Optimize-Windows-Vista-for-better-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 them - many can help a great deal).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least once every month or so, run CCleaner <a href="http://www.piriform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.piriform.com/</span></a> with as many options as you choose to delete (but be
<strong><span>careful</span></strong> because this program if not used properly and with caution and with you paying attention to what you are doing can delete important and even critical files that could cause a great deal of trouble).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Uncheck anything in the Registry section and in the Application Section, uncheck Microsoft Antimalware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Clearing out your temporary files can also save you much space and improve performance and while some of the above will clear a lot of the temp files, they won't cover them all. This will. I recommend running it every month or two. It is TFC by Old
 Timer </span><a href="http://www.geekstogo.com/forum/TFC-Temp-File-Cleaner-OldTimer-file187.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>TFC - Temp File Cleaner by OldTimer - Geeks to Go Forums</span></a><span> and you should download and save it to your desktop. When run,
 it will close everything else, so be sure to save anything you're working on and basically close all your programs. If it asks (and when done even if it doesn't ask), reboot to complete the process.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Restore can take up to 15% of your partition's space but that can be reduced. It's a trade-off. The less space you allocate, the fewer restore points you will be able to retain -but many people reduce this to save some space while leaving enough to
 save 3-4 restore points at least (which is usually enough - until you need them). Here's the procedure:

<p><br />
<br />
Go to Start / Search options and type in msconfig and enter and then double click on the program icon that appears. Go to the startup tab and uncheck any program that you don't need starting at startup. That will probably be the majority of items there - if
 not most of them (some are needed like the AV program and Windows Defender but most are there to make opening the source programs faster and make you think they're more efficient). This will free up a lot of RAM and help a lot in making your system faster
 (though perhaps not so much that you'll be able to notice the difference - but maybe depending on how much unnecessary stuff is loading at startup). When I did this on my system I removed over 90% of the entries and suffered no ill effects – to the contrary,
 I noticed startup was quicker, response times when working were better and I could open more programs at the same time and still have no problems, and shutdown was also faster. Better still, download Autoruns
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a>which is much superior to msconfig and click on the Everything tab and do what was suggested above (though here you
<strong><span>can’t</span></strong> delete everything as with the start menu in msconfig because there are some very important files and services included which
<strong><span>MUST</span></strong> not be deleted or it can cause serious harm to the system). If unsure, leave it alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
You also want to have good AV and AS programs on your system (so no malware is operating in the background draining resources). Windows Defender is a good AS program. The free Microsoft Security Essentials
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</a> is an excellent AV/AM program that has one of the least impacts on system performance and resources according to reliable sources and it does the job very well. If you're using MSE, you don't really
 need Defender and MSE will deactivate it when installed (but you would with many other AV programs - though some of them also deactivate Defender). I would also suggest downloading
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</a> and running it monthly to catch anything that MSE might miss.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
If you follow this advice and do it periodically (at least monthly) then I believe you will have as fast and clean a machine as it is capable of going given the hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp; If not, then please explain how long is too long.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several other options that may help, and if this doesn't work, then post back and we'll try some of them or rule them out as causing the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

            <div>I have the same problem, but I'm not sure what you mean by your answer. How do we fix it with our product manufacturer? By product, do you mean Samsung, the phone? Or&nbsp;by "product," do you mean the email provider?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, what do you mean by "opt to check you product guide if there are steps indicated there for this kind of settings"? Again, by product, do you mean the program or the physical item? And how would either one of them help if Outlook is not accepting
 the correct codes? All of my email programs accept these codes except outlook? How is it a problem with the product?<br />
<br />
<div>Thank you in advance for clearing up your answer for me. And if it would not be too much trouble, would you see if you can find someone who speaks clear English look over your answer before sending it? And correct your grammar and spelling and sentence

            <p>Hi Johayber T.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your attempt to provide some useful assistance. We understand that your superiors at&nbsp;Microsoft, or the outsourcing vendor's&nbsp;customer service believe pandering to the clients with flowery, pseudo empathetic statements is good customer relations,
 but it's not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"<font color="#000000">We understand that you are having difficulties in typing in your account credentials in Outlook.com app in your phone."</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm speaking as a customer and one who has 20 years experience in client relations. It's simply insulting our intelligence. Then when your organization makes it so difficult to find assistance: Help link online in Outlook.com and SkyDrive led to nothing
 even closely relevant, nor did it lead to this MS community forum; only rubs salt in the wound. I found this by Googling, "outlook.com android app doesn't accept user id or password". Thank you Google.&nbsp;

<h3> shoeic  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Access Pivot Table Form - Can you adjust row heights&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have some data I am displaying in pivot table forms. Some of the data has the same description but a different part number and cost therefore I have the description in the row area and the part number and cost in the data area. One description may have
 20 different part numbers and costs and the pivotable will only display 15, I have to click into the area where I then get scroll bars to view the rest.</p>
<p>I would like all records to automatically display. I can alter the column width in a pivot table but I can't seem to find a way of altering the row size. Does anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Me.PivotTable.activeview.detailmaxheight = 32000<br />
</p>
<p>Put it in the ON OPEN event of a form that is displayed as a pivottable. If you are opening a query and clicking "pivottable view" this code may not work. 32000 works for me but you can always move the number up or down to suit your needs. Good luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. - Microsoft, where is the documentation on pivottables. They&nbsp;are a good thing to have but how can we use them if we can't figure out how to manipulate them?</p>

    <title>Latest windows 10 update broke duplex printing in Office 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> janet in nc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Latest windows 10 update broke duplex printing in Office 2016</h2>
                    <p>Been using Windows 10 with Office 2016 and a still current model Dell H625CDW &nbsp;color laser printer for about a year. &nbsp;There was a Windows 10 update this week and now the duplex option does not show in Word 2016. &nbsp;I can still print duplex in other applications.
 &nbsp;Office 2016 was also updated today but that did not help. &nbsp;Latest Dell drivers and firmware are installed. &nbsp;This appears to be a Windows 10 update mess up. &nbsp;In Word 2016 I only have a choice to print one sided or manually two sided. &nbsp;When I click the link
 to find more printer settings, I get an error "Word cannot retrieve all of the print settings from Dell 625 cdw." &nbsp;This is &nbsp;problem on 3 different computers running Windows 10 and 2 different Dell printers. &nbsp;Started just after the update.</p>

            Almost certainly, it is an issue with the Printer Driver. &nbsp;Try uninstalling and re-installing the printer. &nbsp; If that doesn't help, Dell may need to come up with a new driver.

                    <p>Okay, I have researched this and I am not finding a real answer that solves this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; I work in a corporate environment where we must support legacy applications.&nbsp; Our standard laptop is a Windows 7 based machine Running IE 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We still have some
 people with Office 2010 on their machines and they are trying to take the course, "Intermediate Skills in Microsoft Excel 2010".&nbsp;&nbsp; Access to these courses came with our Software Assurance program.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this course (as well as others in the series), there are links to study guides and so forth that are in the form of Web Archive Files (*.MHT).&nbsp; When our users click on them they get a text page with the following error ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>"This document is a Single File Web Page, also known as a Web Archive file.&nbsp; If you are seeing this message, your browser or editor doesn't support Web Archive files.&nbsp; Please download a browser that supports Web Archive, such as Windows® Internet Explorer®."</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have Internet Explorer 9.0.8112.16421</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping you can provide me with the pluggin or whatever is necessary to view these files.&nbsp; FYI - I have tried Chrome, and Firefox as well.&nbsp; Same error.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was not able to successfully get outlook express which once had the dll to support these.&nbsp; There
 is no Outlook Express for Windows 7 according to the information I read.</p>

<h2>            Populating List Box Header Not Working</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>If you set the ColumnHeads property for a ListBox to TRUE, you will see a small grid at the top of the listbox intended to display a header row for the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way it is supposed to work is, it takes any row above the range being used for the ListBox, and populates this header row with that data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am told that this only works when using the<strong>&nbsp;ListBox.RowSource</strong>&nbsp;property, however, RowSource does not work with Excel 2011 Mac, so I cannot test this out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, you have to use the&nbsp;<strong>ListBox.List</strong>&nbsp;property when working with a ListBox, which&nbsp;<span>does</span>&nbsp;work for populating the ListBox, but does&nbsp;<strong><span>NOT</span></strong>&nbsp;work for populating
 the Header.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are left with a blank header.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an idea of how to get this to work?</p>

            I'm quite sure the answer is pretty simple - you can't on a Mac. the rowsource and columnsource properties are not supported. Likewise listbox headers are not supported in Mac VBA.<br />

    <title>Unable to login to Outlook after resetting password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jarsue97  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to login to Outlook after resetting password</h2>
                    <p>My wife doesn't use her live.com account very often and forgot her password. We followed the directions provided and had a 8 digit code sent to her phone via text. We entered the code and she changed her password. When she tried to login the login page had
 a delay of a few seconds then the message (might not be exact quote) "We are unable to access your account at this time. Please try again later." popped up. I tried to login on my account but the page was hard frozen. I had to reboot my computer to gain access
 to the login page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We changed her password twice with the same result. (2X total) In between her login attempts I had no issue logging in to Outlook. I'm using Windows 10 on my laptop and Outlook automatically has my login information available, I just click on the Sign in
 icon. When she was logging in I just erased my information and entered hers. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this normal when changing a password? Or, since she doesn't use the account very often, did the amount of emails in her account have anything to do with this issue?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The feature which will allow you to receive a confirmation that an email has been received and read by the recipient is not currently available in Outlook.com. In the meantime, you can consider setting up your account in Windows Live Mail. It’s a free
 email program that has the feature that you're looking for. To download Windows Live Mail, please click
<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials-other-programs?T1=t2&amp;os=other" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For the steps on how to add your email account in Live Mail, please refer to the solution article below:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Lastly, here are the steps to enable this feature in Windows Live Mail:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Start Windows Live Mail.<br />
2. Click on the <strong>File</strong> tab or just press <strong>Alt + F</strong>.<br />
3. Click <strong>Options</strong>.<br />
4. Click <strong>Mail</strong>.<br />
5. Select <strong>Receipts </strong>tab, mark the checkbox for <strong>Request a read receipt for all sent messages</strong>.<br />
5. Under <strong>Returning Read Receipts</strong>, tick on <strong>Notify me for each read receipt request</strong> if you want to return read receipts.<br />
6. Click <b>Apply</b> and then <b>OK</b>.</span></p>

<h2>            How do I match and sync data from 2 different spreadsheets&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to bring some new data into a spreadsheet, and I need it to be matched with certain products we stock by barcode. I've been looking all over for an answer, but I'm not sure exactly how to phrase what I need to do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are a retail store, and I need to add supplier item codes to our product list. I have got our&nbsp;suppliers to send us spreadsheets with their product barcodes and supplier item codes. I also have a spreadsheet of our products with barcodes only. Now I have
 to bring in the supplier item codes from the supplier spreadsheets into our product spreadsheet and match the data by barcode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone that can help tell me how to go about this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Charelle</p>

<h2>            Nokia E71 &#38;amp&#59; E66 New software available</h2>
                    For those who have come here first, there is now a new release of software for two of the E Series phones.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4777090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokia.co.uk/A4777090</a><br />
<br />
My UK version of the Unbranded E71, does not update as yet, so it might filter down through most of the product codes over the next few weeks.<br />
<br />
Hopefully a lot of the problems we have had here are resolved. Have a drop by the Software Update discussion and the news section of the software update (above)<br />
<br />
Enjoy!<br />
<br />

            My product code is 0550831 and no update yet. However, this update doesn't fix the webcam's grainy and purple output, and also renders the phone hack useless (to install any app)<br />
<br />
If anyone sees the update, can you post your product codes?

The only way to reverse it is at a Nokia Care point, and that might be a chargable service if they can do it at all.<br />

I dont know what easy dial is?<br />

<br />
any option to do a factory wipe of the phone after the upgrade?<br />

Would this help your problems?<br />

<p>The problem here is that it is not possible to send me an sms to my phone number and the mailaddress registered is old. I up-dated my backup mailaddress, but then I was told that to change security info I needed to wait a month before changing password.
 Is there anyway you can help me to change the password, so my hotmail stop sending spam?</p>
<p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t withdraw from the Minecraft beta program</h2>
                    <p>I joined the Insider Hub to experience the Minecraft beta program.</p>
<p>Because I could not use Realms, I left the beta program.</p>
<p>The procedure is written in the Insider Hub,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Leave beta program from Insider Hub</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>Windows Uninstall Minecraft from existing "Add or Remove Programs"</p>
<p>↓</p>
<p>Download from Microsoft shop</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing it according to the procedure, it did not change from "1.7.3 Beta" when it started up.<br />
After that I attempted the same procedure about nine times, shut down, etc., but it did not change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if asking Minecraft staff at Discord,<br />
"Try it again, it sometimes does not work on the first try."<br />
only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can not get out of this state, it will interfere with the operation of Realms, so I'd like you to present a solution as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please.</p>

<p>Thank you for reply, Mr. ErwinJames San.</p>
<p>I did according to the procedure, but it did not solve it.</p>
<p>However, after doing research after that, I was able to solve it self.</p>
<p>On my PC there was an account I use and an account my child's use.</p>
<p>Minecraft was also downloaded to the child's account,</p>
<p>I thought "maybe", I uninstalled Minecraft in my account and Minecraft in another account.</p>
<p>
Then, when DL Minecraft with my account, I went back to 1.6.<br />
I'm sorry.<br />
If there are similar questions afterwards I hope to be helpful.

    <title>Unrecognized database format error&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ladybuggs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unrecognized database format error&#63;</h2>
                    We recently switced computers and I have a access database that will not work with the new PC.&nbsp; Both have MS Access 2007.&nbsp; THe new pc is 64 bit.&nbsp; When I try to open my database I get the following error " Unrecognized database format and the name and directory
 of the file.&nbsp; Any ideas what I'm doing wrong or can you point me in the right direction?

            <p>I appreciate all the input and have found my answer.&nbsp; The new pc was running MS Access 2007 and the old one was 2010.&nbsp; So the fix was to upload 2010 into the pc and everything now works.&nbsp; It was such an obvious fix but I was led astray by the wife when she
 thought everything was the same on the old and new PC.&nbsp; She is my computer expert and I did not bother to recheck until all other solutions were tried.&nbsp; Hope those with similar issues find answers quickly as I know how frustrating it can be.
</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
