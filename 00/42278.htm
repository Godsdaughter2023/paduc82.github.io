<h2>            How do I make an ad hoc network in Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I'm trying to create a wireless ad hoc network in windows 8.1 and I did all the commands in CMD, and shared it with my Local area connection. But when I try to connect another laptop to it, it says it's a limited network. I am clueless right now. Someone
 please help!

            <p>What are you trying to achieve? If you're connected to the internet via your Local Area Connection you'll want to share it with your hosted network, not vice versa. On top of that, I'm pretty sure when sharing your Local Area Connection, you don't want to
 share it with your physical wireless adaptor; instead share it with the Hosted Network Virtual Adaptor.</p>

            <p>How do I share it with the Hosted Network Virtual Adapter? Also, since the Internet in my house is really slow, I thought that making an ad hoc network between 2 laptops would help the speed. So should I just connect the laptops with an Ethernet cable for
 the ad hoc network or would it not solve any problems. I just need help configuring the ad hoc network. Please tell me if I am right or wrong.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>To be honest, I'm still not entirely clear on what you're trying to do. An ad-hoc network won't have any impact on your internet speeds. An ad-hoc network would be useful in that it would allow the laptops to communicate without needing an access point and,
 by extension, allow laptop B to use laptop A's internet connection if laptop A was connected to the internet via Ethernet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're thinking of connecting the two laptops via Ethernet, how would you connect to the internet? If you've the option of connecting to the internet wirelessly, then you may as well just connect both laptops to your access point wirelessly. That way
 they'll both have internet access and still be able to communicate with each other (if needed).</p>

<h2>            There is an &#34;echo&#34; when multiple users are connected at the same time. Very difficult to hear&#33;</h2>
                    When the five of us are all on Skype&nbsp;having a conference call, there is feedback or an "echo" where the same&nbsp;words are repeated twice in a row. This makes it very difficult to hear because the speaker has already gone on to a new sentence which merges
 with the echo from the first sentence. What are we doing incorrect? Seems to me that it might have something to do with sound coming in being picked up by the user's speaker and broadcast a second time. Do not know how to solve this?&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Skype Community forum</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the time, echo issues are being caused by the microphone and the speakers themselves, or the microphone being used picks up the audio output from the speaker.&nbsp;Further checking on this needs to be done and here is what you and the participants of
 the call can do:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you need to identify where the echo is coming from
<ul>
<li>The participants of the call can try to call ECHO 123 on their Skype contact list and on the playback message, check if you will hear an echo on it. Whoever experiences the echo should try some measures to fix it. But here are some tips that you can try:</li></ul>
</li><li>If the person is using an external microphones and speakers, try to lower it down or move the microphone further away from the speakers</li><li>Switching to a headset, a USB headset or other earphones if available.</li><li>If you have more than one microphones, make sure that only one is on. Check your webcam as it may have a microphone.</li><li>Try to refrain from downloading files, browsing the web, or doing any other bandwidth-intensive activities while on a Skype call.</li><li>Try to refresh your connections first before initiating the call again.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps but let me know what happens after trying the above information.</p>

<h3> itscheaptherapy  say:</h3>
<h2>            xbox 360&#47;one and which monitor..... 27&#38;quot&#59; IPS 2560x1440  OR  29&#38;quot&#59; IPS &#63;&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    

<p>So without wasting your time by explaining why it's down to these two options, here's the need to know...</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>

<p>I'm replacing my dual monitor setup and was initially attracted to the ultrawide 29" monitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I cannot decide between the 29" IPS panel versus a 27" IPS panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>While for work purposes i think the 29 has a slight edge just due to screen space (i'm using a 15" rMBP),</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>BUT I'm thinking the best option might be the 27" IPS because.......</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>

<p>the only other thing i want to do besides using my computer is gaming on my xbox360 an forthcoming xbox 1.</p>

<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Please don't clutter the thread by explaining the advantages of a 1080p 24"-27" high refresh rate monitor for serious gaming or whatever reason, just please help me with this decision.....</p>

<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Would the aspect ratio of the xbox on the 29" (21:9) versus the 27" IPS (i assume 16:9?) be that much worse?</p>


<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, any particular monitors or specs i should also note are welcome....thanks in advance for the help, cheers!!!</p>

<p><br />
<br />
</p>

<p>You will get some serious black bars on the side with the 21:9 aspect ratio on the 29" with consoles which default at 16:9. They are great to use in portrait for secondary monitors or for large displays if you watch a lot of movies, but I wouldn't want one
 as my main PC and gaming monitor. For PC work monitors I always liked 16:10 since you can stretch 16:9 and barely notice it. I would go with the 27" 16:9 monitor.

<p>I got email from skype in March 2017, about it being possible to reactivate my credit at any time...now however no sign of any such button...so where is the money I once payed? Has Skype changed its model - so irregular users get rid of their money - without

<h2>            Win 10 Version 1803 &#38; TPM Chipset</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><span>I have an Acer Aspire R13. After Win 10 Version 1803 update, I received a system security warning to reset the TPM Chipset. Microsoft recommended visiting ACER Security Advisory webpage (</span><a href="https://us.answers.acer.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/51137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://us.answers.acer.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/51137</a><span>)
 for updates before resetting the TPM, but as my laptop model was not listed there, I ended up resetting the TPM without applying any further updates from Acer.&nbsp; Windows 10 has the latest updates.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Win 10 Security system warning repeated the
 need to reset the Security Processor in order to fix some functionality issues.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I then ran tpm.msc the management Console of TPM.&nbsp; The TPM Manufacturer is INTC.&nbsp; The status was showing as not ready for use.&nbsp; From the right side Actions Menu, I applied "Prepare the TPM..." action.&nbsp; I restarted my laptop and the problem seemed at
 first to get resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On next wake from standby,&nbsp;</span><span>the problem re-surfaced.&nbsp; This time the management console threw in a message: "Compatible TPM cannot be found" and "Compatible Trusted Platform Module (TPM) cannot be found on this computer. Verify that this
 computer has a 1.2TPM or later and it is turned on in the BIOS.&nbsp; No actions can be applied.
</span><span>I checked and the TPM is turned on in the BIOS.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also checked the Device Manager and the TPM 2.0 is listed there and showing as working properly.&nbsp; Un-installing the device then re-starting the system did not resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I found many online complaints on the same issue but no solution other than uninstalling the Win 10 Version 1803 for now.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Do you recommend uninstalling and any solution you are aware of?</span></p>

<p>fwiw - some months back windows popped a message here wanting me to change my PIN from 4 digit to 6 digit so TPM could properly encrypt the key. &nbsp; Ever since I have used the same 6 digit key on 3 different laptops - one gave me issues - but once I cleared
 the Tpm in tpm.msc all was well.<br />

<h2>            my m9150f gives me a BIOHD-1 error</h2>
                    On my m9150f I just replaced the C Drive because it gave a SMART error with the imminent failure warning, which since then I’ve read could be a con job to get you to spend money replacing a drive that is in perfect working order. I bought a Western Digital
 WD1002FAEX, put it in and found the clips used to hook them up to be really lame with their clipping action, don’t snap when installed, they do resist unplugging when pulled lightly. Now when I started the PC everything went great with loading the Factory
 OS Discs all the way through the updates and my software. However when I run the f9 Diagnostic it gives me a BIOHD-1 error and I should check to make sure the wiring is secure, done this now 7 times. Everything is secure, I have even switched the larger of
 the two plugs and really see no differance, but the ones that are marked on a circuit board as A0 and A2 as their placement I have found determines which is the Primary Drive with the factory partition. AO Drive is the WD Drive and the Secondary Drive is the
 Seagate that came with the PC and nothing has been changed. I would like to know why I am getting this error and if there is anything that I can do to correct it. When I use the Hardware diagnostic tool in Help and Support it lists this error. Anyone got any
 help??????????????????<br />

            <p>I struggled with this for days. Here is what was happening and what I did that worked.</p>
<p>faultykeyboard.log listed 24 entries of the form&nbsp;&nbsp; kb*.kbd</p>
<p>I searched and no such files exist on&nbsp;my computer.</p>
<p>By running regedit and looking I found 24 abnormal looking subkeys matching the list in:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/CurrentControlSet/Control/Keyboard Layouts</p>
<p>After carefully reviewing the potential for damage I discovered that the operating system automatically restores this section of the registery if a boot failure occurs.</p>
<p>I then boldly deleted&nbsp;all subkeys of the type *.kbd from the registry. I deleted faultykeyboard.log. I rebooted then ran the update KB2686509 and it installed and rebooted the computer.</p>
<p>The problem is gone.&nbsp; Everything works.</p>

            Good tips in this thread. It ultimately led me to my solution. The problem computer here was also running a version of Windows XP modified with NLite.
<br />
<br />
I was able to resolve this problem by first opening the faulty keyboard log. On the problem computer, it was located in C:\Windows\system32\faultykeyboardlog.log.<br />
<br />
The faultykeyboard.log file simply listed these four items:<br />
KBDDV.DLL<br />
KBDUSX.DLL<br />
KBDUSL.DLL<br />
KBDUSR.DLL<br />
<br />
I went to a computer that I knew had an unmodified version of Windows XP Professional, copied those four DLL files from C:\Windows\system32. I then transfered them to the C:\Windows\system32 on the problem computer and re-ran the manual installation file for
 KB2686509 which can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29804" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29804</a>.<br />
<br />
Problem solved.<br />

            Hi Pierre,<br />
<br />
Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1:</b> <span>
I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check if the issue persists.<br />

<br />
Note: Make sure you reset the computer back to the normal mode once the troubleshooting is completed.<br />

<p>Hi Madhur,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern about updating the specified game in Windows Store can be due to a configuration related conflict on your device. To better understand your concern we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you're able to download and/or update other apps in Windows Store.</li><li>The version and build of Windows 10 that you're using on your device. To check this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we'd recommend uninstalling and reinstalling Windows Store to revert the settings of the app back to default. To do this, we'd recommend performing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Uninstall Store</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Search PowerShell using Cortana.</li><li>Right-click on Windows PowerShell and then select Run as administrator.</li><li>Copy and paste the command below.<br />
Get-AppxPackage *windowsstore* | Remove-AppxPackage</li><li>Press Enter on your keyboard.</li><li>Close the PowerShell window and check if you can still locate and launch the Store app. If you're unable to locate the app, proceed to the reinstalling Store steps below.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Reinstall Store</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Search PowerShell using Cortana.</li><li>Right-click on Windows PowerShell and then select Run as administrator.</li><li>Copy and paste the command below.<br />
Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}</li><li>Press Enter on your keyboard.</li><li>Locate and launch the Store app and check if you'll be able to open the affected applications.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Performing the procedure will uninstall apps that have been downloaded from Windows Store. Users will need to reinstall the applications to put them back on their devices.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Windows Store ?! This horror is made by a bunch of kids right ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all : WHY GEARS OF WAR IS NOT ON STEAM ? You can make a lot of money with it !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second : Installation process is painfull at least</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third : Update process ? It's a joke ?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last : You need a windows store account AND a xbox live account. You need also all the services on windows running (happy microsoft ? You find a way to f*** us because we like game you can spy on us ?)</p>

            Hi 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />This is consumer Windows forum. Windows server related question is best answered at Microsoft's Technet forum. I would suggest that you should post simultaneously (i.e. cross-post) to Technet forum also. So, your question will be on two forums - This and Technet. 
<br />
<br />Technet Windows Server forum - <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/office/en-US/home?category=windowsserver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/off...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi Eldos 
<br />
<br />I am sorry, there is currently no decrypter available for MrDec Ransomware. You will find lots of websites making some utility available to decrypt those files, these are scams. Decrypters are always provided for free by the major security companies . . .
<br />
<br />This is probably the best legitimate thread to keep a watch on, to see if a decrypter becomes available for MrDec . . .

<br />
<br />Currently there is no decrypter available for MrDec, if and when that becomes available, you will see news of that on the link I provided above
<br />
<br />BitDefender are usually the best company that work on those decrypters and provide them for free:

    <title>Network credentials&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trippap  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network credentials&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded a laptop that was running Win 8.1 Pro&nbsp;to Win 10 Pro. The laptop connects to my LAN wirelessly and there are&nbsp; five other computers on the same LAN, several with wired connections and two with wireless connections. All computers get good LAN
 access and access to the Internet, so I do not believe I have a router problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Win 8.1 I had no trouble sharing files with a computer running Win 7 (browsing/opening files on the Win 7 computer on the Win 8.1 computer). After the upgrade to Win 10, I cannot connect to anything on the Win 7 computer, even though file sharing is
 enabled with no passwords required. I get a dialog box asking me to enter Network credentials, and nothing I enter works, including the domain\username and password of the Win 7 computer. Windows, of course, gives no hint to what "network credentials" it is
 looking for or where the demand for credentials originates. The shares I set up on the Win 7 machine give full control permission to "Everyone".</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been discussions in the past about this sort of problem, but no definitive answers as to what causes it or what credentials are supposed to be entered to satisfy what piece of network security. I'd appreciate any ideas as to how to diagnose and
 fix this very annoying problem. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had very similar connectivity issues with my home network and I'm afraid the above advice didn't work with me or with the three Microsoft Experts that connected to my computer to see the problem for themselves. &nbsp;One even admitted to being baffled
 and confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I found my own solution, which was:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Start Menu - Settings (just above Power)</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Update and Security (bottom right)</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Recovery (4th option down)</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Reset this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Effectively it reloads Windows whilst keeping your files and most of the settings. &nbsp;After this I have Network bliss and can see everything on my network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>
        </p>

            <p>I too have this problem with windows 10 pro. I could not access my network shares as it kept telling me wrong user name and password. I tried everything including reinstalling windows 10 pro 3 times yesterday but each time it could see my network share but
 kept telling me I was using the wrong username/password. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I figured I would reinstall windows 7 ultimate and it found my share no problem and the user name and password worked first time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is something wrong with the networking, as Win 10 pro did work for about 4 days until I had this issue then once it would not let me log on as it kept saying wrong username/password every time I entered it for my one network share, but windows 7 no
 problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and this network share is on a windows 8.1 computer and I can log onto it with an old laptop with windows 10 home, and other computers with Linux, windows xp pro, windows 7 home premium, vista, and ultimate but win 10 pro no way would it take the username
 and password, it kept telling me it was wrong. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So microsoft please fix this ASAP. you broke the networking in 10. Can you make it as good as 7 is, that would be a step in the right direction.</p>

            I think they just want us all on Windows 10?. Mine seems to be now working and I have no explanation other than a possible fix was in an update of which I have no knowledge. Having installed Windows 8 a little too soon I have to say 10 is working pretty
 well in comparison. I did reinstall the homegroup which initially didn't seem to fix the problem&nbsp;but I will be updating my Windows 7 to 10 in the near future.

            <p>What version of windows 10 are you running? Pro is screwed as of Aug 7 2015, and I will not be going back to it till this is confirmed fixed in PRO.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am happy have yours working well and wish you the best of luck with it, but for me and my customers I can not suggest to switch to 10, if they lose networking it would be a disaster, so Microsoft needs to answer this and fast.</p>

            now I'm embarrassed. I have 2 computers on &nbsp;Windows 10 pro. No 1 sees&nbsp;No2 computer this morning and I can access it. No2 sees it but won't let me access. Yesterday the both worked. No1 sees and accesses No3 which is on windows 7, but No2 doesn't access
 that one either today. No2 computer was a fresh install, whilst No1 was an update. This is not good so I agree with you, there is still a problem. Looking at all the comments it seems to have been a problem all through the test cycle, so why they still have
 not fixed it, is anybody's guess. I said that at the beginning of windows 8 when there were several things that didn't work.

            Have had it working intermittently, which is a new one for me as usually when you come across a software problem it either works or it doesn't, although I'm sure that is not always true, but in this instance there is a peculiarity about it. Sometimes rewriting
 the password on the homegroup seems to fix it, other times playing backwards and forwards between network and homegroup seems to get it going--- like a loose screw somewhere.

<p>You will find a solution at www.winhelponline.com/blog/save-and-restore-desktop-icon-layout.</p>
<p>Once you have installed this fix, you should right-click on any empty area on the Desktop to save your desktop layout.&nbsp; Use the same procedure to revert to the saved layout.</p>

            Hi,
<br />There is always a chance that 3rd party programs can cause problems with the PC.
<br />I suggest you to revert back to earlier backups or system restore point before it was installed.

            Hello,
<br />If you continue to have problems, try doing a repair install. A repair Install keeps everything and reinstalls Windows.
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2016/06/how-to-do-repair-install-using-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2016/06/how-to-...</a>

<br />The best and the easiest way is to use first method in the first article.

            The reset Image might be corrupt. You would have to download an ISO file on another computer for both repair install or a reset.

<p>I have the same problem as above. I also can't be called for months now, on my skype 085-number. (in the beginning it worked sometimes, but now it totally failes). I tried reinstalling the software. Deleting it from multiple devices,
 and keep it only on my Phone. Tried different setting, but nothing seems to work. Also adjust batterie-settings of my Phone. When calling the number it says direct: 'your call is not being aswerd at the moment...….'.</p>

<h2>            Volume Fluctuations - Whenever I open a new tab or program the volume increases exponentially.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title - Volume Fluctuations</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I open a new tab or program the volume increases exponentially. The number doesn't change, like if I have it set to "8" it stays at "8", but the volume gets extremely loud. Whenever this happens I just adjust the volume, either by left clicking
 the volume control on the task bar or by pressing Fn + F2 (which decreases the set volume). When I do this the volume reverts back to the regular volume level. I do not know how to fix this.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to help you better, could you please confirm a couple of things:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></li><li>Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Have you installed all the pending Windows update?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to check in Clean Boot state as below and check whether the issue persists or not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the article How to perform a clean boot in Windows in the below link and check if it helps:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a>
<strong>(Applies to Windows 10 as well).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong><strong>:</strong> Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section
<strong>“<span>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</span>”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.</p>
