<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade issues - Inaccessible Boot Device and Invalid Value for Registry</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded my Lenovo A740 (i7-4558 CPU @2.8 GHz, 8GB RAM) to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 a couple of weeks ago.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a couple&nbsp;of days, I&nbsp;noticed that&nbsp;I am unable to&nbsp;install the Windows cumulative updates KB3081424 and KB3081436. I was finally able to install the updates after deleting a key&nbsp;entry in the registry- as suggested in one of the&nbsp;Microsoft Community threads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;also noticed that while my&nbsp;(administrator) account&nbsp;and my wife's (Standard User) account&nbsp;were working properly, my sons' child accounts&nbsp;were unable to access the Windows Store and most of the Microsoft Apps. I tried executing 'wsreset.exe' from the command
 prompt, but I got the following error - 'Invalid value for registry'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this problem was persisting, I thought of resetting my PC (Settings/Update &amp; Security/Recovery/Reset this PC). When I tried doing so, the reset process went through to 95% and then got an error message that the PC cannot be reset because of 'Inaccessible
 Boot Device'. I got a further message mentioning 'Undoing the Changes' after which my PC restarted without going through the reset process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now stuck with a Windows 10 installation that is not fully functional and I am unable to do a clean reinstall by resetting my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please help me fix this. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I have upgraded the A740 to windows 10 and it was working fine. I did notice the Boot up takes longer and the screen was blank for longer duration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was working fine for a week and after which the system is not booting up (or screen doesn't show anything) i could hear hard drive running.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you let me know how to fix this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen issues with Win 10 upgrade in forums not sure how to go forward with this.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Ray,
<br />
<br />Have you used a mail merge to get the data form Excel into Word and print your labels form Word?
<br />
<br />Here is a full step by step on how to do that:

                    <p>Recently I found that flickering sometimes appear on upper left edge of the screen.</p>
<p>And then the mouse cursor cannot be seen and is not responding.</p>
<p>The following is a picture of this,</p>
<p>Is it a hardware issue or driver problem?</p>
<p>Is there any solution or should I exchange a new one?</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

<p>I would try a reset first but if u are still within the 30 day return period returning it is probably the safest approach.</p>

<h3> ccbeebiz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Desktop Connection has appeared in my Start menu, but I didn&#39;t use it, does this mean somebody else has gained access&#63;</h2>
                    I sat at my computer today (I'm the only one who uses it) and pulled up the Start menu. There were four programs listed there that I haven't used for many months:<br />
<br />
Remote Desktop Connection<br />
Dreamweaver MX<br />
Freehand MX<br />
MS Office Picture Manager<br />
<br />
I think this means somebody has gained access to my system.<br />
<br />
Can I change my Remote Desktop Connection to protect against this or is some more complete analysis of my machine needed?<br />
<br />
The settings in Remote Desktop Connection include providing Everyone access to Read and Read &amp; Execute. If I remove these options will that make me safer? Does Skype use this access (that's the only thing I use that might, I think)?<br />
<br />
I have already gone to System Properties and disabled remote access.<br />

<p>Over the past few months Java has indicated that there is an update available.&nbsp; When I authorize it to update, it displays and error message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Error - Java(tm) Update</p>
<p>Failed to download required installation files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After one attempt a window opened with information stating that Windows was having difficulty with the program and had made adjustments to the version - and the issue would be resolved the next time I ran Java Update.&nbsp;&nbsp; It did not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>**** UPDATE ****</p>
<p>Problem solved - by logging into the same computer, using a User Account with Admin privileges, Java installed without fail.</p>
<p>Usually I work in a User Account which has only Standard User account privileges and Java Update failed on this account setting, even after it prompted the Administrator to allow the update to continue.</p>
<p>Someone please mark this question as 'Answered', thank you.</p>

            The last driver from Canon was for XP and was dated 2002. I would think that there is absolutely no chance of ever getting a Win 7 64-bit driver for it..

<h2>            WinDef Error Code 8050800c and System Restore Error 80070002 are Related</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
Over the last twoo weeks a lot of discussion has been going on for the WinDef-and MSE-error 8050800c.&nbsp; The known problem that lies in that WInDef cannot scan or update at required intervals, has created havoc and thousands of users are complaining and at the
 same time try to find a solution.<br />
<br />
I'm one of those users.&nbsp; The issue is not only that MS has not come-up with a fix, but also that WinDef exhibits strange behavior.&nbsp; Strange in a sense that one day is working and the other is not.<br />
<br />
At the same time, people started having problems with the System Restore in Vista, where everything is working properly, except the fact that the system won't revert back to the specified date, coming up with an "unspecified error" notification, and an error
 code 80070002.<br />
<br />
I'm one of those users too.&nbsp; Looking around for solutions to both almost simultaneously and recent problems that hit my pc, I found that solutions suggested by MS people are circling around the ProfileImage registry keys.<br />
<br />
Although these issues are being treated as separate issues, I believe that they are related.&nbsp; For example in this forum, concerning the WinDef error a solution was suggested recently around the ProfileImage.<br />
<br />
But a similar thing was suggested by the MS team studying SR points problems.<br />
<br />
Please look at these links. <br />
<br />

<br />
I would appreciate your views and a possible solution to both of these issues please.&nbsp; Note that I have already checked my ProfileImage values.&nbsp; All are well created, except a key that is in there where it looks completely empty.<br />
<br />
Thanks alot in advance.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the information; your efforts are highly appreciated.</p>
<p>This happens when the Windows Vista restore wizard cannot access the files because of denied access or because of missing or corrupted restore points.</p>
<p>To successfully restore the computer to an earlier state, make sure there are non corrupt restore points and also the Windows Backup and Volume Shadow Copy services are up and running.</p>
<p>Login to the computer as an administrator and follow these steps.<br />
1. Start Windows Backup and Volume Shadow Copy services.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Click Start, type services.msc and hit enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Check for Windows Backup and Volume Shadow Copy services and start them.<br />
2. Start the computer in safe mode and initiate system restore and check the result.<br />
Safe mode: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Why magnifier won&#39;t close sometime in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have problem with close magnifier both version 2.3 and 2.5 of Mouse and Keyboard in Windows 10. When I press mouse's button to open magnifier, I press mouse's button but it won't close magnifier. I tried press Windows logo + ESC key but it won't close
 magnifier.<br />
Why magnifier won't close sometimes in Windows 10? Magnifier don't have problem with old Windows 7 and Windows 8.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try using these methods to fix the account.<br />
<br />
You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup. The ADMIN account in Safe<br />
Mode has no password by default so unless someone changed it that can be used.<br />
<br />
Some programs like the Google Updater (if you added the Google Toolbar, Chrome&nbsp;or Google<br />
Earth) has been known to cause this issue.<br />
<br />
How to Fix the Error "The User Profile Service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded."<br />

How to Fix the Error "Your user profile was not loaded correctly! You have been logged on with<br />

<br />
BE VERY CAREFUL IF USING THIS ONE :<br />
<br />
DO NOT USE THE HIDDEN ACCOUNT ON A DAILY BASIS! If it corrrups you are TOAST.<br />

How to Enable or Disable the Real Built-in Administrator Account in Vista<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67567-administrator-account.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67567-administrator-account.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to user APPLY / OK then raise it back to<br />
ADMIN. This helps clear corruption. Do same for other accounts if needed after following the<br />
above message.<br />
<br />
You can use the Hidden Admin Account - Make another account as ADMIN with your same<br />
password (or two with same password) use one to test or fix the other.<br />
<br />
You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span></a><br />
<br />
If you can't access your old account you can still use an Admin to migrate to a new one (remember<br />
to always leave an Admin Account that is unused except to test and fix).<br />
<br />

<p>Hello, I have recently bought a panasonic avchd camcorder that has .mts clips.&nbsp; I can't import them into windows movie maker live.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; So I imported the clips using the software that came with the camera (but wanted to get them into wlmm because soft.
 was extremely limited) and I converted them to mpeg and than imported them into wlmm.&nbsp; The video was there, but no audio.&nbsp; I don't know what to do.&nbsp; I am not by any means tech savvy but need help thanks! I have windows vista.&nbsp; Do I need to update to windows

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>AVCHD video file is not supported type of file in Windows Live Movie Maker. That is the reason why you were not able to import it. You may be able
 to use a non-Microsoft video editing program to convert the file into a format that Windows Movie Maker supports, and then import the resulting audio or video file into Windows Movie Maker. Some files also require you to install a codec before you can use
 the files in Windows Movie Maker.</span></p>

<h2>            Ideazon Zmerc gaming keyboard problems</h2>
                    <p><span>Dear Microsoft Team,</span></p>
<p><span>I own a</span><span> Ideazon Zmerc gaming Keyboard (</span>http://www.overclockersclub.com/siteimages/articles/ideaz_merc/3.jpg) with extra Keys on the lefthandside for gaming and a num block on the righthandside with special functions
 when numlock is toggled off. Both, the gaming keys and numpad keys aren't working - however, the Special function keys are working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a Windows Insider and testing the new Insider build of Windows 10. Some user experienced Problems since the updates&nbsp;<span>KB4032188 and KB4034674 (</span>https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/6nmb1r/help_on_zboard_keyboard_driver_incompatibility/)<span>.
 By unstalling this updates, the Keyboard is working as expected.</span></p>
<p>I really need my numpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please fix this issue.</span></p>

            I second this as well. This issue has occurred on numerous occasions, to numerous customers all having the same problem with separate Cumulative Security Updates. Either correct the issue so this no longer happens, or give us an option to decline the updates
 rather than waking up to it the next day to find out our keyboard no longer works, due to no fault of their own. I deleted the update early this afternoon, then as of 6:17 pm while I was gone the computer automatically updated and reinstalled the update which
 is causing this problem. This occurs with EVERY cumulative update. Please correct this issue. We should not have to deal with this with every given update Microsoft deems fit for us. This is not a new complaint. I've looked in the records and it's been brought
 up numerous times for over a year now.

<p>Hi Daniel Solomon, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yes, you can use your debit card as your payment method in purchasing Skype products like Skype Number. However, you need to register your card in Netbanking. For more information you can check this FAQ link:

</p><p>I have gone through process , but I haven't seen the option of Netbanking or debit card for purchasing Skype number. Is there any other way&nbsp; to purchase product for 1 year?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype credit has option for only 3 months. It looks like skype number has only one option for payment i.e Skype credit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to use one skype number both for calling and as Caller Id. So , I can't go for subscription.</p>
<p>Kindly help me in this process.</p>

            A required CD/DVD device driver is missing <br />
<br />
1) Change BIOS boot order - The most successful fix for this issue is to set the optical (DVD) drive as the first boot device in the BIOS. To do this, first enter BIOS mode as follows:
<br />
<br />
This is accomplished by pressing a specific key repeatedly as soon as your computer is turned on (or right after it is restarted). For many computers, the key is&nbsp; F1, F2, F10, the Delete (del) key or the Escape (ESC) key. Consult your computer or motherboard?s
 manual or try different keys until you find the right one. <br />
Find the screen or option for changing the boot order. Follow the instructions for changing the boot order.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
2) If you downloaded Windows 7 and burned it to a DVD, double check that you burned the .ISO file as a disk image (and not as a regular file) to the empty DVD. If you burn it to a DVD again use the lowest speed possible. It's also possible the download has
 errors, try downloading it again. <br />
<br />
3) Update ITE ATA driver - Failing the above, try booting back into Windows Vista or XP. Launch Windows Update and install the ITE ATA driver update before attempting the upgrade. The upgrade advisor may not find this driver.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4) Switch from SATA to AHCI - Follow the aforementioned instructions for booting into your computer?s BIOS, then check your HDD or storage settings. Turn off SATA, switching to AHCI, and reboot normally, then re-attempt installation of Windows 7. Also try switching
 to IDE. <br />
<br />
Also, there's 2 main threads for this issue, one that seems to be related to retail disks (and others):

<h2>            Windows 10 boot with 2 min black screen before logon</h2>
                    <p>I have done a few win 10 upgrade and most went well. But on this laptop [HP proBook 4730s, 8 GB RAM, i5 CPU] it gets to a black screen for 2 minutes when booting. When booting, after the BIOS it displays the Logo for 10 seconds then a black screen (without
 the mouse as it happens on some other PCs) for 2 minutes before getting to the Logon screen. Then it is still slow to finish installing the antivirus etc. All updates have been done.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi John,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode and then perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong>Shift key</strong> when clicking the <strong>Restart button.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong>Troubleshoot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>c. Next, hit <strong>
Advanced</strong> options followed by <strong>Windows Startup Settings</strong> from the next screen.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>F4 for Safe Mode
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>For more information you may refer to the article mentioned below.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>Windows Startup
 Settings (including safe mode)</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong> Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files
 and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3: </span>
</strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to
<strong>temporarily disable the antivirus security software program</strong> installed on your computer and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software.
 If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer
 is vulnerable to malware attacks.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Gupa10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 09/17/15, See PS2 below</p>
<p>Thanks for your help. I have tried the above options without success and now I am stuck...</p>
<p>First:</p>
<p>_ With startup on safemode as "minimal", it boots fast (25") till logon prompt and no black screen. (All OK but for Audio and WiFi)</p>
<p>_ With only MS services, all other services turned off including security it has the same original issue ( 2 min of black screen)</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT</p>
<p>Now I have an other problem. With MSCONFIG I have turned off some more MS services and now windows can't start... It gets to the logon prompt, I enter the password then the dots turn for a few seconds and it freezes. From the look of the screen resolution,
 it was starting in safemode. &nbsp;I haven't been able to "Repair", even booting with the WIN10 USB media, the Repair option says it can't do it.</p>
<p>With the command prompt I have found a log file &nbsp;SrtTrail.txt that says &nbsp;"Operating System Version is incompatible with Startup Repair"... But it is the same media I used to do the windows 10 upgrade?&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I reset/restore the msconfig file? (09/14/2015)</p>
<p>Please Help.</p>
<p>Thanks John</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Since writing the above, I have done a System Restore, It reported a failure and now it starts to boot in safe mode, after entering the password I see the SafeMode desktop with the System Restore windows saying that it was successful but freezes there,
 mouse or any input. I have power down and tried a few times, it is always stuck there. (09/15/2015)</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS2: As I haven't been able to restart, I have reverted to Win7Pro, Updated all drivers and re-installed WIN 10, did all the current updates without any problem but the Boot time is the same, 90 Sec of black screen. (09/17/2015)</p>

    <title>Windows Speech Recognition Macros run when they shouldn&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lancemolyneaux  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Speech Recognition Macros run when they shouldn&#39;t</h2>
                    I'm having an issue with the Windows Speech Recognition Macros running at strange times:<br />
<br />
- If I use one macro another macro or two run straight after it.<br />
- Macros run when my mic is muted.<br />
- Even when there's silence macros will run.<br />
- There doesn't seem to be a pattern to which Macros are run.<br />
<br />
I can't work out what causes the macros to run when they shouldn't, but it definitely seems like the mic/speech recognition isn't the problem.<br />
Any help would be much appreciated.<br />
Thanks

            <p>If you are using an external microphone with WSR, but your computer ALSO has a built-in microphone, make sure the built-in microphone is set to Disabled in the Recording tab of the Sound control panel. This will make sure that the built-in microphone isn't
 inadvertently affecting WSR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could there be a short in the wire connecting your microphone to the computer? To check, use the Sound Recorder program to record yourself speaking into the microphone for 20 or 30 seconds. Then play it back, listening carefully for any static, which if
 present&nbsp;could be firing off macros even when the microphone is muted. (You could also try recording silence and listen for static.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say "mic is muted," I'm assuming you mean you have pressed a mute button on your microphone or USB sound card, and that WSR is still in "Listening" mode. If macros are&nbsp;running while WSR is set to "Sleeping" or "Off&nbsp;," then...well, that's pretty
 bizarre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of this helps, please post more information about the computer, Windows OS, microphone, and sound card that you're using. Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your prompt reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the 'Sound' Settings I only have one single recording device and that is my Headset, it is a desktop computer so unless there is some hidden mic I'm not aware of I think it is only my external microphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the sound recorder as your suggested but didn't hear anything that indicates a fault with my microphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're correct about the mute button on my headset, but I have tested muting my mic WITHOUT the Speech Recognition Macros, just the standard WSR commands and none of the standard commands are run so this leads me to believe that it is a fault with the Windows
 Speech Recognition Macro software rather than my microphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regard to WSR sleeping or off, none of the macros run when WSR is in either of these states.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled WSRMacros but that wasn't any help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running:</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span>Thanks for providing additional details about your computer setup. Your gaming microphone has both a USB connector and a 3.5mm connector, and based on looking at the manual, it appears that the microphone input is going into the computer through the
 USB connector. This would mean there is a mini sound card built into the module on the cord, and there should be a listing in the Recording tab of the Sound control panel for your Turtle Beach microphone.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The manual isn’t clear about how audio output gets into the headphones. It’s clear that audio output comes through the 3.5mm connector, but the manual also seems to say that this output might be coming through the USB connection as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also, the headset has its own microphone volume control and a "chat boost" feature, which are not common on microphones designed for use with speech recognition, and could be causing fits for Windows Speech Recognition. When you first set up Windows
 Speech Recognition, you may remember running through a “Set up microphone” routine, which sets a specific microphone volume and SNR for WSR. If after doing this you later make adjustments to the microphone volume with the headset controls, then the volume
 going into WSR is more or less than it is expecting. This could be bad.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So here are&nbsp;some things to check:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>If the 3.5mm connector is plugged into&nbsp;the microphone jack by mistake, unplug it and plug it into&nbsp;the speaker/headphone jack. Not all computers color code their ports, so it can be an easy mistake to make.</span></li><li><span>If the 3.5mm connector is plugged into the correct jack, try disconnecting it. On the Playback tab of the Sound&nbsp;control panel, you may be able to set the headset to receive the sound&nbsp;through USB by selecting the Turtle Beach sound card.</span></li><li><span>If the headset came with any software that permits disabling the microphone volume and chat boost features, try that. If not, try lowering the headset microphone volume control and see if that helps. Also, try repeating the WSR “Set up microphone”
 option in the Speech control panel, and don’t change the Turtle Beach microphone volume features after that. Experiment with low and high headset volume settings, making sure to repeat the WSR "Set up microphone" routine after each change.</span></li><li><span>Even though you can't hear it when you make recordings with your microphone, something about your system may be causing noise to be generated that is triggering the macros. If your headset is plugged into ports on the front of the computer, try switching
 to ports on the back. Maybe that port location will be less prone to interference. (The&nbsp;ports on the back of the computer are generally believed to be less susceptible to interference because the ports are usually on the logic board. Front panel ports&nbsp;have
 long wires to logic board connectors, and those wires are susceptible to interference from other internal components.) Heck, if your headset&nbsp;has always been&nbsp;plugged into the back, it can’t hurt to try switching it to the front.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Give these a shot and let me know how it goes. I have more ideas if these don't work.</span></p>

            <p>Sorry for the delayed reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 3.5mm plug isn't connected to the computer at all as I have my speakers plugged in to the 3.5mm plug on the mother board, this way I can switch between the two playback devices in software without having to interchange hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try the WSR Macros with the 3.5mm plugged in without any luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attempted to 'set up microphone' a couple of times without modifying the volume on the headset but that hasn't seem to solve the problem either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't attempted to plug the USB cable from the headset into the front ports but I've switched it between all the back ports as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any more ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all your help so far!</p>

            <p>You could also try using a process of elimination to determine if certain macros are&nbsp;causing the problem. Start by taking half the macros out of your Speech Macros folder and see if you still have a problem. If you still do, swap the macros you removed with
 the ones you kept. If the problem stops, then one of the macros you removed may be the culprit. Add back the macros you removed in small batches until you identify the problem macro (or macros).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any problems with macros would likely occur in the the &lt;listenFor&gt; statements because that's what Windows Speech Recognition is listening for to trigger them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want to try lowering the microphone volume using the headset controls (still a worthwhile suggestion IMO) and you are comfortable working with the registry, you could follow the instructions in this post to check and perhaps lower the microphone
 levels used by WSR:</p>

<p>
</p><p>You could also consider getting a microphone/headset that is designed for speech recognition. These companies can provide&nbsp;microphones that work well with WSR:&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried your suggestions about removing the macros from the folder without any luck.</p>
<p>I also edited the registry to turn down the volume and that didn't have much effect either.</p>
<p>Recently however I resigned all my macros with a new certificate and in the last 30 minutes the problem seems to have disappeared. If it comes back I'll let you know.</p>

<p>I got one. The Spectre. Try it again. It's really the best submachine gun in the game that's if you know how to use a submachine gun. You have to be close to people and move around a lot. With rapid fire, it's awesome. I've been having fun with the stakeout
 grip lately. I use steady aim with it, though, not sleight of hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;m16/acog/silencer ........ great for medium to long range</p>
<p>**********</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;m60/rds hardened &nbsp;..... the rds seems to make it as accurate as the grip firing bursts, &nbsp;and I prefer hardened over 2 attachments so I can shoot people inside buildings. 100 rounds before reloadingis plenty of ammo in most cases.</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;hs 10 ...dual weild ..... the range is just horrible, but using fj/steady aim or hardened/ninja is probably the most fun class I've run.</p>
<p>*******</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;spas ...... little less fun than the dual hs 10s .... but way more effective. Even at longer range ....... if you keep firing, you may not even get hitmarkers, but it will eventually kill.</p>

<p>Like others have said either Rapid Fire (what I use) or a grip if you are having trouble controlling it. If you are already having trouble controlling it and you put on Rapid Fire its gonna get a lot worse. I would give it another try at least. It takes
 some getting used to like most guns. I've probably got less than a hundred kills with a MAC11 in my entire combat record and I've got like 6 days played lol.</p>

<h2>            Vista spontaneously restarts after shut down</h2>
                    I'm running Windows Vista on a Toshiba Satellite M305-S4910; this laptop is only about 2 months old.&nbsp; I've been noticing that when I attempt to shut it down, it restarts itself almost immediately afterwards.&nbsp; I know for sure that I am shutting it down;
 I go through the Start menu and everything.&nbsp; and my laptop fully powers down.&nbsp; usually, a few minutes later, it restarts itself for no apparent reason.&nbsp; before this would usually happen only once or twice [maybe three times] before I could get it to stay off.&nbsp;
 most recently, however, I attempted to shut it down approximately 10 times, each with the same result: my laptop would turn itself back on.&nbsp; I finally gave up and just went to bed, leaving my laptop on.<br />
<br />
can anyone think&nbsp;of a way to remedy my laptop woe?&nbsp; any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

            This may not be an Os related issue. You should contact the hardware vendor or check for a latest firmware/BIOS update from the vendor website for your laptop.

            I too run vista on a Toshiba Satellite P205. My shutdown with automatic restart problem is only when the power cord is attached. If the power cord is not being used the unit will shut down properly. When this pc was new it had the shutdown/restart problem
 along with hibernate or standby resulting in the unit never waking up. I sent it in to Toshiba for repair under warranty so they do what they normally do, wipe out the hard drive and reinstall the software. So when it returned I had no personal data and the
 same two issues I had when I pulled it out of the box. <br />
<br />
Hope one day Toshiba can figure it out and send a fix.

            I am also facing the same problem as you are guys. I am running windows vista on a fujitsu notebook... I did not face this problem just until 3 mos of my purchase. I have been doing some research and I have even consulted a technical support person from
 fujitsu and I have reformated my HD and did a clean restore of my system software but to no avail I am still facing the same problem. I believe this is being experienced by many windows vista users and as far I have known microsoft has not found any patch
 to this problem but maybe somebody out there has already got some answer and he might want to share it with us.

<h2>            Skype for Business - Enable for HelpDesk &#47; IT Support &#40;Share the support line&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello -</p>
<p>
</p><p>We run Skype for Business as part of office 365.&nbsp; We have the e3 licenses with add-on's.&nbsp; I have 4 users that work on our help desk, and I need a good way to have them answer both the help desk phone line, (which has it's own account and e3 license,) and
 to be able to answer skype calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I am using CX300 phones that store the login to work around this.&nbsp; The (4) support engineers have skype e3 accounts in their own names and I was wondering how to make this work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Essentially I am looking for a way for any of the 4 of them to answer if someone calls the help desk line, and possibly be able to respond to IM's in skype for the help desk account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Matthew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description I understand that you want the 4 Helpdesk users to answer an additional phone call in another dedicated Helpdesk phone line with calling plan enabled, is that correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, please check if set up call forwarding to group of these Helpdesk members can meet your requirement. Please check the<strong> Edit team-call members</strong> part in this following article and feel free to let me know if there is anything unclear.</p>
<p>
