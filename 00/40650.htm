<h2>            Photos App in Windows 10</h2>
                    I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to use the Photo app found in Windows 10 to view my Google Photos?&nbsp; Is there a way to direct it to look to the cloud to bring down previews?&nbsp;

            Hey Paul,
<br />
<br />The Photos app doesn't provide access to Google Drive, but what it does provide access to is OneDrive. It actually would make a great feature, you should file a suggestion through the Feedback Hub (hit Windows key + F together) and tell them all about it. 
<br />
<br />You'll have to continue using Google Drive on the web, or you can open the Microsoft Store and look for an app like GoPhotos for Google Photos, Photos Pro for Google Photos (paid), and so on to view your Google Photos through an app.
<br />
<br />Hope that clears it up at least.       
        </p>

            Hey Cal.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.   
<br />
<br />There are tips here for managing smaller drives including 32gb drives: 
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br />Then for version Upgrades what works best is to install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   If you wait a few days Spring Creators Version 1803 will be loaded into the Media Creation Tool so you can have the latest:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />Track release of v.1803 here:  <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />If that's not enough then clean out the Upgrade Assistant and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

            Hi Cal,
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of Windows 10 - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next 2 years of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything ! 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

Then for version Upgrades what works best is to install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file
 to Run as Administrator. This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files. If you wait a few days Spring Creators Version 1803 will be loaded into the Media Creation Tool so you can have the latest:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> <br />
Track release of v.1803 here: <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a> <br />
<br />
If that's not enough then clean out the Upgrade Assistant and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />
First turn off Windows Update service to regain control: <br />
<br />
Type services.msc in Start Search, Open Services applet. <br />
<br />
Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled. Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />
Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features. <br />
<br />
Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root. Restart PC, try Upgrade again. <br />
<br />
Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>. <br />
<br />
This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:

https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>. <br />
<br />
There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:

https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a> <br />
<br />
You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you. <br />
<br />
There are ways to block Updates here: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a> <br />
<br />
If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates. You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows
 Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved

<p>Thanks, These Advice Help Me. But There just few problems, 1. I didn't had a Second PC, or a USB Stick to Upgrade to the latest version of my computer. 2. A few Months ago, When I'm about to Updating My Computer to the newest Version, I used a 32GB SDHC
 Card, And It Didn't Work. And 3. When I'm about to do A Fresh Installment of Windows 10 today, It's Send an Error that I need 8GB (ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!) So Can you find a better alternative to deal with 32GB? Or How to stick with the Current Version, Thus
 keeping my Computer safe from Virus, Malware, And Security Updates at the same time? I appreciated that. Thanks ;)</p>

            See if you can Download the Windows 10 ISO to the SD card.  If necessary use the direct download site here, just make sure you use the correct version for your license:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />Then open the SD card click on the ISO to mount it, right click to Run Setup.  
<br />
<br />Follow all other steps I gave including all suggestions to make space on smaller drives including moving files off or into the cloud using OneDrive on Demand:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />I'd wait a few more days until the new version is released, spending the time making all preparations in my first post including all suggestions for smaller drives in the links.

            Cal, If you want to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems. 
<br />
<br />You can post back here the Feedback Share link and I'll vote it up with my MVP badge FWIW.    I fully agree but they want to hear it via the Feedback Hub.

<p>Thank you for the&nbsp; information.&nbsp; I tried method 1 and the program reported that I needed to run&nbsp; Syn Settings in Control Panel, but the option to syn settings cannot be accessed.&nbsp; Method 1 program says the administrator must do it when I use Advanced - fix
 problems option. &nbsp;It seems the operating system doesn't think I am the administrator, but I am shown as the administrator in the control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something has gotten out of whack.&nbsp; How do I convince the operating system I am the administrator?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes I also did the scanning for problems and for viruses and malware.&nbsp; No malware was found.</p>
<p>I did the administrator /yes/no procedure.&nbsp; I am not sure I understood it correctly.&nbsp; A separate administrator was created, but I could login as that administrator because I was asked for a password and I did not know what to use.&nbsp; I wasn't able to change
 the password.</p>
<p>Also, logged in as myself, I couldn't change Sync Settings to access my One Drive.&nbsp; So&nbsp; I did the "no" step and I am back to the same problem.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to disable third-party security software and check the issue. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press Windows + X keys and click control panel.</p>
<p>b. Click "System and Security" and then click "Action Center".</p>
<p>c. Either you may disable your security software from action center or from its own control panel.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as
 soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>

                    So I got a new desktop, I added my account as administrator, and added 2 other of my siblings as standard accounts. This computer is 8.1 and I got a update (I'm guessing it's for windows 10). I held off on updating because i have a laptop that was Windows
 10 and had an update for the Windows Anniversary Update or whatever, basically when i tried updating my laptop to the windows anniversary it caused major problems, my laptop wouldn't start up so i had to do a bunch of things manually to fix it and in the end
 after many YouTube tutorials i fixed it somehow, so after that experience i was a bit 'ehh' on weather I should update this Desktop or not, in the end i did. During the update everything that happened to me while updating my laptop happened to me again. Again
 went through a bunch of trouble to fix it in the end i ended up restarting my computer from the last update, all my programs got deleted and my accounts got all funky, i ended up with 3 Administrator accounts, mine, and my 2 o

<p>The account may have been corrupted in changing back to Windows 8.1, so you may need to create a new Standard account to replace it, copy the files over, test programs work from it or reinstall them.&nbsp; Then when ready delete the old account, if necessary
 changing it first to a Local Account.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Switching Tabs While Playing Games Windows 10</h2>
                    I am currently playing games on my laptop running windows 10 on full screen. Sometimes while playing, I will click on the sides of the screen and it will switch tabs to what was behind the game. This is particularly annoying in situations when I am in
 a fight and my laptop will just switch tabs. Is there any way that I can disable this from happening? (The game will take up the entire screen but when I click, my laptop will still go to the tab behind it)

<p>Hi AMK13210,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When tabs switch when clicking on either side of an open window, it might be because the game is only on a borderless window mode which makes an open game seem like it's on full screen but it's not. At this point, you might want to check the game's settings
 for this. To further isolate the issue, try to replicate the issue with a different game and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out.</p>

            <p>You exported the BCD store to c:\boot?&nbsp; Hopefully you did not add the space after boot and did add a space after bcd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It really should be an attrib command such attrib -h -r -s c:\boot\bcd</p>
<p>
</p><p>ATTRIB [+R | -R] [+A | -A ] [+S | -S] [+H | -H] [+I | -I]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [drive:][path][filename] [/S [/D] [/L]]</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are trying to change the permissions on a file so you can copy it elsewhere..&nbsp; Is your system not booting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look at Disk Management, which partition shows as "System" because that is where the boot files are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you just type bcdedit do you get a short&nbsp;listing of the BCD store?</p>

            I haven't played it yet, but may I give you a general suggestion?<br />
A great way to understand if you may like a game or not is watching at gameplays and more on Mixer. I have lots of fun with the live streams, but I admit I also use it as a valuable way to help me choose between games.

            To remove the log-in password:
<br />First, click the Windows 10 Start Menu and type Netplwiz. Select the program that appears with the same name.
<br />
<br />This window gives you access to Windows user accounts and many password controls. Right at the top is a checkmark next to the option labeled Users must enter a username and password to use this computer.” Uncheck that.
<br />When you click Apply it will prompt you for your current password. Enter it twice and you’re finished. The next time you reboot, or your PC wakes up from a nap, you’ll no longer need to type in your password.

<br />
<br />If you’re referring to a different password then please post back with more details.

            I got it running again thankfully. Where do I find the memory diagnostic tool? What preceded this was I uninstalled Chromium and reimage repair because I kept getting an increasing number of pop up websites I deduced that the apps were involved. I also
 uninstalled google-chrome just to make sure. The pop UPS stopped.Then I was working in my new Office 365bus and OneDrive for business when I was advised to update windows 10 ok😂 Here comes reimage repair it put my computer on safe mode😂 Microsoft helped
 me get out. Good then I was working on OneDrive again and my computer went into safe mode and I saw the msg on blue screen re:memory management❓ So I pstd a question what I did to get out I went in and permanently took it off safe mode? Then I did a recovery
 which I could only do using a point in time.It seems to have worked is there some more to be done? I appreciate your help.

    <title>Windows 10 driver and system file corruption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr.doe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 driver and system file corruption</h2>
                    <p>I had some trouble with Windows 10 a month ago, so I performed a clean install and updated to the latest version. Shortly after (2-3 days) my system files became corrupted, startup repair/recovery/reset(various conf. tried) did not work, even when using
 the recovery media. The only option that worked was to reinstall, which I did. The problem has continued to occur, despite any apparent hardware problems. It has tried to fix drive errors on startup, and assumingly will have fixed them but errors continue
 to persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only noticeable side effects before refusing to start and reinstalling, are windows features refusing to start, such as windows exploring, task manager, and settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already attempted the prescribed options from recovery/recovery media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional info: I have not installed malicious software, shutdown the computer incorrectly, exposed it to static electricity, etc.</p>
<p>I have tried doing the install with and without updates, although I cannot try intermediate updates, unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that The problem could be solved with copies of sys. files, although I would like to get to the root of the problem as they would only work temporarily.</p>

<p>Hi Mr. Doe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really odd that the system files on your computer got corrupted after performing a clean install and an upgrade. The upgrade that you've perform might be the culprit why the system files in your computer got corrupted. However, We do not want to jump
 into that conclusion yet. Let's isolate your concern by providing the answers to these questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does the system files in the computer got corrupted as well prior the clean install and upgrade?</li><li>Which version of Windows are you running (e.g., 1703, 1607)?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p>
        </p>

<p>It is currently 1703, I had tried it with multiple configurations. Base install, with general update/updates to device updates/without any updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works for a few days at most, with little difference between them.</p>

<p>We appreciate your response and the information provided, Mr.Doe! After the troubleshooting steps that you've done with your first post, actually I've sensed that it could be a hardware issue. Performing a clean install should've resolved the issue right
 away. We suggest that you run a hardware test on your device, and you may coordinate with the manufacturer of your computer for the steps on how to do so. If you need additional assistance, though, we're just here in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>

<p>I am really not sure, my computer is pretty new and fairly high end. I predominantly use it for modifying and creating text files and research. I think that it could be a problem with custom hardware on the rig, although the hardware is a graphics driver
 and a dual core processor, which I think operates separately from the main system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't had problems in the last 2 days, other than 15-30 second black screen after sign-in which isn't really a good sign. If I can resolve some curiosity for you and frustration for myself then I will reply.</p>

The attached DMP file is of the <b>KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR (7a)</b> bugcheck.<br />
<br />
<i>This bug check indicates that the requested page of kernel data from the paging file could not be read into memory.
</i><br />
<br />
ERROR_CODE: (NTSTATUS) <i><b>0xc000009d - STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED</b></i><br />
<br />
<i>DISK_HARDWARE_ERROR: There was error with disk hardware</i><br />
<br />
^^ 0xC000009D, or STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED, indicates defective or loose cabling, termination, or that the controller does not see the hard disk (possible hard disk failure).<br />
<br />
There are various ways to run Chkdsk~</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>Method 1:</b></u><br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search bar &gt; Type cmd (right click run as admin to execute Elevated CMD)<br />
<br />
Elevated CMD should now be opened, type the following:<br />
<br />
chkdsk x: /r<br />
<br />
x implies your drive letter, so if your hard drive in question is letter c, it would be:<br />
<br />
chkdsk c: /r<br />
<br />
Restart system and let chkdsk run.<br />
<br />
<u><b>Method 2:</b></u><br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the "Computer" window<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click on the drive in question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the "Tools" tab<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Error-checking area, click &lt;Check Now&gt;.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you'd like to get a log file that contains the chkdsk results, do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
Press Windows Key + R and type powershell.exe in the run box<br />
<br />
Paste the following command and press enter afterwards:<br />
<br />
get-winevent -FilterHashTable @{logname="Application"; id="1001"}| ?{$_.providername –match "wininit"} | fl timecreated, message | out-file Desktop\CHKDSKResults.txt<br />
<br />

You can run it via Windows or DOS. Do note that the only difference is simply the environment you're running it in. In Windows, if you are having what you believe to be device driver related issues that may cause conflicts or false positive, it may be a wise
 decision to choose the most minimal testing environment (DOS).<br />
<br />
Run all tests EXCEPT: Fix All, Long Generic, and anything Advanced.<br />

    <title>Ethernet Connection Slower After Waking from Sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ethernet Connection Slower After Waking from Sleep</h2>
                    <p>I have an odd problem since I upgraded my router, Netgear Nighthawk AC1750. On LAN connection, my laptop connects at Gigabit speeds. The OOKLA Speedtest app confirms this at 99-115 Mbps. If I put my laptop to sleep and wake it later, the LAN only connects
 at 10 Mbps, signified by the solid amber LED on the router and confirmed by the Speedtest app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried a couple of things, such as updating drivers, setting default settings, and ipconfig /release - ipconfig /renew. At first, I thought I was able to restore Gigabit only by restarting my machine, but then I discovered that simply disconnecting and
 reconnecting the ethernet cable would restore Gigabit connectivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what's going on here? Any help would sincerely be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must me some compatibility issues or bugs on your router. It is also possible there are some configurations on your router which causes this issue. We've like to help you regarding this issue. But since you've already updated your drivers, set your
 settings as default, and released and renewed your IP address, we recommend contacting your device manufacturer's support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have more concerns, feel free to post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Sorry, but you got scammed. &nbsp;If you call before the 8-10 weeks is up, the reps tell you that they can't tell you anything about when you might receive it and to just call after the 10 weeks if you haven't received it. &nbsp;When you call after the 10 weeks are
 up, they tell you that you should have called more often and that since you didn't you forfeited your right to receive the game. &nbsp;If you keep pressing them, they'll tell you that the offer is expired and that Microsoft does not have any more copies of any
 of the games for the promotion. &nbsp;If you ask them for a digital copy of the game, or for a refund of XBox Live, they will refuse. &nbsp;They don't mind spending 3 hours on the phone over 5 different calls, but they definitely mind living up to their side of the
 bargain.</p>
<p>I know, I've been through all this. &nbsp;Here's what I finally told the representative, and what I plan to do- I refuse to renew XBox Live from this point on. &nbsp;I refuse to purchase any materials from the XBox Live Marketplace. &nbsp;I will buy all games used from
 this point on, because I know how this impacts their profit. &nbsp;And I will blog about this experience in half a dozen places. &nbsp;XBox will lose a couple thousand in revenue just from me, as I have a lot of people on my Christmas list and buy about 20 games a year.
 &nbsp;And I'm hoping that others will follow my example, and that such short sighted business practices will be justly rewarded.

    <title>Text to Speech not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lunaticfiend  say:</h3>
<h2>            Text to Speech not working</h2>
                    <p>I'm running <strong>Windows 10 Version 1809 (Build 17763.557)</strong> and I have English (India) as the system language. The text-to-speech settings shows 2 voices, i.e. Microsoft Heera and Microsoft Ravi, but the preview button doesn't playback any audio/voice.
 Therefore, when I'm interacting with Cortana, I'm only getting responses in form of a text with no audio feedback and the Narrator application doesn't work as well. I tried adding new languages - English (United States), but even Microsoft Mark, David and
 Zira did not work.<br />
<br />
My <strong>sound drivers</strong> are updated to the<strong> latest version</strong>, and the
<strong>sounds work perfectly well outside of this Text-to-speech function</strong>. I've even recently reset windows and updated all the drivers to their latest versions and still there's no audio for the text to speech function.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have <strong>no pending windows updates</strong> (except for version 1903, which it says my PC isn't "ready" for it yet)<br />
<br />
Additional details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer make and model: Asus Zephyrus M GM501</p>
<p>Audio driver: Realtek High Definition Audio version 6.0.8683.1 (16-04-2019)<br />
<br />
Kindly advice me on the issue. Thank you in advance!</p>

            Hi Lunatic
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Method 1: Update Audio Drivers.
<br />
<br />Step 1: Press the Windows key and the R key from your keyboard and type Devmgmt.msc and hit Enter.
<br />
<br />Step 2: Find your audio driver &gt; Right-click on the audio driver &gt; Click on Uninstall.
<br />
<br />Step 3: Once you have uninstalled all the audio drivers, go to your computer manufacturer's website &gt; Download and install the latest audio drivers from there and check for the issue.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Change Playback Device.
<br />Right-click on the Sound icon from the taskbar &gt; Go to Playback tab &gt; Select your audio device and click on Set as Default.
<br />
<br />If the audio device is not listed under Playback tab, then right-click on an empty space under Playback tab and click on Show Disabled Devices.
<br />
<br />Also, press Windows key + R
<br />Type: winver
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Does it say Windows 10 N by any chance on that dialog?

<span>The issue has persisted for 2 weeks by now.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There was no pattern on WiFI disconnection frequency; the Ethernet connection works fine; and none of my other devices (those that did not go through Window update) is affected.&nbsp; In the Windows network diagnostics just now, I notice that Windows is still
 identifying an older version of the wireless network adapter (Provider Microsoft, File date 2018.04.11).<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is perplexing, as the most updated version (Manufacturer / Provider Intel, Issue date 2018.10.18) has already been uploaded to Windows.<span>&nbsp;

<span>I am extremely frustrated, and appreciate if you can share a light of how I may solve the problem.<span>&nbsp;

            <span>Hi User_75,</span><br />
<span>try changing the network adapter driver.</span><br />
<span>1) Go to Device Manager&gt; Network Adapters, right click on the network adapter you are using&gt; Update Driver.</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>
</span><span>2) Select "Search for driver software on your computer"</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>
</span><span>3) Select "Choose from a list of drivers available on your computer"</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>
</span><span>4) Windows will propose 2 or more compatible drivers for the network adapter. Select a different driver from the one currently in use&gt; Next. The driver will be installed automatically. Restart
 the PC.</span>
