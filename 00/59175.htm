            Is the version of the software that you're installing compatible with Windows 7, or is it from a CD for Windows XP/Vista?<br />
<br />
Go to Brother's <a href="http://www.brother-usa.com/downloads/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Find Print Drivers &amp; Utility Software</a> site and download the Windows 7 driver for your printer, if it's available.

    <title>DNS error on Lenovo Edge E545 laptop when using wifi - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevehill - redc  say:</h3>
<h2>            DNS error on Lenovo Edge E545 laptop when using wifi</h2>
                    <p>I have four Lenovo Edge E545 laptops win 7 Pro connected to&nbsp; Draytek 2830 Router. When connected by cable, all is well, full internet access. When connected by wifi, &nbsp;internet access is variable and frequently has no internet access. The trouble shooter
 reports unable to contact DNS server. If I drop the wifi connection and re-connect, it typically provides internet access but will drop again later. I also have a HP Probook also running Windows 7 Pro that connects perfectly by wifi and no issues. Full wireless
 signal for all devices, all within 10 feet of the router.</p>
<p>I suspect that its a driver/incompatibility with the Lenovo wireless drivers.</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this problem?</p>

            <p>Hello Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any recent changes software or hardware prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most common causes for a wireless connection drop are your wireless router and network card signal coming out of the wireless device is a radio signal. Wi-Fi devices normally use a frequency of 2.4 Gigahertz (2.4 GHz). Unfortunately, several household
 items may use the same frequency: some cordless phones, baby monitors, and radio controlled toys. Other devices with the same frequency could interfere with the wireless router’s signal. So these devices, computer with Wi-Fi or the wireless router may need
 to be moved around. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1 Try to install latest drivers.</strong></p>
<p>Go to manufacturer website and install latest drivers for wireless adaptor.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> <strong>Try to check the DNS service status.</strong></p>
<p>A: Type “services.msc”(without quotes)<span>&nbsp; </span>in the start search box and hit enter.
</p>
<p>B: Locate a service called DNS Client and double click to open it.</p>
<p>C: Start the service and click apply and then ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3 Try to flush DNS and check the issue.</strong></p>
<p>1. Click the Start button. </p>
<p>2. In the search box, type command prompt.</p>
<p>3. In the list of results, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
</p>
<p>4. At the command prompt, type ipconfig /flushdns.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4 Try to disable IP Helper service and check the issue.</strong></p>
<p>1. Disable the IP Helper service:</p>
<p>1. Hold the Windows key and type R, enter "services.msc" (without the quotes) and press Enter</p>
<p>2. Scroll down to the IP Helper service, right click on it and select Properties</p>
<p>3. In the dropdown box that says "Automatic" or "Manual", set it to Disabled and then click on "Apply"</p>
<p>4. Then click on "Stop" to stop the service from running in the current session</p>
<p>5. Click OK to exit the dialog</p>

<h2>            File History Making Multiple Copies of Files</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to find a question addressing my issue.&nbsp; Upgraded from Windows 8.1 Pro to Windows 10 Pro last summer.&nbsp; Finally got around to setting up File History.&nbsp; When I checked my 1 TB external drive, I found File History was making copies of my documents,
 pictures etc. every hour as I left it set to default.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it makes a new copy of EVERYTHING every hour... at the end of the day, my drive was consumed with over 600 GB of File History data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted the file several times and turned File History on and off and changed the interval.&nbsp; Whatever interval it is, File History just make another new copy of everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the only computer in the house and it is not connected to a Homegroup.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp; Version of what?&nbsp; My Windows 10 Pro is fully patched with all available updates if that's what you mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also notice that File History does not make a copy of all the folders in my Pictures file.&nbsp; It grabs about 10 of them and then proceeds to make tens of copies of all my individual photos which are not in folders.&nbsp; There is similar behavior in my Documents
 file.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Perhaps time to run some scans to check you don't have any corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><div>Method 1: <br />
System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</div>
<div>Run system file checker (SFC) and see if it helps. Please follow these steps:</div>
<div>a. Press Windows + X keys and click command prompt (admin).</div>
<div>b. Type the following command in command prompt and press Enter.</div>
<div>sfc /scannow</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it does not help, use method 2.</div>
<div>Method 2: </div>
<div><br />
Run DISM tool and check the issue. Please follow these steps:</div>
<div>a. Press Windows + X keys and click command prompt (admin).</div>
<div>b. Type the following command in command prompt and press Enter.</div>
<div>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth.<br />

            <p>Ah, I see what you mean.&nbsp; Yes, it's version 1511.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's not a bad idea to run the SFC.&nbsp; I will try it later today.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't need File History as I use Carbonite, but sometimes it's nice to be able to access something locally.&nbsp; I work on computers for a lot of older people and the File History backup saved the day for a 91 year old individual who had accidentally
 lost all her photos.</p>

<h2>            Sys Restore fails due to deleted file, 0x80070003</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I was trying System Restore several times today...<br />
<br />
It fails with an error 0x80070003 , it could not replace the file....<br />
<br />
The file was c\wamp\myproject\language file\..... (something ...) <br />
<br />
- in short - Restore is looking for a File - which is not a System file - the Folder c\WAMP it stands for home php server for coding projects - it was my own folder, my own made files - and a few days ago I was cleaning there and deleted a few folders, including
 this one...<br />
<br />
so, Restore could not be completed - because of File - but the file I deleted 3 days ago on purpose and it was not meant system file.... or may be it is because it was a language file? - but anyway....<br />
<br />
Sys Restore shows Initializing.... for some longer while, may be 10 min or so, then shows: Restoring Registry ... and = Finishing (but doesn't show Removing Old... part...)<br />
<br />
Is my system restored or not now? How to Restore my System now?</p>

<p>
</p><p>2. My Windows updates are All Off.... I never update anything Working....</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Basically - I am searching for a method to tell Windows stop restoring in My own file's folder.... it is not restore's business to check in that folder...,.</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s.s. the file it is looking for - is Joomla CMS installation File - I would like to know - would I Restore it NOW - Would Windows Restore stop searching for it in it's Restore Image?!</p>

            <p>That is curious that System Restore would seem to know or care about a non Windows folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made an effort to reproduce and could not (yet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Errors like that which end in 0003 are path not found/directory not found (from the old DOS days) so if SR is trying to restore that folder for some reason and not finding it maybe if you create some empty folder(s) it will be happy - but it still does not
 make sense to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would manually create a c:\wamp folder and maybe even the sub folders underneath (c:\wamp\www\flexi\language) and then see if System Restore will work.&nbsp; Maybe it will work with just the c:\wamp and maybe you also need the en-GB folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then if you don't want those folder anymore, delete them and make a new Restore Point that does not have them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are also looking in SevenForums maybe they will come up with something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very curious!</p>

    <title>Proxy 127 virus keeps coming back. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> captainanarchy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Proxy 127 virus keeps coming back.</h2>
                    <p>So I have the proxy 127 virus, and it keeps recurring. It even showed up on the laptop I had before this one, and it causes everything to slow down and several sites to not load at all. I've tried disabling it from the settings menu, but it always turns
 back on. I've tried disabling all proxy connections from the registry editor, but it still comes back (and now all settings related to proxy servers seem to have disappeared from regedit). MalwareBytes always picks it up and removes it, but it always pops
 back up again. One person said the problem could have been something in my router, but when I got a new router and tried all these fixes again, nothing happened. What's left for me to do?</p>
<p>Edit: I'm not technologically minded at all. Everything I know about computers, I learned trying to fix this specific problem. Assume I don't have a clue what you're talking about. Also, if a solution requires by to pay for anything or assumes I already
 own some piece of hardware, it's pretty much out of the question. I'm broke.</p>
<p>Edit 2: One person with a similar problem said it's likely that some legitimate program has been hijacked and is being used to reinstall the virus when I delete it. The problem is finding which one it is. Any ideas on that?</p>

            Hi Dark.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What I would do to get this behind me is this Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />Back up your data to quarantine flash stick, scan it with Malwarebyes from <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a> and AdwcCleaner from <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a> which are the most powerful scanners out there right now and good tools to keep on hand.   Don't reimport data until it passes two scans from each with restart.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.

<div>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community. Let me help you regarding re-installing Windows Live Mail.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you uninstall and re-install your Windows Live Mail in your computer, all emails that was saved in your account online will not be deleted. It will only sync all emails, contacts, folders and other information from your account to your Windows Live
 Mail. If in case that you save emails in your Windows Live Mail and that emails are not showing online, all of that emails are save in your Windows Live Mail and it will be lost if you uninstall your Windows Live Mail. I suggest that you back them up first
 before uninstalling your Windows Live Mail. Please follow the steps in the article below:</div>

Best asked in the Hardware Forum for your version of Windows.<br />

Code 39 means the driver is corrupt or missing.<br />
<br />
Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total process which solves<br />
the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab - click<br />
Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose cable or<br />
slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Also check with your System Maker to see if there are updated drivers for your DVD. Or even if there<br />
are old ones you can reinstall. Many use the Windows Default drivers however a few will have special<br />
ones. Also check the drive maker's site.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Hope these help.</p>

<p><span>Hello ZezKaiEll,</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the clarification. I did some looking around on the Steam Users' Forums (</span><a href="http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?s=68a6cd8038e477dd3bcbe41e22ee30d9&amp;f=229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?s=68a6cd8038e477dd3bcbe41e22ee30d9&amp;f=229</span></a><span>)
 and it appears the error message you are receiving is fairly common. Some user’s state there is a patch that will correct the issue. My recommendation would be to make sure you have all patches for the game installed and if you continue to experience the error
 try the steps below.</span></p>
<p><span>Try running the game in Windows XP SP2 Compatibility Mode:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click the shortcut for the game</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Properties</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the ‘Compatibility’ tab</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Place a check mark in:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>o</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Run this program in compatibility mode for:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>§</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the drop down window select ‘Widows XP (Service Pack 2)’</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click ok</span></p>
<p><span>Once the above steps are complete try starting the game to see if the same error occurs.</span></p>
<p><span>If the above steps do not resolve the error you can try repeating the steps only this time select ‘Windows 95’</span></p>
<p><span>If selecting ‘Windows XP (Service Pack 2)’ or ‘Windows 95’ compatibility mode does not resolve the error you can repeat the steps above, only this time remove
 the check mark from ‘Run this program in compatibility mode for:’ then click ‘ok’ to reverse the changes you made.</span></p>
<p><span>Another option would be to limit the RAM your computer will use as it appears the game has an issue if it tries to run on a system with more than 2 gigs of
 RAM. </span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Keep in mind if you have to take the steps below you will only want to do this prior to playing the game then un-do the changes
 after you are finished.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click ‘Start’</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the search field type ‘msconfig’ (without quotes)</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the ‘Boot’ tab</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the ‘Advanced Options’ button</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Place a check mark in ‘Maximum memory’</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The field should auto populate with 2048KB (2 Gig) if it does not auto populate type 2048</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click ‘ok’</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click ‘ok’</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You should be prompted to reboot – after the system reboots try the game and see if the error continues.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know how this works for you.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

<p>Purchase and content usage is an alert that pops up when our store cant identify licenses on your account for whatever reason. So your live your games or&nbsp;DLC might give you an error that you don't own them. This is an issue handled by our engineers and staff
 behind the scenes and all you have to do is wait for us to fix the issue. Thank you for your patience, here's a link to check the status if you need it.</p>

            Hi Farhan 
<br />
<br />Make sure that headset 3.5mm plug is pushed all the way in
<br />
<br />Are you sure that you have the headset on the correct way round - I know this sounds like a stupid thing to suggest  . . 
<br />
<br />Windows by default does not allow swapping of left and right channels . . .
<br />
<br />What Audio icon do your see in your bottom right System tray, is that realtek or some other sound panel?
<br />
<br />What is the exact Make and Model of that headset?

            Hi Farhan
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />Click Balance then make further adjustments there.

            If your sound card interface does not have a channel swap facility then you may need to solve the problem with a solder iron.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Did the msconfig troubleshooting help?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to update the display drivers from device manager and check.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, you may go to the computer manufacturer’s website and check if there is an updated version of the display driver available.</div>

<h2>            Xbox one lag&#33;&#33; Please help&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
Right.... 1 month ago I was a happy gamer with no lag or any issues what so ever with my xbox 360, I saved up all my pennys and bought the xbox one day one edition. I am having a problem that's not going away even 3 weeks after launch, my download is 6.8MB
 and my upload is 1.4MB according to a speed test but on my xbox one its saying 2.7MB and 0.8MB and a latency of 217ms (NAT type open), firstly can anyone tell me why the different figures between my xbox speedtest and every laptop speed test&nbsp;(bear in mine
 these tests were done when these were the only devices connected to the internet).
Anyway I go to play fifa 14 (The only game I have) and it takes me 30 minutes to connect to a game then when I'm in one there unbearable lag like the loading screens take a good 2 minutes with all the server lag, its just really bad connection when I'm
 in a game which is a very rare occurrence! Also I cannot connect with party chat and the once I have its just been the same old lag.
So I ring up xbox go through all trouble shooting, opening ports, dmz servers, clearing catche...etc so they send me to my broadband provider which is sky by the way and I talk to them for a while and they suggest a new router so I pay £70 for that (Thinking
 what the hell seems like I've just wasted £450 anyway). The new state the arc&nbsp;sky hub&nbsp;arrives and.... SAME PROMBLEM! I am connected with a 1m Ethernet cable so wireless is not the issue. So I spoke to xbox again ad I feel like they've just got me going around
 in circles and I just feel so annoyed that everything was perfect on my 360 and now I pay £450 for something that I can't play online!!
Please please please someone help me out here or tell me if you are having a similar problem... I really need to get this sorted it seems like for the past 3 weeks this is all I have been doing and I'm started thinking about a return and a PS4 quite sad
 really after 12 years with xbox...
<p>Please help!! </p>

<p>Having the exact same problem. I have 5Mb down and about 80ms ping on laptop, yea not great but better than 1Mb down and 300ms ping on the xbox one. I got into a game of fifa once and it lagged out, most of the times I can't even connect to the ea servers
 its that bad. Done all steps like forwarding ports, Dmz etc and called both Ms who seem clueless and my isp &nbsp;The strange thing is that I downloaded killer instinct (3.3gb) and it took 2 hrs which is not bad for my connection. Couldn't have done it that fast
 with 1Mb down. Never had this problem with the 360. Really don't want to swap for a PS4. I'll keep you updated if I find a fix, Fingers crossed
</p>
<p>Btw read this, found it on a site about slow downloads on xb1. I don't know a lot about DNS to be honest, worth a shot. Good luck!
</p>
<p>"I had a similar problem. It turned out to be a poorly chosen DNS server. See, Xbox Live is hosted from multiple data centers around the country (and world). To get optimal speeds, you should be connecting to the closest hub geographically. When the xbox
 attempts to download anything, XBL points you to the most appropriate data enter based on the DNS server you're using.</p>
<p>So for example, my router was configured with the Comcast DNS servers automatically, but they were like 1000 miles away from my actual home. This resulted in my xbox connecting to a data center far away.</p>
<p>When I manually set my DNS servers, to something more local ( I used 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220). The speed test under Settings &gt; Network &gt; Detailed network statistics went from a pretty crappy 10mbps to my full 50mbps.</p>
<p>This is not exclusive to Xbox either, I saw most of my traffic improve."</p>

    <title>Game Sharing on 3 Consoles&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rdlee-ba714a1c-f0c0-4b34-a715-65071ee3d7ab  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game Sharing on 3 Consoles&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My situation is this. I now&nbsp;have 3 Xbox One consoles in my home.&nbsp;I game share between two of them with two different gamertags. Majority of the&nbsp;digital games have been purchased on one console with one&nbsp;gamertag.&nbsp;Just got a third console&nbsp;and wanted to use it mostly for offline gameplay. But, if I set it to be my home console, will I lose access to it on one of the other two? Or will it work if I stay offline? The reason I ask is this, I signed in on Xbox Live on it with my main gamertag and it let's me play the downloaded games I purchased ONLY if I'm online. I tried playing offline and it won't load. Any help or advice would be appreciated. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Surface laptop 2 keeps crashing</h2>
                    I recently bought a Surface Laptop 2. Approximately every two hours of operation time it crashes. The screen freezes and I get a blue screen telling me I have a system thread error. This occurs regularly and I have to reboot it or it tells me the system
 had a problem and it is checking for it. It then displays the percentage of the fix operation until it restarts on its own. I ran the Windows 10S fix tool. I think it is a firmware or hardware issue. I saw in previous discussions the Surface pro and Surface
 laptop freezes with great regularity. I am not the only one. Will this be addressed by Microsoft?&nbsp;

<h2>            My Windows Surface Rt 8.1 Has Installed An Unwanted Update... How Can I Remove Or &#34;Uninstall&#34; This Update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, as stated above, my Surface installed an update that I do not actually want. This morning and yesterday, I had been watching videos on
<a href="http://watchdisneychannel.go.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This Site</a>, when it suddenly had an error message, telling me that I do not have an updated version of Adobe Flash Player, or no version at all. For the past hour and a half, I have attempted to install/enable/update
 the flash player with no success (I even watched several tutorials as well). When going to a website to install, it would say that I already had flash player when the site above told me I didn't. I was confused, and frankly, I wanted to figure out if I just
 needed to update my PC. I came across my Update History, which said that my computer had been updated today (around the time the error message popped up on the website I was watching). It said that a Security Update For Internet Explorer had been successfully
 installed. This new installment is unwanted, at least for me, as it keeps me from watching videos. I have tried adding the website above to the list for Adobe Flash Player and it showed up, but I was still unable to watch (the same error message had appeared).
 So I was wondering if there was anyway I could uninstall this update or find another solution. Thank you!</p>

            <p>Well, you first need to understand the tablet you have. &nbsp;It is a Surface RT which runs a recompiled version of Windows 8.1. &nbsp;It is a "canned" system and can only install programs from the "Store" app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tablet has an ARM processor and not an Intel processor and thus, cannot execute standard programs. &nbsp;That is why you cannot download/install programs from the Internet to include Adobe Flash Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adobe Flash Player is updated via Windows Update. &nbsp;That is the only way you can get the latest version of it and no alternative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some web sites are making changes/upgrades for which the "RT" version of these tablets (Surface RT and Surface 2) will no longer play the media. &nbsp;There is no work-a-round for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are stuck with what you have and you have to install all of your updates. &nbsp;That is the only way the RT models can stay current. &nbsp;It won't be 100% of what you expect and it won't be what you will like but you have to hand it to the system for which it
 can be used for secure web browsing if you need to do online banking or shopping. &nbsp;The system cannot be hacked and get a virus for which the Intel based version of Windows can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one myself and also a Surface Pro 3. &nbsp;Microsoft did come out with the Surface 3 which is an Intel based tablet and can run any program from the Internet - but, Adobe does not make Flashmedia available for Internet Explorer in Windows 8. &nbsp;They produce
 a version for submission to Microsoft for which then, Microsoft then places it into the Windows Update repository.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get around that restriction on Intel based tablets is to either install Firefox from Mozilla or Google Chrome and with those, you can use the real Flashmedia Player with them. &nbsp;But the RT models are stuck with the Windows Update version only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for security updates - you install ALL of them. &nbsp;There are attempts now to hack the ARM based tablets!!!!!!</p>

<h2>            What Other Device&#40;s&#41; Can Be Windows Media Center Extenders&#63;</h2>
                    Of course, Microsoft would prefer that we use the XBOX 360 as a Windows Media Center 'extender'. But are there other devices that can function as extenders? Is the word "extender" really just a synonym for 'router'?

<p>No.&nbsp; "Extender" != "router."&nbsp; <br />
A router is (typically) the core of a network; an Extender (full, proper name:&nbsp; Media Center Extender), by definition 'extends' the Media Center experience to another location on the local network (which your router is the backbone of.)</p>
<p>It's not that MS would "prefer that we use the Xbox 360 as a Media Center Extender."&nbsp; Rather, it's that nobody else is making them anymore.&nbsp; Really.<br />
The <strong>only</strong> Extender device that's still being manufactured is the 360.&nbsp; Linksys bailed from the market, D-Link bailed, and HP's MediaSmart TVs (which also had Extender functionality) barely got out the door before HP killed the line.&nbsp; Samsung&nbsp;barely
 entered the market, with a rather nice rear-mount box for some of their TVs (the MR-00EA1 only works with certain Samsung TVs.)&nbsp; Also killed off.<br />
<br />
If you want an Extender that's not a 360, you can search, say, Amazon, eBay, Craigslist, etc., for a Linksys DMA-2100 or DMA-2200 (the '2200 adds a DVD player), or a D-Link DSM-750 (which does not have a DVD player.)<br />
But, honestly?&nbsp; $200 for a 360 Slim is a fairly good deal, especially since it can do a lot more than just be an Extender.&nbsp; And, it performs that job a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> better than the DMA-2100/2200 did.</p>
<p>I'm not defending MS here in any way - I'm just saying how it is.&nbsp; MS had nothing to do with others' decisions to leave the Extender market (nor, decisions to not enter said market.)&nbsp; Linksys, D-Link, et. al., simply decided to leave, for whatever reasons.&nbsp;
 ((shrugs))</p>

<br />Because you would like to jump from one build to another this could be the issue.

<br />For these scenarios the better way is clean reinstall system.

            Hi,
<br />Try updating to 1809 using Media Creation tool and if it fails let us know.
<br />
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

<br />Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Once you have the Windows 10 Spring Creators Update ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade. If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don't, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:
