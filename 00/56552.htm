<h2>            How can I reverse the scrolling direction on my Type Cover&#39;s trackpad&#63;</h2>
                    I prefer for my trackpad scrolling to be reverse-direction. Now do I do this with the new Type Cover, using the Surface Pro 2 (512GB edition)

            <p>If you have Type Cover 2 and are using Surface Pro with Windows 8.1, you should be able to do this:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Open the Settings charm, tap Change PC settings &gt; PC and devices.</p>
<p>Tap Mouse and touchpad to see the trackpad settings.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>

<h2>            Keyboard settings change every time I restart my computer</h2>
                    <p>I have an Italian keyboard, with English as an option (I work in both languages and I need to keep both language packages on). Since I updated to the last version of Windows 10 a week ago, every time I restart my computer the keyboard automatically switch
 to the English settings and I need to change it back to Italian manually. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this and keep my settings fixed like they used to be?</p>

<p>Hi G,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really odd that the keyboard settings on your computer keeps on changing every time you restart your computer since Windows Updates should enhance the performance of your computer. However, Let's see if these steps will resolve your concern:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Clock, Language, and Region</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Language</strong>.</li><li>Look for <strong>Advance settings</strong> at the left pane.</li><li>Under <strong>Switching input methods</strong>, tick the <strong>box for "Let me set a different input method for each app window"</strong>.</li><li>Once done, click Save and restart your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Note</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Make sure that you set up the language to your preferred keyboard settings before following the steps given above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your feedback.</p>
<p>

<h2>            SHIFT &#43; x doesn&#39;t work on my laptop&#39;s keyboard</h2>
                    <p>Hello,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ideapad z510, dual boot Windows 8.1 and Linux Mint. I have a strange problem. When I try to type capital X, using SHIFT + x nothing gets typed.
</p>
<p>This doesn't happen in Linux, so I assume it must be some windows problem. I don't have this problem with other keys, they seem to work fine. Also this problem persists if I use an external keyboard or after I reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked and disabled sticky and toggle keys and no result. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is that SHIFT + x works a few seconds after windows restart. After windows finishes loading it stops working.</p>
<p>
If anyone has an idea, please let me know.</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Does the issue occur when you are using any particular program or all the programs?<br />
2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
3. Did you check if the issue occurs with different keyboard?<br />
<br />
This issue could occur due to some third party program causing the issue. I would suggest you to perform clean boot and remove the program that is causing the issue.<br />

    <title>Switching Motherboard and CPU, Re-installing win 10 via USB - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Switching Motherboard and CPU, Re-installing win 10 via USB</h2>
                    I just bout a new motherboard and cpu, the old ones are amd, the new ones are intel and msi, huge upgrade. I figured I'd have to reinstall windows, I have the "free upgrade" windows 10 from windows 7, I installed the mediacreationtool and created a usb
 with windows 10 installer. I'm not entirely sure if this will work that's why I'm asking before I go through all this, but on their website it claim that when I reinstall windows I should be able to click skip on the key and it'll work a bit later, since I
 had had windows 7 installed previously. Will this work? Otherwise I'll have to dig through and find my old win 7 disc and reinstall that to reinstall windows 10.

            <p>You would have to reinstall if you replaced the hard drive, but not the mobo. &nbsp;Windows 10 is already on the hard drive. &nbsp;The issue is that the motherboard's serial number, make and model have changed. &nbsp;That is what requires you to reactivate Windows. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, yes, Windows will run fine, but it will not be activated because when the license manager software "calls home" to verify the activation status the hardware will not agree with what is registered on Microsoft's servers and the servers will not confirm
 the activation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just use the Activation page to enter the Windows 7 product key and Windows will register the new mobo (computer) as a Windows 10 device and activate the software. &nbsp;That is called digital activation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming here that you purchased a retail copy of Windows 7. &nbsp;Retail copies of Windows 7 can be transferred to a new computer and Windows 10 provides you a means of transferring the Windows 7 license easily and then using that for a new upgrade from
 Windows 7 to Windows 10 for free. &nbsp;All of that happens when you enter the Windows 7 key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that Windows 10 is already installed doesn't matter. &nbsp;Why would you have to go through a reinstallation of Windows 7 and a lenthy upgrade to 10 when you can verify that you own a qualifying copy of Windows 7 by simply entering the product key?</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I'm posting in the right place.&nbsp; I just had a strange activity.&nbsp; I was reading an article on Cnet.com.&nbsp; I turned around to watch TV, leaving the web page idle for a few minutes, heard a click like a phone hanging up (I'm on broadband), for lack of
 a better description.&nbsp; A window was popped up entitled "Windows Security" with my previous user picture, the orange daisy.&nbsp; It said: "The server honeybadger.mediamath.com at Honeybadger requires a username and password. Then the spaces asking for Username
 and Password. Under that a check box "Remember my credentials".&nbsp; I heard a noise from the speaker.&nbsp; Without clicking on the popup window, I closed IE,&nbsp;and the popup window closed too. &nbsp;I performed a Quick Scan on my computer and there were only tracking cookies.&nbsp;
 I’ve never heard of honeybadger. Never been to any honeybadger site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me what happened? Was someone trying to get into my computer?&nbsp;&nbsp; I’ve never seen this Windows Security window before.

<p><span>As you’ve mentioned that, “a window was popped up entitled "Windows Security"” even when the computer was left idle, it probably seems to be web based scam.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span>I would first suggest you to manage the add-ons on your web browser. You may refer to the following article to manage add-ons on Internet Explorer.

<h2>            After a Windows 8 Update, my system is stuck in system restore and a blank screen.</h2>
                    <div><i>big windows 8 crash! Need help!</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
I am using windows 8 problem free since it came out. Now I have just installed the system update which came out in the last day or so and my Samsung Np300E5A has crashed big time. When I start the computer now all I get is the windows 8 logo followed by automatic
 system repair followed by a blank screen! Thats it, it goes no further. When i press f8 at startup nothing happens so i cant enter safe mode. even when I try samsung recovery solution at start up and off the recovery disk it freezes at the beginning of the
 process! I'm very stuck, any help is hugely appreciated! I upgraded to windows 8 from windows 7 by legitimate online download from microsoft. I have no backup disk.

            <p>&nbsp;Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Welcome to Windows 8 Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It looks like you are having issues with the Windows updates and you are not able to log in to your PC.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let me ask you few questions before I would provide any suggestion :</div>
<div><br />
1) Was the Update successfully installed before the issue was found?<br />
2) Did you make any changes prior to this issue besides installing the update?<br />
3) Did you create a&nbsp;DVD for Windows 8 after downloading?</div>
<div>4)Are you able to run Startup Repair succesfully?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>I would suggest you to follow the following&nbsp;methods to resolve the issue:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><strong>Automatic Repair</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Turn On your PC by pressing the power button.<br />
2) When the manufacturer logo comes up, Tap F8 and Space Bar simultaneously until you find a windows asking to choose the operating system.<br />
3) Select “Change default and choose other options”.<br />
4) Select choose other option in the next window.<br />
5) Then, choose Troubleshoot.<br />
6) Select Advanced Options.<br />
7)Select Automatic Repair.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After Repair gets over, check if&nbsp;the issue is resolved or not.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it still persists,you can follow&nbsp;next method.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div><strong>System Restore</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>1) Turn On your PC by pressing the power button.<br />
2) When the manufacturer logo comes up, Tap F8 and Space Bar simultaneously until you find a windows asking to choose the operating system.<br />
3) Select “Change default and choose other options”.<br />
4) Select choose other option in the next window.<br />
5) Then, choose Troubleshoot.<br />
6) Select Advanced Options.<br />
7) Select System Restore.<br />
8) PC will restart and will then prepare for System Restore.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I hope it will work normally and you will be able to log into </div>
<div>your PC.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please write us back if the PC still persists.<br />
&nbsp;</div>

            Hi Pinaki,
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>I didn't make an changes before windows update, my Laptop was working great.</li><li>After update and re-start my laptop started running very slowing and loading very slowly. I eventually had to restart again and when I did I was greeted by windows 8 automatic repair which led to a blank screen and all these problems.</li></ul>
<div>I have tried steps one and two but when I press F8 and space I do not get the option "Change default and choose other options"&nbsp;Unfortunately&nbsp;I did not make a&nbsp;re installation&nbsp;copy of windows 8 but I have got one from a friend.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I get as far as reset windows 8 it asks me to insert&nbsp;re installation&nbsp;media and when i put the cd back in it says incorrect media. It fails to restore the system and also fails to automatic repair.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Like I said, it freezes when i try to re-install windows 7 also. Any more ideas? this new windows update has caused me huge problems.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Daragh&nbsp;</div>

            Yes, this I knew. But the problem is the PC cannot reach Windows, so it's too late for these options. How can I recover my notebook&nbsp;<b>without</b>&nbsp;starting Windows?? It really annoys me, because I just rebooted my notebook.

            sadly i still didn get the problem fix. i gave up and changed back to windows 7 till all these bugs fixed in 8. really like 8 but with all the crashing on start up, lagging at start up. random update may get stuck in that metro thing, etc ill just wait
 till this stuff fix. i had to reset over 6 times since i was not able to get into the start up. and if i do it lag for hours.&gt;&lt;<br />

<h2>            IPv6 DHCP DUID Changes every re&#47;start. Not correct.</h2>
                    <p>The XboxOne's DUID&nbsp;for its IPv6 DHCPv6 Client is being regenerated every time the system starts or restarts.</p>
<p>This is not correct, the DUID should be atleast semi permanent maybe regenerating after a factory defaulting at most.<br />
</p>
<p>Since the DUID&nbsp;is changing every reboot/startup its impossible to reserve an IPv6&nbsp;for the XboxOne since in IPv6&nbsp;that is based on DUID.&nbsp;</p>

<strong>"</strong><strong> Restarting "</strong>. Is this normal? What steps should I take?

</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your interest to use Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to restart the computer manually by pressing the power button in the system unit. Once it restarts it will automatically continue from the installation phase from where it stopped. Also remove all non-essential external hardware devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information is helpful. Feel free to write is back for any other assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>

            Hi, Houle_christine!<br />
<br />
If you mean an icon where you can choose languages (EN/FR/...) in Windows, then go to Control Panel -&gt; Regional and Language Options -&gt; Keyboards and Languages -&gt; Change Keyboards. Verify that you have French language listed there. Then press OK everywhere
 to close the two windows. After that, the icon should appear in the toolbar and you should be able to use French accents.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

    <title>How can I install Windows XP and create a dual boot set up if Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martin healy  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I install Windows XP and create a dual boot set up if Windows 7 is preinstalled&#63;</h2>
                    <p><em>I've a problem installing Windows XP in a dual boot configuration with a preinstalled windows 7 PC.</em></p>
<p>Windows XP allocates the C: drive to the very small system partition in a dual boot configuration on my preinstalled Windows 7 PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;I installed Windows XP on a preinstalled Windows 7 PC in a multiboot setup. I can boot both OSs from Windows Boot Manager.
 However, the XP installation refers to the C drive as the system drive which has only a 100 MB space despite the fact that the XP installation is installed on a different partition or drive. Consequently, anytime I install software or drivers, Windows XP chooses
 c:\Programs\swsetup instead of g:\Programs\swsetup which results in disk space error. I've tried changing the default C: to g: but this does not always work as some programs don't provide the option of where to install software. The windows&nbsp;XP installation
 partition has plenty of space on its G: drive but for some reason it keeps pointing to the system partition as being like the local root drive. This is not the case with my windows 7 and my windows vista installations. When I boot to Windows 7 and Vista from
 Windows boot manager, both OSs uses the C drive as being the local drive in my computer even though they are installed on different partitions or drives. This is not the case with XP as it treats the very small system partition (100 MB) which came preinstalled
 on my PC as being the C: drive. Furthermore, XP boots automatically into Windows without requesting any password which I find strange.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm aware that XP should be installed first in a dual boot configuration with Windows 7 and Vista but as my PC came preinstalled with Windows 7 I followed the instructions on the windows 7 forum on how to install XP in a dual boot config after Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can boot Windows XP and Windows 7/ Vista from Windows Boot Manager.&nbsp; The problem is that my XP system recognises the small system&nbsp;partition as being the C: drive even though it is installed on a different partition/drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I boot up Windows 7 and
 Vista, the OS allocates the C drive to the&nbsp;partition in which&nbsp;Windows 7 and Vista are installed in.&nbsp; This is not the case when I boot into XP as&nbsp;it allocates the C drive&nbsp;instead to the small system partition and not to the partition in which Windows XP is
 installed.&nbsp; This problem was evident from the&nbsp;moment I was installing Windows XP at the Windows XP setup stage.&nbsp; At the early stage of installation, I noticed that Windows XP had wrongly detected the small system partition or drive as being the C:\ drive.&nbsp;
 Is there anyway, I can prevent Windows XP from allocating the C: drive to the&nbsp;small system partition that came preinstalled on my Windows 7 PC?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd welcome any suggestions from people out there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please note that I followed the article @ <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/8057-dual-boot-installation-windows-7-xp.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/8057-dual-boot-installation-windows-7-xp.html</a>&nbsp;using method 2 where windows 7 is installed first.&nbsp; I did skip step 7 which involved the installation of&nbsp;EasyBCD on XP.&nbsp; Why is it necessary to install&nbsp;EasyBCD on XP when&nbsp;EasyBCD
 can be run from Windows 7?&nbsp;From Windows 7 I created&nbsp;an entry for XP&nbsp;using EasyBCD which added&nbsp;XP to the Windows Boot Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;Step 7 just mentions installing&nbsp;EasyBCD which is vague.&nbsp; The only purpose of see in installing EasyBCD on XP is that it allows a
 user to configure the BCD from XP as well.&nbsp; I did have to load my Windows 7 repair disc&nbsp;after installing XP&nbsp;in order to fix and repair the BCD which ultimately restored Windows Boot Manager.&nbsp; Anyway, I managed to successfully add Windows XP to Windows Boot
 Manager and I was able to boot into Windows 7&nbsp;and XP.&nbsp; However XP allocates the small system partition to the&nbsp;C:\ drive which proves problematic.&nbsp; This problem is simply not addressed or highlighted&nbsp;in the above article.&nbsp; Like I said in my previous post, the
 problem regarding the allocation of the small system partition to the C: drive is appearant at the early stage of installing XP in a dual boot configuration where Windows 7 or Vista are installed first.&nbsp; You seem to have ignored this point.&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above article doesn't cover everything.&nbsp; I've read other articles where other users have experienced this same&nbsp;problem.&nbsp; I will post these articles if you wish me to do so.&nbsp;</p>

            Where does it say to uninstall XP in method 2 of the article?&nbsp; In the method 2 case, Windows XP is not suppose to be preinstalled in the first place - so the uninstall of XP is irrelevant.&nbsp; The screenshot in step 5 of method 2 illustrates how XP allocates
 the&nbsp;C: drive to the 100MB small system partition which ultimately proves problematic or detrimental when the XP installation is&nbsp;completed in a dual boot configuration with a preinstalled copy of Windows 7 on a machine.

            I suspect that you are installing old software as the drive letter designation is irrelevant to almost all but ancient software, I've had Windows XP installations on drives other than C and this did not cause any problems on these systems.&nbsp; The setup routine
 on some old software specifically looks and wants to install on C: but this is rather ancient and most of that kind of software dates to the Windows 95 days and was designed for Windows 9x, software properly designed for NT operating systems doesn't have a
 hang up about drive letters.<br />
<br />
What does the SET SYSTEM command return (at the command prompt)?<br />
<br />
Look at the ProgramFilesDir value at &nbsp; HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion and see what it says.<br />
<br />
As for your thinking that " At the early stage of installation, I noticed that Windows XP had wrongly detected the small system partition or drive as being the C:\ drive" that is an incorrect statement.&nbsp; The Windows NT/2000/XP setup program has always assigned
 the C: letter to the first enumerated active partition, this was only changed with Vista and later operating systems where the setup program assigns the C: letter to the boot volume rather than the system volume.&nbsp; The boot volume holds the Windows files, the
 system volume holds the system files necessary to boot the operating system, for Windows XP these are NTDETECT.COM, ntldr and the boot.ini files.<br />
<br />
If you really insist or need to have Windows XP installed on a C: drive then flag the present G: drive as the active partition then proceed to reinstall Windows XP cleanly on the newly flagged active partition, the Windows XP setup program will assign letter
 C: to the active partition.&nbsp; After Windows XP is installed move the active partition flag back to the present small C:drive and add the Windows XP installation to the Windows 7 boot configuration.<br />

            <p>Thanks for the response again.&nbsp; Firstly, I would like to make the correction that I'm not installing old software which you&nbsp;suspected in your last reply.&nbsp; I'm installing Windows XP with SP3&nbsp;in a dual boot config with Windows 7 and not any old OS such as
 Windows 95 or Windows 98.</p>
<p>However, I&nbsp;agree with&nbsp;your previous statement&nbsp;that "The Windows NT/2000/XP setup program has always assigned the C: letter to the first enumerated active partition; this was only changed with Vista and later operating systems where the setup program assigns
 the C: letter to the boot volume rather than the system volume".&nbsp;&nbsp; This statement explains why I've no difficulty in booting into Vista and Windows 7 in a multiboot config because the C: Drive is assigned to the boot volume and the previous allocated drive
 letters&nbsp;&nbsp;for the Windows 7/Vista partitions (drives) are switched to the C drive when booting into that particular OS.</p>
<p>I would like it made known that this is not&nbsp; just a problem about me being fussy about what drive letter windows XP is installed on.&nbsp; I'm happy to install Windows XP on any drive&nbsp;or partition as long as Windows XP is fully functional on that drive in a dual
 boot config with Windows 7.&nbsp; However, this is clearly not the case.&nbsp; On my preinstalled Windows 7 PC, I managed to free up some space and created a new primary partition&nbsp; (60GB) which was assigned a G or I drive and then I installed Windows XP on this drive.&nbsp;
 I then followed the instructions based on method 2 on the article @ <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/8057-dual-boot-installation-windows-7-xp.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/8057-dual-boot-installation-windows-7-xp.html</a>.&nbsp; However, when I boot into Windows XP, I'm confronted with two problems.&nbsp; Firstly, the Windows XP logon screen does not appear and it goes straight into Windows.&nbsp; Secondly,
 Windows XP assigns the C: drive to the system volume which is the small active 100MB system partition (aka first partition).&nbsp; The allocation of the C drive to the small system partition might be viewed as no big deal or issue to most people as many would just
 regard it as just an assignment of a drive letter.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, when I try to install any programs or drivers on Windows XP, the system points to the small C:\ drive&nbsp;for the destination or location in which to install the software and not G or I drive where
 XP is actually installed.&nbsp; Eventually, the system would come up&nbsp;with an error message saying that there is not enough space to install the drivers or software and this is because it tries to install the software on the small C: drive where there is no space.&nbsp;
 I could work around this problem by browsing or changing the path&nbsp;to the G or I.&nbsp; However this doesn't always work.&nbsp; Of course an OS should always point to the C: drive by default when installing programs but unfortunately it's pointing to the small system
 partition where there is no space.&nbsp; This is why I refered to XP wrongly detecting the small system partition as being the C drive during installation in a previous reponse even though I always knew that XP assigns the C: drive to the first active partition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this problem is just a matter of assigning or changing a drive letter, can you please explain why the Windows XP logon screen doesn't appear at boot up?&nbsp; &nbsp;Also do you accept the fact that the allocation or assignment of the C: drive to the small system
 partition is problematic when the OS installs programs by default on this small system partition where there is no space and not on the partition or drive where XP is installed like in normal circumstances?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response to your previous question in your last reply w.r.t "What does the SET SYSTEM command return (at the command prompt)?"&nbsp; From Windows 7, the output shows:</p>
<p>SystemDrive=C:</p>
<p>SystemRoot=C:\Windows&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I suspected you wanted the know the output from Windows XP.&nbsp; At this moment, I can't give you the output&nbsp;from XP as I removed the unsatisfactory XP installation from my PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I've taken your comments on board regarding your comments in quotes: "If you really insist or need to have Windows XP installed on a C: drive then flag the present G: drive as the active partition then proceed to reinstall Windows XP cleanly on
 the newly flagged active partition, the Windows XP setup program will assign letter C: to the active partition.&nbsp; After Windows XP is installed move the active partition flag back to the present small C:drive and add the Windows XP installation to the Windows
 7 boot configuration."&nbsp; My understanding from this info, is that&nbsp; I would set the partition or drive where XP is to be installed as active and then boot from the XP install CD and install XP on this partition and then XP would see this active partition as
 being the C: drive.&nbsp; And then like you said, I would move the active partition flag back to the present small C: drive and add the XP installation to the Windows 7 boot configuration.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;will&nbsp;the movement of&nbsp;the active partition flag back to small system
 partition after the installation of XP cause the same problem again when booting into XP?&nbsp; In other words, could I end up back to square one where XP will still install programs and software by default on the small system partition and also where the OS just
 boots into Windows without requesting any user login?&nbsp; At the same time I understand that the active flag on the XP installation partition or drive has to be removed&nbsp; afterwards - otherwise Windows will boot automatically into XP everytime as it will bypass
 the Windows Boot Manager screen.&nbsp; In due course, I will attempt the above possible resolution or suggestion.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you realise I have carried out this procedure using method 2 on <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-windows_install/ive-a-problem-installing-windows-xp-in-a-dual-boot/ec8b2ae1-d987-4bbe-886d-b536f0423492">

 mins approx to install XP and then it requires a few more adjustments afterwards.</p>
<p>However, I will attempt your possible resolution to this problem sometime soon.</p>

            By "old software" I meant that you were maybe trying to install old user software on Windows XP, like trying to install old games or old accounting or spreadsheet programs from the Windows 95 era, some of these old software packages were sometimes hard
 coded to look for and install on a C: drive, I didn't mean that you were trying to install an old operating system.<br />
<br />
As for the the instructions on the sevenforums all that these instructions really tell you is that when an operating system is installed it rewrites the boot sector of the active partition and that after the installation you must then restore the boot sector
 so that a common boot loader can be used to start all the operating systems.&nbsp; When you install Windows XP after Windows 7 is installed the XP setup program will rewrite the boot sector and install the XP boot loader (ntldr).&nbsp; Ntldr cannot boot Windows 7, the
 Windows 7 boot loader can boot Windows XP so in a multiboot environment you after Windows XP is installed you must then return the boot sector to the Windows 7 boot loader to be able to boot both operating systems.<br />
<br />
As for the drive letters please keep in mind that drive letters are really almost completely irrelevant.&nbsp; Drive letters are symbolic links assigned by the operating system and on NT operating systems it really doesn't make a hill of beans of difference which
 letters are being assigned to the drives, it is not a requisite that a "C:" drive exist on an NT system.&nbsp; Also keep in mind that being that drive letters are a contrivance or creation of the operating system that the partition drive letters from one operating
 system to the other need not be and often are not the same.&nbsp; You could have 3 partitions on a disk (partitions 1, 2 &amp; 3) and one operating system could assign letters C:, D:, &amp; E: to the partitions while another operating system on the same drive could assign
 them letters D:, E:, F: or other completely different letters and it wouldn't make a hill of beans to any of the operating systems, it would not cause one operating system to fail to boot or to not work properly.&nbsp; Granted that this can be annoying and cause
 confusion for the user or that&nbsp; it may cause problems if the user is using common scripts or batch files which refer to drive letters.<br />
<br />
On NT operating systems the persistent drive letter assignments are recorded in the Mount Manager database at the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\MountedDevices key and as far as the operating system is concerned it is completely blind to what letters another system
 on the same computer assigns to the drives.<br />

            <blockquote><br />
<p>If this problem is just a matter of assigning or changing a drive letter, can you please explain why the Windows XP logon screen doesn't appear at boot up?&nbsp; &nbsp;Also do you accept the fact that the allocation or assignment of the C: drive to the small system
 partition is problematic when the OS installs programs by default on this small system partition where there is no space and not on the partition or drive where XP is installed like in normal circumstances?<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
The logon screen has nothing to do with the drive letter assignment, the system is using AutoLogon, this is common on Windows XP systems when only one user account is created.&nbsp; To use the logon screen enter&nbsp;
<br />
By default Windows XP will want to install programs in the Program Files directory and it will obtain the location of the directory from the ProgramFilesDir value in the registry.&nbsp; Software installers can override this and try to install the software in another
 location.<br />

            <p>Thanks for the reply again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's strange that&nbsp;&nbsp;XP should use AutoLogon from itself unknown to the user.&nbsp; I've installed XP in the distant past with only one user account and I was always presented with a login screen.&nbsp; Normally the AutoLogon feature is enabled intentionally by a user
 and it's seldom I've seen this feature enabled by default.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By right, XP should install programs and drivers in the Program Files directory of the drive or partition where XP is installed and not on&nbsp;the small active system partition where there is no space.&nbsp; This doesn't occur when installing&nbsp;the same programs&nbsp;from&nbsp;Windows
 7 and Vista in a multiboot config.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Just to recap, my Windows XP installation is of no use to me because I can't install all the manufacturer's drivers. &nbsp;The operating system installs the driver software by default in the Program Files directory of the small active system partition where there
 is no space. &nbsp;This results in an insufficient disk space error. &nbsp;Like I said before, I can occasionally overcome or work around this problem by changing the file path or directory to the location of the partition of drive where Windows XP is actually installed.
 &nbsp;However, the software installer of some drivers don't provide any option of where to install the software which means I'm unable to install some drivers such as chipset drivers. &nbsp;The chipset drivers come in an executable file and when I double click it on
 it, it doesn't provide the user with any option of where to install same and attempts to install the driver software on the small system partition where there is no space and which subsequently leads to a disk space error. &nbsp;The whole state of the XP installation
 is entirely unsatisfactory. &nbsp;At this moment in time, I haven't come across any resolution to this problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The assignment of the C: letter drive to the small system partition may be totally irrelevant here; but the fact that the&nbsp;<span>ProgramFilesDir value in the registry of the operating system is pointing the</span>&nbsp;<span>Program Files directory to the small
 active system partition is a major hindrance.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I'm wondering would it be possible to resolve this problem by editing the registry and c</span><span>hanging the value of the "ProgramFilesDir"
 location to the partition or drive where Windows XP is installed?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If possible, I hope Microsoft might provide a fix or resolution to this problem in the future.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>&nbsp;In a prevoius reply you quoted:&nbsp; "If you really insist or need to have Windows XP installed on a C: drive then flag the present G: drive as the active partition then proceed to reinstall Windows XP cleanly on the newly flagged active partition, the Windows
 XP setup program will assign letter C: to the active partition.&nbsp; After Windows XP is installed move the active partition flag back to the present small C:drive and add the Windows XP installation to the Windows 7 boot configuration."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My understanding from this info, is that&nbsp; I would set the partition or drive where XP is to be installed as active and then boot from the XP install CD and install XP on this partition and then XP would see this active partition as being the C: drive.&nbsp; And
 then like you said, I would move the active partition flag back to the present small C: drive and add the XP installation to the Windows 7 boot configuration.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;will&nbsp;the movement of&nbsp;the active partition flag back to small system partition after the
 installation of XP cause the same problem again when booting into XP?&nbsp; In other words, could I end up back to square one where XP will still install programs and software by default on the small system partition and also where the OS just boots into Windows
 without requesting any user login?&nbsp; At the same time I understand that the active flag on the XP installation partition or drive has to be removed&nbsp; afterwards - otherwise Windows will boot automatically into XP everytime as it will bypass the Windows Boot
 Manager screen.&nbsp; In due course, I will attempt the above possible resolution or suggestion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You&nbsp;seem to have overlooked the above comments in your last reply.&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving the active partition flag back to the present small C:drive and adding the Windows XP installation to the Windows 7 boot configuration will probably put me back in the same problem.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello, I have a problem..</p>
<p>I can't connect my bluetooth headphones (P6) to my Windows 10 PC.</p>
<p>Whenever I attempt to, my computer says it's connected but the sound doesnt come through and comes through the laptop speakers.</p>
<p>In photos 2&amp;3, I've tried to connect my iPhone to my computer to show that it doesn't go through and I get an error saying that it's unsupported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already done the service.mcs and changed both bluetooth options to running and automatic, but it only changed the message from "out of range" to "unsupported".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, I'm not quite sure what to do now. I've smoothly connected my headphones to my iPhone with bluetooth, so it's not that.. So is there anything else I can do? Thanks</p>

<p>One can only wait. Haven't seen anywhere where they even acknowledge there is a problem.</p>

                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 from 8.1.&nbsp; The upgrade went OK.&nbsp; After playing with windows 10 for a while I could not find Photo Gallery and when I searched for that I got to a link to down load Windows Essentials 2012 which was supposed to include Photo
 Gallery.&nbsp; </p>
<p>After the down load and run I then received a white box with the error:&nbsp; iCloudServices.exe - System Error</p>
<p>
</p><p>X&nbsp; The program can't start because MSVCP100.dll is missing from your compute.&nbsp; Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.&nbsp; I clicked on&nbsp; OK&nbsp;&nbsp; but nothing really happens.&nbsp; The box just comes back about 3 times then on the 4th click on OK it goes away
 but on a reboot it starts all over again.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We will help you in resolving your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you a question regarding the query:</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you download the link from official Microsoft webpage?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Scan your PC twice for detecting malware or virus attack by running the anti-virus software and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Re-register the .dll files </strong>by following the steps below and check if you are facing similar issue<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Dynamic link library (DLL)</span></strong><span> is a collection of small programs, which can be called upon when needed by the executable program (EXE) that is running. When one of the DLL file is corrupted, then executable program will fail
 to perform properly. So we need to re-register the DLL files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>a. </strong>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and select <strong>
Command Prompt(Admin).</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>b. </strong>At the command prompt, type the commands mentioned below and press
<strong>Enter</strong> after each command.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>regsvr32 msdxm.ocx /s</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>regsvr32 dxmasf.dll /s</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>regsvr32 wmp.dll /s</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>regsvr32 wmpdxm.dll&nbsp; /s</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong>c. </strong>After registering DLL files restart the computer and check if the changes are effective.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Download <strong>Windows essentials</strong> from the link below and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/essentials</a></strong></p>

            <p>I did go to the official Microsoft site to down load essentials 2012.&nbsp; But evidentially the download and Run did not work as I never could see Photo Gallery on my system after going thru the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I followed your suggestions and ran antivirus scan twice.&nbsp; No viruses were found.&nbsp; I rebooted the system a couple of time after running virus scan each time.&nbsp; Same result.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to iTunes and had a notice that a new version of iCloudServices.exe was available.&nbsp; I installed it and rebooted.&nbsp; The problem was not there any longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went to the Microsoft download site for Window Essentials 2012 downloaded it made my selections and&nbsp;now I have Photo Gallery and no error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Is Photos app just a viewer&#63;&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stefneedee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is Photos app just a viewer&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I just purchased a new PC laptop with Windows 10 after years of using a MacBook Pro with iPhoto library.&nbsp; I was under the assumption that Photos was the same as iPhoto in that when you downloaded&nbsp;photos to it, that you could then upload them from there
 to Shutterfly, Snapfish, etc.. Unless I'm missing something, it seems that this is not the case.&nbsp; Also, I noticed after thinking I had transferred about 1000 of my 15,000+ photo library that the picture files weren't in the Pictures folder - only in the Photos
 app.&nbsp; But, I did notice that some of the pictures that had been saved to my Pictures folder were showing up in the Photos app.&nbsp; So, am I left to understand that the Photos app is more of a viewer than a functional place to store photos?&nbsp; It's making me really
 miss my Mac.

            <p>It's mostly a viewer, but it has almost all the same functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, in iPhotos you would click a picture and then click "Share" and post it to facebook.&nbsp; Doing the same task in the Microsoft app is identical (click picture, click Share, then click Facebook).</p>

<p>Is there a program that uses C-Media Audio? I would have to do some research and get back to you.<br />

            1. Are you trying to install this game from Microsoft Store or from some media?
<br />
<br />2. If you want to know if some program is conflicting -
<br />
<br />Boot your computer in Clean boot mode and then start Outlook. If it works successfully, then some program is conflicting with this. 
<br />
<br />Refer to the section - Install, uninstall, or run an application
<br />
<br />Don't forget to do - Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.
<br />
