<h2>            Spam Email Marked As Not Spam, Disappeared from Inbox</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Outlook Professional Pro 2013 for only a few weeks. I check all my folders, including spam folder everyday several times a day. Today, I found an email in the spam folder that was a legitimate email so I marked it as not junk. Of course, it immediately,
 disappeared from the spam folder. No worries there. I went to my inbox and saw it as the most recent email (my emails are arranged by date and time). Before I could click on it to reply, it just disappeared right before my eyes from the inbox. I thought perhaps
 it had somehow been missed and was an older email (although in retrospect, I am sure it came in today) so I tried searching for it under multiple search terms that I remembered from the email. It is not showing up anywhere. I even tried checking other folders,
 other inboxes and trash folders. To be on the safe side, I am not deleted anything until I find it. The odd thing is that it appears to never have existed, though I know it was there. Any idea where it could have went and how I can stop it from disappearing
 there again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time and attention.</p>

My Outlook 2016 desktop version has the same problem. I had an item in the SPAM folder this morning and I marked it as NOT JUNK. It immediately disappeared. It is not in my INBOX, it is not in my OST mailbox. It is just gone. This is not the first time it has
 happened. I am not sure what causes this behavior, but it is a SERIOUS problem!&nbsp;

<h2>            N78 Messages not synching</h2>
                    I am not sure if to put this in messaging or in pc applications.<br />
<br />
I am trying to synchronize my N78-3 sms with Nokia Photos 1.5. The phone does it sometimes and most of the times it ignores both sms and MMS.<br />
I have noticed that if I have taken multiple photos, it sync's the messages from that day the photos were taken and from then on. It does not sync messages from days prior to the photos.<br />
<br />
This is driving me wild. I used to use Lifeblog for this with my N73 and no problems.<br />
<br />
Any Help appreciated.<br />
<br />
BTW I have tried both PC Suite 7.08.2 and N-Series PC Suite 2.0

    <title>Music app for Lumia 1520 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Music app for Lumia 1520</h2>
                    <p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to find an music app I can use just for my own musicfiles.</p>
<p>Preferebly in wide-screen mode and small, adjustable characters. &nbsp;You should be able</p>
<p>to change what information you would like to be shown, for ex. &nbsp;Artist, Song, Lenght, etc´,</p>
<p>and in which order. &nbsp;Everything I found and used so far is app´s with big fonts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And the most wanted function of all: &nbsp; a musicplayer (to be used with MP3-books) that&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can add an pause/mark that the app remembers, that I should be able to read&nbsp;</p>
<p>several book and still be able to return to each book whenever I want and it will&nbsp;</p>
<p>remember where I was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do you buy your music? &nbsp;I don´t want to stream, I want to be able to buy my</p>
<p>music and download it to my computer and then transfer it to my Lumia 1520.</p>
<p>There must be an easy way to do that? &nbsp; I have even had difficulties to add MP3´s&nbsp;</p>
<p>to my Lumia 1520. How hard could it be? &nbsp;Thought it would be easier with Windows</p>
<p>Phone. &nbsp;Is there a program for Windows Phone to be used for music as there is for
</p>
<p>iPhone-users with iTunes Store?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope for a positive answer!</p>

            <p>Thanks Jack!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But on my Lumia 1520 I encounter a lot of problems with the VLC-app.</p>
<p>If all these function would work properly then this would be a great app for me.</p>
<p>If I start an album it only plays the first song and then stops.</p>
<p>I can´t either go forward or backward in a playlist. It only plays the song it´s at</p>
<p>and then stops. &nbsp;Really strange!</p>
<p>Now when I tried it, it wasn´t possible to pause a song, it only kept on playing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the memory function for MP3-books would be supergreat!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards!</p>

<h2>            Syncing Problem</h2>

</p><p>I am getting a message that reads: "Sorry. It looks like this page was added from another computer and hasn't synced yet. Click here or please press ENTER to reload the page."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing happens when I click to reload the page or press enter. I currently have two versions of OneNote (one is a desktop app and the other is an application that came with the computer). They don't seem to sync together. I can see the titles of the files,
 but they do not open. I have already tried opening the files through OneNote.com and pasting the URL into web. I have also checked if there is a problem with the server and tried to click the "view sync status" and it just says"Not Syncing," and says it was
 just recently synced but nothing happens. I have also tried going to each individual notebook to try and sync them and it just says loading and nothing ever happens. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>

            Hi Lori,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community. <br />
<br />
Provide more information regarding the issue. <br />
<br />
1) Which password is the user prompted to enter?<br />
2) How exactly have you shared the file one <b>SkyDrive</b>?<br />
3) Did you choose <b>Send Link </b>option while sharing the file on SkyDrive?<br />
<br />
The password which is prompted&nbsp;could be to access <strong>SkyDrive</strong>&nbsp;credentials, but not for the
<br />
file.<br />
Check the following MS link which contains, detailed information on <b>Sharing the files</b> on
<b>SkyDrive</b> and see if you can choose a different way of sharing the file and see if it helps.

            Daniel - Some users are prompted to enter a password to open the document. I do not know what SkyDrive is. We have added various word documents to our own website and uploaded them through a content management system.
<div><br />
<div>Visitors to the site can then download the Word documents from our website. When they click on the link to the document it prompts them for the password to the document. Since the documents are not password protected, they can click ok two or three times
 and it will eventually open the file.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Again, some people are getting the password prompt, but not everyone.</div>

 that data was&nbsp;removed by Excel, and placed in a&nbsp;file of some sort&nbsp;called "table2.xml", but I can't find that file anywhere.&nbsp;I have no confidence in a spreadsheet that has had an unknown amount of data removed.</p>

            <p>Hello Patricia,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will be happy to help you in sending messages with pictures. If you have pictures stored on your computer and you wanted to send it to your friends, you will need to use the attach files feature in Outlook. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Sign into your account. </p>
<p>2. Click <strong>New</strong> to compose a message.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Click the <strong>Insert </strong>button, then choose on how you want your pictures to be send.&nbsp;(As an attachments, Inline Picture, or share via Skydrive)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Browse for the location where the pictures are located.</p>
<p>5. Click <strong>Open</strong>, once you have located the pictures.</p>
<p>6. The pictures will be attached to your message. </p>
<p>7. Type in your message and send it to your contacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The message size should not exceed 25MB (body of the message plus attachments) so that you can send it.&nbsp; If you think that the pictures' files are large, I suggest that you choose share via Skydrive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope I was able to assist you with your concern and please do not hesitae to post back if you have other issues.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
I have been advised to post her as this issue has also been raised on the skydrive forums
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/skydrive-files/unable-to-send-photos-out-through-email/b4ed11ea-2147-4866-a528-0a97892ce3ff">
here</a> - I was unable to send photos via email, and was getting an error using the "share via Skydrive" feature which is advised above, however if you go to skydrive web, selct the photos or folder you wish to shre, then hit email, it allows a successful
 share.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
This is an issue with outlook's Share via Skydrive feature rather than an issue with skydrive itself.<br />
<br />
Before asking me what the exact steps I took are, please read the other forum post within this thread, which is a couple ofmonths old.<br />
<br />
Thanks, and please provide a fix.<br />

            What exactly happens when you try to restore and how are you going about the restore process?&nbsp; The simplest thing to do is with Outlook closed, copy the .PST file from the flash drive to a folder on your HD where it will not overwrite any existing .PST
 files, check the properties of the file once its on the HD to make sure the "Read Only" attribute wasn't set on the file during any of the transfer processes (Outlook will refuse to do anything with a Read Only .PST file), open Outlook, then open the .PST
 file using "File &gt; Open and Export &gt; Open Outlook Data File", navigate to the .PST, select it, and click OK.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I did what you suggested, copied the restored .pst file to the HD (Desktop) and checked to make sure it was not a Read Only.&nbsp; Then I went into
<p>
</p><p>*File</p>
<p>*Import and Export</p>
<p>*Import from another program or file</p>
<p>*Personal Folder File (.pst)</p>
<p>*Browsed to the .pst file on the desktop and selected it (clicked open)</p>
<p>*Replace Duplicates</p>
<p>Then on the final window selected these:</p>
<p>&nbsp; *Personal Folders</p>
<p>&nbsp; *Include subfolders</p>
<p>&nbsp; *Import into same folder in Personal Folders</p>
<p>&nbsp; *Finish</p>
<p>
</p><p>A large group of old emails were imported both into the Inbox and Deleted mail box.&nbsp;&nbsp; A large number of RSS entries were imported.&nbsp; But none of the special personal folders I had created were imported nor were any of the emails they would have contained.</p>
<p>I don't expect you will have a solution to this as I did a search in the office community and found ten pages of problems all associated with personal files and data being lost and nary a solution.&nbsp; I think I am going to test to see if an new folders I create
 will be restored if I purposely delete them. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I am a fool for ever trusting Microsoft and/or Mozy with heritage information.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The first and most important question is whether or not you were backing up the "right" PST file OR all the necessary PST files. The red flag in your description is the reference to the contact/calendar folders being out of whack. That by itself is an indicator
 that multiple PST files were in play and the backup was not complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Outlook profile would have survived an 'in place' upgrade so first thing to check would be what data files are defined in your Outlook profile and which one is defined as the default for the profile. Do that by using the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app --&gt;

<p>I have reviewed the .pst files that are being backed up to Mozy and every one (all of them) on the HD is being so saved.&nbsp; I have run through the Mail procedure you suggested but nothing worked.&nbsp; There is now and only has been one email account on my computer.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help and for everyone else who has tried to help.&nbsp; Searching on the community forums turned up ten pages of similar problems of people losing personal folders during the W10 upgrade.&nbsp; Microsoft did it again.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Just one last thing since there is something seriously missing from this description&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;IF&gt; all the PST files were backed up and subsequently restored then there is another issue at play that has nothing to do with W10. Very specifically, backing up a copy of a complete PST file would never selectively exclude individual folders within a PST
 file - just wouldn't happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that begs the "clarification" question - is the issue that individual folders within a given PST file do not exist OR any given PST file is not getting opened in Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated previously - the red flag in all of this is the fact that you stated that your contacts/calendar folders were not "up-to-date" as expected "as at" the last Mozy backup as stated in your original post
<strong>"</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>When I restored the Mozy backup .pst file the calendar was not rebuilt and most of the restored address book was out of date. "</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>An AddressBook is a specialized <strong>view</strong> of the contact folders designated to be a member of the AB - it's not something that gets restored on its own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either you were looking at the wrong contacts folder OR your "backup" is not working properly. Just like email folders within a PST file, any contact/calendar folders would not suddenly be missing selective entries that too just wouldn't happen - no &lt;ifs&gt;
 &lt;ands&gt; or &lt;buts&gt; about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes there are a myriad of threads related to W10 and issues accessing data files but those have absolutely no bearing on the description of your problem., Those issues dealt primarily with file permission issuess applicable to an entire file - not specific
 folders or contents within a folder inside a PST file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simple way to determine/isolate this issue is by (1) creating a new Outlook profile (2) ensure that you use the same PST files for any POP3 account AND that the same PST file is set as the "default data file" for the profile which is where the default contact/calendar
 folders are located.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To put this more succinctly, if you open up every pst file in Outlook that was restored via whatever process is used with Mozy, AND you do not see the data you're looking for, then it absolutely has nothing to do with Outlook or W10 and everything to do
 with your backup process &lt;Full Stop&gt;.</p>

    <title>How do I turn off automatic header and footer prompts&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miss debra  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I turn off automatic header and footer prompts&#63;</h2>
                    Automatic headers and footers are ruining my page. &nbsp;Even though I have disabled them, I still get a ghostly prompt which overshadows my page when I&nbsp;inadvertently&nbsp;click on a spot that triggers it. &nbsp;I then have to click a button that appears with the prompt
 up on the top right of my page that says cancel header? &nbsp;or something like that. &nbsp;Unfortunately, even though I click the button to disengage the suggested ghostly header, it reconfigures my page as if it had to make room for the suggestion. &nbsp;The realigning
 of my page sometimes takes me an hour to correct! &nbsp;This is horrible. &nbsp;Please help!

            <p>To add to what everyone else is saying, what you are seeing is not a "ghostly prompt" or a "suggestion" that you use a header or footer. It is the header/footer area and the Ribbon tab with the appropriate tools for editing the header and footer. These appear
 only when you activate the header by double-clicking above the top margin. Perhaps it would be easier for you to avoid clicking in this area if you either hid the white space (as has been suggested) or displayed text boundaries (Office Button | Word Options
 | Advanced: Show document content) which will display your page margins as a dotted line.</p>
<p>To repeat: No one is trying to force you to add header or footer content; what you are seeing is the result of actions you have (albeit perhaps inadvertently) taken to activate the header/footer layer, which makes Word think&nbsp;you want to edit the header or
 footer.</p>
<p>FWIW, what you describe (a "popup" or "superimposed transparent page") does not describe the normal appearance of the header/footer pane, so I wonder if you are using some add-in that is resulting in a different way of displaying the header and footer. If,
 however, what you mean is that the text in your document is dimmed, then that is the normal appearance; when you are in the header/footer, document text is dimmed, and when you the document body is active, the header and footer are dimmed.</p>

            Draft view (called Normal view in Word 97-2003) is a simplified view of the page which&nbsp;hides the headers and footers (meaning that you can't activate them by mistake). In Word 2007, you can click the View tab, and then click Draft.

<p>I meant that I want to click the "Help" button when I am offline, to search for help on how to use, say, MS Word features.</p>
<p>When I click the "Help" button, a new window pops up with the message "Help is only available on line. You aren't connected to the internet. Check your connection and try searching again."

<p>If I am in an area with mobile service, I could call Office 365 for business support, it seems like overkill.</p>

<h2>            Unable to sync Outlook on my Blackjack II</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking for help on my new Blackjack II.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have corporate Outlook email and got all the info to setup a connection with Outlook on my Blackberry.&nbsp; Started Active Sync and I get the following message when I sync:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The security certificate on the server is not valid.&nbsp; Contact your Exchange server Administrator or your ISP to install a valid certificate on the server.&nbsp; Support Code 80072f0d."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have contacted my Administrator and he sent me a certificate that I was suppose to load on my Blackjack - others in my office have done this who have Blackjack I and it works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However when I try to put the certificate on my Blackjack II here's what happens:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I get the cert file from my admin - it looks fine - properties show it to be&nbsp; a properly configured certificate file.</p>
<p>2. I use ActiveSync - Explore - to open the desktop of my mobile phone.
</p>
<p>3. I drag the certificate file from my PC desktop to the BJ II desktop and it show up fine.&nbsp; Icon is of a certificate file.</p>
<p>4. I go to my BJ II and Start -&gt; My Stuff to the directory where I placed the certiticate file and nothing is there - the file does not show up.</p>
<p>5. I do a Search on the filename and the file shows up in the list of Search Results files - but the left soft menu key - which has Open as it's action - does not work.</p>
<p>6. Help!</p>

<p>When I did that however, the Blackjack was locked down, so then I had to do this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you can optimize and configure your Blackjack to run at optimal speeds you must first unlock the thing. If you don’t application unlock it’s security settings, any changes you make
 that is registry based, will not be saved.</p>
<p>Here is the easy steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Download and install

Device Security Manager Powertoy for Windows Mobile 5.0</a> from Microsoft. This is a nifty utility to show what security policy is in effect. If you connect your Blackjack to your PC, you’ll see two tier security policy is in effect.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Download and copy
<a href="http://sems.org/content/download/secpolicies.cab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
secpolicies.cab</a> to your Blackjack using ActiveSync. I got this from sems.org who got it from Telus support, after following a post on qusers.com.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Run and install it. This allows you to install third party SSL Root Certs.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you run Device Security Manager Powertoy for Windows Mobile 5.0 now (it is listed in Start - Programs as “Security Configuration Manager”, you’ll see now you are using One Tier Prompt.
 Select Security Off and click Provision. It will install tool.cab to your device and then provision the settings.</p>

    <title>Automatic login for Yammer embedded in Sharepoint site - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chriscouper  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automatic login for Yammer embedded in Sharepoint site</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>We have an embedded Yammer feed on our SharePoint 2013 intranet page. Whenever our users logon for the day and browse to the intranet site, the embedded Yammer feed displays a big logon button. They click the login button, enter their email address then
 the login auto-completes from there.</p>
<p>I've scoured the web trying to work out how to get auto-logon to work, and read testimonials from many people who have got this to work.
</p>
<p>I logged a support call and have been told that it’s not possible with my configuration. Unfortunately the support person has not been able to tell me what configuration does support Yammer embedded automatic login.</p>
<p>My question is for the people who have Yammer embedded automatically logging in: How have you configured your Yammer environment? EG Is it Yammer basic, Yammer Enterprise, Yammer SSO, Office 365 SSO, federated domain etc.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting! By design, you really have to login to the Yammer embed login page so you can load the Yammer feeds you embedded in your intranet site. This is by design regardless you are using Yammer Basic or Enterprise with a specific authentication
 method. Should you like to have this configuration for Yammer embed, feel free to reach out to our Product team by going to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.creatingyammer.com/research" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.creatingyammer.com/research</a>. Let me know should you have any questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately yammer and SP are not integrated in any way, despite Msft's claims to the contrary. This is a huge limitation which really makes yammer no different from embedding a facebook feed.</p>

    <title>Using Outlook 2010 in multi-user environment - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jpstewar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Outlook 2010 in multi-user environment</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7 with Office 2010. The only users on this machine are me and my wife. I was originally using another machine for email/calendar so I only set my wife up on Outlook initially. She is running fine. The problem is that I now want to
 run email from this machine as well. So I logged onto my user ID and ran Outlook. I fully expected it to ask me to establish myself as a new Outlook user. Instead, when I run Outlook, it is bringing up my wife's email!! I don't know why it's doing this but
 I'm wondering how and whether I can fix it. Seems to me if it's a multi-user machine I should be able to run a different instantiation of this mail, no?

            Thanks. Actually, while waiting for an answer to this post, I decided to do a little research. I found that the reason my wife's email was coming up on both log-ins is because hers was the default email. Making mine default wouldn't solve the problem.
 So I found out about profiles, said, "Ah-ha" and created a profile for myself. So the way it works now is that when I run mail, it asks me to choose a profile. I choose it and I get my mail. Interestingly it doesn't ask my wife for a profile but just runs
 her mail ok. So, problem solved. Thanks .<br />

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the bubble icon to open <strong>Skype</strong>.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba4969b4-7f84-44f2-94b4-b8ffbb91e777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba4969b4-7f84-44f2-94b4-b8ffbb91e777" height="253" width="458" /></a></li><li>On the bottom-left part of the screen, click <strong>Settings</strong> or the gear icon.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d595bad7-2638-4060-bd80-25946edf90fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d595bad7-2638-4060-bd80-25946edf90fa" /></a></li><li>Then set the <strong>Notifications</strong> setting to what you prefer.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd19f8e4-93e5-42f0-93c3-e34333fb8cfb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dd19f8e4-93e5-

<p>Was this an edit to a document opened in Word 2003 or earlier from an e-mail message? If so you should never open Word attachments directly from e-mail - however it<strong>may</strong> be possible to recover your changes. See
<a href="http://www.gmayor.com/outlook_attachments.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gmayor.com/outlook_attachments.htm</a>&nbsp; Later versions of Outlook make this sort of issue more difficult.</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use to be able to assign a task to an e-mail and be able to customize it, such as rename the task, assign a start or due date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am currently using outlook and have my msn account set up with exchange activesync.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the moment, I&nbsp;can only flag and un-flag a&nbsp;e-mail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Exchange server supports everything, so yes, you can use custom flags with exchange. Only IMAP and EAS don't support them.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, if you type in your own for follow up text, see <a href="http://www.slipstick.com/outlook-developer/code-samples/set-flag-follow-up-using-vba/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.slipstick.com/outlook-developer/code-samples/set-flag-follow-up-using-vba/</a>&nbsp;- if you use the same phrases over and over you can use a macro to set the flag.

            <p>Hello <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5508d1fe-b3f5-4ec3-ad93-20cbf4b21cb1">
<font color="#0072c6">MarcoPorras</font></a>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week I was able to flag an e-mail message, then go to Tasks, and on the To-Do List, right-click the flagged item, select Rename, and then enter the new name for the task. I had multiple to-do items created in this way, and they were grouped by categories
 and sorted by due date. I preferred flagging my e-mails versus creating tasks out of them (by dragging the e-mail to the Tasks view on the Navigation Bar) because double-clicking a flagged e-mail from the To-Do Bar in Mail view opens the associated e-mail,
 including attachments. I want to point out that I&nbsp;use an Outlook.com e-mail account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Between last week and this week I had to troubleshoot a user profile problem, documented
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_365hp-publish/publisher-write-protection-error/99ac856c-a58b-4c02-b3a2-ed9086afc651">
here</a>. One of the results was that I ended up with a new Windows user account, and had to set up my Office 365 Home Premium apps again, including Outlook 2013. Up to the time of this reply, the e-mail flagging feature&nbsp;did not function&nbsp;the way it did last
 week.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, in the process of composing this reply, I&nbsp;went through the View Settings command in Tasks (View tab &gt; Current View group)&nbsp;trying to reestablish my custom views. It was there that I&nbsp;discovered what I had forgot:
<em>I had been using the Active view in Tasks when the flag renaming&nbsp;feature&nbsp;worked.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now I have set the view of the To-Do List in Tasks to Active, and I can rename my items again. I am much relieved to have this aspect of my organizational system functional again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While in Tasks, the Active view can also be selected from the Home tab &gt; Current View group. I hope this works for you too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. I noticed something when I set up my e-mail account the second time in Outlook 2013. It downloaded my flagged messages from Outlook.com and displayed them in the To-Do Bar
<em>with the original subject lines from the e-mails</em>, not the custom names I had given them before. This leads me to suspect that Exchange ActiveSync does not&nbsp;sync custom names for flagged e-mails in Outlook 2013 to Outlook.com, as

            I'm&nbsp; having the same issue. I use Outlook 2013 with my Outlook email account. I once had the option of setting costom flags but at some point, the option completely went away.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several possible reasons why you're unable to add your Hotmail account and open the Calendar app after the update. To isolate this, can you tell us the OS build currently installed in your phone? Go to
<strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; About &gt; More info &gt; OS build</strong>. Have you tried checking if there are any app updates? Open the
<strong>Store &gt; Menu &gt; Download and updates &gt; Check for updates</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may perform a soft reset to refresh the phone's OS. Press and hold the <strong>
Volume</strong> <strong>down</strong> and <strong>Power</strong> button at the same time until the phone vibrates and restart.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Ovi Suite Disapeared - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Ovi Suite Disapeared</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem is this. i recently attempted installed the 3.4.49 update onto my PC. upon completing the download i set about installing it through the Ovi Suite itself. however the result was that the Ovi Suite crashed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have attempted to restart the installation but now the software has vanished completely from my machine. I have tried numerous times to simply redownload the program from the Nokia website, but whenever i run the installation it tells me that it has installed
 successfully and i can click the button to get going. When i do click on the button nothing opens and im left on my desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have gone into the files and i can see that the nokia folder is empty, and there is no sign of the Ovi suite on my computer, despite literally checking every folder on my computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following this i have cleared the registry to remove any errors, deleted the nokia folder and attempted the process from the beginning all over again following a fresh restart. This has resulted in the same outcome, it merely creates a nokia folder (which
 is empty) and tells me the installation was successful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can i fix this? as i am having major software issues with my N8 and i cant fix them without the suite</p>

<p>Have you deleted everything related to 'Nokia' thru' Windows Control Panel ? Then run the
<a href="http://www.piriform.com/CCLEANER" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">CCleaner</a> and clean Registries again. Download the latest Beta version of the Nokia Suite from
