                    <p>My computer could not install Windows updates because of missing or corrupted files. I used Refresh to repair the damage which also restored preinstalled Mcafee. I uninstalled it from programs and also ran MCPR tool. Mcagent.exe shows up in icon behavior
 settings. Is this unremoved Mcafee files or malware? I had previously ran Malwarebytes and it had removed Rogue System Tool. I would appreciate help with this.</p>

                    Signing into my current account, I get error code 0x80070520 when signing into the Xbox app on windows 10, or into Forza Horizon 3. Logging out and logging back in does not affect this. Uninstalling Forza Horizon 3, or Xbox, does not affect this. I do
 not own an Xbox, but would like to play games I purchased on my Microsoft account. How do I fix this error?

            If you are in a critical situation where a production system is in dire need of repair, you may be better off having it serviced at a local shop or even go so far as to backup the data to another system and use that for the time being. Without access to
 the faulting system, the amount of data we have and the resources to try and remedy this are finite. It may be free, but that comes at a cost of time and accuracy of solution. If you still wish to pursue this avenue, then read on.
<br />
<br />
More data is necessary to work with beyond what is already presented, so it'll be good to answer a few questions. Is the crash consistently showing that the bugcheck is D1? Are the 2nd and 3rd parameters also consistently 2 and 8, respectively? How frequent
 are the crashes? Is there any action or activity on the system that will invoke the symptoms?<br />
<br />
At least one minidump will be needed for this, but first it's best to turn on Driver Verifier in order to potentially increase the accuracy of the minidumps. In the Start Menu type
<i>verifier</i> and it should show up <i>verifier.exe</i>. When that is open, click
<i>Create custom settings</i> then proceed. Go to <i>Select individual settings from a full list</i> and proceed. In the list, select everything
<b>except</b> <i>Low resource simulation, IRP logging</i> and <i>Force pending I/O requests</i>, then proceed. Check
<i>Select driver names from a list. </i>Select all drivers that do <b>not</b> have Microsoft Corporation as the Provider. Finish setup, then restart the system.<br />
<br />
This may cause a boot loop, in which case if so then Driver Verifier is doing its job. Once your system has crashed a couple of times, go into Safe Mode (tap F8 key during system startup), then open Driver Verifier again, except at the main menu select
<i>Delete existing settings</i> and click Finish, then restart again. You should now be able to enter Windows normally. Collect the minidumps present in
<i>\Windows\Minidump</i> directory, archive em via zip, rar or some other method, and attach it to your original post.
<br />
<br />
In the meantime, while everyone is looking at your dump files, you can also take this time to do hardware tests. Start with 7+ passes of
<a href="http://www.memtest.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Memtest86+</a>, then do an overnight run of <a href="http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Prime95</a> on Torture Test on Large FFTs setting. Make sure that your system's cooling - especially CPU - is sufficient, as this will stress the CPU to its maximum for a good length of time. You may use something like
<a href="http://www.hwinfo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HwInfo</a> to monitor temperatures (click 'Sensors only' at startup). Report back on results from both Memtest and Prime95.<br />
<br />
As for the System integrity check problem, make sure that you run such repairs from a Windows recovery or installation disk. You can access it by click
<i>Repair my computer</i> when it starts up. Aside from the usual tools, you may also want to enter Command Prompt and type
<i>CHKDSK /R</i> and after that is complete follow up with <i>SFC /SCANNOW</i>. You may also need to type in the letter of your system drive (typically C:) for CHKDSK in case it does not start. If any reports issues, you will want to do a restart of the system
 and run them a second time.<br />
<br />
As of right now, all I can garner from the bugcheck info you provided is that it crashed because some code erroneously attempted to call itself, or the instruction pointer failed to update itself. What code made the mistake, I cannot tell without at least a
 minidump to go on. It does seem more like a software issue than hardware, though again, I'm not sure without more data.<br />
<br />
I hope that all is enough to work on for the time being.

<p>Hi M Mozer,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which program does have many setup files?<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May I know for which CD are you using to look at the setup files?</p>
<p>Autorun is a technology used to automatically start programs or enhanced content (such as video content on a music CD) when you insert a CD or another media type into your computer. This is different from AutoPlay, but the result is often the same: when
 inserted, the CD starts automatically by using a particular program. Autorun is incorporated into the media types that use it, and you can't modify it.</p>
<p>This might be an issue if the CD/DVD that you are using is not set up as autoplay when inserted.</p>
<p>You may have to enable the autoplay feature in the computer.</p>
<p>Open AutoPlay by clicking the Start, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type autoplay, and then click AutoPlay.
<br />
Do one of the following:<br />
To turn AutoPlay on, select the Use AutoPlay for all media and devices check box.<br />
Click Save.<br />
<br />

                    I'm running windows 10 ( but I do not have the oct 2018 update installed) and all 3 browsers gets a dns error. I tried reinstalling both ethernet and wireless drivers, ipconfig /release, ipconfig /flushdns, ipconfig /renew no help. I checked services and
 dns is running and set to auto.&nbsp; Looks like I'll have to reinstall windows if I can't find a fix. Any suggestions? Thanks

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Go to those steps, from the Start menu or by pressing the key combination Win + I open the Configuration and click on the option Networks and Internet. Once there, we select the option Status of the left side menu and within the settings and options that are loaded in the right panel we have to look for network restoration.
<br />Clicking on this option will show us a new window from where we will be able to perform the network reset in Windows 10. In this way, all the network adapters will be removed and reinstalled and the original configuration of other components of the network will be re-established. net. This implies that if we were using some software such as a VPN client or virtual switches, we will have to reinstall them.
<br />A process that is carried out automatically by the system by clicking on the Reset button now shown in Network Reset in the Windows 10 configuration. It is normal that the process does not take too long, although we must wait until the end completely and restart the computer again to proceed with the network configuration in Windows 10 as we had until now.

            Hi Jonn. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Which network icon is showing in System Tray:  the Wireless waves or Ethernet TV with plug?  Left click to see if any Networks show up to sign into.  
<br />
<br />If not right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try updating the Network adapter driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage, using the full make/model number, HP Serial or Dell Service Tag from sticker on PC:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try Rolling back and then Uninstalling the Network adapter driver in Device Manager.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose the Network adapter you're using, on Driver tab choose Roll back, restart PC.  If that doesn't help try Uninstall, then restart to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>

<br /> 
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thanks I'll check it this weekend. It's a Dell desktop so both ethernet and wireless is shown. I did make sure airplane mode is off-which I wish I could permantely do since its a desktop. System restore only had one and it's within the time period of the
 error so couldn't use that. I'm thinking of the old check disk program at start up to see if that would help. It opens the webpage you want then errors to a dns error prompt. She's ok with wiping and reinstalling windows, just it will go back to windows 7
 instead of 10. I perfer 7 anyway-more user friendly. I'll update this post with what I find out. Thanks.<br />

<h2>            Unable to activate Windows 7 purchased from CraigsList</h2>
                    <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Craigslist Win 7&nbsp; fraud?</span><br />
<br />
I purchased a "Full Retail Windows 7 Pro 32/54 Bit" supposedly still sealed, off CraigsList.&nbsp; Bad move I know but it was $125 so I guessed it to be genuine.&nbsp; The packaging and disks and 3-D seal and product key all looked valid.&nbsp; NOT!!&nbsp; I have already done
 the install and installed most of the programs and drivers which i need before trying to activate it.&nbsp; The key is
<span style="font-weight: bold">*****-*****-VBHD9-PP2W6-THDQ7</span>.&nbsp; MS tells me that it isn't even valid in the USA, what gives?????<br />
<br />
What is the cheapest way to just purchase a valid 64-bit Win 7 Pro key?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<p>There is no cheap key, if you need Windows 7 Professional, you will just have buy it at the standard retail price:</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your system had a previous genuine Windows license (XP or Vista), you can purchase an upgrade license:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lately there have been several reports of instances of blocked MSDN keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media and reciepts, if you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the store you purchased
 it from and report it to www.microsoft.com/piracy </p>
<p>If you have purchased a key, with or without DVD's or packaging from EBAY or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN key because your key has been blocked you can check a few things yourself, if you received your key with the physical product
 go to www.microsoft.com/howtotell and verify your product however some counterfeit software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.</p>
<p>To check your PID press the win key and pause at the same time, or open system properties through the control panel, scroll down to activation section and look at the PID It will look something like this 12345-067-1234567-54321, the portion you are interested
 in is the three digit section, if it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have an MSDN key.</p>
<p>065, 066, 067, 068 for Ultimate, <strong>220, 221 area for Pro</strong> and the 230, 231, 221, 232 area for premium, there are probably others but they should be close to those posted</p>
<p>About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys </p>
<p>They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose
 is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside
 of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses
 it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.</p>
<p>In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere
 along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.</p>
<p>Validate Now:</p>
<p>You can confirm that your software is genuine now. It’s quick and easy.</p>
<p>http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/ValidateNow.aspx?displaylang=en</p>
<p>Click the 'Validate Windows' button, if the validation check fails, then click on the 'Get Genuine' button to get a WGA Kit.

    <title>programs &#38; functions inaccessible under administrator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vegansoul  say:</h3>
<h2>            programs &#38; functions inaccessible under administrator</h2>
                    
<p>hello.&nbsp; i am new to the vista world, having recently had a computer built for me running vista 64-bit home premium.&nbsp;
i'm experiencing a scenario that appears so vast that i'm unable to find any applicable articles or web documents addressing it.</p>
<p>upon initial startup, i began setting up and running programs under my administrator account with no other user accounts set up and with UAC off.&nbsp;
even so, i noticed that i was being asked to provide permission to install many programs or access folders to do so.&nbsp;
still, all went reasonably well after installing a few programs until, all of a sudden, all of my running programs began shutting down at once.</p>
<p>when i attempted to restart them, i received the message "Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file.&nbsp;
You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."&nbsp; 
in addition, i received a red shield with an "x" in the system tray with the message "Check your computer security.&nbsp;
There are multiple security problems.&nbsp; Click this notification to fix these problems."&nbsp;
however, clicking the notification resulted in no on-screen action.</p>
<p>i immediately shut down the internet connection for security purposes, then could not restart it without the error message.</p>
<p>after exploring further, i learned:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
most programs, including most important vista administrative functions, cannot be accessed or do not run at all (receive first error above or clicking results in no action).&nbsp;
these include:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
all security programs (windows security/firewall/defender/internet options, avast anti-virus, comodo internet security, ad-aware)</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
all browsers (ie, firefox) and email programs (mozilla thunderbird)</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
many control panel programs (system restore, system backup, indexing options, problem reports and solutions, device manager, view event logs, nvidia control panel, most options in sharing and discovery, people near me, sound, mouse, keyboard,
 turn windows features on and off, windows sidebar, configure advanced user profile properties, change my environment variables, view 32-bit control panel items)</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
other installed programs (microsoft money, openoffice, irfanview, gimp, mp3directcut, 1-by-1 player, forte agent newsreader)</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
i can access certain items, such as control panel, default programs, and help and support, through explorer, but not through the start menu (although, as mentioned above, many functions within each do not work).</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
many items, such as "run", restart, and shut down, are inactive or lacking permission.&nbsp;
however, the log off function works;&nbsp; therefore, i can restart or shut down at the log in screen by pressing the red button.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
when attempting to run a program through the "Run As Administrator" option, i receive the first error above.</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
when attempting to grant permissions to folders or program executables, it seems i've lost my ability as an administrator to do so.&nbsp;
by right-clicking on the file or folder properties under the security tab, i am unable to edit permissions (they are greyed out).</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
my dvd drive is not sensing a disk when inserted, nor does it do so after turning on that function.&nbsp;
therefore, i cannot save any of the important files on my pc (emails received or checkbook) to a disk.</p>
<p>i was later able to turn my internet access back on through help and support, but it really doesn't help (and obviously lowers my security).&nbsp;
i tried creating an additional adminstrator - - in doing so, i was able to create the user, but the permissions are even more limited than my current one.</p>
<p>in addition, i tried rebooting into safe mode, but the f8 key only produces a choice between booting normally or booting from a disk.<br />
</p>
<p>i do have an old xp-based system, from which i am writing and posting this plea.</p>
<p>i am at a loss and wonder if any folks in this forum might be able to assist, short of reinstalling vista and/or shipping it back to my pc manufacturer for repair.&nbsp;
thanks so much in advance for any support advice.</p>

            You turned <strong>OFF</strong> the UAC, then you setup your system, without the rights you need to OK the setups. Turning off UAC does not turn off the security retraints of Vista, it simply disables your ability to over-ride them effortlessly. To recover
 from that, you would need to reset the Permissions of so many different things, doing it manually would be, I think, a bit daunting.<br />
<br />
Since this is a recent install, I would save data, and restore to&nbsp;clean install&nbsp;default. You could spend a year fighting to overcome the damage installing things without the correct Permissions on files and registry entries has done.<br />
<br />
There is a chance doing an "In-Place Upgrade" could help, but you would have to try it to know.<br />
<br />
<p>If you would like to perform the In-place Upgrade, refer to the following steps.</p>
<p>1. Start the computer by using the current Operating System. </p>
<p>2. Insert the Windows Vista DVD in the computer's DVD drive. </p>
<p>3. Use one of the following procedures, as appropriate:</p>
<p><br />
• If Windows automatically detects the DVD, the Install now screen appears. Click Install now.
</p>
<p>• If Windows does not automatically detect the DVD, follow these steps:<br />
a. Click Start, click Run, type Drive:\setup.exe, and then click OK. Note Drive is the drive letter of the computer's DVD drive.
</p>
<p>b. Click Install now. </p>
<p>4. When you reach the "Which type of installation do you want?" screen, click Upgrade to upgrade the current operating system to Windows Vista.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the attached DMP files are of the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (50)</strong></span><br />
<br />
<em>This indicates that invalid system memory has been referenced.</em><br />
<br />
Bug check 0x50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM).<br />
<br />
Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.<br />
<br />
Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.</p>

<h2>            how do you work out the default gateway using cidr or slash notation</h2>
                    <p>I had this question in the Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist - 70-680, Configuring Windows 7&nbsp;Measureup &nbsp;asking me to find out the default gateway of an IP address of 192.168.123.128 with a notation of /26.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was wondering how I would work this out? I'm really struggling on this. if anyone has the time to help with this that would be great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know CIDR is used in finding out the subnet mask, but not sure how to do it for defualt gateways or IP addresses.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>There are many email products with very similar names that work very differently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mail items in Windows Live Mail (WLM) are stored as separate files with strange long names that are numbers.&nbsp; Not recognizable at all.&nbsp; There is no practical way to retrieve one particular email from backup.&nbsp; You can recover a specific folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following is the backup advice I give to my clients for WLM:</p>
<p>
Backup Windows Live Mail &amp; contacts
</p><div style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<em>&nbsp;</em>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
Open the mail portion, click on the down pointing arrow in the top left corner, choose Export Email, then choose Email Messages, then choose Windows Live Mail.</li><li>
Now choose where the backup is to go. Create another folder inside your backup drive folder for this entire backup and name it email yourname dd-mm-yy</li><li>
Open the address book (Contact list) portion of Windows Live Mail</li><li>
On the top towards the right, find the Export icon. Choose comma separated values</li><li>
Click the browse button and navigate to your external hard drive folder for this backup and create yet another folder named address book yourname dd-mm-yy.</li><li>
On the next screen choose which data elements to backup. I choose them all</li></ol>
<p>
Windows Live Mail is no longer supported by Microsoft.&nbsp; Not such a bad thing because that also means they are less likely to mess it up.&nbsp; For your own security, you should download a copy of the program and store it in your backup drive in case you need to
 re-install for some reason:&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20170112124505/http://wl.dlservice.microsoft.com/download/C/1/B/C1BA42D6-6A50-4A4A-90E5-FA9347E9360C/en/wlsetup-all.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/20170112124505/http://wl.dlservice.microsoft.com/download/C/1/B/C1BA42D6-6A50-4A4A-90E5-FA9347E9360C/en/wlsetup-all.exe</a></p>
<p>
<em><strong>Move your Mail folder (a one time thing)</strong></em></p>
<p>
Windows Live Mail (WLM)&nbsp;sets itself up in a very inconvenient place.&nbsp; Hard to find.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is&nbsp;no reason&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;to move it to a more accessible location
 on your hard drive.&nbsp; This is a one time thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Once you do it, you will never have to do it again</strong>.&nbsp; Now, make backing up that folder a regular part
 of your regular backup procedure, in addition to the above steps</p>
<p>
To move it:</p>
<ol>
<li>
With WLM open, click on the little blue rectangle with the arrow in it on the top left of the WLM window</li><li>
Click on Options then Mail, the Advanced tab, Maintenance, Store folder</li><li>
Click the Change button.&nbsp; A navigation list of your hard drive pops up.</li><li>
Now navigate to the C: line, click once on it.</li><li>
Click Make new folder</li><li>
Type&nbsp;<strong>your name</strong>&nbsp;followed by the word&nbsp;<strong>mail</strong>,
 click OK, Click OK</li><li>
Close all the open windows.</li><li>
Close WLM</li><li>
When you next open WLM, it will take longer because that is when it actually moves your mail folder</li></ol>
<p>
The reason you should do this is that in the future you will be following the back up procedure above, BUT also you will be backing up that Mail folder to your external hard drive as well.&nbsp; The reason to do this is that if ever your system needs to be re-built,
 the re-builder can copy that Mail folder to the right place in your “new” system and all of your mail, contacts, calendars and whatever the way you have WLM set up, will be in effect in the new computer.</p>
<p>
Once Windows is re-built and all is working, download WLM 2011.</p>
<p>
The 2011 version works better than the 2012 one.&nbsp; The main advantage of the 2011 version is that Groups do not work in 2012.&nbsp; If you do not use groups, download WLM 2012 from the Microsoft site</p>
<ol>
<li>
Start your newly installed WLM and&nbsp;<em><strong>ignore all messages.&nbsp;</strong></em></li><li>
In WLM, click the tiny arrow icon on the nearly top left.&nbsp; Choose Options, Mail</li><li>
Click the Advanced tab, now Maintenance, Store folder</li><li>
Use your mouse to select the entire content (the location where your mail is installed in the new installation) shown in that window, Ctrl+C to copy it.</li><li>
Close WLM</li><li>
Navigate to the location you just copied by pasting (Ctrl+V) it into the text box above the start button</li><li>
Delete all the contents of this folder, but not the folder, which will now be empty.</li><li>
Copy the content (not the folder) of your backed-up WLM folder, and paste it into the folder you just deleted the contents of.</li><li>
Start WLM, and you will have everything back just as you had it before.&nbsp; No importing, no having to go and reset everything back the way you like it.&nbsp; You won’t even have to set up the accounts again.&nbsp; This even has your passwords.</li><li>
Type indexing options into the text box above the start globe</li><li>
Click Modify and add your new Windows Live Mail folder.</li></ol>
<p>
You should now use the “move” procedure above on your new or newly re-built PC.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can you search the Store from inside the Metro Store App using keywords? Or is there an app for that? Rather than looking over all the apps, as I am specifically looking for music instrument apps etc...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span>As I understand, you want the keyword to search the store from Metro store apps.
</span><span>I would suggest you to follow the troubleshooting steps to check if it helps.<br />
<br />
</span>
<p><span>a. Go to <b>Store</b><br />
b. Press the ‘<b>Windows + Q</b>’ key on the keyboard.<br />
</span><span>c. Under <b>search option</b> type the app you want and check.<br />
</span><span><br />
Refer the link:<br />

    <title>Microsoft-Account access being blocked by Firewall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sebastian2015  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft-Account access being blocked by Firewall</h2>
                    Dear community, <br />
i set my Windows 8 "Firewall with Advanced Security" to "Block all outgoing connections". Unfortunately this seems to stop certain Windows components from connecting to my Microsoft Account. The Mailapp can no longer access my Outlook.com mail (my 2nd email
 account works flawless) and sign in to the Store App is also prohibited (although displaying apps is possible).
<br />
<br />
The following outbound rules are activated:<br />
Services:<br />
<ul>
<li>wlidsvc (Signin assistant for microsoft accounts)</li><li>WSService (windows store- service)</li></ul>
AppPackages:
<ul>
<li>MicrosoftCommunicationsApps (the default one)</li></ul>
<p>Programs:</p>
<ul>
<li>C:\ProgramFiles\WindowsAppsmicrosoft.windowscommunicationsapps_16.4.4406.1205_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\LiveComm.exe (this executable seems to be always running and has the same icon as mail, so i allowed it too)</li></ul>
<br />
It seems to me there is a service/apppackage/program missing an outbound rule. Which one could it be?<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Hi linnyanne,</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;What is the format of the file that you are trying to open?</p>
<p>A codec is software that is used to compress or decompress a digital media file, such as a song or video. Windows Media Player and other programs use codecs to play and create digital media files.</p>
<p>A codec can consist of two components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder performs the compression (encoding) function and the decoder performs the decompression (decoding) function. Some codecs include both of these components and some codecs only include
 one of them.</p>
<p>For example, when you rip a song from an audio CD to your computer, the Player uses the Windows Media Audio codec by default to compress the song into a compact WMA file. When you play that WMA file (or any WMA file that might be streamed from a website),
 the Player uses the Windows Media Audio codec to decompress the file so the music can be played through your speakers.</p>
<p>To know more about Codec visit the following link:</p>

<p>You can search from your favorite search engine and download and install the codec which is compatible with the Operating system.</p>

<p>If one of these conditions applies to you, Windows 8 customers will be able to install Windows 8.1 Preview using the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/iso-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b><u><font color="#008080"><span>ISO image</span></font></u></b></a><span> once they become available.
</span></p>
<p>However if you have Windows RT, you cannot install from an ISO file <font>–</font> you can only install Windows RT 8.1 Preview if your original OS language was one of the 13 supported languages.
</p>
<p>If then this problem did not solved then I cant say anything but should try this method..</p>
</span><font><font><span>
<p>Preview 8.1 isos</p>
</span></font></font>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/preview-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#0000ff"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/preview-download</span></font></font></font></u></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Testing of Windows 8.1 Preview (Warning) </p>
<div>
<p>It has come light that testing the Windows 8.1 preview will not be as straightforward and will involve some prerequisites.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do not install it on a production machine or boot drive.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft Senior Product Marketing Manager Michael Niehaus reiterated that message in the RT in the Enterprise session on Tuesday. When the 8.1 preview is available,
<a href="http://reviews.cnet.com/windows-8-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">Windows 8</font></a> and Windows RT users will receive a Windows Update notification. That update will trigger the new bits to show up in the Windows Store, where potential
 testers will be able to read the description and choose whether or not to install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the final versions of Windows 8.1 are available, after their release to manufacturing, those who have downloaded the preview will get the same Windows Update plus Windows Store notification. While their data and accounts will be preserved if and when
 they choose to install the free, final 8.1 release, <strong>all their apps must be reinstalled,</strong> Niehaus said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Even if testers opt instead to roll their devices back to Windows 8 after installing the preview bits, they still will have to reinstall their apps once they move to the RTM version of Windows 8.1.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 users who do not install the preview build and opt instead to go straight from Windows 8/Windows RT to Windows 8.1 will not have to reinstall their apps. All settings, data and apps will carry over, a spokesperson said when I asked. Users will
 be able to decide when and if they want to move from Windows 8 and Windows RT to the 8.1 versions, officials stressed.</p>

<p>How to prepare:</p>
<p>Backup your system before:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check out the following article by Microsoft MVP JW Stuart about how to backup a Windows XP installation here using Acronis True Image
<strong><a href="http://www.pagestart.com/winxpnlhdatih05161101.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">here</font></a></strong></p>
<p>Another solution you can use for backing up Windows XP is Easeus To Do Backup, JW Stuart also has an article about it
<strong><a href="http://www.pagestart.com/winxpnlhdtodo04051101.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">here</font></a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These same principles should work for persons running Windows Vista. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are running editions such as Windows Vista Business, Enterprise or Ultimate editions, you can use the built in Complete PC Backup of your Vista installation. This can be very handy in case your Windows 8 installation fails. For instructions about
 how to use Complete PC Backup, see the following article <strong><a href="http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2007/09/29/speaking-of-recovery-tools-windows-vista-backup-center/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">here</font></a></strong>. Of course, you
 will need an external hard disk for this task. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a partition:</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/2011/02/25/how-to-create-a-simple-partition-in-windows-7-quick-tip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://notebooks.com/2011/02/25/how-to-create-a-simple-partition-in-windows-7-quick-tip/</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dual boot:</p>
<p>See instructions for dual booting based on installing the Windows 8 Previews, same principles will work for the Windows 8.1 preview:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2012/03/05/how-to-dual-boot-windows-xp-and-windows-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff">How to dual boot Windows XP and Windows 8</font></u></a>

</p>
<p><strong>Use Virtual Machine software:</strong></p>
<p>This is recommended if you have a powerful enough processor and lots of memory.
</p>
<p>You can use alternatives such as Oracle VirtualBox or VMWare Player.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads</font></a></p>
<p>VMware Player;</p>
<p><a href="http://downloads.vmware.com/d/details/player_401/dGpkYnRwd3didGRwQA==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://downloads.vmware.com/d/details/player_401/dGpkYnRwd3didGRwQA==</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you are running Windows 8 Pro on a computer with SLAT support Second Layer Address Translation,
</strong>you can use the built in Hyper-V that comes with Windows 8 Pro edition. </p>
