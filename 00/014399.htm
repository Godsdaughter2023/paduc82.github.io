</p><p>I just received this email and I contacted Microsoft and did a chat.&nbsp; the first agent told me it was a legitimate email and I should respond but I would never share my username and password so I recontacted Mircosoft and chatted with another agent who told
 me that Microsoft would never ask for any such personal information.&nbsp; Thank GOD I trusted my instincts and refused to respond to the email.&nbsp; Hope this helps someone else!</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office 2013 &#40;plus other programs&#41; disappeared from START&#62;ALL PROGRAMS</h2>
                    Hi All,<br />
I was talking to Gerry and he advised me to come to this area of the site, and not the Windows area I was in.<br />
<br />
Basically when I click on <b>START&gt;ALL PROGRAMS</b> I used to see all of my installed programs, now I only see a small amount of them, one of the most important ommissions (in my opinion) is Microsoft Office 2013. I have run Kaspersky Security Suite, Malwarebytes
 and SUPERAntiSpyware and they all give my system the all clear.<br />
<br />
I have run MGADiag but it seems it isn't compatible with Office 2013.<br />
<br />
Any help in restoring my programs to the START&gt;ALL PROGRAMS would be greatly appreciated as I am at a loss of what to try next.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Paul<br />

            Since you can run Repair, apparently you still have Office installed.<br />
<br />
You are just going to have to recreate the shortcuts. <br />
<br />
The program files are going to be located something like this:<br />
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\OFFICE15<br />
<br />
<br />
The start menu entries will be something like this:<br />
C:\Users\xxxxxx\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs<br />
<br />
<br />
You can manually recreate the program shortcuts in the start menu.<br />

<h2>            lost skype contacts and credit</h2>
                    i don't use skype too often, but recently i logged in to my account on my phone (after few updates) and i noticed that my all of my contacts are gone, then i logged in on my desktop and same thing - no contacs and no credit (not much 5-6$, but still it
 is gone). After reading skype and ms forums i conclueded that i might somehow merged my skype and microsoft accounts, all right, but how this explain my contacts and credit disappear ? what can i do to get i back?&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 activation problem</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have a desktop running Windows 7 and the computer was shipped by HP with 7 pre-installed.</p>
<p>The computer was bugging me to upgrade it to 10 for free. &nbsp;However, I decided to set 10 up as a separately bootable system. &nbsp;In other words I can boot in Win 7, or into Win 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, this bypassed the activation process within the upgrade and when I manually try to activate it with the product key Windows gives an error code that the product key is blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>To add to what Joe said... Each installation needs a license, so you can't just use your old Win7 installation and dual boot into a free Win10 upgrade installation. &nbsp;You need to either upgrade your Win7 install to Win10, or purchase a Win10 key. &nbsp;Also, in
 order to activate a clean install with your Win7 key, and therefore upgrade your license to a Win10 license, you need to be on build 10565 or later.</p>

Doing so gives such participants access to an early preview of a product still in development and the possibility to help shape its release with early feedback. Over the years, the methodologies available to do pre-release testing of Microsoft code has opened the door to a new set of early adopters who are more willing to take such products for a early spin without hesitation. Microsoft has responded to the rapid changes since the early days of Windows 95 and in more recent times Windows XP which were only available to a select technical group of private testers.

      If that does not resolve the issue, follow the instructions here.<br />

      <br />
      For Edge:<br />
      <br />
      User Scott_Ki has provided this solution.<br />
      <br />
      ************************************************<br />
      <br />
      When this happened to me, I closed Microsoft Edge using the Task
      Manager.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Then in the search bar next to the Windows 10 logo on the bottom
      off the screen (I call it the "Cortana Search"), I typed in
      google.com and hit enter.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      Microsoft Edge opened up with a new tab for Google.&nbsp; You can see
      the offending site still opens in a tab that doesn't have focus.&nbsp;
      Click the "X" to close Edge. Do not click on the offending site
      tab or it will get focus again.<br />
      <br />
      <br />
      When Edge closes nicely, it won't "Restore" the sessions and the
      offending site tab will be gone.<br />

</p><p>By default, all Skype subscriptions have recurring payments. The payments are always taken 3 days in advance to guarantee the continuity of service. With that all being said, you can't change the payment method once the subscription enters the recurring
 payment period which is the 3 days because the system will recognize your old payment instrument. That is why you need to change the associated payment instrument attach to this subscription outside the recurring payment period. Below is the screenshot where
 this information&nbsp;is being shown to&nbsp;every Skype user prior to purchasing a particular subscription on our website:</p>

    <title>&#64;email.msn.com no longer exists - not receiving emails with that - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davep_riley  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#64;email.msn.com no longer exists - not receiving emails with that anymore - HUGE problem</h2>
                    <p>I have a huge problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using @email.msn.com since 1997 (MSN records will see since 1998, somehow they lost a year).&nbsp;For some reason I was&nbsp;directed to use @msn.com&nbsp;at least ten years ago for webmail. I went&nbsp;with this, due to the convenience of not having to set up POP3
 or install an email client on other computers. I would still download my emails to a client as a backup, but would use webmail to delete and/or send and receive email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'email' one was the only email address I&nbsp;gave out in all these years and the only one I used for most of my online accounts (outside of email)&nbsp;- &nbsp;I never gave out @msn.com. One big advantage of this was that I was able to easily distinguish between spam
 and real email due to spammers sending to @msn.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, someone has been using @msn.com for bogus accounts and I get their notifications, luckily it hasn't been that bad. I tracked that person down and told them to stop using it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through outlook.com migration (and it sucks) and lost the ability on webmail to use "Send As" for @email.msn.com. Only @msn.com is available now. That was a bummer, but I got lazy fighting that one (I tried).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as of yesterday (April 19th, 2017), the @email.msn.com no longer exists. An email received on 4/18 came in on the 'email' one but my doctor sent me a receipt on 4/19 that I never got. I tested both email addresses&nbsp;on two separate gmail accounts and the
 'email' one&nbsp;never hits my inbox and no NDA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least 90% of my many accounts outside of MSN use that as an email address for log in, such as FB, LinkedIn and of course, financial institutions, utilities and other bills.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>***Now when emails are sent to @email.msn.com, they go into a black hole and no one is receiving an NDA&nbsp; and I am not receiving these emails. ***</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have no idea if anyone is sending me anything. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This means that any bills or account notifications&nbsp;will go answered and I could end up behind on my bills. I am lucky that I am up to date, but this will screw up that track record.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called MSN Premium Support the past couple days, and their answer is "I'm sorry that domain doesn't exist" or "that portal doesn't exist". &nbsp;I am paying them for the software and services, surely they can come up with a better answer? I get it, but it is
 still not acceptable. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of whether this exists, I need a solution such as a secondary SMTP address re-added to my account. or some kind of&nbsp;contact or something that would ensure receipt of those messages sent to @email.msn.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise, I am stuck with at least a year or more of updating all my accounts for which I could get behind. And some accounts may not allow changing the email address, which means I'll lose any history in those accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So one simple update on the server would save me a year of headaches. </p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW - Microsoft, maybe pay all my bills so I don't have to worry about this? One can dream, eh?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want a Server Engineer to answer this message, not customer service or technical support - Server Engineer ONLY, please.</p>

<p>Are there ANY server administrators or engineers that read these messages? Am I in the right place? Do I need to talk with your director or CEO or something to get anywhere?

<p>

            I'm in the same boat for the same reason outlined in the original post. &nbsp;Please provide an update on what if anything is being done to address this subset of original users that are stilling using the @email.msn.com for the reasons outlined above. Very
 frustrating that I was not given advanced warning that this change would be happening, it would have allowed me to update my subscriptions.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I too encountered this same issue and have been using @email.msn.com for the same reasons that @DaveP_Riley was. &nbsp; I haven't been receiving emails for over a week now and working the standard support channels was producing no results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm happy to report that after reaching out to some internal contacts at Microsoft, as of approximately 1:20pm PST on 2017.04.27, the problem was identified and corrected.</p>

<p>That is freaking awesome, I am now getting those emails. After the migration to the new outlook.com, I was assured that the 'email' would not disappear. So I felt lied to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the migration happened, I lost the ability in webmail to select "send from..." and select the 'email' email address. Hence contacting M$ back then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for the effort, so very much appreciated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know what the technical reason that caused our issues? I am in IT, so I am very curious to know what happened.

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Glad to know that everything is resolved now. The issue can be caused by the migration recently applied on the email servers. Since this has been corrected by the appropriate Team, rest assured that you will be able to receive your emails smoothly.</p>

</p><p>Mind you, my migration happened a few months ago, so for it to be a problem that much later, it is possible it is unrelated to the migration, hence asking</p>

<p>I can confirm that the issue had nothing to do with a migration as Anna implies was the case. &nbsp;It's also very disappointing that no one from Microsoft replied to @DaveP_Riley's initial report of this issue and it wasn't until the problem was resolved (via
 indirect channels) that an official Microsoft representative decided to reply to this thread (albeit with incorrect information). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As @DaveP_Riley outlined in the OP, this issue had disastrous consequences on users that relied on @email.msn.com email addresses. &nbsp;There was virtually no recourse for remediation by the users since the use of this email address has occurred over 20+ years
 and in many cases, due to providers requiring identity verification, you must receive an email at your currently registered email address in order to change your email address to something else. &nbsp;This would mean that to change from @email.msn.com to @msn.com
 I would need to receive @email.msn.com in the first place which wasn't possible. &nbsp;I encountered the same lack of responsiveness and results from Microsoft on the support case I opened that reported the issue of @email.msn.com not working. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall, thoroughly disappointed with both the fact that the problem occurred in the first place and then the lack of responsiveness from multiple Microsoft support channels (especially given urgency of the issue). &nbsp;Moreover, when I'd even get a response
 from Microsoft support via my ticket, the inability to understand and resolve it despite me telling them directly that the MX record was missing. &nbsp;In the end, it took an outsider to get it resolved and the only reason that happened was because I was lucky
 enough to have internal contacts who were able to get in touch with the individual(s) responsible for the email.msn.com subdomain. &nbsp;Microsoft support's channels (including answers.microsoft.com) provided zero value which is something that really should be
 addressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@DaveP_Riley - I'm not at liberty to share all the specifics around the issue but I can share this: 1) The root cause was a change made to the email.msn.com MX record; 2) The resolution was to correct the MX record; 3) There are internal discussions at Microsoft
 going on as I type this to determine: a) How the heck did this even happen; and b) put protocols in place to make sure it doesn't happen again.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 G Suite Instant Search broken AGAIN with yesterday&#39;s Windows updates</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 Professional 64-bit</p>
<p>Outlook 2010&nbsp; Version 14.0.7188.5002 (32-bit), using G Suite</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is slightly different from what happened back in the summer where the index would build but Outlook instant search wouldn't cull the results.&nbsp; This time, it won't even add emails to the index at all.</p>
<p>As soon as the very latest round of Windows Updates finished installing (Wednesday 10/11/17 for me), my Windows search index no longer indexes emails in my Outlook, and, as a result, typing anything in the Outlook instant search bar brings up a totally blank
 result (as opposed to last summer when it just gave you your entire email list no matter what you typed).</p>
<p>First thing I did was go to Indexing Options and rebuild the index.&nbsp; It has 8 items indexed (LOL) despite having Outlook (containing many more than 8 emails) as my only "included location".</p>
<p>Next I tried removing Outlook from the indexing options included locations &amp; restarting Outlook, and luckily the old slow non-indexed search still works, but omg that takes a couple of minutes to run a simple search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway it's obvs a result of one of these many MANY KBs that came through this week - can anyone advise once you find out which one it is?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!</p>

 It occurred to me to do that as a last resort bc that would most likely solve the issue, but the problem is this bundle included dozens of critical security updates, and I'm hesitant to simply roll back everything indiscriminately if many of these were in
 response to some new malware exploits.&nbsp; Let's see if anyone finds out specifically which KB is responsible for the issue.&nbsp; Thanks again!&nbsp;</span>

    <title>Windows Defender deleting my stuff - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Defender deleting my stuff</h2>
                    Windows Defender keeps deleting my gaming files because they are .exe extensions.&nbsp; So I would like to know how to prevent Windows Defender from deleting stuff without asking me for permission prior to. I mean it seems great and all that it wants to delete
 any threat immediately, but not when your service is actually causing me more problems then it is fixing. I didn't ask for it to remove things from my device without asking. Please anybody that has an answer to this feel free to leave input. I also don't want
 to go to add exclusions. I want it the exact opposite I don't want to have to add something to not be deleted, I want to not have my stuff being deleted without me wanting it so.

            <blockquote>Windows Defender keeps deleting my gaming files because they are .exe extensions.</blockquote>
<p>Nearly every program running in your system has EXE extension. So, having an EXE extension should not be a problem. They are most probably malicious (maybe cracked?). Make sure you have genuine copy of your game, otherwise you can get into trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>So I would like to know how to prevent Windows Defender from deleting stuff without asking me for permission prior to.</blockquote>
<p>A malware can do a lot of damage in few seconds. So taking permission before removing them seems a threat in itself to me.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>I also don't want to go to add exclusions. I want it the exact opposite I don't want to have to add something to not be deleted, I want to not have my stuff being deleted without me wanting it so.</blockquote>
<p>Windows Defender won't delete your stuff, unless it has nothing but malware, it moves your stuff to a safe vault, a quarantine, and you can restore your stuff anytime you want (but do it only when you are 100% sure your stuff is not malicious). Adding exclusions
 makes sense, exact opposite don't. As I said before, if Windows Defender started waiting for your approval, malware can do a lot damage between that time. But if you still want to customize this behavior, you can do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Win key + R.</strong> This will open Run dialog.</li><li>Type 'gpedit.msc' and hit enter. This will open Local Group Policy Editor.<br />
<em>Note: This won't work with Windows 10 Home edition.</em></li><li>Navigate to&nbsp;<strong>Computer Configuration -&gt; Administrative Template -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Windows Defender -&gt; Threats</strong>.</li><li>The options there will give you some sort of control over threat removal.</li></ol>
<p><strong><em>Experiment at your own risk!</em></strong></p>

    <title>Email supposedly from Escalations Support asking for my account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Email supposedly from Escalations Support asking for my account details to help recover account--Is this legit&#63;</h2>
                    Like many other posters here, I've been unable to recover my email account for many weeks, despite numerous attempts to prove I am the rightful person to recover it. I've spent weeks filling out their online questionnaires with what I could remember, including
 past passwords and titles of recent email messages and the names of folders in my email box. However, I kept being automatically rejected (often within a minute of submitting the verification forms with details) and told I was unsuccessful in fully validating
 myself. Finally, after posting support requests at the support site under two incident SR numbers, I was told my matter was being referred to a more senior escalation support team and that I'd get an email from the escalations support people,
<br />
<br />
Here's my question: Yesterday, I received an email from someone named Gary from Escalations Supports asking me to provide more information to him. Here is the text of that email:

IT APPEARS HE IS ASKING ME TO PROVIDE THE INFO <b><u>VIA AN EMAIL, which I find rather insecure</u></b>, considering the lower level MS escalation agents at the official Support Site asked me to post messages/communications over there.
<br />
<br />
His email to me has a different SRX number than the previous two SR numbers listed on the official MS support site (which were marked as closed on that site, even though they never resolved the matter for me). On the incidents list, there is no mention of the
 new SRX number, but I was assured that I was to expect an email from an escalated level of support and that this one must be legitimate.
<br />
</div>
<br />
CAN I SAFELY RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS ASKED BY GARY OF ESCALATIONS SUPPORT IN EMAIL FORM? Arguably, email format is not secure compared to the format for online communications used on the official support site. I have sent him a brief reply telling him that
 I would be willing to provide info, but questioned the wisdom of doing so in an insecure format such as regular email. ANY ADVICE ON WHETHER I MUST PROVIDE THE INFO IN EMAIL FORM back to him?
<br />
<br />
FYI, the support site fails to list the new SRX number, so there is no place set up for me to respond to Gary's information request in the earlier secure site. I am baffled as to why an official ESCALATIONS SUPPORT team member would expect me to give confidential
 information to him via ordinary, unencrypted email. It doesn't sound wise, Could it be Microsoft is just trying to collect more information about me while verifying my IP address used for email? Why would my case be handled with less attention to security
 after being kicked up to a higher level of escalation support? Isn't this suspicious? What should I do? I want to get back inside my locked email, but I don't want to compromise my security in the process of recovering it.

Whenever I try to reach Yammer Auth through a SDK implementation (https://www.yammer.com/dialog/oauth), for a week this has been very slow (up to one minute), and today the connexion cannot be established at all.<br />
Are you encountering some server issues ?<br />

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have a Lumia 550 and running Win 10 (most of the time ok) but the Microsoft store doesn't load and I cannot remove it or repair it (options greyed out). How do I get it back? Help. I have reinstalled Win 10 from scratch but don't want to keep doing that
 just to access store Apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd issue - got Facebook messenger on same mobile but there is no phone symbol next to contact/s so can only send messages&nbsp; to them like I would from my PC. I can make calls from messenger on my PC and laptop ok</p>

            <p><span>Hi bigjoe1_10,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to go through the steps and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u><span>Method 1</span></u></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to access the ‚ÄúC:\Users\(Username)\Favorites‚Äù folder on your C drive and check for any other user account. If you find any other user account
 try to access the User account folder and check if you can find the missing files in the user account folder and post back the result.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In order to locate the favorite folder, you may refer to the following steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Click "Start" and select your user name at the top of the Start menu.</span></p>
<p><span>2. There will be a folder called "Favorites." All you Internet Explorer Favorites are stored in this folder. If you want to copy the folder,
<span>&nbsp;</span>right-click on it and select "Copy" from the context menu.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also refer to the following link.</span></p>

            Microsoft tech people need to get their act together. Too often, answers to a&nbsp;problem are unrelated to the issue posted. Such is the&nbsp;case here. I have Win10 w/MS Edge. I would like to see comments that were made by me regarding articles from the (msn.com)
 Homepage via Edge. There is the tab/button to view all comments, however I do not see where I can&nbsp;click a prompt or something to see my&nbsp;own posted comment. The problem with just trying to find it is that most times my comment is far down the list of comments
 posted after me of that particular article. Note:&nbsp;Yahoo (w/I.E.)&nbsp;has 2 buttons to view comments; 1. view all&nbsp;comments and 2. my comments. And so, when I click the 'my comments' tab, just all my comments are displayed.

                    <p>I purchased Office 2016 through a HOME PURCHASE PROGRAM via web and all was fine when I load it on my SURFACE 3, as well as I purchased VISIO 2016 - Now that I upgraded to a SURFACE PRO 4 and try to install it again - it says I have exceeded my number of
 installation; I wiped out the SURFACE 3 so it's no longer loaded on that machine.</p>

            If Office is associated with an MS Account you log on to that account to de-activate the old install, and install on the new. If its not associated with an MS Account you use phone activation but do not respond to any prompts until given the option to

<p>
</p><p>Most important is Settings. &nbsp;I cannot check updates (yes, today it is 28th of July here in Japan). &nbsp;Hitting Settings in the start menu doesn't cause anything. &nbsp;Hitting Edge or Store in the taskbar brings up "Element not Found" error dialog. &nbsp; wsreset.exe
 doesn't work, either.</p>
