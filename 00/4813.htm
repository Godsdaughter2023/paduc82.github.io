    <title>Interchangeably use the start menu and start screen on multi display - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dennis bakker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Interchangeably use the start menu and start screen on multi display setup and open apps accordingly</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 3 and have a docking station where a 27"&nbsp;display is attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this setup it would be ideal if the SP3's touch display shows the start screen and opens apps in full screen mode and the 27"&nbsp;display shows the start menu and opens programs and apps in a windows on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other people may use such a multi display setup in a different way so maybe the best solution is to make a per&nbsp;display option to use the start menu or the start screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the start screen is used, make an option in the context menu and/or appbar to open the app in a window on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the start menu is used, make an option in the context menu to open the app full screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What&nbsp;do you&nbsp;think of this proposal?</p>

            <p>Sometimes I want the start screen and full screen apps on my non-touch screen, so your option won't work (at least for me).
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I've</span> <span>thought about</span> <span>mouse and</span> <span>touch use in Windows 10</span>&nbsp;<span>again and have</span>
<span>the following in mind</span><span>:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are on the desktop you have the start menu, but with a right click it should show an option to go to the start screen and when you click or tap an app it should open in full screen. When you right click or tap and hold&nbsp;the app a context menu should
 appear with the option to open the app on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as you are in full screen apps the start button should go to the start screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can always&nbsp;go back to the desktop by clicking/tapping the desktop tile and there you get the start menu back. When you click an app in the start menu it will open in a window, but again with a right click open a context menu with an option to open the
 app in full screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there should always be an option (as in Windows 10 right now)&nbsp;to disable the start menu and only use the start screen. And for a multi display setup, make that option a per display option.</p>

    <title>Cannot update Country and Mobile number in Find my Phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leanaesterhuyse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot update Country and Mobile number in Find my Phone</h2>
                    <p>I recently had to change to a new Windowsphone Lumia 535 after my previous Lumia 535 was stolen. The thieve immediately took the SIM out so I could not use Erase my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On setting up my new Lumia, I entered my Microsoft account details etc and everything was sinqed nicely (contacts, calender, OneDrive, etc). However, when I login to my Microsoft account on my laptop and try to Find my Phone, it says it can't find my phone.
 When I click on Ring, it opens up a box that requires me to enter the country and phone number. HOWEVER, the menu does not allow me to change the country. I am in South Africa and the default option is USA, which can't be changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can Microsoft please edit the program to allow users to change the country settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I setup my new Lumia, I did set the time region etc to South Africa. My previous Lumia worked perfectly with Find my Phone, or Ring my Phone.</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>Regarding Erasing the phone that was stolen. The thieves immediately took out the battery. They know that I was going to report the phone stolen and Blacklist the EMEI at the cellphone provider. I tried to Erase the phone many times, I just got a message
 that the phone cannot be find and the map displayed the area where it was last in my possession. After two months I eventually Removed the phone from my profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That leaves me with the new/replacement Lumia, for which I cannot update the phone number, as per screenshot above. Windows seems to find my phone - I suppose by EMEI, but I cannot add a phone number, so the Ring function does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I started the new phone up originally, I registered with my Windows Account, including my number. My cellnumber reflects on my Profile, just not next to my Device Lumia 535? It is so frustrating.</p>

    <title>File as nickname - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> teddystiles  say:</h3>
<h2>            File as nickname</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess I understand that MOST Pocket PC users are business folks, but surely there are more than a few of us "turbo nerds" who can't help but buy these things. Personally, I'm on my very first Pocket PC (the Tilt) and I'm loving it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, there is one annoyance that I can't seem to surmount: can you file a contact by a nickname? For example, of course I want my mother entered with her full name (Jane Doe, say), but I'll enter "Mom" as her nickname. Under "file as," however,
 I can list her as "Jane Doe" or "Doe, Jane." Well, of course I want her listed as "Mom." I don't want to put "Mom" in the first name field and leave the last name blank, of course. How is this accomplished? Surely even power business users have mothers?!?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Mom, of course, is an example. I really would like most of my contacts entered with full names, yet appearing in the contact list under their nicknames. Am I missing something or am I going to have to seek out a computer genius to put a
 hack together for me?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks so much,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Deleting Browsing History - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Deleting Browsing History</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a problem accessing an old (but still live) email account. Advice on their community forum is that I should delete my browsing history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under earlier versions of IE it was possible to select what you wanted to be deleted but it seems that under IE11 / Internet Options / Browsing History, it will delete everything i.e.&nbsp; temp files, history, web form info, saved passwords and cookies. But
 there are some cookies that I must not delete so is there any way that I can select what to delete? I have checked the box "delete browsing history on exit" so if my problem is linked to browsing history then IE isn't deleting on exit as it should be doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help please? Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have unchecked&nbsp; "Delete browsing history on Exit".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I wanted to&nbsp;keep cookies was that I use the OneMoreLevel games site and didn't want to lose my score on Lightning Pool - it's taken me a long time to reach it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then checked "Preserve Favourites Website data", thinking it would retain all the data including my score.
</p>
<p>I also&nbsp;checked 'clear cookies' .</p>
<p>
</p><p>The outcome?&nbsp;I've now lost my Lightning Pool score.&nbsp; I thought that as OneMoreLevel was a Favourites site,&nbsp; it would retain that data but it hasn't.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Microsoft account emails still linked&#59; billing information from my main account CC&#39;d to secondary account</h2>
                    A few years ago, I unlinked my two Microsoft accounts. The one I'm currently using to write this question is my primary account, while a secondary account was unlinked from it. Since then, Microsoft has obviously stopped offering linked accounts, but I'm
 still receiving personal information sent to my secondary account (it's CC'd on all my billing emails for Windows Phone and Windows Store app purchases, for instance, as well as Xbox Live renewals).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried everything I can to unlink the accounts completely, but nothing has solved the issue. My emails are not forwarded, and there are no options in Outlook.com's settings or Microsoft Account management settings that will let me resolve the issue.
 I have called Microsoft and done live chatting, but every time I'm told it's not possible for the person on the other end of the conversation to resolve the issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I want my accounts unlinked completely. This is essentially my last option, and I was referred here by the live-chat support individual.</div>

<h2>            Best way to consolidate multiple sheets from multiple workbooks</h2>
                    I have 10 workbooks, each workbook has 10 sheets, 1 per client. Different people edit each workbook and add new rows. My objective is to create an easy to maintain method to consolidate all sheets from all workbooks into a master workbook. Though i considered

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This could be one way</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. We create one workbook per worksheet and therefore there will be 100 files in&nbsp;one folder</p>
<p>2. We save all files are CSV files</p>
<p>3. We then download and install a free add-in from Microsoft called Power Query</p>
<p>4. In Power Query, there is a way to combine data from all CSV files lying in a certain folder to one Excel file.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The benefit of the process defined above is that if you edit data in any of the 100 CSV files or add new CSV files to that folder, data in the new file will keep updating.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you had fewer files and fewer worksheets per file, then I would have suggested another technique.</p>

 around the end of March.&nbsp; Even using the "CTRL P" command - does not print the calendar, only the top banner, nothing of the actual calendar contents, the rest of the page is blank.</p>

<p>I would gladly sign in or out to get the WIndows 8(1) start screen back ! Hell I would even reboot to get it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we are left with an option to make the start menu full screen. Microsoft never learns, again they are taking away options that made perfect sense. They make the very same mistake they made by not offering people choice in regards to startmenu/startscreen
 in Windows 8. Now the people who have used and defended the start screen are thrown under the bus.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>People that want to go back to previous century could use the start menu, whilst people who have moved on could continue to use the start screen that was perfectly usable on all kinds of devices from Windows 8.1. This option did exist in all tech previews
 of Windows 10 until now. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But no, gone is the true full screen start experience, gone is the start screen background. Gone is horizontal scrolling. To add insult to the injury, there is no apparent way to select multiple tiles, resizing tiles don't work correctly and I fail to see
 how this approach would offer a better experience on touch devices, in fact it is the direct opposite.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do I see the taskbar even in tablet mode, why is Microsoft insistent of throwing everything that was great about Windows 8 away just to please the whingers, who have called Microsoft everything under the sun ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do you **** of your most loyal customers, and for what purpose. Builds as recent as 9901 offered CHOICE, why remove the choice and replace it with something that is worse than the startmenu from Windows 7 AND is worse than the start screen in Windows
 8.1, much worse in fact. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why do you throw perfectly functional code away, what purpose does it have and who do you think would be happy ? The people that longed for the start menu now have it back, whilst by removing this options, you force people who said goodbye to the startmenu
 to start using it again. I don't want to be thrown back in time a full six years. It's 2015 for crying out loud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please please give us back the OPTION to enable the start screen. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh by the way, tablet mode or not, this build is not usable on a tablet. And the way you are going with this, I fail to see how it would ever be half as usable as Windows 8.1 on a tablet. You are clearly giving up on touch devices.

            <p>Hey folks, this is a technical preview, not even a consumer preview. They're trying out different things and gauging reactions. Lots of people complained about the fullscreen start screen, so now they're offering the option of a hybrid, and they've explicitly
 said it will be resizable. I'm sure there will be a way to enable full tablet mode for the startscreen if that's what you want. For now, the fullscreen mode is pretty close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the lack of a background -- this is a preview!! Not the final design!! I'm sure that customization will be back in a coming build. The best thing you can do is give feedback via the insider app.</p>

            <p>I am fully aware this is a tech preview. My posts clearly addresses the removal of perfectly functional code. That was working fine as recent as the 9901 build. Why remove functional code when they clearly know people who have used Windows 8 for years will
 be offended. Especially if the alternative is so much worse. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And no the full screen mode isn't pretty close, it is miles away from the start screen. I outlined the problems with the full screen mode, whilst forgetting to point out that the search experience is now only being done through the taskbar, a taskbar that
 makes absolutely no sense on a touch device.&nbsp; If you choose to hide it (which I shouldn't have to do in tablet mode in the first place), the search function doesn't work, so I am forced to live with the taskbar being visible all the time on my TABLET.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem this time around is that instead of progressing towards usable builds, the builds on Windows 10 become less usable at each iteration. Instead of progression we seen the opposite. The forcing of the start menu is a perfect example.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>People that loved the start screen now no longer have the option to use it and be done with it, whilst the people that loved the start menu, now no longer have the ability to resize it to get rid of the (in their view) useless stuff on the right side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For both people, the forcing of the start menu quite clearly represents backwards progress instead of improvements.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Again Microsoft is making the same mistakes again. They shouldn't have removed the option for using the start screen as they will never be able to improve the start menu in such a way that it is acceptable for start screen users without offending the people
 who come from Windows 7.</p>

            <p>I understand what you (and many others) mean. People are DIFFERENT. And because of that, we have CHOICE. Some like Blue, others like Yellow. And some, but not everybody likes GREEN. And that is what Microsoft is kind of doing, merging two completely different
 colors, thinking everyone will adapt to the new color, and then leaving YELLOW and BLUE without their respective CHOICES, should they have a problem adapting. If I like BLUE and you like YELLOW, why shouldn't there be an option for us to CHOOSE the COLOR we
 prefer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure, there is no problem with creating GREEN, but hey, BLUE is not YELLOW or GREEN, and neither is GREEN YELLOW or BLUE. It's a matter of CHOICE, and CHOICE is what DEFINES&nbsp;us as an INDIVIDUAL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone remember Windows 7?</p>
<p>A few years ago, there was common sense about this, without the need of any special Insider Program.</p>
<p>Some liked the 7 Start Menu, while others liked the Classic Start Menu. Windows 7 had an OPTION for CHOICE. It allowed the USER to CHOOSE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why remove the OPTION to CHOOSE in Windows 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is gaining CHOICE, but not enough, as it still forces ONE or MORE of the colors to sit tight with another that does not get along well.</p>

<h2>            VBA count for last used row &#40;and column&#41; of data</h2>
                    <p>I need some counts&nbsp;to allow&nbsp;me to accurately re-define an array.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My initial thoughts are ......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dim wsSourceData As Worksheet</p>
<p>Set wsSourceData = Worksheets("Fred")</p>
<p>dim&nbsp;rrr as long</p>
<p>dim&nbsp;ccc as long</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>rrr&nbsp;= wsSourceData.Range("A" &amp; Rows.Count).end(xlUp).row</p>
<p>ccc&nbsp;= wsSourceData.Cells(1, Columns.Count).end(xlToLeft).column</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But this will only count column A and row 1, which may not be the true&nbsp;range of the data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also need to convert the column count to a letter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I achieve this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation.</p>

<p>we have just recently returned from living abroad for a number of years, have bought a new pc, with windows 10 OS. Have found our old office discs, and key, but the disc wont begin to install. It is a genuine disc, bought it myself many years ago, but when
 tried to download, Microsoft says the product key is not valid.</p>
<p>Although i don't have the receipt (they used blackboards back then), surely i shouldn't have to buy again ? Its not like i have lost it, or broken it, the discs and packaging are still in perfect condition...&nbsp; Help :o)</p>

<p>I've been running Office Outlook 2003 email on Windows 10 since it came out. Unfortunately I just set Windows defaults and now Office Outlook 2003 won't operate even though I've changed it back to my default! This is bad form Windows. They took it away and
 I/we want it back.</p>

<p>Hi-I don't know what 'check your key' means? </p>
<p>After houts yesterday I found some other route to my Outlook 2003 email account and found either the incoming or outgoing (can't rememember which), had changed from a POP3 to an HTML. I changed it so both were back to POP3 and this solved the issue - what
 a relief. BUT, later the issue returned and I have no idea where I got the other route to the email account. I've tried all the usual ways. Any ideas please? And/or explain 'check your key'. Many thanks.</p>

            When I said check your Product Key, I just meant to make sure you were using the&nbsp; correct characters.&nbsp; Your email account setting depend on which email provider you are using.&nbsp; Here is the settings for a Gmail account, as you will see it points you to
 how to get to your email account, which basically is&gt;Tools&gt;Email Accounts&gt;See <a href="http://www.help30.com/helpemailPOP/Outlook2003Setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a>&nbsp; You should be able find your exact setting by searching the internet for&gt;Outlook 2003 email setting for (then put your email providers name). PS: you can repair Office by click on&gt;Help&gt;Detect and repair (although you do not need this for your email
 settings)

<p>Thank you Ron but <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">everything</span> on my Outlook 20O3 page gives 'operation failed'. This includes all on the tool bar which, of course, is where Tools&gt;Email Accounts is (for my Settings)!&nbsp; Now, after today's effort
 I seem to have totally lost my Outlook email account. Detect and repair has opened an error box: Error 1010. Error configuring ODBC data source: Visual FoxPro Database. ODBC error 13. The setup routines for the Microsoft Visual FoxPro Driver ODBC could not
 be loaded due to system error code 126: The sprecified module could not be found.</p>
<p>(C:\WINDOWS\system32\vfpodbc.dll).. Verify that the file Visual FoxPro Database exists and that you can access it.</p>
<p>I do not understand the error message and, as I said, all I get now when I open Outlook is an Outlook page with all folders etc empty and no send/receive! It did open the Tools&gt;Accounts and there is no account showing. (If I ADD an account I'm sure my usual
 account will not be available but just a new one which will not my previous/current emails).
</p>
<p>Any more suggestions please?</p>

            I am not sure where you are with this.&nbsp; First of all you say the Product Key will not work then you say you are having other problems.&nbsp; Not sure you have added an email account. &nbsp; I suggest that you uninstall Office and reinstall. Before reinstalling try
 the Windows 10 Mail App.&nbsp; See how <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17198/windows-10-set-up-email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a>&nbsp; This will not prevent you installing Office Outlook 2003.

<p>Thanks but it seems we have some confusion. Windows updates has stopped my exisitng Windows Outlook 2003 from operating. It is still opening but won't send/receive or let me into Tools&gt;Accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think 2003 can be installed these days, (I got it in 2003 off the internet if I recall), also if at all possible it would be a new account and I'd lose my existing emails. I will find out but not optimistic. I'm using the BT server currently for
 my emails but I've never liked it and want my old Outlook 2003 (it linked from BT but I don't have to go on the internet for it). Hope I'm clearer to you now but if not, thanks for you efforts anyway.</p>

<p>Windows updates should not stop outlook 2003 working, although from posts on this forum Microsoft has a bad habit of pushing Office 365 on computers running older Office software, just like it did with Windows 10!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your emails should still be on your webmail.&nbsp; That is why I suggested that you use Windows 10 Mail App.&nbsp; It is actually quite good and you may think that it not too bad a replacement for Outlook 2003.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Third party spam filter vs outlook 2016 built in spam - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nyartist2016  say:</h3>
<h2>            Third party spam filter vs outlook 2016 built in spam</h2>
                    I've been using a program called Spam Reader to filter spam rather than the built in junk mail program in Outlook 2016. They seem to be in conflict. I see I have two folders: one called spam that has an envelope with a red circle with a red line through
 it. Is that the folder that Outlook automatically sets up? I also have a junk folder so is that the one Outlook sets up? With Spam Reader I thought that I would avoid the conflict by directing that program to send spam to the spam filter (which I believe is
 the folder Outlook sets up) but I'm also getting spam delivered to the Junk folder so is that the one Outlook sets up? and if so when I try and click on a message in Junk folder and label it not junk it just stays there and doesn't get moved to the inbox?&nbsp;
 This sounds like a question with no answers!

<p>Hi Palcouk</p>

</p><p>So if i uninstall spam reader then I'll have just the outlook junk folder. Do you know if spamfighter also creates its own spam folder?</p>

    <title>Uninstalling software - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronbo2000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uninstalling software</h2>
                    I installed a demo software for Sprite Backup on my Treo 750 device.&nbsp; The trial is done and I opted for another backup software.&nbsp; However, when I try to uninstall Sprite Backup via the Remove Programs, it comes backup and says:"Sprite Software Backup was
 not completely removed.&nbsp; Do you want to remove it from the list of installed programs?"&nbsp; I take yes and the software is still there.<br />
<br />
I look under Start &gt; Programs and the Sprite Backup icon is still there and is working except of course it tells me that it has expired.&nbsp; I don't want to hard reset as I have too many stuff in this device now.

<p>how long are you waiting to try and touch it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what was the last 2 softwares that you installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>when was the last time you did a back up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if it were me, i would reflash the device with flasher.</p>

<p>here is the <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Updating_the_firmware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
LINK</a>&nbsp;with directions to flash.&nbsp; its actually very simple.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>it may be the only way to get it back to normal if you cannot touch the screen.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are facing the issue on start menu.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a known issue that may occur when you first install build 9926 of Windows 10 Technical Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong>&nbsp;Try to run the search and index troubleshooter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press Windows key +X.</p>
<p>b. Click on Control Panel.</p>
<p>c. Click on Troubleshooting.</p>
<p>d. On the left pane, click on view all.</p>
<p>e. From the list, click on search and index.</p>
<p>f. Run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Try to perform clean boot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows
 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong> Try to perform virus scan:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. Please let us know the results. Feel free to write us back for any further assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>

<p>Hi Lucky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience. To better understand the situation, could you let us know the following info?</p>
<p>1. What is your Office suite plan, Office 365 Home, Office 365 Personal or Microsoft HUP?
</p>
<p>2. By "it doesn't seem to work at all", could you let us know which error or in which step you fails to install the Office suite? You could capture some screenshots for the error you encounter.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is an article for your reference: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/download-and-install-or-reinstall-office-365-or-office-2016-on-a-pc-or-mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658#InstallSteps=Install_on_a_Mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Download and install or reinstall Office 365 or Office 2016 on a PC or Mac</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>
