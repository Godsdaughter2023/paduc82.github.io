<h2>            Bought a game, no download.</h2>
                    Hi there! A few days ago I bought Hydrophobia on sale, for nearly 3 bucks, but the download stopped after a few seconds. An error occured: errorcode 80181102. After that I made a reboot and the store says i have to Pay again, to Download the game. I already
 got the bill, which says I've paid my debt. What can I do?

Please try to go to your download history and see if the game is located there. If the game was purchased properly you should also be able to see it in your transaction history

            The manufacturer's warranty won't be affected by it. I do suggest from now on however, when you purchase a console, to also get Microsoft Complete for Xbox... its only $50 extra, but it is a 3 year warranty that covers repairs and accidental damage.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Anna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As onyx stated the repair warranty is usually a temporary warranty when the console is returned in case something happens where you need to send the console back. It should not replace your 1 year manufacturer warranty as they are essentially separate. You
 are entitled to having a full year of warranty from the day you purchase your console and that shouldn't change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the manufacturer warranty date is showing something different than 1 year on the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Device section</a> of your Microsoft account, I recommend getting in contact with Xbox customer support and the hardware department should be able to help you with that.

                    I have a Sony VAIO &amp; have been using the larger battery (extended life) since I purchased it bout 3 years ago.&nbsp; I was always able to automatically switch from AC power to battery power by simply unplugging, or plugging computer into ac out let.&nbsp; And, I
 was always able to see the battery icon on left bottom of screen (taskbar) &amp; it would show % battery left.&nbsp; Now, suddenly, as soon as the power cord is unlugged the laptop shuts totally off, no reserve power at all &amp; I cant find the battery info. anywhere
 on the computer.&nbsp; Icon no longer appears in lower left corner &amp; when I go into power settings, the "Battery 1" icon is greyed out, so it looks like computer is not finding any battery.&nbsp; This happened so suddenly.&nbsp; Could the battery have just basically lost
 all power &amp; become non-existent to the computer, or is it a computer problem, not recognizing battery.&nbsp; Not sure if this is some setting I can fix somewhere, or if i need to have a

<p>yeah, most things made are cheaper to replace than to fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>but if the laptop seems to be running ok otherwise, it might simply be easier to see if there is a recall on the faulty battery or if it is still under warranty.&nbsp; also, sometimes you can add a little more memory to the old system and see some improvement
 with performance</p>
<p>on the other hand, replacing the laptop can be problematic because&nbsp;the old machine has all the programs installed on it,&nbsp;registered&nbsp;product keys and has accumulated years of personal files.&nbsp;&nbsp;and sometimes old costly programs will not function on newer versions
 of windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>so the hassle would be to bring the new machine up and running to the standards you have come to accept.</p>

<h2>            Sharing a folder in Windows XP to Everyone and giving specific permission to a particular user to a sub folder</h2>
                    Hi
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have two machines . Machine A [<i><b>Windows XP Professional - Servicepace 3</b></i>] and Machine B [<i><b>Windows 7 Enterprise]</b></i> and both machines are in the same domain. I shared a folder in
<i><b>XP machine</b></i> to Everyone with '<b><i>Read</i></b>' permission. This folder contains many sub folders and files. Now all the folders and files in the shared path &nbsp;are able read by all users from all machines. Now &nbsp;I need to give a
<i>delete permission to a &nbsp;particular user [Say user1] to a particular sub &nbsp;folder inside the shared folder</i>. For that &nbsp;i selected that particular folder and in security tab i added user1 and gave the full permission. I&nbsp;<b><i>logged in to windows 7 machine</i></b><i>&nbsp;
 as User1. </i>When i opened the particular folder [to which we have given full permission to the user1] &nbsp;using the shared path
<i><b>from Window 7 machine</b></i>, I am not able &nbsp;to do any modifications in that particular sub folder. It is saying "Acces Denied". I checked security tab of that sub folder again. It is saying that user1 having full security right in that sub folder. How
 i can overcome this situation?&nbsp;<i><b>I need to give specific permission to a subfolder in shared path to a particular user.&nbsp;</b></i></div>

            It sounds to me like you are doing everything right and it should work.&nbsp; I could only think of a couple of issues that might cause your symptoms.<br />
<br />
The first is that there might be a local user "User1" created on the XP or Win7 machine as well as the "domain/User1" user in the domain.&nbsp; The local and domain "User1"s would be recognized as two different users as far as file access is concerned.&nbsp; So when
 you set the file permissions, you would need to specify "domainname\User1" or "MachineA\User1" to differentiate the user and get the correct user.&nbsp; You may have already done this, but it is not clear in your description.<br />
<br />
The second is that there might be an pre-existing connection between Machine B to Machine A perhaps created by another user on Machine B.&nbsp; Windows will only allow a single concurrent authenticated connection between any given two machines.&nbsp; Before attempting
 the connection, you may want to verify that there are no existing connections by bringing up a command prompt window and entering the command:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net&nbsp; use<br />
This will show existing connections.&nbsp; Make sure to close existing connections before opening a connection with the User1 authentication.&nbsp; Another way to show current connections is to do the following on the XP machine:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-Click "My Computer" -&gt; Manage -&gt; System Tools -&gt; Shared Folders -&gt; Sessions<br />
This will show current active sessions connecting to the XP machine and the authentication.&nbsp; Make sure the "Guest" column does not say "Yes".<br />
<br />
In any event, I find that generally using the command prompt window generates better errors than the GUI when connecting to another machine.&nbsp; From Machine B, try bringing up a command window and connect to machine A using the "net use" syntax:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net&nbsp; use&nbsp; *&nbsp; \\MachineA\ShareName&nbsp; password &nbsp; /user:DomainName\User1<br />
(assuming you wish to connect with domain User credentials).&nbsp; If you omit the password, it should ask. If it has a problem, it should give you a descriptive error. (Caveat:&nbsp; I don't have much experience with Windows 7.&nbsp; I am assuming that the command line syntax
 hasn't changed much since XP)<br />
<br />
Hopefully some of the above will be helpful.<br />

<p>1. There is no local&nbsp;user named 'User1' in Machine A and Machine B</p>
<p>2. There was one pre-Existing connection from Machine B to Machine A. I&nbsp; cleared that connection.&nbsp; I used net use * /delete</p>
<p>3. I used net use \\machineA\ShareName /user:DomainName\User1&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The command completed sucessfully. It didnt ask for any password.</p>
<p>4. I cleared the "inheritable from parent" checkbox for that particular sub folder. [Tried in both ways, with that check box checked and unchecked]</p>

<br />
Wow,&nbsp; I duplicated your steps and was surprised when I had the same problem that you have.&nbsp; After a bunch of experimentation, I believe I've come up with a solution (at least it worked in my duplicated case).&nbsp; Apparently there are two "layers" of security at
 play here.&nbsp; One being the file/folder security level which you have correctly set to allow User1 to write/change things in the folder.&nbsp; The other layer is the networking security layer that is not quite so apparent.&nbsp; This is the layer that was set when you
 right-clicked on the top-level folder and selected "share this folder".<br />
<br />
The solution that worked for me:&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the top-level folder that you shared on your computer, right-click on it, and select:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing and Security -&gt; Sharing (Tab) -&gt; Permissions (button)<br />
In the screen that pops up, you probably show only&nbsp; "Everyone" with only Read permission.&nbsp; At this point, click on the "Add" button and in the screen that pops up, type in:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DomainName\User1<br />
then "OK".&nbsp; You will see User1 appear on the list.&nbsp; Click on User1 and then select "Full Control" in the bottom window, then "OK" your way out.&nbsp; This will not change any file or folder security on any item in the "Security" tab, but will allow User1 to make
 changes if the file/folder level security allows it.<br />
<br />
It worked for me... I hope it solves your problem, too.<br />

            <p>Hi Wunders</p>
<p>Sorry for this late reply. I tried your suggestions. It will work. But&nbsp;I have some doubts in this.
</p>
<p>1. If i give the full permission to User1 in Share, user1 will get the full permission to all folders under this shared folder. To restrict the permission to a particular folder, i need to go to that subfolder&nbsp;&nbsp;and deny the permission to user1.
</p>
<p>2. This will be more tedious if there&nbsp;are 100's of folders and more than 100 users.
</p>
<p>3. In windows7 it is very easy. Ie. What i did is that, i shared the folder&nbsp; to 'Everyone' with 'Read' only permission. Now all the users have only readonly&nbsp; permission. But if i added one user in any subfolder and grant edit permssion, that user will get
 the edit permission.&nbsp; If i want to deny the edit permission , just to remove the user entry from security tab[ by default&nbsp;'Everyone' have read permission].
</p>
<p>But in Windows XP, it is just opposite. I need to add 100 users [or Authenticated Users]&nbsp; while sharing the folder and grant full permission. Then to make all folders read only,&nbsp; i need to go to each folder and deny&nbsp; all permission execpt&nbsp; read permission
 to each user. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I dont know why this difference. I thought&nbsp;there will be some workarounds to make it&nbsp;like Windows 7.&nbsp;Any official microsoft &nbsp;documentation regarding the change in Sharing Security from Windows XP to Windows 7 ?. I coudnt find anything more specific to sharing
 security change. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Dominic</p>

            I don't think it's really as bad as you make it out to be.&nbsp; I'm not familiar with Win7 sharing, but it doesn't sound that far off from Windows XP sharing.&nbsp; What you could do (what I do) is to right-click on the top shared folder then select:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing and Security -&gt; <u>Sharing</u> (Tab) -&gt; Permissions -&gt;<br />
and then give "Everyone"&nbsp; Full control.&nbsp; This will give everyone the <i>potential</i> for full control, but you can easily dial that back with file/folder level security.&nbsp; One day you may want to add a "suggestion box" folder that everyone might need to write
 to and this would allow that.<br />
<br />
After you do the above, again right-click on the top level folder and select:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharing and Security -&gt; <u>Security </u>(Tab) -&gt; Advanced<br />
Then change the security such that "Everyone" has "Read Only" access.&nbsp; Eliminate other non-desired users/groups.&nbsp; Check the "Replace permission entries on all child objects...." box and click "OK".&nbsp; This will restrict access to everything in and under this
 folder to Read-only access to Everyone.&nbsp; Now you can go to a given lower-level folder and give a specific user added permission to that folder only.&nbsp; Avoid the "deny" permissions as it takes precedence over "allow" which is not usually what you want.&nbsp;&nbsp; This
 doesn't sound far off from what you say Win7 does.<br />
<br />
If there is a group of users that you want to give write permission to, you can create a "maintain" Group at the domain level, add those users into the group, and simply give that Group write permission where necessary...&nbsp; it eliminates the need to add tens
 of users to the permissions if they need to write a particular directory.<br />

    <title>Windows Media Will Not Record Due To Restrictions Imposed By Content - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Media Will Not Record Due To Restrictions Imposed By Content Provider</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>

<p>In the past I found Windows Media Center to be an extremely useful PVR device; however, recently I am starting to receive messages that advise that a scheduled recording did not occur because of restrictions by the content provider. &nbsp;I understand
 the rational for Microsoft implementing features that respect the rights of content providers and I don't have a problem with the concept. &nbsp;However, the implementation in Windows Media Center is extremely poor on two fronts.</p>
<p>First - the user should be advised that the software will not record a specific show at the time that the user submits the request to record. &nbsp;Or alternatively, the program guide should be annotated to let the user know in advance that scheduled
 recordings of a specific show will not be supported by Media Center due to the wishes of the content provider. &nbsp;In either case the user would be able to take action to either record the show using another means, watch the show as it airs, or simply know that
 they are out of luck for that specific show. &nbsp;It is extremely frustrating to find out after the fact that the software has let you down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Secondly - On&nbsp;occasion&nbsp;I have told Media Center to record a series. &nbsp;Often the show is only broadcast on one channel, and occurs at the same time five days a week. &nbsp;Sometimes Media Center records the show and other times it does not because of the
 wishes of the content provider. &nbsp;I'm not sure why the content provider would allow me to record Charlie Rose on Monday but not Tuesday. &nbsp;I suspect that something is not quite right.</p>
<p>These problems can be fixed by letting the user know in advance that a show will not record. &nbsp;As it is currently implemented the program is almost useless.</p>
<p>I would be grateful to hear the views of others on this limitation, and any advice for fixing or working around it.</p>

<p><span>Hi arty12,</span></p>
<p><span>If a broadcaster sets restrictions that prohibit a show from being recorded, Media Center can't record the show. Windows Media Center just takes
 the data that is provided by the content provider. Take a look at the following article under “What is copy protection and how does it affect me”. Also, you may get in touch with the content provider to know what they require to be able to record the content
 on the computer.</span></p>

<p><span>Also, have a look at the following article:</span></p>

<p>I understand from the article that the copy protection is broadcast with the show. &nbsp;I also understand and respect the broadcasters rights in this regard; however, there has to be some middle ground. &nbsp;Someway of windows media being made aware in advance,
 and by extension the user being made aware in advance, that windows media will not record a particular show so that appropriate action can be taken.</p>
<p>As it stands I can no longer use windows media for recording tv as the process is far too unreliable (between 25% and 40% of my scheduled recordings fail). &nbsp;Instead I am using the software that came with my tv tuner to serve this function, which has proven
 to be 100% reliable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the comment in your reply "i<span>f a broadcaster sets restrictions that prohibit a show from being recorded, Media Center can't record the show" - I think that the wording is
 not exactly correct. &nbsp;You really should have said that if&nbsp;</span><span>a broadcaster sets restrictions that prohibit a show from being recorded, Media Center has been designed NOT to record
 the show. &nbsp;I say this because, as I said above, I am now using other software that can record the shows that windows media will not. Also, tivos don't have this problem nor my dvd recorder. &nbsp;This is clearly something that Microsoft alone has implemented. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would be grateful if someone at Microsoft would send me an Email if they ever change the implementation of this feature. &nbsp;Until that time Windows Media Center will be another
 piece of operating system provided software that will remain unused by me.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wayne, if I read your posts correctly, your problem is not that you're being advised (in advance) that a show will not record; rather, you're being informed (after the fact) that the show did not record.&nbsp; Correct?<br />
The latter does happen; to the best of my knowledge, the former is not possible.<br />
Reason:&nbsp; there is nothing in the Guide data that tells MC if a show may or may not be recorded.&nbsp; Rather, MC simply respects the CGMS-A flag in the signal, should there be one.&nbsp; If it sees a CopyNever flag, it won't record (nor will you be able to even watch
 it live.)</p>
<p>Now, as to fixing your problem (because it is fixable):&nbsp; could you provide specs on your setup?&nbsp; What tuner card(s) are you using?&nbsp; Are you using a cable or satellite STB (set-top box)?&nbsp; If yes, how is the STB connected to the tuner?<br />
One common cause of erroneous copy flags is a flakey connection between STB and tuner card, which can introduce<em>just enough noise</em> that happens to look just like a CGMS-A flag.&nbsp; Quick fix:&nbsp; try a different video cable.</p>
<p>HTH,<br />
Chris</p>

<p>Hi Chris, and thanks for the response. &nbsp;Actually what I see if I happen to be on the computer doing something else at the time a recording is schedule is one of two things:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;either a red record icon in the System tray letting me know that the recording is in process; or</p>
<p>b. &nbsp;a warning letting me know that the recording will not happen because of the software is respecting the providers wishes.</p>
<p>If I'm not on the computer at the time of a failed recording I've also seen two things:</p>
<p>(i) &nbsp;a notice in the system tray like b above; or</p>
<p>(ii) no warning that a recording session failed, even though the show was not recorded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes when I catch the warning that the show will not record as the show is being aired, I tune my computer to the show and I am able to watch it live. &nbsp;Indeed if I push the record button while watching live, the software does record.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have two set ups and both have problems. &nbsp;On is a Dell XPS One desktop with an internal avermedia tv tuner. &nbsp;The second is an HP quad core laptop with an external usb Hauppage tv tuner. &nbsp;Both computers a connected to an analog cable signal (no STB).</p>
<p>Thanks for the info about it not being possible for the software to tell in advance that a show will not record. &nbsp;I suspect that you would agree that this limitation renders the software too unreliable to use; particularly when there are many other options
 available. &nbsp;I may be over simplifying matters, but as a Microsoft customer it appears to me that Microsoft is more interested in satisfying the broadcasters than the end user that purchased their software. &nbsp;Again, I must emphasize - I respect provider rights
 and I applaud Microsoft's attitude in this regard. &nbsp;However, I can't fathom how software with such a&nbsp;fundamental limitation can be released.</p>
<p>Cheers Wayne</p>

<p>Greetings Santosh and thank you for your assistance. &nbsp;I have learned from the replies to this posting that Windows Media Center (WMC) does not know at the time that the recording command has been submitted, whether the content provider will override the
 user's request to record an episode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In view of the above I am attempting to install alternative PVR software that can access an electronic program guide (EPG) for Canada. &nbsp;I already have other software that can perform the recording function; however, it is not connected to an EPG. &nbsp;I have
 selected MsDVR2005 software to replace WMC; however, when I try to run the MsDVR software it fails because it thinks I am running an old version of Windows Media Player (WMP) even though I am running WMP12 and Windows 7.</p>
<p>In hopes of resolving the problem I would like to uninstall/reinstall WMP but cannot access the software from the control panel uninstall screen. &nbsp;I would be grateful for advice on how to uninstall / reinstall WMP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks, Wayne&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Santosh,</p>
<p>Many thanks for the guidance. &nbsp;It did seem to do the job of disabling and re-enabling WMP. &nbsp;However, the alternative PVR software still thought that I was running a pre-version 7 of WMP. &nbsp;Long story short - no joy with the alternative software, and since
 the scheduled recording feature of Windows Media Center is so unreliable I think that it's time to go back to the old way of recording TV.</p>
<p>I have to say that I am extremely disappointed with Microsoft. &nbsp;It was the advertising of the media features associated with Windows 7 that enticed me to buy and install this operating System on my two computers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether you are a Microsoft employee, but if you are I would be grateful if you could escalate my views on this aspect of windows media center within Microsoft. &nbsp;Further, I respectfully request that someone from Microsoft management contact
 me with a view to&nbsp;explaining&nbsp;why the tv recording feature in this manner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Wayne</p>

<p>Hi, Wayne.<br />
Thanks for the key piece of information there - you're in Canada.&nbsp; Unfortunately, from what I've learned over at thegreenbutton from my Canadian comrades there, is that both Rogers and (particularly) Shaw are notorious for inserting CopyNever flags into all
 (or nearly all) programming.&nbsp; It would not surprise me one bit if other cable operators up there do the same.<br />
<br />
Media Center is simply respecting the flag (as improper as the flags' usage may be.)&nbsp; Hence, your issues with MC.<br />
In the U.S., what they're doing would be flat-out illegal (and, bring a very hefty fine from the FCC); however,&nbsp;your&nbsp;CRTC lacks in the power to press the cablecos to stop doing that.<br />
And, the cableco DVRs can record everything because, well, they're programmed to&nbsp;disregard the CopyNever (if not all) flags in the signal.&nbsp; It's been a problem for quite a few years now.<br />
The cablecos have no incentive (read:&nbsp; risk of fines) to discontinue the practice, and every incentive (read:&nbsp; lease out more DVR boxes, for more money in) to continue it.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Chris</p>

<p>Hi Chris, and thank you for shedding some light on the actions taken by our cable companies here in Canada. &nbsp;If what you are saying is correct (and I think that you are) I still must lay most of the responsibility for this debacle with Microsoft. &nbsp;For the
 past 3 weeks I have been installing software, removing software, reconfiguring software - all to try and make WMC work. &nbsp;During this process I have waisted countless hours and lost the opportunity to view many tv shows that did not record. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In my view:</p>
<p>a. &nbsp;WMC should let the user know when they schedule a recording that content provider rights will prevent the software from recording. &nbsp;Instead it posts the message that the program will record.</p>
<p>b. If Microsoft cannot or will not do this, then as a minimum they should let Canadian users know that the recording function is unreliable. &nbsp;It's simply not acceptable for Microsoft to sit on the sidelines offering suggestions to solve the problem, when
 they have good reason to think that their proposed solutions will not work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a final note, I am now using WinTV software from Hauppage, which has proven to be 100% reliable for recording scheduled recordings.</p>
<p>Regards Wayne</p>

<h2>            Dll file missing</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>So the last two weeks I keep getting the message during boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a problem starting winscomrssrv.dll</p>
<p>The specified module could not be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no pointing to any particular software that might be associated with the .dll file.</p>
<p>If I press OK the message goes away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i have tried is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eset internet security - Updated and scanned entire system and drives - No problems found</p>
<p>Malwarebytes - Updated and scanned entire system - No problems found</p>
<p>Sfc / scannow - No problems found</p>
<p>Restore health - No problems found</p>
<p>Registry - Search the entire registry and found nothing with that name.</p>
<p>Stopped - Deleted - Started services - All ok no problems (and no fix)</p>
<p>Google - Well it seems as its me and a polish guy that have this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So google pointed me to a polish forum where someone asked the same question, and the reply indicated that it might have been a virus that got removed and now im stuck with the message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case, any idea how i remove the message?</p>
<p>Any other ideas as to how to remove the message?</p>

            Hi ThomasG7 
<br />
<br />That is definitely left over from some malware that has been removed from your PC, the dll is not  recognized library, there must be some reference to that in your Startup processes - you need to remove that
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />With that utility, on the initial list and on the Logon Tab, look for any reference to winscomrssrv.dll, then right click and delete that reference . ..

<h3> residentevilout  say:</h3>
<h2>            Resident Evil Outbreak for 360&#47;One&#63;</h2>
                    



<p>As every RE fan knows, Resident Evil Outbreak was the first Resident Evil game with online play, and its only available for PS2. Capcom tried to revive the concept with Operation Raccoon City, but it never worked out as it bombed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I was thinking... would anyone here like to see an XBL release of this game with online support? I used to play this all the time back in the day and would think that being most games have online play, this would do rather well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(For those that never played it, check it out online. It basically was third person Left 4 Dead with locations from Resident Evil 2 and 3)</p>

<p>I played the first outbreak online only, on account to how File 2 shut down before File 1.
</p>
<p>I loved it, a very good game and the new online Resident Evil games could only wish they were as good. It was like Classic Resident Evil, but with online, and you could actually split up and if you get attacked, from another room the other person could hear
 you scream for help. </p>
<p>That was great. Its sad in the new Online Resident Evil games you are forced to have a partner follow you everywhere.

<h2>            Upgrade from Windows 7 or 8 to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Hi All,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am trying to upgrade from Windows 8 Enterprise 64 bit to Windows 8.1 Enterprise 64 bit. I logged in to Win 8 machine as Administrator. Inserted the Win8.1 DVD and invoked setup. I selected "Keep my files" option. Win8.1 installation was successful but
 I did not see my installed software when I logged in.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does Win8.1 remove all my software which was installed on Win8? And does the same happen if I upgrade from Win7 to Win 8.1?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>Arvind</div>
<div><br />
</div>
                </div>

<p>Enterprise must be different, because my 8.1 Pro has a "Keep Everything" option...</p>

<h2>            Taskbar and Maximized windows</h2>
                    Hello<br />
I've noticed strange thing. I use 2 monitors with extend view feature.<br />
Sometimes when I maximize window in primary screen (with taskbar) Window doesn't end at the top of task bar, but at the bottom of whole screen (window is behind taskbar).
<br />
<br />
I think it's a bug, but I haven't found any "Commit bug" section :)

            Hi Michael Borek,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's check if the system that is being utilized performs differently under the Windows suggested settings, rather then the currently set settings to verify the overall performance rate the hardware has for handling the OS.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
To do this follow these steps:<br />
<br />
Click <strong>StartORB</strong> - in the <strong>Search line</strong> type<strong> Performance Information</strong> - from the Programs list
<strong>click Performance Information and Tools</strong> - <strong>Click Advanced Settings</strong> on the
<strong>left side</strong> of the Window - Click<strong> Adjust the Appearance and&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;of Windows</strong>&nbsp; - from the<strong> Visual Effects Tab</strong> select the
<strong>Adjust for best Performance</strong> setting&nbsp;that is towards the top of the tab - click<strong> OK</strong>.<br />
<br />
Run&nbsp;in this setting for a while.&nbsp; Note the changes it effects the system by and try to document the changes it has into the post.&nbsp; Also, note whether the issue occurs while in this setting.<br />
<br />
It may be the drivers for your hardware components&nbsp;need updated.&nbsp; Although, Windows 7 tries to install drivers for as many parts as possible, the drivers -which change often- may not be the latest from the manufacturer's website.&nbsp; It is always best, after an
 install of the operating system,&nbsp;to follow through with installing the latest drivers for your components&nbsp;from the manufacturer's website.&nbsp;&nbsp;Driver's are designed to provide the best performance&nbsp;and handling of a component&nbsp;to perform optimally between the hardware
 and the software.&nbsp;&nbsp;Driver's, unless the hardware is Microsoft, are not authored by Microsoft.<br />
<strong>Note:&nbsp; </strong>
<div>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third
 Party Software is at your own risk.<br />
<br />
Try to install all&nbsp;your system component drivers so you have the best, at this time, performance available to your system.&nbsp; Some drivers you may look for include;&nbsp;&nbsp;Video Card Drivers, Network Card Drivers,&nbsp;any Hardware Vendor Suggested Drivers for you motherboard-Bios,
 Chipset, etc.-you may want to&nbsp;contact your hardware vendor, if under warranty, or if their support is available to you,&nbsp;for more suggestions involving that process.<br />
<br />
<br />
What we want to find, by changing the setting above, is&nbsp;a little about your configuration.&nbsp; This should assist us in reviewing what your system currently functions under at Windows suggested settings.&nbsp; This does not mean, this is the only settings your system
 is capable of, as was stated some of this may be video driver or other driver related.&nbsp; We understand the issue&nbsp;isn't constant in how it occurs, but, let's give opportunity to these steps to walk towards other suggestions if necessary.<br />
<br />
Please keep us advised involving this issue.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />

<h3> alanfoss_chorleywood  say:</h3>
<h2>            iCloud for windows - installation issues Windows 10, Windows Installer reports&#58; A program run as part of the set up did not finish as expected Contact your support personnel or package vendor</h2>
                    <p>Trying to install this has been a nightmare with a lot of time spent my microsoft support chat.&nbsp; After many hours I have finally got this to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this if you are having this error.&nbsp; I think the bottom line iCloud for windows is very flaky and when it fails an install it leaves a mess behind, and even the tools to remove "left behind files" do not find everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstall Windows 10 as a fresh install.&nbsp; (It may work from a RESET but not tested this but worth a go)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update Windows10 - DONT install anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install iCloud for windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I installed step by step the following.&nbsp; After each step I restarted windows and checked that the iCloud logon screen would launch and then closed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firefox</p>
<p>
</p><p>AVG Internet Security</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office 365, and setup/logged on Outlook2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then logged on to iCloud.&nbsp; It requested a repair run to enable Outlook, which I suspect was needed as Outlook was not present when iCloud for Windows was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all seemed to work, and is now up and running probably until the App is updated or otherwise gets in a mess with Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>You'll need to file a complaint on him via the console and block communications with him. The enforcement team will investigate from there. Calling out other gamers is not allowed on the forums.</p>

    <title>Why am I being constantly kicked off of my home internet&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> willdaddy09  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why am I being constantly kicked off of my home internet&#63;</h2>
                    I am using a 2010 Dell laptop and since the last year or so it has been getting kicked off of my parent's home internet for reasons I can't discern. I will be successfully connected to the network, but will be kicked off, seemingly at random, to the internet,
 but still maintain connection to the local network. I will disconnect and reconnect from the network and will have a small window of time where I will be connected again that will last anywhere from 2 minutes to 2 hours but will be kicked off, where I will
 then have to disconnect and reconnect to regain connection.&nbsp;
<div>I am a college student and have had no problems connecting and staying connected to the campus' network, friends' personal networks, or public networks (such as starbucks). &nbsp;No other laptop, desktop, gaming console, or smart phone have this sort of problem
 from my parents' home network. &nbsp;</div>
<div>I have been looking everywhere for a solution to my problem and have found other people have this problem but no one has been able to offer a permanent solution. Can ANYONE figure this out for me? &nbsp;</div>
<div>I am somewhat savvy when it comes to computers and I can tell you this much:&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is NOT the router nor modem. They have been replaced several times and to no avail. Not to mention that no other device has this problem on the network.&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is NOT my wireless connection, as I will connect an ethernet cable to my computer from the router and have the same outcome.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I THINK that it may have something to do with some sort of IP conflict between my laptop and modem? I'm not for sure but that seems to be the only reason people have given me for this problem. &nbsp;</div>
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you. </div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues with Windows 8.1 system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try the following methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try to boot the computer in safe mode and check, Please refer to the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or
 an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may
 temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the
 computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a
<strong>SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>
