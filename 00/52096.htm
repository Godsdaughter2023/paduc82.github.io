<h2>            Windows 10 - Taskbar Speaker &#40;Sound&#41; Button not working - Latest Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading (Update April 2018), the Speaker button in the Taskbar doesn't work at all, left click or right click both.<br />
I can't even adjust the loudness - nothing pops up when clicking the "Speaker" button.<br />
<br />
Can you please let me know whether there is any solution for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>VKSBK&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Martin
<br />
<br />Windows 11 is an Internet myth, there will be no Windows 11 
<br />
<br />When support for Windows 8 ends, Microsoft will re-brand Windows 10 to just Windows 
<br />
<br />The model Microsoft are using going forward is, twice yearly a new version of Windows (called a Feature Update) will be released. That feature update will include any new Functionality and features available for Windows and will deprecate older features 
<br />
<br />That way, once your PC is up to date, you will always have the latest version of Windows. This is something like the Office 365 model, with the one exception, Windows 10 feature updates are free and there is no subscription .

<p>Go to <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/06/22/reset-and-fix-broken-windows-vista-file-ext-and-type-associations-include-exe-com-sys-zip-lnk-folder-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/06/22/reset-and-fix-broken-windows-vista-file-ext-and-type-associations-include-exe-com-sys-zip-lnk-folder-drive/</a>&nbsp;and scroll to the EXE and LNK options and run both of them (one if for your files and the other is for your
 shortcuts and this will fix the file associations for them which is probably the problem here).</p>
<p>If that doesn't resolve the issue, then try logging in as another user and see if that user can use the desktop without problems.&nbsp; If so, there's probably something corrupt in your user profile.</p>
<p><span>To fix this use
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If that is the only available Administrator Profile (you need to be an administrator to fix this), enable the Hidden Administrator Account (HAA) using
</span></span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US&amp;guid=&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;dg=microsoft.public.windows.vista.administration_accounts_passwords&amp;p=1&amp;tid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055&amp;mid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US&amp;guid=&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;dg=microsoft.public.windows.vista.administration_accounts_passwords&amp;p=1&amp;tid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055&amp;mid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055</span></span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If you can't remember the password, try nothing as that's probably what you (or the vendor) did during installation.&nbsp; Once done, be sure to deactivate the HAA to save it in case it's needed again and for security purposes (since people often try to hack into
 systems using this account).&nbsp; Do NOT use the HAA as your administrator account because if you lose the only administrator account on the system or it becomes corrupt again then you are hosed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I assume your mouse works find
 clicking and scrolling on other screens and folders so we can rule out the mouse as the problem.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you can't use the desktop with the other user either then we may need to try some general troubleshooting techniques to try to locate and
 resolve the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>===================================================================================================================</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make
 the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted,
 push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a><span>&nbsp;along with burning software like:
</span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</a><span>&nbsp;and, of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32.&nbsp; Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It may want to schedule itself to start at the next startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Agree and then reboot so the program can run. It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning desktop (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools /
 Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>.
<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work (or if SFC finds corruption it cannot fix), we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Although this will not affect your data,
 settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had
 to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Nash,</p>
<p>To narrow down the issue, I’d like to collect the following information:<br />
1.&nbsp;Regarding “<em>it failed to open as it disappear after clicking on it</em>”, do you mean it crashed when you double-clicked to open it? Can you please provide more information about the situation for our understanding?<br />
2.&nbsp;The version of Skype for Business.<br />
3.&nbsp;Does the issue occur to any other users in your organization?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please re-install the Skype for Business on your PC. You can&nbsp;refer to&nbsp;the article below for the detailed steps:<br />

<p>Digging a little deeper, it appears that "catalog.wci" is connected to the Windows&nbsp;Indexing service rather than System Recovery.&nbsp; The following article is for a Server-2003 but is close to your error:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; "The indexing service does not index documents...."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/954818/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/954818/en-us</a>&nbsp;&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might try some of the suggestions in the following article (which talks about Windows 2000, but at the end says it applies to Windows XP as well)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; "How to create and configure catalog for indexing"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308202/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308202/en-us</a>&nbsp;&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't use Windows Indexing very much, you might just try to turn off the Indexing Service.</p>
<p>The instructions for turning the Indexing service off are in this article:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; "Windows XP may run slowly and you may see multiple symptoms...."</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <strong><span>Step 1:</span>
</strong>
<p><span>Please check the log files for the setup in order to analyze if the installation is stopping.</span></p>
<p><span>To analyze the log file please refer to the link below:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744583(WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744583(WS.10).aspx</span>
</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span>
</strong></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to do a clean boot on your current operating system and then find out whether you current operating system can run
 a windows upgrade compatibility advisor.</span></p>
<p><span>Clean Boot will help you start your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether
 a background program or any of the third party service is interfering with your program.</span></p>
<p><span>To perform clean boot, please follow the steps below.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start on your Desktop</span></p>
<p><span>2. Type msconfig in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Continue. </span></p>
<p><span>3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable
 All.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>7. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>To return your computer back to normal boot:
</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start on your Desktop</span></p>
<p><span>2. Type msconfig in the Start Search box and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click the General tab.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>5. When you are prompted, click Restart to restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>For information on using “Clean Boot”, see the following Microsoft Article:</span>
<span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</span>
</p>
<p><strong><span>Step3:</span>
</strong></p>
<p><span>Also find out whether your current operating system can run windows upgrade advisor.</span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To know more about the windows upgrade compatibility advisor, please refer to below links:

            Thought I was haveing the same problem just now.&nbsp; It stayed at 86% during the gather files portion of the install for over an hour&nbsp;but I decided to have another cup of coffee and be patient.&nbsp; Eventually it moved past that and is now completing the install.

            Hello Benji26,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your post. &nbsp;I understand that you have done all the updates, but what Service Pack are you currently running? &nbsp;To check:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Click 'Start' &gt; Right-click 'Computer' &gt; Select 'Properties'</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your current Service Pack will be listed. &nbsp;In order to upgrade to Windows 7 from Vista, it is recommended that your computer is running at least Service Pack 1 and preferred Service Pack 2. &nbsp;We look forward to hearing back from you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers</div>

                    I went into control panel and turned off every option possible about windows update yet my computer is still updating and there is no way once to update to tell it to update later instead it says save what you are doing because we are going to update your
 computer. This is VERY annoying because i use my computer at all hours of the day and don't want windows telling me when to update my computer by turning my computer off and forcing me to update. is there any way to turn off this option because if there is
 not any way to turn off windows update i'm going to have to switch to an OS that has a little more freedom then this OS.&nbsp;

You should switch because if you set the Windows Update to manual and you are still getting automatic updates - you didn't do it right (or you have a repeating update that never got installed properly.)<br />

    <title>files and settings lost after windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            files and settings lost after windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to windows 10 recently. &nbsp;Last night after an automatic update, my personalised settings had been lost and most of the folders and files on my desktop had disappeared. &nbsp;I found some of the files in C:\users\temp\desktop. &nbsp;I am pretty sure the temp
 user was not there yesterday. &nbsp;But some of my important folders were not there and after spending several hours searching my hard drive I can find no trace of them. &nbsp;Any ideas of what might have happened and where they might have gone?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Fresh Paint missing tools</h2>
                    The version of Fresh Paint at the Microsoft Store had a selection of tools, but the one on my Surface has only the brushes. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling and that didn't fix it.

So.. how does the schedule look these days? Will there be time to finish the porting of Fresh Paint anytime soon? As a guy in a related post pointed out: Fresh Paint might be quite a useful tool, but until the pencil and crayon (and how about pen?) tools are
 included, the app will be just a toy..<br />
<br />
Here's an alternative solution: Beg the guys at 53 to port their awesome "Paper" app to W8/RT! :)

<h2>            Skype Conference Call with Landline or Mobile Numbers from different Countries</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to have a conference call via Skype with landline/mobile phone numbers from different countries? In that case for example I need to include numbers from Holland, Belgium and France.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you need to purchase subscription's for the individual countries, then start calling one number and then just adding the other numbers as usual? Is there any other/cheaper way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help,</p>
<p>Johanna</p>

            Hi Johanna
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />The best for you would be to buy Skype credit which is applicable for all countries otherwise you will have to buy individual subscriptions.
<br />
<br />How do I purchase Skype Credit? - <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA570/how-do-i-purchase-skype-credit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA570/how-do-i...</a>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro Validation COA keys and Windows 10 Pro retail - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Validation COA keys and Windows 10 Pro retail</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Looking for a confirm on validation and coa key and Windows 10 Pro oem or retail version.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I bought a HP Refurb (500-539) from the auction site(Sept 2016).&nbsp; Originally W8pro, with an upgrade to W10pro.</div>
<div>
<p>First thing,&nbsp; after setting up,&nbsp; I noticed from Belarc, Ver ? ( build 10240).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I get an offer from Microsoft for the anniversary upgrade/update.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now,&nbsp; I have&nbsp; Version 1607 (build 14393.222).<br />
</p>
<p>Then&nbsp; I did the Windows Tool for the ISO&nbsp; and swapped out the installed HD with more GBs and did a clean reinstall.<br />
All,&nbsp; went smooth.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Now,&nbsp; I was curious about validation.<br />
I have the original coa key for Windows 8 Pro, sticker on desktop tower.<br />
I have a key ending with "3V66T",&nbsp; which shows up in key finders(ie..Belarc)<br />
I have a &lt;OA3xProductKey,&nbsp; which I found in the DiagReport.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Now, for oem or retail,&nbsp;&nbsp; I did a cmd prompt &lt;slmgr -dli&gt;</div>
<p>Description: Windows(R) Operating System, RETAIL channel</p>
<p>This is the only research option I could find to determine if oem or retail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if in fact I have a RETAIL OS,&nbsp; I know that the original key(W8pro), which this HP 500-539 started with is Not Valid and Void.</p>
<p>I know that the key ending with "3V66T" is ? ? maybe a generic key for upgrading to Windows 10?</p>
<p>So,&nbsp; the &lt;OA3xProductKey&gt;in the DiagReport must be my valid coa key?&nbsp; Which is tied to this HP 500-539 Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But,&nbsp; if&nbsp; I have a Retail OS,&nbsp; can't I load this OS on a different desktop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or,&nbsp; I can change out MoBos, hardware, software, with out losing my OS?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (note:&nbsp; only using 1 operating pc at one time)</p>
<p>But,&nbsp; if I do carry this retail os to another desktop,&nbsp;&nbsp; would I have to use the &lt;OA3xProductKey&gt;? I think so?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            <p>The base qualifying license Windows 8 Pro OEM is tied to the hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

            <p>I guess what is throwing me into confusion is, &nbsp;both windows 10 pro applied to two of my desktops are showing Retail. &nbsp;One is from base OEM Builder windows 7 pro and the other is from HP Refurbished base windows 8 pro. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The base OEM Builder windows 7 pro desktop, windows 10 pro was applied for when the free windows 10 was being offered and loaded in Dec 2015/Jan 2016. &nbsp;Then I reversed back to 7 pro. &nbsp;With the copy of the ISO image that I executed then, &nbsp;used to convert
 back to 10 pro Sept 2016. &nbsp; During installation, which was successful, &nbsp;no key was asked for. &nbsp; The version was 1511(build 10586). &nbsp;Then I went to update, and now version is &nbsp;1607 (build 14393.321). &nbsp;At no time during any installation was a key asked for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HP Refurbished Windows 8 pro desktop came pre-installed with Windows 10 pro, &nbsp;version ? (build 10240). &nbsp;Then I installed the update and now is version 1607 (build 14393). &nbsp;Which during update, no key was asked for.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, &nbsp;I am aware of the fact that Microsoft has embedded info to validate operating systems, &nbsp;and at some instances, &nbsp;keys are not necessary.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then on both desktops, &nbsp;running cmd prompt slmgr /dlv, &nbsp;both show</p>
<p>Description: &nbsp;windows(r) operating system, Retail channel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that Retail could transfer to (applied to one machine at a time only) another desktop(machine)?</p>

            Hi Jeb, sure you can turn off that feature . . .
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Privacy - Activity History
<br />
<br />Untick 'Let Windows collect my activities from this PC'
<br />
<br />Untick 'Let Windows sync my activities from this PC to the cloud'
<br />
<br />Turn off 'Show activities from accounts' 
<br />
<br />Then click 'Clear' to wipe any data already collected
<br />
<br />That's It!

            <p>Well, no this did not really help at all.</p>
<p>i navigated to the hotmail/ outlook page you indicated . There I did seethe gmail account in a box marked Outlook.com aliases; send only. There was the word "Details"</p>
<p>which did not offer a delete this account option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No where on the page did I see a " delete this account option" I could not get the cursor to highlight the text for a right click option to delected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Must be not doing something correctly</p>
<p>&nbsp;pleases check to see if there is a delete this account button. Otherwise, I will just live with it.</p>
<p>but, thanks for your time , BEnMz</p>

<p>Hey there XY Phobias,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It sounds like there is something with this monitor that needs to be changed to get this working, or at least a setting on the monitor that needs to be changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;You may need to ensure the console is plugged into the proper HDMI port on the monitor as only 1 HDMI input will support the HDMI 2.0 connection for 4K. Have you tried switching the HDMI port on the monitor and ensured the proper settings are selected on the monitor to support the feature?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may want to reach out to Samsung support as well for this issue, since we know the console is outputting video in this case (if switching the port doesn't work).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have bought a new laptop and want to set it up with a new Microsoft Account profile for my wife. Is it possible to do this but still have direct connection to one drive, email, apps etc...&nbsp; The only way I can see to do this is to setup her account as
 a local and sign in to my account. But as soon as this is done my settings(including profile photo, wallpaper etc). Does this seem correct?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, there is no option to share a User Account. The only option you have is to create a new user account and give the permissions under the family and other user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under family and other user in Settings, you can add and give the permissions/privileges to the user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want more information you can refer to the Microsoft help article.</p>

<h2>            IOMEGA SCREENPLAY DX HD Media Player W7 and W8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a local network based on a router 1 Desktop XP and one laptop W7.</p>
<p>At that time Screenplay worked fine with Desktop XP. I could connect with no User and PWD and had access to all media files on XP.
</p>
<p>The screenplay has 2 items starting menu: "VIDEO DOSSIERS PARTAGES" and "VIDEO MULTIMEDIA SERVER".</p>
<p>I used only VIDEOS DOSSIERS PARTAGES and it worked with no password at all.</p>
<p>Recently I upgrated my Desktop to 8.1 and nothing works anymore:</p>
<p>* Installation CD not compatible with W8</p>
<p>* not able to connect the PC: User and Password required? (which ones)</p>
<p>* the only thing I'm able to do is working with Laptop on W7 by simulating as a media server with no stability in files and directories.</p>
<p>* If I go straight to "VIDEO DOSSIER PARTAGES" on both PC's a User/Pwd is also required?</p>
<p>The only way to use the Screenplay is with USB keys.</p>
<p>How can we get an installation CD compatible W8? How can solve the problem?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your reply.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

    <title>intel rapid storage technology - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> give me win 7  say:</h3>
<h2>            intel rapid storage technology</h2>
                    <p>I am running a Dell XPS 8300 desktop with raid 0 hard drives. As many other users have noted the program IAstorDataSvc eats up about 30 percent of my cpu resources at idle on the desktop. (I upgraded to Win 10 assuming this problem would eventually be solved,
 &nbsp;and now it is too late to revert to Win 7.) This *did not* happen with win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any solution to this problem other than just turning off the service? I tried that, and the computer worked properly for a while, but then started not loading assets properly in a resource intensive game I am playing, Fallout 4. Turning the service
 back on restored the game to loading assets properly, but the high cpu usage is back and causes the game to use 100% cpu and stutter. Additionally, when at idle, the cpu is running at max turbo instead of downclocking as it should, obviously leading to excessive
 power usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a *very* frustrating problem, and needless to say I wish I had never installed Win 10. However, as I said, apparently I have waited too long, and there is no longer an option listed to restore to Win 7. Unfortunately, I did not create a backup before
 converting to Win 10. My most recent backup is from several months ago. I have been to the intel and Dell websites, and they say all my drivers are up to date.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi Kiarra,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So since when are you facing the issue? Is your Windows updates up to date?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please try the below methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Check the <strong>System Date and Time</strong> on your computer. If they are showing incorrect values, then follow the steps below and correct the time and date according to your time zone.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + R key</strong> on your keyboard</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type “<strong>Control</strong>" and click on "<strong>Date and Time</strong>".</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click <strong>Change date and time</strong> button (To change the time zone click on time zone tab).</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong> to save the date and time.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> Also place the computer in clean boot state and try to access Windows store.
<span>Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications/drivers or startup items are causing the issue.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer the article and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, follow the section

<p>My problem began when I installed windows 10 on a brand new SSD. &nbsp;My old drive had bad sectors and I was unable to clone my old drive on the new one due to bad sectors. &nbsp;So instead I just installed windows 10 using a boot flash drive. &nbsp;But the store and
 a few other features did not work after install and all gave me the same error as in the screenshot above. The only difference is the CV line was different with each attempt but the error was always the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only difference I can see right now over my last install is that I noticed my login no longer tied to my Microsoft account by email but instead its more like windows 7 where you login by username and password stored on the local system. &nbsp;When I upgraded
 my old system to windows 10 I remember the setup specifically making me setup a Microsoft account tied to an email but when I installed this new fresh install on a blank disk that never happened. &nbsp;I do not know if this has anything to do with the problem or
 not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried every suggestion above myself with the same results as the original poster. &nbsp;Although the SFC is still running int he background right now but since this is brand new install on a brand new SSD I am not sure if its really going to find much.
 &nbsp;I would expect problems like that exist more on aged disks or older systems where file corruption has had more opportunity to occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the results:</p>
<p>Beginning system scan. &nbsp;This process will take some time.<br />
<br />
Beginning verification phase of system scan.<br />
Verification 100% complete.<br />
<br />
Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So any ideas of what else to check?</p>

            <p>I did find a solution but before I found it I realized I had several larger problems with my windows install and the Microsoft store was just a minor symptom. &nbsp;So let me explain so others might benefit if my situation is related to others out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically all the advise I got on all threads on all web sites I could find via google was wrong concerning my issue. &nbsp;But it probably applies to about 90% of most people who have issues with windows store. &nbsp; but for the rest of you you might want to know
 the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main reason my Microsoft store was not working was because my windows login was not linked to any sort of Microsoft account when it was created during the fresh install of windows 10 I was doing. &nbsp;Why this happened I do not know. &nbsp;Now when I tried to
 link my local account to my existing Microsoft login I completely failed. &nbsp;I have no idea why but every way I attempted to do this would result in failure. &nbsp;Like if I went into my user settings in control panel it had an option to add or create a Microsoft
 account but if I clicked on it I would only get a quick flash of a window popping up then disappearing instantly. I assume this was the window that would ask me for my email/pass or allow me to create a new Microsoft account. &nbsp;I tried everything and began
 searching around help forums for how to solve this problem but the only answers I was getting were telling me to delete the old local account and make a new one. &nbsp;This worked just fine. &nbsp;When you create a second account all it asks for is an email and nothing
 else. Its possible the email I put in matched an existing Microsoft account so the user creation program left it at that knowing it can get the password and other details when the new user tries to login the first time. &nbsp;And this what more or less happened.
 &nbsp;I switched to that account and it brought in all my info such as my name and other things as soon as I logged in. &nbsp;The only problem is I had spent days setting up the other profile after installing windows before now I have to do it all over again. &nbsp;Apparently
 there is no easy way to migrate a profile from one user to another on the same computer. &nbsp;Options exist for doing it from one computer to another but not between two users on the same computer..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow the short version off all this is if you have this trouble and none of the other advice seems to work check to be sure you are logging in with a Microsoft account and not a local account. &nbsp;If its a local account go into the control panel settings
 for your user and attempt to create or login to an existing Microsoft account and link it tot your profile. &nbsp;If this fails then you have your problem and the only solution is to create a new profile from the ground up using a Microsoft account then migrate
 your data over. &nbsp;This should help the rare 10% who do not have issues with their clock or conflicting software, or network setting issues. &nbsp;Its likely to affect those having trouble from the first minute after installation. &nbsp;If your store worked before but
 suddenly no longer does my solution is not likely applicable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So good luck and hope the people who read this thread are helped by my experiences.<br />

            None of this worked for me, but what did is hitting&nbsp;<strong>Windows + R </strong>
then typing <strong>WSReset.exe</strong> and hitting&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>. This will reset the Windows Store without deleting any installed apps or anything.
