            <p><span>Hi Ally,
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your issue description, I understand that the Apps are not working in your Windows 8 computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>If you do a refresh in your computer the apps that came with your PC or you installed from Windows Store will be reinstalled, but any apps you installed from
 other websites and DVDs will be removed. Windows puts a list of the removed apps on your desktop after refreshing your PC.<br />
So try to find out the folder which has the list of all the removes apps and try to install it once again.</span></p>
<p><span>You can refer to the article mentioned for more information about Refresh.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>How to restore, refresh, or reset your PC</span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>I suggest you to try to perform the trouble shooting mentioned below if the apps are crashing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Run the Modern User Interface App troubleshooter and check if it helps.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Please click on the link given, download the file save it and run the troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Step 2: Please go to the link given here and check if the issue gets resolved.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please go through the following link for troubleshooting.<br />
In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If the Store doesn’t notify you of the problem or you continue experiencing problems with an app</span></p>
<p><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>What to do if you have problems with an app:</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>·</span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>Which
 were the files you had deleted?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to boot the system in&nbsp;<strong>safe mode</strong> and check if the same error occurs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To boot your system in safe mode refer to the link provided below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you don’t face the issue in safe mode I would suggest you to perform, Clean Boot on your system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
 If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows
 Vista or in Windows 7:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</span></p>

                    I have a HP labtop with window 7, purchased in Dec. 2009. The window media player does not accept the AVR video format that I have been compressed. Anyone know what I can do?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>AVR (Audio Visual Research) - The Audio Visual Research file format, saved with the AVR extension, is an outdated Mac sound format that is no longer supported
 by many programs. You can use any third party converters to convert the files to the MP3 or WAV format and then try to play the files on the system. I would suggest you to use your favorite search engine and then find any third party converters and then convert
 the file.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Games won&#39;t start.</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes after updating a game it wont start. I don't get an error message either. sometimes the issue is resolved by reinstalling the game but i'm tired of having to download the whole games again after every few updates. Is there any way to fix this permanently for all games?</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>it might be looked at if enough people report the issue through the console. But most of the time a hard restart will fix the issue instead of uninstalling and reinstalling the games</p>

            <p>Hi. Please press and hold the power button on your console for 10 seconds to do a hard reset. Turn the console on and try again.
  </p>
<p>If that didn't work please navigate to the game under my games and apps and press the menu button and scroll down to saved data and select to delete all locally saved data. Your saved data will sync from the cloud once you open the game again</p>

            <p>Hello Denninz619, it is best for the console if you power cycle after each update before loading any games.&nbsp; You can try clearing your mac address in settings- network settings- advanced network settings to see if that helps.</p>

<h2>            Achievement list games vanish. Specifically The Witcher 3 Complete Ed.</h2>
                    <p>Oddly never seen this before, or at least haven't noticed, that games are not in the achievement list in profile. Ones that were but have vanished no where to be found. In particular the watcher 3 complete&nbsp;&nbsp;ed which I have over 75% achievement completion.
 Is gone. I noticed this on for sure as I'm still playing it, the achievements unlock still but that's it... funny,,, perhaps other games are&nbsp; over past 12 years, not really sure there, who knows,.&nbsp; hard resets, reinstalling game, profile, etc. Its gone...
 none of the regular fixes work... the watcher 3 standard ed that I played years ago is there.... weird... got feeling Microsoft will blame the witcher crowd and the witcher crowd will blame Microsoft..both will tell me to do the same old stuff to fix while
 neither really has a clue.any takers? The truth is out there... who did it... was it Microsoft, project red, Warner brothers, bell, Rogers, satellites, servers, mad authors looking for more dough, polish business..... stay tuned...</p>
<p>Whos gonna spill the beans?</p>

            Thanks but no its not on my end . Its something technical. The list was always there but is gone. Either Microsoft or project red issue. Maybe project red hasn't paid its achievement tax, or maybe it has something to do with a lawsuit, but its gone. Most
 likely its a programming conflict the techies unknowingly created..no one knows... few care... but I'm aware.... something's broken... ill keep checking.... but this by far has not solved the problem... same old cliché....I don't know is a better and more
 dynamic answer.

            This may or may not have something to do with it. Achievements were not unlocking in the game... so it was a common problem I found out...and in order to get the said achievements to pop I had to alternate my mac address, go to an earlier save and redo
 for the pop... that worked for the achievements... maybe for some reason you can't have both...you either have the list with unobtainable achievements or the achievements with no list... its peculiar... internal no doubt.... not entirely sure if that's when
 it disappeared,, but hey I'm just pondering

            frig it..no one knows. But know this Xbox you achievement list is now deemed unreliable and incomplete. Perhaps it will magically reappear when someone&nbsp; trips over a data cable..but in the mean time...im not the only one with this issue...and apparently
 other titles have gone missing too...I don't like it.... it doesn't seem to be a priority... but like I said the achievement list is incomplete and&nbsp;&nbsp; therefore obsolete in its task... to record all acftivity....i'm just gonna stop playing the witcher 3 and
 avoid cd project red games and any others that fall into the achievement void... broken achievemts is common but missing from list is bizarre

<p>Hey StelarDag,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be happy to provide some input. Have you checked <a href="http://www.trueachievements.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>Achievements for Witcher 3 or the GOTY edition have been a little unstable for a while now and is technically a known issue by the community as there are a number of others that have achievement issues not showing up correctly on their profile&nbsp;for this game
 specifically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I replied to another <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/el-%c3%baltimo-juego-jugado-ha-desaparecido-de-mi/d2805d69-ec79-4f81-846f-8cfa86461c41">

            Not that I'm aware of the broken achievements and how to force them through... this is different, the game is playable, the achievements are obtainable, they pop, and you can see them in the little side tab progress tracker.... all systems go.... bugged
 or not.... this is directly linked to Xbox profile achievement list ....the one that's been there since 2005...tracking your achievements and percentage completion... my first game was call of duty 2 and cameo.... you know the forever achievement list......
 the game has vanished..... it was there for the longest time..... is gone... its not there......kameo and call of duty 2 are still there with hundreds of other games... but not this one.... this problem is unique.... its as if I've never played the game or
 got any achievements at all.....I can accept bugged achievements all day long.... but this is going to require a different answer than the usual

<h2>            Windows 8.1 BIOS OEM Product Key blocked - reason for blocking and how to fix it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello and thank you in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon resetting my Windows 8.1 Pro&nbsp;laptop to&nbsp;its factory settings after a year of use, its activation status was lost and I was unable to re-activate. The system is reporting the key as blocked, even though it's the pre-installed BIOS OEM key and has only
 been used on this laptop.</p>
<p><strong>Question 1a - why was my key blocked?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Question 1b - can I fix it without paying for a new one?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Backstory:</p>
<p>The laptop model is Dell Precision M3800 - I got it from Dell in May 2014. Everything worked great until I decided to upgrade to a Windows 10 Insider Preview build through the Microsoft website a few weeks ago. The upgrade had some critical errors, so I
 refreshed the system. Then used Dell's recovery software to restore the system to factory condition from the pre-installed factory image, dated May 2014 (some time before I got the laptop).</p>
<p>Since then, the Windows 8.1 Pro reported that it was not activated and prompted me to activate every so often. Phone activation through SLUI 4 didn't pass, ended up being routed through support departments. Since then I refreshed, restored and ever reinstalled
 Windows 8.1 using a "clean Windows" DVD I got from the MS webpage. While they all reinstalled correctly, none of them were activated.</p>
<p>I used a third-party program called NirSoft ProduKey to retrieve my BIOS OEM key and tried to activate Windows that way. It always failed (during all of the mentioned installation scenarios), due to error
<strong>0xc004e016</strong>, and most recently <strong>0xC004C003 </strong>(reported as blocked key by activation servers).</p>
<p>I installed Windows 10 from the media creation tool once build 10240 was out, hoping that the key was somehow "upgraded" to a Windows 10 key during my Insider Preview upgrade back a few weeks ago, but that was still unactivated, with the SLUI + phone activation
 method still failing, and the BIOS OEM key rejected as well.&nbsp;Since then I have&nbsp;restored&nbsp;the Windows 8.1 Pro factory image again. I have a hunch that the upgrade to Windows 10 is related, because when I log in to my account through the Microsoft website, my
 Dell laptop shows up on "My Devices" with Windows 10 10240 attached to it, but a system-generated computer name, as if belonging to that old build. Just a hunch though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is additional information about my BIOS OEM key, extracted using another third-party tool. Redacted some parts.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Product Key<span> </span>: [XXX]-J8D32<br />
Profile<span> </span>: C:\Windows\System32\spp\tokens\pkeyconfig\pkeyconfig.xrm-ms<br />
Validity<span> </span>: Valid<br />
Product ID<span> </span>: [XXX]-AAOEM<br />
Advanced ID<span> </span>: [XXX]-2112015<br />
Activation ID<span> </span>: [XXX]-7a3af6f0d987<br />
Edition Type<span> </span>: Professional<br />
Description<span> </span>: Win 8.1 RTM Professional OEM:DM<br />
Edition ID<span> </span>: [Blue]X18-95457<br />
Key Type<span> </span>: OEM:DM<br />
EULA<span> </span>: OEM<br />
Crypto ID<span> </span>: [XXX]</p>
<p>
</p><p>To sum up - the things I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refreshing the system from the troubleshooting screen; restoring it using the Dell utility, and reinstalling from a Windows 8.1 Pro DVD - multiple times.</li><li>Applying the BIOS OEM key I extracted from the system&nbsp;to all of those versions. Failed.</li><li>Trying phone activation through SLUI 4 on all of these versions. Failed, after explaining the problem got directed to contact Dell.</li><li>Contacting Microsoft support through phone and chat - failed to activate due to some error, advised to contact Dell.</li><li>Using all of the above on Windows 10 downloaded from the Microsoft website (clean install only, since upgrade is only possible for activated systems). No difference.</li><li>Contacting Dell - after 3 hours of support over phone the only solution they provided was to replace the motherboard and issue a new key, then charge me over a thousand dollars for it (I'm not kidding). Not an option.</li><li>Did the command slmgr.vbs trick to reset activation status. No dice.</li><li>Checking online
<p>Current situation: Windows 8.1 Pro installed from pre-installed factory image, unactivated, error 0xC004C003 (key apparently blocked). At this point, maybe I don't even expect a fix, but an explanation why the MS activation servers have decided to deprive
 me of an equivalent of $170. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Cheers!</p>

            <p>The problem here is that with an OEM machine like Dell, the product key is located in the BIOS although the latter has all but been replaced by UEFI.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you run a recovery, the software retrieves the product key from the BIOS which obviates the need to place a sticker containing the key to the outside of the laptop. It's also a means of reducing fraudulent installations where the product key can be
 stolen or copied. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This site deals with activating Windows for the different versions of Windows:

<p>
</p><p>By the sound of it though, you already went through that process. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, your best bet might be to call Microsoft again, but do it via the steps in the following post marked as
<strong>Answer </strong>in the following thread: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/says-windows-8-isnt-activated-after-refreshing-my/d7ce96db-fb97-4339-a335-81d4a7161060">

<p>
</p><p>Utilities like Nirsoft were only of any use when Windows 2000 was around and are next to useless these days since Microsoft has taken appropriate steps to prevent fraudulent installations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are a few other reasons why activation may fail: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-8/why-activate-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What might be worth your while doing is to contact Dell and get a set of original recovery discs. More info on that option here:

            <p>Xircal, thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indeed, I am familiar with what you have described in your post, including reaching a support person through ignoring the automated system (that was the first time when they declared that Microsoft can do nothing about it and redirected me to Dell). I am
 also familiar with the 'Why can't I activate Windows' article - unfortunately, nothing they described was relevant to my case. And regarding Nirsoft software, I have read reports that it worked for some people using Windows 8 OEM systems and having activation
 troubles. - so I wouldn't cross it out. Who knows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have not yet considered the recovery disc option from Dell.</p>
<p>I followed your link and my only option of contacting them to ask about the replacement media is to phone them during Mon-Fri office hours. On Monday, I will ask them if:
</p>
<p>1) replacement media can work in my situation even though the pre-installed recovery partition didn't, as well as
</p>
<p>2) inquire about P&amp;P cost of the recovery media and compare it to a new Windows key from the MS store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you Xircal! I will be back with updates.</p>

            <p>This might work! Download this tool which purports to be able to retrieve the Product Key from the BIOS:

</p><p>It was mentioned in a troubleshooting post by one of the moderators on this forum, so perfectly safe. You'll find a reference to it in the fifth post down in this thread:

            <p>Xircal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tool you linked to has the exact same purpose as ProduKey, and even displayed the same -J8D32 key to me.</p>
<p>Like I wrote before, this key displays the error 0xC004C003, and upon re-entering produces the message: "This key didn't work, please check it and try again, or try a different key." This is all described in the first post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read this solution worked for some people (re-entering the retrieved key after system installation), but it didn't for me.</p>

            <p>Pity. Sounds like Microsoft blocked it from working. </p>
<p>
</p><p>See if the Answer in this thread helps. The problem and OS is the same as your own:

<p>
</p><p>Contacting M$ would seem to be the way to go though since you do have a valid product key. Your error appears in the second box down here and is the so called MAK type:

            <p>Thank you Xircal, this is the first time MAK comes up in the subject. I just called Microsoft explaining the most recent findings and somehow got them to ask my for my product key (finally!) - I was informed that my key had been blocked because it was
<strong>abused </strong>(???) - that's as much as they could tell me. They gave me 2 options:</p>
<p>1. Contact Dell support and approach them from a different angle, telling them my OEM key got blocked for no good reason;</p>
<p>2. Go to howtotell.com (operated by MS) and resolve it from there. At least that's what the phone consultant told me - the website seems actually useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say, I didn't give the key to anyone else, or use it to install anything on any hardware apart from the laptop I got it from. The first post describes pretty much everything I've done to it since taking it out of the box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't look like I can do much more on the Microsoft side of things. I'll need to contact Dell somehow, and that's easier said than done, but I think I have a number which worked. This didn't seem as relevant before, but now I must mention that I got
 this laptop for free. It was brand new out of the box, and I got it on a business trip to the US after speaking to Dell representatives. They wanted me to have a unit of their new mobile workstation model, since they thought I'd be able to make good quality,
 creative things with it. So, there's a non-zero chance that this one came from a different batch than the ones meant for retail, and maybe they were activated in some a different way? Volume Licensing maybe? I'm throwing guesses here.</p>

<p>It might be a good idea to download the free version of Malwarebytes and run a full system scan just in case you have malware lurking somewhere which copied your product key.

</p><p>I use it myself and was lucky to be able to purchase a lifetime license to the Premium version for the princely sum of $23 before they switched to an annual subscription model. :)</p>
<p>

<p>I had a developer license on my main Dell workstation, so I decided to do a reset to the original Windows 7 SP 1 Pro OEM disk that came with the system and take advantage of the free upgrade. So I completely wiped the disk and installed 7.1, then Windows
 10 _from_ a USB drive created via the Insider site.</p>
<p>I kept getting error&nbsp;0xC004C00 (activation code is blocked).</p>
<p>I tried tons of things from the net... reinstalled 5 different times, tried to use slmgr.vbs... I was seriously considering bringing it up under Linux (I use virtual box for VMs and really only use Windows because RDP is a superior way to remote in).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I saw a pattern in what was going wrong in all the messages on the Internet about this problem. Basically everyone was using a USB drive or DVD with the ISO. But most do not have this problem.... well in my case there was an important problem...
 the 7 SP 1OEM disk did not have ethernet drivers, for the (at the time) brand new Intel chipset.... as I was upgrading anyway, I didn't bother to install them. THAT seems to be the problem.... as part of the upgrade process, the Windows 10 upgrade checks for
 available hot fixes... with no connectivity it could get these patches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what worked for me:</p>
<p>I installed 7 SP 1</p>
<p>I installed the ethernet driver and established connectivity.</p>
<p>I then updated it fully (200+ packages... "conveniently" package in 7 different sets).</p>
<p>Then I did the upgrade from the USB key...</p>
<p>it worked first shot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note, it is my guess the updating wasn't necessary, the real problem was was likely that Windows 10 needed to download the hot fixes to its process.</p>

            <p>Thanks Xircal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a full scan using Malwarebytes and my system is clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just phoned Dell regarding this (had to phone twice because I strangely lost the call mid-support), and managed to push the matter a little further. I was handed the e-mail address to the phone assistant's superior. Explained my problem and now awaiting
 reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation is further complicated because the Dell website constantly pushes you away from any contact options once it figures out you're out of warranty. Every now and then people on the phone bounce me back and forth between the American Dell (where
 I got the laptop) and the Polish one (where I reside tight now). And upon any request that I transfer my ownership from USA to PL, I cannot complete the online for because the system rejects my Dell Service Tag due to some error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not yet asked about the recovery media, I will wait for Dell's e-mail response first.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply bSturg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand how I can apply it to my case, though. At no point during my struggles did I have issues with connectivity. My drivers, supplied together with my Windows 8.1 Pro factory image, worked flawlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, remember that I cannot upgrade my system to 10, because this is only allowed for already activated systems. The only way for me to install Windows 10 is through a clean install, so the drivers and the upgrade path become irrelevant. And as far as I
 know a clean install of Windows 10 will not let me upgrade my 8.1 key to a legit 10 one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps it works different with Windows 7, but that is a different case from mine.</p>

            <p>Hey Ehensel</p><p><br /></p><p>Do you have both consoles plugged into the same router? It could be that your router doesn't support this and causing the unavailable NAT type. I would unplug everything for the router /modem and console leave it 10 mins then boot the network up leave for 5 mins then boot up one console and check your NAT type running a test conntion then a test multiplayer to force a new connection and refresh the NAT. &nbsp;If its still a issue then there is a helpful troubleshooting guide here &nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution</a> .</p><p><br /></p><p>If you like this post or it helped you then upvote it&nbsp;</p><p>Xbox Ambassador<br /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this error displayed even after you restart your PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;The "Remote procedure call" error might be displayed when a service called upon by Windows is not responding. If you have already restarted the PC and yet see this error message, I would recommend you to boot the computer in Safe mode and check if the issue
 persists. You can follow the steps suggested in this article&nbsp;to boot the computer in Safe mode:</p>

<h2>            touchpad and keyboard suddenly stopped working</h2>
                    the touchpad and keyboard suddenly stopped working a few seconds after the computer starts. i did a system restore and it worked well for a few hours before it stopped working again. im not sure if this is because of the windows 10 updates. i mean, do
 i need to perform system restore everytime it happens? are there any ways to solve this permanently?

<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire Free Premium trial</h2>
                    I logged into the desktop version of Microsoft Solitaire for the first time and it automatically started a week of free premium as a trial. Is there any way to get rid of it? I never play on my desktop so I would rather save it for when I actually will
 play. This should be an opt-in service...

    <title>Network Drive name problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mpd01605  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network Drive name problems</h2>
                    First, I'm using a laptop with Vista Enterprise SP1.<br />
<br />
I have two hard disks connected to an Apple AirPort Extreme wireless router, the latest one.&nbsp; They are given two different names that I configured when they were connected to my computer- NHD-1 and NHD-2.&nbsp; In the AirPort Utility (where you set up the router),
 they show up correctly as "NHD-1" and "NHD-2" (See <a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3570/3478184886_e0e0bc7ba6_o.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Picture 1</a> ).&nbsp; On my friend's MacBook, they are displayed as such, and on my XP computer, when first mapped, the drives show up as the typical name with the network path but those are easily renamed so that's not a problem.<br />
<br />
The problem is on my Vista machine.&nbsp; In Computer, both drives show up, and I can connect to them fine, but they have the same name(i.e. "NHD-1 (X:)" and "NHD-1 (Y:)").&nbsp; Whenever I try to rename one, the other is renamed the same.&nbsp; The drive letters are still
 different (X and Y), but Vista won't rename just one.&nbsp; X is associated with NHD-1 and Y is associated with NHD-2.&nbsp; I can rename one of them anything and it renames the other in Computer.&nbsp; The problem is on Vista's end and I don't know how to fix it (WITHOUT
 choosing "Map network drive" and choosing "Connect to a website...etc etc etc"- that's a workaround, not a solution).&nbsp; See
<a href="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3598/3478184876_73247b1e2d_o.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Picture 2 here</a> for what Computer looks like.&nbsp; There is nothing under the "Properties" of the drive that lets me change it.&nbsp; When connecting, I still need to type the correct drive
 name (i.e. "\\Galactica\BOBBY NHD-1" or "\\Galactica\BOBBY NHD-2"), but then after connecting to whichever I do last, it renames the first, but still connects to the correct drive.<br />
<br />
The router is not the problem, the drives are not the problem.&nbsp; Vista is the problem.&nbsp; How can I get it so I can name two mapped network drives differently?&nbsp; It's just a naming problem, but I've searched high and low and haven't found this problem anywhere
 else to help me.

<p><span>Hello, MPD01605</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for using the Answers Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>You could try disconnecting both of the drives, and reconnecting them. Go to Start, Computer, Right click on the network drives (X and Y) and choose Disconnect.
 After the two drives are disconnected, click Map Network Drive, Choose your drive letter, and manually enter the network path (<strong>\\Galactica\BOBBY NHD-#</strong>) and press Finish.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if the network drives display correctly or not.</span></p>

<p>I'm&nbsp;seeing the same symptoms MPD01605 describes. Disconnecting and remapping, like David recommends, doesn't resolve the issue.<br />
<br />
I'm using&nbsp;Vista Ultimate on a laptop.&nbsp; When I&nbsp;map two different drives they both show up with the same name but have the contents of their respective mapped drives. If I rename one Vista renames the other. I tried disconnecting and remapping but get the same
 problem. I also tried&nbsp;running "net use * /DELETE /YES" from a command prompt. I get a message back saying all mapped drives have been removed but upon remapping the drives I see the same names.<br />
<br />
Glad to know I'm not the only one seeing goofy stuff in Vista...</p>

<h2>            Absolutely frustrated - no way to speak to anyone</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to speak/chat to an operator about my support ticket but I could not even find the link to do so! Absolutely frustrating! I click on 'Contact Support' and every single option just leads to the same US Contact Page; when I try to call the
 local number, they give me options that don't apply to my situation!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, a few months ago, Microsoft sent an email to me regarding a voluntary recall of my Surface Pro 3 charger. Since my charger was really not working, I registered for the replacement. Last month, they sent to me an email saying that they have shipped
 my charger, provided me with a tracking number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it has been a month and I've not yet received the charger, I tried to check the status of the tracking number they provided me (which, coincidentally, seems to be the same as my support ticket number). But it appears that the tracking number is invalid.
 However, I have no channel to communicate to anyone at Microsoft!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting desperate as I could not use my surface pro 3 and I do not want to buy a new charger when I am supposed to get a replacement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate if someone can point me in the right direction. Thanks!</p>

                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been experiencing countless BSOD, a different message every time, ever since I upgraded my machine to Win 10 (win7 previously). I have updated all the drivers to their most recent versions, performed memory tests, disk tests and, win10 troubleshooter
 tool. The diagnostic tests all came back with no errors to report. I have uploaded my mini-dump file in the one drive link below. Would really appreciate some help here, as I am writing my PhD thesis.... having to deal with occasional BSOD while trying to
 meet deadline is extremely frustrating. The last episode happened while editing a figure on Adobe illustrator with chrome and spotify running at background.</p>

<h2>            Surface Book 7 &#40;windows 10&#41; and Bernina Software 7 issues</h2>
                    I Had a very difficult time getting familiar with Bernina 7 (first time user too) on my new surface book. The buttons were microscopic, the surface was apoplectic, the pen was useless, I was having a panic attack because I had dropped $$$$ on all this
 and wasn't getting what I wanted out of them. And there wasn't much in the way of help here, so I thought I'd let you know how I got it all better. (I'm soo happy!!) I drove all the way to the Bernina shop and gave the nice lady there a piece of my headache
 and we worked it out. Ok so my problem was screen resolution, primarily. the resolution on my surface is 3000x2000 and B. software 7 was designed to run at 1024x768. Changing the resolution fixed it up mostly, but running simultaneously in 2018 and circa 2013
 was giving my surface the fits so I gave my bernina software a dedicated user account and downloaded Carroll to automatically select the ideal resolution environment as I move between accounts to get the work done :) I'm so glad I

            Have you been able to use the pen at all in the Bernina software? &nbsp; I'm looking into getting a new computer to run my V7 and design works on. &nbsp;If the pen is able to be used like a mouse with making stitches and so on I &nbsp;would love to get the surface book.

            The 'safest' way would be to convert the video first.
<div>
<div><span>Have you tried converting the source video to WMV, composing in Windows Movie Maker and then exporting to MP4?</span></div>

<div>
<div>Anyway.. Here's a link to Klite codecs; it supports the codec you are requesting.</div>

================================== <br />
Sorry, I don't know the <u>"most efficient, quickest <br />
and best way"</u> but will try to offer some ideas.<br />
<br />
Which version of Windows are you running? <br />
<br />
If you can download the video to your hard drive...<br />
converting to the .WMV format before importing <br />
into Movie Maker should improve the issue.<br />
<br />
I have my doubts that the following article would <br />
be useful but it may be worth a look:<br />
<br />
How to Import Videos into Windows Live Movie Maker<br />
<a href="http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-import-videos-into-windows-live-movie-maker.navId-323836.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-import-videos-into-windows-live-movie-maker.navId-323836.html</a>
<br />
<br />
There are many video converters available on <br />
the net...some free, some retail, some better <br />
than others.<br />
<br />
The following freeware&nbsp; is just one example that <br />
works well for me.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Freemake Free Video Converter (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/</a><br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8 / 8.1)<br />
(***Choose the Custom installation and carefully<br />
read *all* the install screens...there may be some<br />
items you want to uncheck***)<br />
<br />
If a green Install button appears when you launch<br />
Freemake...you can ignore it and it should disappear<br />
when you import files.<br />
<br />
To download the full version instead of using the <br />
web installer...see the following:<br />
<br />
Freemake Apps - Offline version<br />
<a href="http://www.freemake.com/offline/offline_all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freemake.com/offline/offline_all/</a><br />
(If you want to install Freemake freeware <br />
to your PC without the Internet connection, <br />
download these files)<br />
<br />
When you have Freemake installed...open Freemake <br />
and drag/drop your video files on the main screen. <br />
<br />
Or...Left click the Video button and Browse to the <br />
folder your video files are saved in. <br />
<br />
Select (highlight) the files you wish to import into <br />
Freemake and left click the "Open" button.<br />
<br />
When your video files are imported into Freemake,<br />
Left click the WMV icon at the bottom of the screen.<br />
<br />
The "WMV Output Parameters" screen will open.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Choose a "Save To" folder so you can find the <br />
converted files.<br />
<br />
Left click the "Convert" button and wait for the files <br />
to be converted.<br />
<br />
Good luck.....<br />

            Hi Larry,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your reply. &nbsp;I'm afraid I don't know how to convert my source video into a WMV since the PlayMemories Home is the only option my Sony Handycam came with. &nbsp;Why doesn't Sony let you record in normal MP3 or MP4 formats or at least give you the
 option? &nbsp;Is it proprietary software?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Guess I will have to download the codec, thanks for the link!</div>

            <div>As a suggestion for video converters, I have used all three of these video converters and think are are very good; and easy to use. They all have the video conversion options you'd be searching for and handle plenty of common formats— and they're all free.
 Be sure to watch for the installation options [opt out] on just what you want.</div>
