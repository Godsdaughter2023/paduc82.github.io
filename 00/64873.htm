<h2>            Bluetooth speaker no longer working after update to Win 10 1809</h2>
                    <p>Speaker Philips BT50B/37 stopped working after update to version 1809. The device pairs and connects, but there is no sound coming out of the speaker. If I try to manage audio in Skype, I get the message "there no device to manage".</p>
<p>In Device manager I see 3 audio devices:</p>
<p>- Philips BT50 Hands-free</p>
<p>- Philips BT50 Stereo</p>
<p>- Realtek HD Audio</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I display the sound devices, I see 3 devices as follows:</p>
<p>- Headset Philips BT50 with mic (default)</p>
<p>- Headphones Philips BT50 without mic - disconnected</p>
<p>- Speaker/HP - Ready</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BT50 speaker worked fine in earlier versions of Win 10, including v.1803. Speaker also connects and works fine with a cell phone.</p>

<h2>            Printer not working in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: printer</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I bought a new printer HP PSC 1400. I didn't know when I bought it, but I guess HP doesn't offer support for it, anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It prints, but not in color. I downloaded the manuel, and I tried to update the drivers, but it said the printer drivers are already updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do to get this printer working? I can't buy another one, right now. &nbsp; My HP computer is running Windows 10.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Why don&#8217;t I receive messages from my friends&#63;</h2>
                    Why don’t I receive mesages from my friends when they said they sent me and why can’t they see my mesages i sent to them? Why does it show that they are offline, even when i am talking on Skype with them. I have the latest version of Skype downloaded.
 Skype was working fine until like a week ago.

            Hi Jannine, thank you for your reply. I have Wivdows 10 on my computer and I use my IPhone and Ipad for Skype as well. Today, Wednesday, suddenly I got messages from my friends they sent several days ago. Skype might had a glitch, like the one you have
 experienced before and they fixed it. Thank you again for replying to my question.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<h3> k.street  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error codes 641 and code 800F0A13 when trying to update to service pack 1</h2>
                    I keep getting error code 641 and code 800F0A13 when trying to update to service pack 1. I can no longer uninstall programs or install certain updates. My virus protection updates definitions ok but Java won't update anymore and Adobe Acrobat won't update
 anymore... I ran the "System Readiness Tool" and checked the logs it created it say's it found no errors. I tried updating again after that but still the same errors appear. I've run registry scans with Norton 360-No errors. I also get the message "components
 that are needed are not available" and "The windows installer service is not configured properly" or something like that. I'm at wits end and about to reformat the drive if I can't resolve this soon. Please help if you have the remedy to this predicament.
 Thanks!<br />

            Hi <span>maxla,<br />
<br />
The best way to delete the duplicate photos in Windows Live Photo Gallery is by selecting all the duplicate photos in the same folder and manually deleting them. Please refer to the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Open Windows Photo Gallery to view your photos.<br />
<br />
2. Find the location of the folder where the duplicate photos are saved. Scroll through all of your pictures or click to view pictures in a specific folder.<br />
<br />
3. Right-click on the duplicate photo. Select <strong>Delete</strong> from the menu that opens. Click
<strong>Yes</strong> when you are asked if you are sure you want to move the photo to the Recycle Bin. The duplicate photo will be deleted.<br />
<br />
4. Click <strong>CTRL</strong> and select each duplicate photo you want to delete if there are multiples in the same folder. The photos will be highlighted; right-click over the photos and click
<strong>Delete</strong> from the menu that opens. Confirm to send the items to the Recycle Bin.<br />
<br />
5. Repeat this process if you have any more duplicate photos you want to delete in other folders.<br />
<br />
But if you're referring to the option that automatically detects all duplicate photos and delete them, that option is currently unavailable in Windows Live Photo Gallery.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.<br />

<h2>            unable to boot to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title - Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I upgraded my Windows 7 machine to Windows 10.&nbsp; It was fine for a couple weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just today, for no reason, it froze up and starting restarting over and over.&nbsp; It will not load up to windows or give any options otherwise.&nbsp; It moves to an automatic repair
 tool screen for 5 seconds, then it goes to a sceen showing this " :(" and stating there is a problem and it is going to restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; It keeps doing this over and over again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have been searching on ways to boot up in safemode.&nbsp; I found a dozen options, but all of them include being able to load up to the desktop.&nbsp; Well I cant do that.&nbsp; It keeps looping over and over.&nbsp;&nbsp; F8 does not work, and I cant change that because, again,
 I cannot get to windows to change it.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I am stuck watching my computer restart itself over and over and over again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I let that happen for 20 minutes and it went to a Scanning and repairing drive (C:) mode.&nbsp; It is at 3% and has been for about 15 minutes with nothing happening.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is, what am I supposed to do about this?&nbsp; I just lost everything on my desktop, which I can gather again but it is going to take me hours to do this now.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, I don't have my windows 7 CD anymore, so I am stuck with a useless computer
 right now thanks to the wonderful world of WIndows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To really put the icing on the cake, I am a broker and I work from home.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just missed 2 conference calls because of this and my lack of being able to log on Citrix, in both cases which were regarding
 products in the tens of thousands of revenues to my company.&nbsp; So you didn't just waste my time, you just cost me more than your damn windows 10 product is worth..</p>

    <title>partitioned microSD card and now cannot reformat to one partition... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nufumanchu  say:</h3>
<h2>            partitioned microSD card and now cannot reformat to one partition...</h2>
                    <p>hey there everyone,&nbsp;I decided for various reasons to partition the 128gb microSD card in my Surface Pro 3,&nbsp;I split basically in half using the Disk Manager, it more or less forced me to make the second partition a 'Simple Volume', which&nbsp;I didn't understand
 but figured it was no big deal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now&nbsp;I want to just recombine the partitions.&nbsp;I don't have any data on them that&nbsp;I need to worry about, and am just trying to format the whole thing to FAT32.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Viewing the Partitions in Disk Manager shows this:&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d58204eb-2fe9-44f6-8cad-a17e51c4d6d0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d58204eb-2fe9-44f6-8cad-a17e51c4d6d0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>but all efforts to combine the partitions lead to failure and frustration...&nbsp;Here are the options available for the formatted partition:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54e1a5d0-0737-4506-a0cf-b969b9757f34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54e1a5d0-0737-4506-a0cf-b969b9757f34" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see "Extend Volume" is disabled as is "Delete Volume", and formatting this partition
<strong>only</strong> effects this partition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore the list of options for the second partition is even more confusing:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cef515a-9ecf-4ce4-ac29-84100ddd0cfa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cef515a-9ecf-4ce4-ac29-84100ddd0cfa" /></a></p>
<p>SO, any advice on how to achieve this simple goal??&nbsp;I don't know anything about MS's "Simple Volume" and to be honest I'm pretty stunned that this is so difficult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE NOTE:&nbsp;I have tried to search these forums and on the web in general but haven't found anything directly relevant &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Dell Digital Delivery Windows Service &#40;32 bit&#41; is it necessary&#63;</h2>
                    <p>my question is, is Dell Digital Delivery Windows Service (32 bit) necessary? </p>
<p>
</p><p>at Control Panel\Programs\Programs and Features it&nbsp; is shown as Alienware Digital Delivery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>two names what are bit different, are they one program, or two versions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>does it help with updates? does it help with download software? </p>
<p>
</p><p>or is it only meant for buying software online? </p>
<p>i never buy software online &amp; its rare when i buy it at all, i use legal free versions 99% of the times</p>
<p>
</p><p>my overall question is, do i need it? &amp; does uninstalling it cause any problems, i ask cause i know one program that will cause problems if uninstalling it, cause it requires a lot of work before it can be uninstalled
</p>
<p>
</p><p>should i just disable it &amp; not uninstall? or its pointless to keep it?</p>

            <p>Hello Sugram,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me ask you;</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you experiencing any issue on the computer due to Dell Digital Delivery Service?</li></ul>
<p>Dell Digital Delivery is a service which enables you to purchase software at the time you order your computer and then download and install it automatically once you receive the computer and connect to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When your new computer is powered on for the first time, you will be walked through the regular computer setup including connecting to the internet. The second time the computer is powered on, the Dell Digital Delivery helper application already installed
 on your computer will run automatically. Dell Digital Delivery will begin downloading and installing your purchased software a few minutes after the computer is started for the second time. At the time Dell Digital Delivery launched, you will have the option
 to Download Now or Remind Me Later. If you choose Remind Me Later this option will appear the next time the computer is started and on subsequent re-starts until you decide to download the software you purchased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Such software is installed by the manufacture when delivering the PC to the end user.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are facing difficulties using the service or you do not want it, you may uninstall it from the computer: Right click
<strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Control Panel </strong>&gt; <strong>Programs &amp; Features
</strong>&gt; right click <strong>Dell Digital Delivery Service</strong> and click <strong>
Uninstall</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><em>Prior to uninstalling the service and for more information,&nbsp;you may refer to:

<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            Hi Nolan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Do you have any hardware or other problems?  A beep like that can be a beep code which means hardware problems as referenced here:  <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/beep.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerhope.com/beep.htm</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Nolan. -
<br />
<br />Did you check which beep code most closely matches the one you're receiving?  Look in the list. 
<br />
<br />Test your RAM overnight to stress it with a more reliable bootable test, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />Test the hard drive with diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.

    <title>Bug report&#58; Explorer and WMP corrupt ID3 TXXX frames - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tim de baets  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bug report&#58; Explorer and WMP corrupt ID3 TXXX frames</h2>
                    <font>I would like to report a bug in Windows 8: editing tags of MP3 files, both in Windows Explorer and Windows Media Player, corrupts existing ID3v2.3 TXXX frames in these files.<br />
<br />
</font><font>To reproduce, take a sample MP3 file and add a TXXX frame to it with
<a href="http://www.mp3tag.de/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mp3tag</a>. This is done by right-clicking the file in Mp3tag, selecting
<b>Extended tags</b>, clicking the button to add a new field, and entering a field name that's not in the list (such as
<b>REPLAYGAIN_TRACK_GAIN</b>). Be sure to also enter some data and click <b>OK </b>
two times.<br />
<br />
Then either use Explorer or WMP to, for example, change the file's Title tag. When using WMP you may also need to use the
<b>Tools </b>- <b>Apply media information changes</b> command afterwards. After the change has been written to file, go back to
<b>Extended tags</b> in Mp3tag. You should see that the original data of the TXXX frame is completely gone and that the new data is a part of the frame name ("eplaygain" in my case). In other words, the frame has been corrupted.<br />
<br />
The same issue also occurs when using <a href="http://professionaltag.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Professional Tag Editor</a> to add a TXXX frame, so the cause definitely doesn't lie with Mp3tag.<br />
<br />
Could someone please forward this to the right people at Microsoft? Thanks!</font><br />

            That is an old issue since windows 7 if not even earlier. I also posted a topic about that and used the feedback tool during the release preview of windows 8. This topic was brought so often to microsofts attention so that you can be sure that nothing
 is going to change in near future. The only thing you can do ist to keep your music library safe: don't add it to any library, don't play it with wmp/wmc and don't tag it from windows explorer. Sorry to say that, but after all that years i lost hope that microsoft
 is going to fix this incredible bug that destroys content of your tags.

    <title>Windows Easy Transfer -- PLEASE HELP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hank harkey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Easy Transfer -- PLEASE HELP</h2>
                    <p>I have had my Dell Inspiron 17R SE 7720 running Win7 Home Premium, x64, SP1 (Dell pre-installed) since mid-2013. That is almost 5 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have always used MS Security Essentials &amp; I install ALL updates immediately upon availability.&nbsp;My machine has run&nbsp;near-perfect for&nbsp;almost 5 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the time has come that I must restore the OS to its original factory-install. Something occurred that has caused the OS to be very confused (related to structure of Directories). I depend on my IT professional for the difficult work &amp; he has advised
 that the only fix is by factory-restore or clean-reinstall. Unfortunately, he has become unavailable so I will have to perform the work myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I back up externally, on a daily basis (incremental), &amp; have the original-install WindowsBackupImage in addition to&nbsp;the Dell restore-partition to from which to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My plan was to use Windows Easy Transfer to back up &amp; restore other files, data, etc. That is until I began my preparations to do so. I had not tried to use W.E.T. prior to now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEVER, I repeat NEVER, have I ever seen any message, error message, notice, notification, etc indicating that my User Profile is TEMPORARY. That is until TODAY, when Windows Easy Transfer notified me. Also, my W.E.T. install must be bad because I also received
 an error message of a missing DLL file. Today was my first attempt to use W.E.T. so I had no knowledge of that either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried the shut down, restart &amp; log in again bs as suggested in MS Forums. However, I still have a "TEMPORARY" profile. In fact, I tried that suggested "fix" several times (very slowly) to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also checked my Drivers &amp; Utilities Resource CD. &lt;&lt;==== No Help</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't a clue as to how to repair the missing DLL file Error: C:\Windows\winsxs\amd64_microsoft-windows-m.onwizardapplication_ 31bf3856ad364e35_6.1.7601.23806_none_19375fdfc408b4a3\cmi2migxml.dll is missing&nbsp;from the install disk. The W.E.T. Disk is invalid.</p>
<p>(Tried to run MigSetup.exe directly trying to avoid Profile error.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some other software to substitute for W.E.T. that I could access immediately (Free, of course)? I realize my software is 5 years old but can't I get a break here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a note: I know, but do NOT understand why MS doesn't give a damn about us Win7 users. I now refuse &amp; will continue to refuse upgrade to Win10. For the most part, my Win7 OS runs perfectly so why should I upgrade. Your further degradation of Win7 Support
 won't force me to do so either &amp; I think your method is shameful. (I hope this statement doesn't kill my request for help.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate someone caring enough to give me some simple help. I need to get this reinstall work done so I can move on to life's many other challenges. I am 72 so I probably don't have a lot of time left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely, Hank Harkey</p>

<p>I would recommend that you do everything possible to avoid using "Easy Transfer".&nbsp; You'll have a far more clean and better performing system (and a much faster/easier time performing the work) if you simply use the "even easier transfer" option -- which
 is, drag-and-drop.&nbsp; You can't get more reliable, compatible, and easy than that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just plug in a hard drive USB, drag files over you care about, and then take that USB to the new computer (or hold onto it until you're done factory-resetting your current computer) and then drag the files back into place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering that you are about to perform a factory reset, I would not spend anytime researching or caring about the temporary profile issue.</p>

<p>Hey Hank no problem at all. &nbsp; I've posted nearly 40<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7f0aae79-fedb-4efc-a2b0-00e7e76111e6">,</a>000 times on this site, so I definitely enjoy coming back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your observation of IE having trouble displaying sites is sort of well-known around the web.&nbsp; A lot of folks still joke that IE is the #1 browser... for downloading Chrome.&nbsp; Even Microsoft know that IE draws people's ire, they setup a website a few years
 ago called <a href="http://www.thebrowseryoulovetohate.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.the<strong>browser</strong>you<strong>love</strong>to<strong>hate</strong>.com</a> to try to convince people "know really, it isn't so bad anymore". &nbsp; But ultimately they gave up, cancelled IE, and started building a whole new browser from scratch for Windows
 10.&nbsp; The love to hate site now redirects to rethink<strong>ie</strong>.com, which is itself broken -- which I find both hilarious and fitting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too love Chromecast and Chrome is one of my most used browsers.&nbsp; Although I work for a web hosting team so I have about 11 web browsers installed on my computer.&nbsp; To me they all do the same job, and I use LastPass so they all "remember the same passwords"
 (I don't have to individually let each browser remember the passwords typed into just itself), so that's a life saver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is a shame that Cox still doesn't have IMAP email.&nbsp; I'm actually here in OKC too, a Cox subscriber, but I'd really never considering using the email services my ISP provides.&nbsp; I just don't want to be locked into it, plus if I move or get another service
 provider I don't want to lose my email or tell everyone I got a new email address. It's just a pain to me.&nbsp; I don't mind using Outlook.com (formerly known as Windows Live/Hotmail) or Gmail, but I put a vanity email address so I look professional and cool&nbsp;🕶
 (my email is handled by Google but ends with @ cmdrkeene.com)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your Outlook question, you are completely right, I shouldn't have said shortcuts what I really meant was all the content in the left-hand navigation pane (all your folders, contacts, calendar, etc.).&nbsp; That will all be inside the PST file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also yes that convenience rollup would be a great way to catch up.&nbsp; Although even after that's installed, I wouldn't be too surprised if there are still 100+ remaining updates that have been published since then -- Windows 7 has a long history and a
 huge amount of patches over the years.</p>

<h2>            Epson Lx 300 &#43;II not printing in win 10</h2>
                    <p>hi</p>
<p>the day&nbsp; before i have received&nbsp; few complains (7)&nbsp; about LX 300 + II&nbsp; stopped working on windows 10 computers.</p>
<p>i have noticed that the printer is online&nbsp; and properly connected trough usb cable. When i send job to the printer, the job appears on printer queue as printing and disappear&nbsp; but the printer is not printing , no error , no nothing. I have tried the same
 printer on another win10 laptop&nbsp;&nbsp; and same result. Same printer on win7 &nbsp;&nbsp; is working fine.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that on a win 10 computer with last&nbsp; updates&nbsp; made 3 weeks ago is working fine.</p>
<p>It seems that the problem appear only on computers with the last update on win 10
</p>
<p>any suggestions?</p>

<p>Microsoft says: </p>
<p>"<em>After installing this update, some Epson SIDM and Dot Matrix printers cannot print on x86 and x64-based systems. Microsoft and Epson have determined the cause of the issue and are working on a solution. This problem is not related
 to the printer driver, so installing current or older print drivers will not resolve the issue.

<p>FWIW</p>
<p>Microsoft released over night a fix/update ( <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4055038/november-21-2017-kb4055038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>So I guess MS will soon release a fix/update for Windows 10, too...</p>

            Troubleshooting Tips To Solve Common Problems When Windows 7 Does Not Install<br />
<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and fix them.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</a>
<br />
<br />
2. Disable all security software including anti-virus and firewall programs.<br />
3. Make sure your computer has the most recent BIOS and drivers.<br />
4. Disconnect all external devices except keyboard and mouse before installing.<br />
5. If your computer/motherboard has integrated video use that and remove the dedicated video card.<br />
6. If you have a large amount of RAM (memory), try reducing the amount of installed RAM. 1GB if installing 32bit, 2GB for 64bit, then replace RAM if the upgrade is successful.<br />
7. If you downloaded Windows 7 and burned it to a DVD try burning it again at the slowest speed possible. It's also possible the download may have errors, you could try downloading it again.<br />
<br />
8. Check your RAM (memory) for errors. This may take awhile.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A) Insert the Windows 7 DVD and restart the computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; B) Boot from the Windows 7 DVD.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C) Choose your language, then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; D) Click on "Repair your computer" then select the operating system to repair.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E) Click the Memory Diagnostics link on the System Recovery menu.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; F) The computer will restart and your memory checked for any errors. <br />
<br />
9. Disable Startup Programs:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A). Click Start, type MSCONFIG in the Start Search box, and then press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK User Account Control permission and enter password if any<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If using XP: Click Start, click Run, then type: MSCONFIG and click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; B) On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C) Right below Selective Startup, uncheck the "Load Startup Items" check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; D) Click the Services tab, click the "Hide All Microsoft Services" box, then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E) Click OK, then restart the computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; F) Attempt the upgrade again.<br />
<br />
(NOTE: if the upgrade doesn't work and you continue to use XP/Vista turn your security software back on, then also return to MSCONFIG and on the General tab, click "Normal Startup" then click OK to exit.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
If you got the upgrade disks from the computer manufacturer, those are modified OEM Windows 7 install disks and the best answer would come by contacting them because of the modifications made by them.<br />

<p>Go to McAfee and get their uninstalling software and completely remove.</p>
<p>You only need Windows Defender and Malwarebytes for virus and malware protection.</p>
<p>The best protection sits between the chair and the keyboard.&nbsp; When downloading a program do not let the downloading program add any other programs to the one you asked for.&nbsp; Watch where you are going with your browser.</p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Final option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.

            <p>1&nbsp; If you have a big enough USB then yes you can put an image on any other <strong>
NTFS</strong> USB / hard drive then move it as long as it is kept intact &amp; the entire folder structure is put into the USB drive's root level before you try to restore from it e.g. J:\WindowsImageBackup or H:\WindowsImageBackup.&nbsp; You cannot tamper with any
 of its subfolders as that can corrupt the image.&nbsp; Personally, I have never created an image onto a network drive but Windows Help says that this is okay [I have a feeling I have seen reports of people having problems with saving images in network locations
 but I don't have any details noted down].</p>
<p>2&nbsp; My Win7 Home Premium x64 system image takes up 29-33GB depending what mood it is in so you will need a big USB for this job.&nbsp; I use my 500GB external drive so I have never done any experiments to find out how small a drive I could use.&nbsp; Your datafiles
 will add to the size of your image - my 29-33GB is just Windows 7 &amp; applications since my datafiles are on a different partition.</p>
<p>3&nbsp; It is possible that the error message you had was caused by the USB being too small for the job or not being NTFS-formatted&nbsp;- try a larger&nbsp;USB / external drive &amp; it may work&nbsp;but do&nbsp;check that the external drive or USB stick is formatted using NTFS.</p>
<p>4&nbsp; Your Dell also has a Factory restore partition &amp; the backup utility bundled by Dell can create an image of that partition as an extra insurance against drive failure.&nbsp; I used a 16GB USB stick for this but I think I could have got away with just 8GB.</p>
<p>5&nbsp; Please be aware that both Windows system images &amp; the Dell Factory restore partition have problems restoring to different hardware so if you ever have to change hard drives [if your internal hard drive fails or you just decide to get a bigger one], you
 may have to reinstall Windows from scratch.&nbsp; You can try the system image but it may not work correctly.&nbsp; You should therefore regard a system image as being a method of recovery from software corruption of your system [by far the most likely event] rather
 than protection against hardware failure.&nbsp; There are other applications such as Acronis TI that make images that can cope with hardware changes.</p>
<p>6&nbsp; You can also make an installation DVD/USB yourself. Download the correct ISO from
<a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/official-windows-7-sp1-iso-from-digital-river/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Official Windows 7 SP1 ISO from Digital River</a> then transfer it to a DVD or USB using the

    <title>Last Windows 10 Update performed on February 2019 corrupted my all 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ragnarokkr24  say:</h3>
<h2>            Last Windows 10 Update performed on February 2019 corrupted my all 3 HD</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I normally don't like update Windows 10 since I read about the October 2018 update error, but as this update was removed and now (February 2019) I was assuming this is fixed, plus the constant OS message about a new update that I was delaying as much as
 I could by clicking on 'remind me later' button, 6 days ago the update was inevitable and Windows 10 started the process to update Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OS was really good with the previous update that shown elements of 'Fluent Design' on file explorer folder and others, I choose Dark theme a year ago but file explorer was with white background, but with the last update (sorry I wasn't checking which
 update has which designated number/code), the update that turned the file explorer background Black&nbsp; (which was really cool) the problem started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used this update like 3 times, if not less, when in the new start of my computer, it shown an error with one java xml file ( file system error (-2147219196) ), then the other files don't open and showing this message window: 'You don't have permission
 to open this file, see the owner of the file or an administrator to obtain permission'.... those files were located on the 'D:\' drive which is not a partition of the same HD, but a whole separated HD in which I also had Windows 8 installed. So when I switched
 to Windows 8 the whole drive was like a brick....non of the files open, the system shown a lot of error about corrupted files, and after rebooting and starting Windows 8 again, it won't even booted, the whole HD was corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I restarted from my newly updated Windows 10 from the other HD to check the content of my Windows 8 drive (D:\), but it wasn't readable at all, not even the Linux distro that I used that time detected the partitions on the Win8 drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I bought a new 1TB HD, installed again Windows 10 from my USB which contains Windows 10 April 2018 (so no Fluent Design to show nor Dark theme on File Explorer window). Then, as a test I installed in this new HD few trusted software from my collection,
 tested the software, rebooted the PC from the new HD several times with no errors. Then I rebooted the PC but this time I choose the other HD which contains the newly updated Windows 10 from six days ago, then with the file explorer I copied an image file
 and an .exe file from the updated 6 days ago Windows 10 HD, then I moved to the newly bought 1TB HD that I tested before, just went to the Download folder of that drive, and pasted the files there, then I turned off the PC. Then I started the PC again from
 the newly bought 1TB HD and it shown an error about a corrupted file from OneDrive app, I checked the Download folder and the folder was empty, so the files that I previously copied and pasted were gone, so I restarted the PC booting from the same newly bought
 drive and the whole drive was corrupted, so the PC was stuck on the Bios because it couldn't find any bootable media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I unplugged the now 2 corrupted HD and I booted from the 3rd HD which contains the updated 6 days ago Win10, this time the system shown a lot of errors as the previous HDs, the file explorer shown that drive was with 0 bytes free, and the same 'You don't
 have permission to access this folder' or 'file' was present all over the drive. I manage to upload system fonts and copy cached code from sublime text that I was working on, and that's it, the rest was lost. After trying to reboot again, the drive was lost,
 not passing the Bios screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also an external drive where I have all my work was affected, but one Linux distro manage to read the content so I hope I will be able
</p>
<p>to recover my work files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is possible that one update manage to corrupt all my HD and files, and make me lost all my years work, collected from 14 years ago. I have back ups but not the recent work. I hope that I will recover everything with the Linux distro that manage to read
 the external drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I reinstalled Window 10 April 2018 on the newly bought 1RB HD again and is working fine, so possible error from power supply or hardware are discarded. And for the external drive with my recent work, I will try to recover it using Linux as this drive
 was the only one readable by Linux, as it was unplugged as soon as the first error appeared and it wasn't connected to any Windows OS to this date, the other 2 internal drives are other story.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And today my laptop shown the 'Is there a new Windows Update' message, so I will back up everything from there just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any one experimented the same with this update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to recover the files or the systems of the other 2 internal drives (win8 / win10 updated on February)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advise will be appreciated. </p>

<p>Hi Kumar, thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Answer to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>1: Which version of Windows was installed before you updated?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Sorry but I don't check all the time which version is installed, nor I'm taking note of the number, I just wanna use windows with out any OS interference. Also I didn't updated, I was forced to by Windows, when you
 turn your computer off and then on, windows do it automatically, so no button to stop it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The only clue that I have is that the update was the one that turned the file explorer black instead of the normal white, I guess if you choose a dark theme in Themes. Sorry but that's the only reference that I have.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2:&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>What is the make and model number of your Computer?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>It's a custom desktop PC with 2 HDs. The first HD was from a Dell Inspiron JNT25 A01 (win8) and the second HD was from a Asus A54C (win10). And working flawless since 4 year ago if I'm not wrong.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>3:&nbsp;</strong></span><span><strong>Have you tried connecting the hard-drive to a different computer?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Yes, the first HD that got corrupted by showing some error/not access/corrupted messages was the one with windows 8, so when I moved to the windows 10 HD to check disk windows 8 HD, the windows 8 HD was corrupted and
 unable to access nor even to preform check disk process. <strong>(*)</strong> But then the windows 10 HD was showing the modal messages that I saw on windows 8 after becoming corrupted. So at second start from windows 10 HD it was corrupted too, not booting
 at all, same as the windows 8 HD, not booting too. Then I installed windows 10 (I think is April 2018 release) on the new HD that I bought, both HDs presented the same behavior, not able to access at all, showing 0bytes of free space, but I guess that is because
 the system is unable to access them.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I saved files on the windows 8 HD while I was using windows 10, also some software dependencies were installed on that win8 HD, that's why win8 HD became corrupted first. The</span>&nbsp;win8 HD is a WD of 1TB, while the
 win10 HD is a Crucial 64GB solid state, that's why I needed some space for software from the win8 HD, and that's why windows 10 corrupted first my windows 8 HD.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After the corruption of my whole HDs, I booted from Linux usb and both HDs were showing no data in their file partitions (I use gparted). Then I connected my external HD that until now I didn't connected to any windows
 machine, and it showed the file tree, it was accessible but with one corrupted folder, this folder was the one that I first noticed when windows 8 was in the process of file corruption, while I was using windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So when I booted the second time after viewing the error/wrong owner/corrupted file messages on each windows OS, the second time is the one that doesn't boot or shown files. That's why I won't connect my external HD
 to any other windows system, and I didn't connected or attempted to copy those files. I was spending my time to setting my new windows 10 April release to block any update attempt and installing my working software.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For the other instructions, I didn't used the method that you suggested yet, but I wonder why in the first place windows will change owner, that's not the correct behavior.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Best regards.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong>* Edit:</strong>&nbsp; I forgot to mention this, I know the cause of corruption was the last update (performed in my case on February 2019) of windows 10 because, after the corruption of my windows 8 HD, I bought
 a new 1TB HD and installed windows 10 April release, checked few reboots and installed some software, checked again few more times and everything was flawless, then I moved to the updated win10 from the Crucial 64GB HD and then as a test I saved 2 files into
 the download folder inside my newly installed win10 on the newly bought 1TB HD, then shut down and restarted from my 1TB HD windows 10 newly installed, opened the download folder and no files there, the folder was empty, and my other files and folder were
 corrupted showing the different modal messages that I mentioned before. Then I restarted again and the newly bought HD with the newly installed win10 was unable to boot, then I restarted from the 64TB HD with the updated win 10 and there was when this system
 started to show the error messages. So I have to reinstal win10 again and then I checked both corrupted HD as I mentioned above....</span></p>

                    <p>I have Windows 10 running with all the latest updates, I have noticed that several programs and the Pc were taking a long time to do some tasks after checking in the Task Manager I found that the Service Host (scvhost.exe) was running about 65 times and
 as I watched it the number grows up to about 84 now.</p>
<p>I want to find a way to reset the number of them loading, does this mean a reinstall or rebuild?</p>

 reset, install your necessary applications, make a full system image (to help if you have to reset it again, you can just restore to that point instead of doing all that waiting, updating, installing, driver installs, etc.) and see if everything is good.</p>

<p>Hi Shenan,</p>
<p>I do a bit of work with windows10 and 7 also XP but that has gone now.</p>
<p>I was wondering why so many (up to 60+) ScvHost.exe are running?</p>
<p>I know that many applications will use it and start there own running but I have do not have any applications running only started up Windows 10 and logged in.</p>
<p>I suppose it is a little of a curiosity question as well, and if they all have to start then it is OK.</p>
<p>I was going to try what you you suggested but I have to load up a new drive to test it and see what gets loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Glenn Sharp</p>

<h2>            How to recover stolen disk space&#63;</h2>
                    My son's has a Think Pad T61, 3 gb ram, 100gb hard disk. The disk properties window says the disk has only 7,41 gb left free.<br />
I have look at every directory's properties to see that&nbsp;all the files and programs uses about 39,7 gb.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
How&nbsp;can we recuperate the missing&nbsp;50 gb of space?&nbsp;<br />
How can we set the computer so this will not happen again?

It would be helpful if you could post for us any and all drives / partitions that show up under disk manager and the total size, used space, and free space of each.&nbsp; It sounds like your 100GB hard drive was partitioned into two drives of 50GB each and only
 one of those is being used so you are only seeing half the space.&nbsp; Do you see a drive D: with around 50GB of space?&nbsp; It could be that the other half of the drive was not formatted so it won't show up.&nbsp; It all depends on how the drive was formatted and partitioned
 when Vista was installed.<br />
<br />
Here is one thing that might be your culprit:<br />
