<p><span><strong><span>I have been using Publisher for many years and am having real difficulty with the new 'align' feature. I find that I cannot precisely
 align objects. The 'snapping' feature has gone backwards instead of moving forward and it is now taking me a lot longer to do my work.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span>If I 'trust' the feature to work, and use the align to object tool, it seems ok, but when I zoom in (to
 about 170%), the object is clearly not touching the one next to it by about 1mm.</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>If I zoom in and do my work at 170%, I cannot see the objects around that I am supposed to be grabbing and snapping so now I am continually zooming in and out!</span></span></p>

<p>I don't know how to advise you on this. Change your nudge to 1mm, if you know the 1mm is the default gap, then maybe one nudge will solve&nbsp;your problem.</p>
<p>Have you tried the "draw border inside the frame" when you are doing shapes?</p>

<p>Thanks Mary - I was doing the nudge thing, but it seems a shame to have to do a nudge when before I could practically do my job in my sleep - now its like i need to stare at the screen and really concentrate and still text boxes dont exactly line up with
 picture frames unless i zoom into like 300 or more %</p>
<p>mine defaults to draw border inside frame, i did try a little with outside frame, but not sure it was any better.</p>
<p>I have to do more tomorrow so I will test more with the inside outside thing and post an update.</p>

<p>Mary,</p>
<p>Excuse me for butting in here, but where is the control/option in Pub 2010 to turn on or off&nbsp;the "snap to" feature, and for that matter where do you change the "nudge"?</p>

<p>The Nudge is File,Options, Advanced.</p>
<p>The Snap is on the Page Design tab. Look under Align To, if you hover over the Guides or Objects, you'll see the snap text.</p>

<p>Hi DavidF, Mary, and Tricia -</p>
<p>I second the thanks--I hadn't found the snap-to objects or guides either! I just thought they had reduced it to some automatic&nbsp; all-inclusive snap-to that one couldn't specify and could only over-ride by holding down the Alt-key as&nbsp;one moved their whatever.
 (I used to make floor plans and kitchen designs with Publisher--it was sooo easy. No more. Arggghh.)</p>
<p>I pull a text box and get not one, but two, boundaries! WUWT? And which one is going to snap-to? Arggghh.</p>
<p>Mary, I'm glad you are staying calm and grounded using this. (I'm going stark raving mad!)</p>
<p>M.</p>

<p>ok so I have been testing Pub 2010 throughout the day and have these questions / comments to make.</p>
<p>- i am not sure what Morisot meant by holding down the alt key while dragging things across the page so they aren't snapping to every single thing. this does not work for me. by the time i finally get something across the page, half an hour later my hand
 and mouse are just about behind the computer i have had to stretch so far.</p>
<p>- when you are trying to for eg. snap a text box to a picture frame, what exactly do the green and red lines that show up mean? they must mean that you are just about to snap to something over in the neighbours yard because very rarely do they snap exactly
 to the object right next to them. just about every single time it is out 'just a little' even at 200% zoom so i always have to do the snapping twice - or more times.</p>
<p>- because microsoft has put SOOO much effort into making text frames sparkle when you hover over them and all the 'convenient' red lines that appear etc etc, my graphics just cant keep up! i never used to have a problem with this. even when i change the
 setting to fast resize and zoom my objects disappear so that i have to scroll up and down to get them back. (my images are only very small in size eg 20-80kb)</p>
<p>I am sure that i could go on and on. I used to praise Publisher as an awesome tool and was really looking forward to the upgrade, but unfortunately i kind of feel that it was a waste of money and may go back to using the older version. i have great pride
 in my work and am finding it very difficult to reach the same standards without spending absolute hours doing what used to take me very little time.</p>

<p>The red lines are the alignment lines. If you have lots of objects on your publication, when you move an object, the object will try to&nbsp;align with every object even though they are not touching. The green lines are the guides, these do not appear and disappear
 like the object lines. If you are snapping to objects its best to turn off the snapping to guides especially since you seem to have graphics issues.</p>
<p>It seems to me you should look into getting an updated driver for your graphics card. What version Windows are you using? Read the 4th FAQ here, it is a little dated, but the result is the same for all versions of Windows.</p>

 no problems found. Defragged, restarted, check scanned registry issues. Can't find any problems. Need a real answer. Starting to think I need to uninstall Defender and try a re-install if I can. Just worried about picking up a bug while my computer is vunerable.</p>

    <title>Merging skype and microsoft accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> imnottechsavvy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Merging skype and microsoft accounts</h2>
                    <p>I recently merged my original skype account and my microsoft skype account because it was only allowing me to access my microsoft account since the email was linked up to it. while doing so, I was given a notification that all of the stuff on the original
 account (contacts, conversations, etc.) were going to be the only stuff on the new merged account - which was totally fine bc thats the only account I used. however, after merging the two it turns out that EVERYTHING was deleted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>is there a way to undo this? to either get my contacts and conversations back or to unmerge the two and delete the microsoft account?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Please be advised that when merging your Skype account to a Microsoft account, only your contacts who have a Skype account are the onew who will remain on your contact list. And for the conversation, it should retain the last 30days of your conversation
 history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for clarification, is it your Skype contacts or Microsoft contacts that disappear on your account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post. <br />

<h2>            recurring meetings in outlook calendar when room is busy some of the time</h2>
                    We are running Outlook 2010 at work with Exchange. If someone books a recurring meeting and a meeting room is included, if the room is busy for any of the dates in the series the room does not get booked at all.

<div>Is there a way to change this so that the room is booked for all available days and a notification sent to meeting organiser to find alternative rooms just for the days with a clash?</div>

    <title>How do I disable auto capitalization when editing text in a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david m&#229;rtensson  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I disable auto capitalization when editing text in a textarea&#63;</h2>
                    I recently found that IE no auto capitalize words according to my system language settings.<br />
<br />
My problem is that I answer questions in both Swedish and English and there is no way to change the settings for IE only.<br />
<br />
The auto capitalization causes many problems, both because it makes the wrong capitalizations when I answer in another language.<br />
<br />
But also since I sometimes supply temporary login credentials and a capitalization that I do not notice can make them not work.<br />
<br />
<br />
As it is I have to refrain from using IE for this since it has caused to much problems.'<br />
<br />
<br />
All other browsers I have tried allows me to switch language for the browser only and also do not auto "fix".<br />
<br />
Iphone did the same but had the option to disable auto fix.<br />

<p>In IE11 on W7sp1 I have only recently become aware that there is a Spelling Correction category under Manage Add-ons.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, I'm now on W8.1 and don't see it there.&nbsp; Previously I thought the AutoCorrection feature was something that came with HTML 5.0
 and hence could be disabled by switching User-Agent strings but I have not had positive feedback for that idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; YMMV.</p>

<p>Good luck</p>

You probably have a faulty Add-in (A template stored in the Word Startup folder).&nbsp; Remove them all and add them back one at a time until you located the faulty one.

<p>
</p><p>after upgrade from Office2013 to Office2016 (32 bit) on Windows 10 (Italian) i notice that the istant search of items with attachments failed if the search criteria isn't write in English language.</p>

            It's a known issue and there are issues with the English implementation as well. It is being investigated and scheduled to be fixed. No ETA has been set for it, but if there are no further complications, I'm expecting it to be fixed with the July update
 as the June update is already&nbsp;locked for deployment.

<h2>            Issue playing a video multiple times in show mode in PowerPoint for Mac</h2>
                    I'm running PowerPoint 2011 for Mac on a MacBook Pro and noticed an odd issue a couple of months ago. I insert a video into the presentation, typically as a Quicktime movie (.MOV), select play automatically and then select play in fullscreen. In show mode,
 the video may play once or twice without a problem. But eventually the video will stop playing. This usually happens after playing the presentation once in show mode to test the audio levels and playback of the video(s). When this happens there are two things
 I can do to make the video work: 1. Back up one slide and then advance to the slide again, or 2. Get out of show mode and then get back into show mode. This has become such a problem that I will have to just play the videos separately in Quicktime on a second
 computer from now on, which will work for some venues, but not all. I haven't experienced this problem yet running any version of PowerPoint on a PC and playing the video files as MP4s.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried changing the settings on the inserted video to rewind after playing and I've converted the videos to MP4s and still encounter this issue. I've also had the show computers re-imaged and reinstalled Office for Mac and the problem still occurs.</div>

            In at least some Windows 7 / 2007 set ups the star will only appear if you hover the mouse just under the slide number in the thumbnail (ie where the start should be)

<p>Oh, how odd.</p>
<p>Just wanted to add that the star for animation is really only useful (as far as I'm concerned, anyway) if you don't have slide transitions applied, because the star also indicates a transition.</p>
<p>You know, this is stupid and I've mentioned it before to MS. I think I'll have to mention it again. ;-)</p>

    <title>Merging photos into Publisher 2013 Directory from Excel 2007 database. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Merging photos into Publisher 2013 Directory from Excel 2007 database.</h2>
                    <p>My problem is creating a Directory in Publisher 2013 (Windows 7) and using an Excel 2007 sheet as the database. All&nbsp; of my text inputs work fine. I can insert the column titles of the text fields in the master document any place I wish and the proper information
 appears in each record after completing the merge. However, I cannot merge a column of photos. I have tried numerous ways of putting a photo field in the master document and formatting the contents of the column holding the individual photo information. I
 have no problem inserting the same photo in all of the records just by doing a "insert photo." Obviously, I don't know how to create the photo field in the master document or format the contents of cells referring to the photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched Microsoft help topics and posted several questions to the community about the problem with no results. I would be happy to pay for the tech support to solve the problem if it comes to that but don't know where to go to get the specific help
 I need. I can't believe that no one else in the entire Office 2013 world has had or cares about this particular problem.</p>

            <p>Glad to hear that you figured it out. I just realized that the link I provided was not one of the posts where Mary suggested putting the images in the same folder...sorry about that. I rushed the search for one of her posts and copied the wrong link.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also the late, great Mary Sauer used to suggest that putting the images in the same folder/directory as the excel and publisher file was helpful. I would also suggest that you be sure to optimize and size all the pictures before you try to import them into
 your publication. Here is one of the times Mary discussed this issue: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2007-office_other/catalog-merge/c0d4cd0c-7a16-436a-bdcc-2de2d3170829">

<h2>            An Update Saga</h2>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hi, Members of the "<em>Microsoft Answers</em>" Forum Community.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; As advised by <em>JoeNamco</em> and <em>Hula_Baloo</em>, I am inserting here a Purpose Statement for this Thread.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am currently running "<em>Microsoft Windows Home Edition Version 1709 (Operating System Build 16299.15)
</em>©<em> 2017 Microsoft</em>" on an <a href="https://www.asus.com/us/Laptops/X551MA/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="ASUS X551MA-SX056D Laptop Personal Computer">
ASUS X551MA-SX056D Laptop Personal Computer</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I enjoy using the "<em>Feedback Hub</em>" App and various Software Engineering Forums through which I am able to report the Issues that I see in the Operating System and in its Apps.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; More than that, I have been constantly monitoring the "<em>Microsoft Windows Update</em>" Software Packages until I have decided that I am no longer interested in the Release Edition of the Operating System and I am willing to enroll into the "<em>Microsoft
 Windows Insider</em>" Program.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Giving the fact that, naturally, it would be interesting for the makers of this Operating System to receive more than a dry Error Status Report, I have starting jotting down here also the Issues that I find to be quite serious.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For instance, I have been noticing for some time the fact that the "<em>Microsoft Windows File Explorer</em>" ("<em>EXPLORER.EXE</em>") App is constantly crashing when I am vertically scrolling down a Window full of Extra-Large Icons (256px * 256px in size).<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Since any Operating System or App has an infinity of possibilities for optimization, I also do not have a definite goal in finding out the perfect state of the current Build that I am using.<br />
</p>
<p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Hi, PCR Just PCR.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; (1) I have created this Discussion here. I do not expect any results from it. If the Operating System is about to crash again, then I shall probably Cleanly Reinstall it again.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I agree that most of the Users are not interested in this Discussion.<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; (4) I think that the "<em>Microsoft Windows Backup</em>" App is a LEGACY Software Application remained from the Old Days of the "<em>Microsoft Windows 7</em>" Operating System.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have not bought yet that External Winchester Hard Disk Drive. After I buy it, I hope that I shall be able to configure the "<em>File History</em>" App.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; You might have noticed the Description of the "<em>Previous Versions</em>" Tab:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "<em>Previous versions come from File History or from restore points.</em>"<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; As I do not trust either the "<em>Microsoft Windows Backup</em>" App, nor the "<em>Restore Points</em>" App, nor the "<em>File History</em>" App, I am still performing Regular Data File Writing on Digital Versatile + Read-Write Disks using the "<em>Burn
 Aware</em>" App, since the "<em>CD Burner XP</em>" App has been detected as containing Malware by "<em>Symantec</em>"'s "<em>Norton Security Online</em>" App.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Enjoy the "<em>Microsoft</em>" Way,<br />

<p>Just to let you know it is advised to not use third party Anti virus apps with the Insider Builds because it can cause Install problems with new Builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then it has just been suggested to use third party apps to do backups.</p>
<p>Many free Backup Apps are available that work very good, so when you get your external drive you can try some of them and see how they work for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Rescue Kit 14 Free from Paragon. You can go to the link below and read what can be done and how to do it. One of the reasons I use it is I multi boot different OS Systems on partitioned drives and the rescue kit has a way to make System Images or individual
 Partitions</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Hi, Cal54.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; (1) <strong>Anti-Virus</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am currently considering whether to discontinue the usage of the "<em>Symantec</em>" Apps. Sadly enough, I have two Lifetime Licenses for the "<em>Norton Utilities 2016</em>" App and for the "<em>Norton Security Online</em>" App.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; It is interesting that the "<em>Mozilla Firefox</em>" App is branding the "<em>Symantec</em>" Apps as LEGACY.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Somebody has advised me to use the "<em>Microsoft Windows Defender</em>" App, which I do not really trust.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; (2) <strong>Backup and Restore</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Nobody has advised me so far to discontinue the usage of the "<em>Microsoft Windows Backup</em>" App, although the "<em>Microsoft Corporation</em>" itself seems to consider it as LEGACY.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am currently using it "<em>due to historical reasons</em>", to use a cliché.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; As a programmer, I do not produce much Used Data Space. Normal Human Beings write tons of GigaBytes or even of TeraBytes and maybe soon they will even break the PetaByte limit with MultiMedia Files. I prefer to use Streaming and not to store much on my
 own Media.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore, the Operating System is usually taking less than 50 GigaBytes of Total Used Data Space, with all of the Wasted Data Space that the System Optimizers are attempting in vain to remove.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; What I am more interested in is the "<em>Previous Versions</em>" App and that is why I am waiting in line to buy that 8 TeraByte External Winchester Hard Disk Drive at the price of USD 278. By configuring it to use the "<em>File History</em>" App, I expect
 to have more than the Latest Version of the files that I am maintaining.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; A Supplemental Winchester Hard Disk Drive would also serve as a Sand-Box for a Kits Server, a Source Code ("<em>GitHub</em>") Server and maybe for other things.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; For the moment I am using the "<em>Microsoft Windows Backup</em>" App. I have been using a Universal Serial Bus Flash Drive of 28 GigaBytes that is quite alright. I prefer to buy "<em>Digital Versatile + Read / Write Disks</em>" because somehow I trust
 them more than a Flash Memory Device.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Actually, there is no Material Substance currently known to the Human Beings that is able to resist any calamity, such as a Huge Hurricane. I am therefore maintaining Backup Copies on Six Different Cloud Providers ("<em>ASUS Web Storage</em>", "<em>MEGA</em>",
 "<em>Google Drive</em>", "<em>Microsoft OneDrive</em>", "<em>DropBox</em>" and "<em>Box</em>") that reside in different Geographical Areas.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I will soon study your Backup Solution.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; (3) <strong>"<em>Microsoft Windows Update</em>"</strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am not really looking for a solution for the failures of the "<em>Microsoft Windows Update</em>" App. I just want to learn somehow what is going on.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; There was a time when I was thinking that "<em>Microsoft</em>"'s Motto could be changed from:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "<em>Where do you want to go today?</em>"<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; to:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "<em>What on Earth is my computer doing right now?</em>"<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, I have given up on understanding things in the meantime.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for the response and for the pieces of advice,<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; DOBRESCU_Mihai.<br />

<p>As you will find out over time that most of the&nbsp; issues with updating and installing are due to the addition of 3rd party installations software and devices, as I've been running 3 systems on the preview since the start of the program all 3 are dual booting
 systems, first boot is a "clean" version of Preview nothing added nothing removed, 2nd boot is the same build where I add and remove "stuff" for testing, when an issues shows on 2nd boot, I boot up the clean build and test my PC and most times it turns out
 to be something that I've done with the 2nd boot.</p>
<p>I also have tested some older systems such as Dell OptiPlex 755 with E 6000 series CPU finding that they work find with the current RTM builds, but will not work with the current preview versions, waiting for MS to announce newer guild lines for what will
 work and what won't.&nbsp;</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; Hi, JoeNamco.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for replying and for sharing your views.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; At &lt;REMOVED NUMBER OF YEARS&gt; years, I feel like an Old Johnny now. The Operating System has become increasingly more complex and more difficult to understand. Instead of becoming more compact, I feel that the System Resources that it needs are more and
 more challenging for a Regular User.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Fashion now is that everyone has at least a Laptop-Tablet-SmartPhone Triplet. I myself switched to Laptops back in 2006, when I also bought my First License of the "<em>Microsoft Windows Vista</em>" Operating System. I feel that the Desktop Personal
 Computers have always been much stronger, but - what to do - I have to keep up with the trend.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I bought this Laptop almost three years ago, on the Fated Date of Friday 26-September-2014. These Laptops are meant to be used during an amount of time even shorter than this. After I bought it, I also decided to buy my Second License of the "<em>Microsoft
 Windows 8.1 Home x64</em>" Operating System. It has evolved ever since at a Scary Pace, making it almost completely different than the "<em>Microsoft Windows 3.1</em>" Operating System that I was using back in the year of 1993 on a Desktop Personal Computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am maintaining my opinion that the Perfect Behavior of a "<em>Microsoft</em>" User would be to use only "<em>Microsoft</em>" Apps. This is why probably they must have invented the "<em>Microsoft Universal Windows Platform</em>" Apps. For the moment, as
 much as I try, I find it almost impossible to use most of them, because either they are crashing very often, or they do not offer the same kind of functionality as I have been used to.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let me review just the Apps that I have now open in my Task Bar.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have tried to use the "<em>Mail</em>" App, but sometimes it is simply just disappearing, without much ado. It is also behaving strangely or moving slowly when I am composing a message. Unavoidably, I had to switch to the "<em>Mozilla Thunderbird</em>"
 App and to hope that they will keep on improving it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am now still attempting to use "<em>GitHub</em>"'s "<em>Atom.</em><em>io</em>" Editor App, still in its childhood, which seems to be the first UWP App that has both a lot of functionality and that is not crashing that often. But I had to disable the "<em>Norton
 Security Online</em>" App in order to help it update itself. From time to time, I feel that I should switch back to the "<em>Notepad++</em>" App or even to other older Apps such as "<em>Crimson Editor</em>" or "<em>EditPlus</em>".<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am still using GHISLER_Christian's "<em>Total Commander</em>" App and I hope that he will be able to maintain it in this ever-changing world. The "<em>File Explorer</em>" App does not have the functionality that it provides and I do not really need all
 the graphics and the effects that it provides. This is still a Computer and not a Pot of Flowers. It does not need all the FX.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; With all of my good intentions, I have not been able to keep on using the "<em>Microsoft Edge</em>" App. Besides the integration with "<em>Cortana</em>", I do not see a good reason to use it. All these UWP Apps seem to be extremely rudimentary and made
 to be usable even by a giant that has huge thumbs. Eventually, smoother users need much more things from a Web Browser and, when I felt the need to increase the speed, I have eventually switched back to the "<em>Google Chrome</em>" App, although "<em>Google</em>"
 itself has proved that it is slower than the "<em>Microsoft Edge</em>" App.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Finally, the "<em>Norton Security Online</em>" App has a lot more options than the "<em>Microsoft Windows Defender Antivirus</em>" App, as I have just found out that they have rebranded it. But it is itself like an Old Johnny who was "<em>in</em>" maybe
 thirty years ago. I will eventually uninstall it, not because it is bad, but because it does not seem to fit anymore in this Square or Cubic "<em>Microsoft Windows 10</em>" World.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe this is the present and we have to adjust to it. As the "<em>Google Android</em>" Operating System has its own "<em>Google Play</em>" Store and the "<em>Apple iOS</em>" Operating System has its own "<em>App Store</em>", also the "<em>Microsoft Windows
 10</em>" Operating System will be itself soon confined to its own "<em>Microsoft Windows Store</em>" from where most of the users will be installing their Apps.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have myself turned on the Option to be warned if I am installing an App from a source other than the "<em>Microsoft Windows Store</em>". Maybe those few users that will be left and that will continue to install Apps from other sources will become curiosities
 in the near future. Feared as "<em>Experts</em>", although they are just a little bit more curious than the others.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; It does not seem to be a bright future, but what to do? I am reluctant in waiting for the "<em>Microsoft</em>" Corporation to tell me what to do, but the circle seems to become tighter and tighter.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Anyway, believe me or not, I am still using a copy of the "<em>Microsoft Windows XP</em>" Operating System somewhere. I do not feel the urge to possess anything anymore, as the World seems to be full of Computers right now. Maybe it is just an illusion
 and the Human Beings are simply not able to take this giant leap that the "<em>Microsoft</em>" Corporation is now attempting to force them to perform.<br />

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hi, pc-learner.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Great Reply!<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; And I was just praising this Forum for being less hostile than others!<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp; I do not know how you have read the First Post of this Thread. I have been quite explicit there. Please attempt to re-read it.<br />

<p>I still use Total Commander on all my builds and my desktop which I keep at Release.&nbsp;Brings back memories of the old Norton Commander from MSdos days. I love the dual pane windows and it just works faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess I'm an old Johnny now with about 20 years on you, and lots of time on my hands. Really enjoy running Insider Builds, but only on a spare laptop and in a few Virtual Machines on my main system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Insider builds I keep security with Windows Defender because as mentioned previously, 3rd party security does cause issues with Insider updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to agree with you on the windows uwp apps as they are just too basic to accomplish things. Guess it has to do with turning our computers into a smart-phone...lol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still old school on a lot of things, I have an original Surface Pro, that I hardly ever use, couple of tablets but still prefer my desktop. It is so much cheaper to build with high end components. Video card not keeping up, well just swap it out for a new
 one. Chip speeds have not really changed much speed wise, I run my i7-2600 at 3.90 GHz and overclocked the memory too. Can even run the new Doom with no frame loss with this ole girl. All of this on Release version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a great day!</p>

<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; At the first glance, the Error Code 0x80240034 is somehow related to the "<em>Microsoft Windows 10 Insider Preview</em><em>&nbsp;(rs3_release)</em>" App.</p>

            <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Hi, Johnny_55.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; It feels great to hear such impressions.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; As an attempt to upgrade myself to my 2017 Version (I have noticed that the Fashion now is not to be labeled as "<em>Open</em>", "<em>Pro</em>", "<em>X.Y.Z</em>" anymore, but simply to be suffixed by the release year), I have attempted to find a "<em>Microsoft
 Universal Windows Platform</em>" replacement for the "<em>Total Commander</em>" App made by GHISLER_Christian and all of his Swiss Family. I consider that this App is so good that I may be among the few users who have actually paid the ShareWare Fee.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; During the old days of NORTON_Peter's "<em>Norton Commander</em>" MS-DOS App, there was an even better Clone called as the "<em>DOS Navigator</em>" App. I see now that there are a lot of Clones out there that can still be used, to some extent.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I am not sure yet how to call the "<em>Microsoft</em>" Command-Line Shell. I used to call it "<em>MS-DOS</em>" Command-Line (from back in the days when it was based on the "<em>Command.COM</em>" App), but recently I had the unpleasant surprise to receive
 some surprisingly aggressive remarks on the "<em>Stack OverFlow</em>" Forum. Apparently, it should be called as the "<em>Microsoft Windows</em>" "<em>Cmd.EXE</em>" App. I am still referring to its Shell-Scripting Language as "<em>Batch File Processing</em>",
 until the next correction.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have read something about a "<em>WinNC</em>" App but did not dare to install it. I have installed "<em>MEGA.nz</em>"'s UWP Sync App and it feels like a two-year old playing with a cube - but at least it is working and I have not seen it crash yet.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I have given up on using even "<em>Mozilla</em>"'s "<em>ThunderBird</em>" App E-Mail Client as it is taking ages to load. It is plainly simpler to use "<em>Microsoft</em>"'s "<em>Outlook.com</em>" Web App inside the "<em>Google Chrome</em>" Web Browser.
 They have just inserted its Beta Version and each time you feel comfortable and adjusted to some Settings, they keep changing them like the views that one sees from a Roller-Coaster Ride. But at least it knows how to integrate with "<em>Google</em>"'s "<em>GMail.com</em>",
 "<em>Yahoo!</em>"'s "<em>Y! Mail</em>", "<em>Microsoft</em>"'s "<em>OneDrive</em>", "<em>Google</em>"'s "<em>Google Drive</em>", "<em>DropBox</em>" and "<em>Box</em>". This should break any competition.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Therefore - as I have previously stated - the only UWP App that I am still attempting to use is "<em>GitHub</em>"'s "<em>Atom.</em><em>io</em>" Editor App. The "<em>GitHub Desktop</em>" UWP App is still at its 0.8.0 version and it does not even know how
 to link to their own Editor, no matter how much I have tried to persuade it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; The Editor is huge and it is also taking ages to load - it is occupying around 200 MegaBytes of RAM even completely empty. I have realized that I have to start it only once and then to try to use it for several days in a row. The good part is that it has
 not crashed yet. One has just&nbsp;to ignore the fact that it cannot set itself as a Tile in the Start Screen.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; If I find it useless, then I shall go back to the "<em>Eclipse</em>" IDE, which looks really good and it is working quite fast. Maybe I should still wait for a few years until the UWP Apps will become useful.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I do not know what to expect from the "<em>Microsoft Windows Insider</em>" Program yet. I am happy that nothing has crashed yet - except for that small 0x80240034 Error Code.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; PCR Just PCR has warned me that the issues might not get solved even after the Final Release.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; You will start laughing when you read that I am still playing Oliver Twins' "<em>Dizzy</em>" Games that are maintained on the
<a href="http://www.YolkFolk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="The YolkFolk Community">
http://www.YolkFolk.com/</a> Web-Site. They have created a nice small Adventure Game Engine ("<em>DizzyAGE</em>") that is still working in the "<em>Microsoft Windows 10</em>" Operating System. Let us hope that they will be able to maintain it even in the future.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Enjoy the ride!<br />

<p>You mentioned WinNC which I have installed on a virtual machine and it does look promising. Little better graphics compared to Total Commander but because I am so used to using the one, never really tried learning the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yea I registered TC well over 20 years ago, my number being #48xx. I just find it faster than trying to use windows explorer, especially if you have to move a lot of data to various locations and drives. It's kind of a no brainer to copy or move files. What
 you see is what you get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you still remember the days when you wanted to load drivers, you had to manually set them up in the config.sys file, along with allotting memory just to access over 640k. My first system was a 286, with 1M memory and a 40M hard drive. That baby cost over
 $3500 back in the day. I still have a case of floppy disks.....lol. This was back before high speed internet, and we used BBS to get our warez. Original Doom was on I believe 4 floppy disks that took over an hour to dl.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We sure have come a long way. Glad to be part of the ride. Cheers!</p>

            Do you mean the glance screen? If yes, the feature to shut glance screen when phone is being charged has been removed( at least on my 550 too) for unknown reasons. Better use the feedback app to report the problem.

            Two ways to get to the same place that will let you use the old Settings UI
<br />
<br />From within Outlook
<br />File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; Manage Profiles --&gt; click on &lt;Email Accounts&gt; --&gt; highlight the account --&gt; &lt;Change&gt;
<br />
<br />with Outlook closed
<br />Open the Control Panel &lt;Mail&gt; app --&gt; click on &lt;Email Accounts&gt; --&gt; highlight the account --&gt; &lt;Change&gt;

            You do know that readability statistics are displayed only "when Microsoft Word finishes checking spelling and grammar"? That is, you have to manually run a spelling/grammar check to completion. Also, the feature is&nbsp;not available in all languages.

            <p>Okay, just checking. It's not something I ordinarily use (I don't run the spelling checker manually or use the grammar checker at all), but I just tried it on a sample passage, and I did get the Readability Statistics at the end (though it's very volatile):</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e55e3e9-6604-4a6b-b885-1e74edec5063" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>These statistics are rather amusing, since the sample passage was entirely lorem ipsum text (it required a painful number of Ignore Alls and a resolute determination not to try to figure out why some repeated words rated Ignore All and some got only Ignore).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I say, the dialog is very volatile. When I tried to capture it, it disappeared, and I had to Undo one of the Ignores and run the checker again in order to get it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, my dummy text building block is formatted as "Do not check spelling or grammar." When I ran the spelling checker the first time, I got the "You're good to go" message and no Readability Statistics. I had to
<strong>Ctrl+A, Ctrl+Spacebar</strong> to make the text full of errors and recheck (I guess I should have reset just one paragraph!). But this suggests that it may not be possible to get the R.S. if Word finds no errors?</p>

            <p>Thanks to&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Suzanne S. Barnhill c</span>omment I was able to discover this issue with Readability Statistics in Outlook. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While composing a new mail, I select REVIEW and confirmed the Language "Do not check spelling or grammar was unchecked. &nbsp;But when hit Crtl+A and checked it again, it showed part of the document was set to "DO NOT CHECK SPELLING OR GRAMMAR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears my Signature is causing the issue. &nbsp;I created a new signature with nothing in it, and the spelling and&nbsp;Readability Statistics popup with no issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore i'm calling this a Microsoft BUG as it should know not to check the signature block. &nbsp; The only way I can get it to work without removing my required company signature, is to manually select the text I want checked.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Agung,<br />
<br />
In some instances, some security software can interfere when installing Excel add-ins. For this, we suggest that you temporarily turn off your antivirus or any security software that's installed on your PC and see if it contributes to the issue.<br />
<br />
Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.<br />

<h2>            Copy is only taking part of the drawing</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've created a simple diagram in Visio 2013. When I copy this and paste into Word 2013 it only displays part of the drawing. I'm pretty sure the problem lies with Visio rather than Word because I get the same problem when pasting into OneNote 2013.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am able to edit the partially pasted image - right click in Word and select Visio Object \ Edit. When I do this I can see the whole image.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />

<p>Based on my tested, if the Visio drawing size bigger then Word one page, after we insert the Visio drawing as object, it will show partly in Word.</p>

            <p>I have this problem too. It probably has to do with the ability of Windows 8.1 to scale displays and font DPIs. It isn't a real solution, but for me it is an acceptible workaround to disable the compatibility setting of VISIO.EXE to check "<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Disable&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Display</span><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">&nbsp;Scaling

<p>Try a soft reset.</p>
<p><strong>Soft reset</strong>. In standby dial *#7370# and the phone's lock code (Nokia's default lock code is 12345). Warning!Soft reset deletes all your
<u>phone's</u> data, so backup your stuff before you do a soft reset!</p>

                    I am new to a mac. I have Powerpoint for mac 2015. When making a slide I want put a title on the slide, then scroll thru/preview different fonts to pick the best one. I could do this easily with Powerpoint 2010 on my pc. I actually have to pick a font,
 close out of fonts for it to show up. Very inefficient. Also, how do I make it so only english fonts show? thank you.

            <p>The feature you're referring to is <em>Live Preview</em> which is not provided in the Mac version of Office. You can use this site to vote for it if the feature request is posted or you can post your own request:

<p>
</p><p>As for font management in this version, I haven't quite figured that out as of now... Office 2016 does many things quite differently.<br />

<h2>            Drop Cap Settings</h2>
                    <p>I have to create 271 drop caps! Going through the dialogue box gets tedious fast! How can I change the default settings, font and size, in Drop Caps so I don't have to go through that dialogue every... single... time?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Devaraj,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to sign in to your OneDrive account using a web browser and provide us the screenshot of the free space available. You can see the space details once you sign in to your account on the bottom left corner of the login page. You can also provide
 us the free space available on the drive in which OneDrive is installed in your Windows 10 computer.</p>
