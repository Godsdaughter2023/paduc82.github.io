<h2>            What happened to my brightness bar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Alright I've already talked to a help person and they gave me the run around and provided no solution I hadn't already tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Restarted my computer</p>
<p>-My Display adapter is up to date (NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti)</p>
<p>-I do NOT have a second monitor</p>
<p>-I cannot change the brightness through my physical monitor (for some reason the option is grayed out)</p>
<p>-Reinstalled Windows 10 (Do NOT tell me to do this again)</p>
<p>-Unplugged and re plugged my monitor</p>
<p>-Switched cables and monitors</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yet, no matter what I have done my brightness is nonexistent and my monitor is stuck at a depressingly low brightness.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The well-known reason for this is if the currently installed driver for your graphics card is not fully compatible with your current version of Windows 10. Even if the drivers are updated but not fully compatible with Windows 10, issues like this can happen.
 For us to effectively assist you, kindly provide the information we need below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any significant changes to your computer that could have triggered the issue?</li><li>Have you checked if the graphics card being used by your computer is not the onboard graphics card but the NVIDIA graphics card?</li><li>How did you reinstall Windows 10? Is it through a repair installation or clean install?</li><li>Have you checked with the graphics card manufacturer to get the specific driver fully compatible Windows 10?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I built this computer a year ago and have not changed my drivers. The driver was updated about a month ago, and this issue has only occurred within the past week. There have no significant changes to my software or hardware, unless you count reinstalling
 Fall Out 4 through steam as something significant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install. I have the Windows 10 OS disc, as well as a hard wipe USB. I wiped my computer after backing everything up to my external hard drive, then I reinstalled Windows 10. After confirming the error was still there with&nbsp;<em>only
</em>Windows 10 installed (along with the basic drivers, of course), I imported the rest of my files from my hard drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;NVIDIA has always been my go to for drivers and since I haven't had any issue with my computer within the past year I don't think compatibility is an issue.

<p>Thank you for the response. yes, Windows 10 will be providing basic drivers for devices to run. However, specific drivers for those devices especially graphics card needs to be up to date and it should be fully compatible with your current version of Windows
 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having up to date drivers but not fully compatible with Windows would still incur several issues such as this. We also need to make sure that if you wouldn't like to use the onboard graphics card, you need to set your dedicated graphics card as default which
 you can also get the proper instruction to set it up from the manufacturer of the graphics card. The specific driver is also available from them which you can download from their website.</p>

            <p>Hi karenTC</p>
<p>This sounds like a typical problem if you are using a laptop with a touchpad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Because the Keyboard is integrated into the Laptop Case, something as simple as the vibration caused by typing can cause the
 touchpad to move the cursor or initiate a click, depending on the sensitivity settings.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You need to disable the touchpad when typing. Most modern laptops will provide an option or keyboard shortcut to accomplish
 this.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The following Keyboard shortcuts have been known to disable the touchpad on various systems. Press and hold the
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">Fn</span></b> key and then press either
<b><span style="font-weight: bold">F4, F6, F7, F9, </span></b>or<b><span style="font-weight: bold"> F12
</span></b>to disable the Touchpad.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Read the manual for your system specific instructions or contact the laptop manufacturers support.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let us know what you find.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Regards</span></p>

<h2>            Prevent Vista from Sleeping while Uploading&#47;Downloading </h2>
                    
<p>Is there any way I can prevent vista from going to sleep while downloading or uploading a file?&nbsp; I want to have my computer sleep after several minutes of inactivity, but as of now, whenever I download a file, I have to go into Power Management and turn
 off sleep mode.</p>
<p>Can I just tell vista not to sleep while it is busy doing something?</p>
<p>This also happens with my hard drive (i.e. writing a big file, computer goes to sleep in the middle of it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I may be wrong, but won't this disable the computer from sleeping entirely?</p>
<p>This is exactly what I do now.&nbsp; The problem is, I have to remember to turn off sleep mode when I download/upload something or when I'm saving a large file.&nbsp; Then, when it's done, I have to go back into Power Management and turn it back on.&nbsp; This gets quite
 aggravating.&nbsp; I would like the computer to recognize that downloading/uploading/writing is not "inactivity".</p>
<p>I still want my computer to go into sleep mode when I'm not using it.&nbsp; I just want to be able to download something, walk away, have the download complete, and then (when everything's done), have the computer sleep.&nbsp; The same goes for uploading.&nbsp; I have
 my computer set up to stream video from the PC to my PS3.&nbsp; However, 5 minutes into the video (which is, 5 minutes after I walk away from my computer), the computer goes into sleep and the video fails.&nbsp; I have to turn off sleep mode every time I want to watch
 something.&nbsp; Then, when the video is complete, I have to remember to turn back on sleep mode when the video is done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any solution to this?&nbsp; Or is this just another of Vista's unsolvable problems?</p>

<p>Yes, that would disable computer from sleep mode.<br />
<br />
I don't know anything about connecting computer to PS3. Don't know if that is relevent to your problem or not.<br />
<br />
I don't have a solution for you. Sorry.<br />
<br />
<br />
Correction :<br />
You don't have to disable it. You don't have to set it to Never.<br />
<br />
Try using a longer time period, such as, say, 2 hours ?<br />
<br />
Will that work ?</p>

<p>It's not just when connecting to a PS3, so that can't be the problem.&nbsp; It happens when I download a file from the internet, when I save a large file, or when I render a video file.&nbsp; Any time I am not physically at my computer and moving the mouse, the computer
 goes to sleep.&nbsp; I can't leave it to run anything without first turning off sleep mode.</p>
<p>This is extremely annoying.&nbsp; Does anyone else have an ideas?</p>

<p>I see your solution, but the problem is, it doesn't address the problem.&nbsp; The point of sleep mode is to save money on power by turning your computer off when not using it.&nbsp; Therefore, the shorter the setting, the better.&nbsp; This is why I have my computer set
 to sleep after a few minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, extending the the time to 2 hours would solve most downloading/streaming issues, but then the whole point of having sleep mode is sort of undercut.&nbsp; Plus, this is still a manual adjustment.&nbsp; I want my computer to realize that downloading/uploading/streaming/saving/writing
 all count as "activity" so as to prevent the computer to sleep.&nbsp; I don't understand why Vista does not recognize this, when XP did it just fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has to be a setting somewhere...</p>

<p>I got it figured out:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to turn off all of the machines in the house.&nbsp; Before shutting off your main PC, go ahead and delete what Dan says: Delete the idstore.sset file found in the \Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Roaming\PeerNetworking folder of your system
 drive (for example, drive C).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, make sure you TURN OFF ALL YOUR MACHINES, all of them.&nbsp; Start up the main one (with that file deleted) and it will then allow you to create a Homegroup.&nbsp; It will give you a password, but you can change it to one that you want instead.&nbsp; Turn on all
 the other machines, and they can join with that password.&nbsp; It will work, and that goes for an Xbox One Media Player too (which won't ask for the password but folders will show up now.)</p>

<p>We are a small business of &lt;40 people, many of whom use the free version of Skype regularly.&nbsp; We have a group of 5 who would like the advanced functionality (particularly the meeting scheduling feature) of Skype for Business.&nbsp; Is it possible to buy licenses
 for 1 person to schedule meetings or even just the group of 5 who really want that feature versus the whole company?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our setup would be:</p>
<p>Skype for Business Online</p>
<p>In-House Exchange Server 2013</p>
<p>Office Pro Plus 2013</p>

<p>Hi Julie,</p>
<p>A standalone Skype for Business Online plan doesn't have a minimum number of license when being purchased.</p>
<p>But please notice that if the group of the 5 people all need to attend Skype for Business Online meeting, a license is required for each of them. So you will need to purchase 5 licenses to let them use the Skype for Business Online features.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Henry Huang</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 error code 0x80070017, unable to install Windows latest upgrade , 16299</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer was shipped to me January 14, 2016 pre-installed, I do not have a disk.&nbsp; Hoping that the updates that came out at the end of 2015/beginning of 2016 were included.....&nbsp; I have been blindly pecking away at this issue over the past month or so by
 following prompts and don't have confidence that I will have success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run Windows Trouble Shooter multiple times and still my computer will not upgrade to the current version.&nbsp; It even at one point told me that all fixed after running, "Windows Update resolve problems that prevent you from updating Windows".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the computer,&nbsp; current version is 14393 and that my computer is compatible and with enough space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system also tells me that a number of previous upgrades failed to install automatically:&nbsp; 1507; 1511; 14393;&nbsp; 1703 and 1607 (this is a loose list).&nbsp; Some info seems to say that 1607 did not install properly and other info&nbsp; seems to show that it has installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Trouble Shooter has told me:&nbsp; potential Windows update database error detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Security and Maintenance as told me:&nbsp; restart PC to repair driver errors (have done this multiple times).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows update status tells me:</p>
<p>--2017-12 cumulative update for Win10 version 1607 for x64 based systems error code 0x80246010.</p>
<p>--feature update to Win10, version 1709, error code, 0x80246010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP computer and there may be issues from their side too that possible interfere?&nbsp; HP system has attempted repairs numerous times and for days.&nbsp; Seems to be related to EXN_2016 Intel RST driver for Win10/Win7 (gee I miss Win7) version 14.8.01042Ap1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some one, either Windows or HP has sent notifications that "drivers need repairs and to shut down".&nbsp; I did that a number of times and haven't gotten that message lately and after probably 5 times of shutting down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone to HP webpage to look for drivers and did a mass installation of whatever driver was listed for my model.&nbsp; There were maybe 2 that I did not install because it instructed me to "unload" files???&nbsp; I am not savvy enough so do not feel comfortable
 to do that (did I say that I miss Windows 7??).</p>
<p>
</p><p>A site I found on the net is saying that a possible cause is that the OS can not access c:/windows folder due to bad registries inside Windows 10 system.&nbsp; What say you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I try?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

    <title>Question About Windows Keys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lucas_gi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question About Windows Keys</h2>
                    <p>I have done much research on this topic but I got multiple different responses each taking their own stance on both side of this. My question has to do with the difference between windows 10 OEM keys and "full" keys and whether it's legal to buy a OEM key
 for personal use or not. I also want to know and understand the terms of using a OEM key. I am building my own PC so I don't have to deal with proprietary hardware, pre-installed bloatware, unnecessary expenses during non-warranty repair, and the ability to
 upgrade &nbsp;or replace single parts without buying a whole system.</p>
<p>Here are my sources that I will reference:</p>
<ul>
<li>http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16832416892&amp;cm_re=windows_10-_-32-416-892-_-Product - Newegg Windows 10 Home</li><li>http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16832588491&amp;cm_re=windows_10-_-32-588-491-_-Product - Newegg Windows 10 Professional</li><li>http://www.zdnet.com/article/is-it-ok-to-use-oem-windows-on-your-own-pc-dont-ask-microsoft/ - ZDnet</li><li>https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-10-Home/productID.319937100</li></ul>
<p class="contentStandard">In both Newegg windows 10 keys, the title states that both keys are OEM. In the specifications tab for both keys there is a disclaimer stating that use of the software is subject to the terms of Microsoft OEM System Builder License.
 The Newegg windows 10 prices are $99 for home and $139.99 for Pro. On Kinguin, I found windows 10 pro keys for $28.09. The price for local retail and Microsoft Store retail for Windows 10 Home is $119.99. I would like to save money if possible and buy the
 key through Kinguin. Although, I heard that it is legal to buy and use OEMs for personal use because you count as a System Builder. Iv'e also heard that it's only legal to buy these keys if you are a manufacture. Another thing I have heard is through ZDnet
 and that is that it is legal to buy the OEM but it can only be activated once and it will not work with hardware change because it counts as a new system. If I were to buy a OEM key and use it on my PC that I am building and I wanted to upgrade the system
 or had to replace a major part like the motherboard, CPU, GPU or the hard drive that the OS is installed on, I would have to buy a new key and could not reactivate my PC. I also heard that this is the case for "full licences".&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Can someone clarify the terms so that I know exactly what is going on? And what is the difference between OEM and "full" versions exactly? Is it possible for me to temporarily buy a OEM key for my system through Kinguin or Newegg
 until I have enough money to buy the "full" version of Windows 10 (probably when I decide to do a major upgrade)? And what kind of hardware changes can I do with OEM and "full" keys and how can I reactivate my system afterwards? And could I reactivate with
 the same OEM key if the hard drive containing Windows OS fails and I have to replace it?</p>

<p>I have done much research on this topic but I got multiple different responses each taking their own stance on both side of this. My question has to do with the difference between windows 10 OEM keys and "full" keys and whether it's legal to buy a OEM key
 for personal use or not. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>I also want to know and understand the terms of using a OEM key. </p>
<p><strong>This article gives a good analysis:</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>I am building my own PC so I don't have to deal with proprietary hardware, pre-installed bloatware, unnecessary expenses during non-warranty repair, and the ability to upgrade &nbsp;or replace single parts without buying a whole system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To make this easy, purchase a full version retail license, it removes any penalties and dangers of possibly invalidating the license if you need to change key hardware components like the motherboard or wish to transfer it to another computer.</strong></p>

            I did all of the above however the easiest way for me was to create the new folder. Once that was done then right click the mouse and use the rename command to rename the folder. however that is not working now

<p><span>Is it only on one specific contact? Possible that the person you are trying to video call is on offline. You may also check on your camera device if it’s listed on the application and try if camera will work
 when you’re on the Skype application.</span></p>

            I had the same problem going from Windows 7 to10.&nbsp; There are many more complaints about the problem posted in other places on this site.&nbsp; Nothing seems to work.&nbsp; Talked to a Best Buy emopyee whom I know, he had the same problem and reverted back to Windows
 7.&nbsp; Now I need to find out how to do that since I can't get into the computer.&nbsp; Am posting this on another computer in our house.

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this same issue. After multiple attempts to do anything I gave up and did a reinstall...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually did three... The first had no display issues, but was having problems installing graphics driver updates from Windows Update... so I started over...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second had the flashing display issue... The third had no issues, but still took a couple of tries to get the drivers to install...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish I had a better resolution for you...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try entering SAFE Mode at the screen where you Login...</p>
<p>Hold down the SHIFT key while you click on RESTART... Don't Login...</p>
<p>The machine will restart with a list of options...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once booted in Safe Mode, you can then try uninstalling your graphics driver(s) in Device Manager...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click on the icon just below HELP to "Scan For Hardware Changes" to reinstall...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it reinstalls the same drivers and the problem still exists, the next try click on Yes to delete drivers also...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I didn't try this as a I had a backup image that I could reload easier than trying to actually attempt to jump through hoops..</p>

            &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm having the same problem. &nbsp;I can do an alt/control/delete and access the task manager. &nbsp;I am thinking of using the "Startup" tab, select one task at a time and disable it on the theory that something that is trying to start is causing this endless
 looping. &nbsp;However, I'm reluctant to do so but don't see I have any other options. &nbsp;I have an HP pavilion dv7 laptop, in case it matters to anyone.

            <p>Found this in "windows 10 flashing desktop screen" and it solved the problem. &nbsp;I was watching the task manager and the problem reporting task was definitely always running. &nbsp;It was tricky to type in "msconfig"; you need to keep clicking and using the left
 arrow key to control the location of the cursor in order to type in the full command. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Hello!<br />
There is actually a simple solution to stop the screen from flashing.<br />
Step 1: Open Task Manager. You can do this by hitting ctrl+alt+delete and selecting Task Manager from the list that appears<br />
Step 2: In the top left corner, hit “File” and select “run new task” from the drop down menu.<br />
Step 3: Type “msconfig” into the box.<br />
Step 4: A new box will open. In this new box, select the Service tab.&nbsp;<br />
Step 5: Scroll through the list and search for “problem reports and solutions control panel support” and “windows error report service.”<br />
Step 6: Disable the two items by clicking the checked box beside them. The check should disappear.<br />
Step 7: Click Apply, then click OK.<br />
Step 8: You may be prompted to restart your computer. This is not necessary, but definitely recommended.<br />
If your computer uses Norton Antivirus, upon restart, it will probably be a good idea to update the Norton program (hopefully the program will prompt you to update). If you do not use Norton, you still might want to run an antivirus scan and even perhaps an
 anti malware scan.<br />
After that, your PC should be in good shape. Enjoy Windows 10! And remember, if you don’t like it, I’ve read that for a month you have the option to revert back to your old OS. If you want to, a quick internet search will bring up an easy step by step process
 (but remember to always back up your info before switching an OS!!).</p>
<p>Hope everything starts working again! Have a good night!</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I uninstall&#47;remove Trend Micro completely from my laptop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For the last week or so I've been getting a persistant pop up on&nbsp;my laptop as soon as I log on. Trend Micro keeps opening my C Drive Program files and I don't know why. I've tried to delete it but it won't let me, I've also tried uninstalling it from my
 program files but it's not there? I have googled and it appears to be some security software but I have never purchased or downloaded it. I am using Microsoft Security at the moment for my laptop.&nbsp;Is this a rogue file and should I run some sort of hijack software?
 If so what?</p>

<br />you need to install touchpad drivers from Toshiba site. Please check these drivers are Windows 10 compatible.
<br />You may try to repair Windows before installation. Run command

    <title>Issues connecting wireless - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pickpocket094  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues connecting wireless</h2>
                    
<p>I recently have returned home from college and I wanted to hook my xbox up to online in order to play Live.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I went through the regular wireless network process, as I have in the past, and tried to register my new wireless router.
<br />
<br />
It found the network I was looking for, and I typed in the password. Somewhere during the "saving settings" part of it, my xbox didn't got stuck on the screen and I was forced to do a manual restart after waiting about 15 minutes.
<br />
<br />
From then on, whenever I try and register for wireless, it has the network I had previously listed as my default wireless, complete with check in the upright corner, but it constantly connects and disconnects. I tried to hit "Y" and disconnect, but it immediately
 pops back up. <br />
<br />
Since then, I have tried to unplug my router, at which point it was still identifying the same wireless. The only progress I've been able to make is when I disconnect the main modem from the wall, it still chooses the same default wireless, but this time actually
 completes the scan to find neighbors wireless, well out of range. <br />
<br />
I've tried to do a factory &nbsp;restore to the console itself, but the problem seems to be the only thing that is left over.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
(For the record, my wireless adapter connected to the xbox is a linksys, not an Xbox official one.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think if you are using a usb wireless adapter, only the microsoft certified are guaranteed to work properly with the wireless connectivity software on the xbox. Now if you are using a wireless access point, then it should be configured via a computer with
 your network ssid, security type and password. It is connected to xbox via a network cable and no special wireless settings required on the xbox.
</p>
<p>In order to help we need equipment specs......wireless adapter specs &nbsp;and router specs.

    <title>Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> malesoun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Super Street Fighter IV Arcade Edition</h2>
                    
<p>As there is no forum for SSFIV yet (no doubt it will turn up after the DLC/retail disc for arcade edition is released), I thought I would start a discussion thread for this here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this <a href="http://www.push-start.co.uk/xbox/super-street-fighter-iv-arcade-edition-achievements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>&nbsp;is to believed then the new achievements will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Awakening – As if you could ever defeat Evil Ryu in Arcade Mode on the hardest difficulty. See for yourself! – 50G
</li><li>Birth of the Oni – To surpass the power of Oni, you must defeat him in Arcade Mode on the hardest setting. – 50G
</li><li>Just Enough – Dude, just clear Arcade Mode on Medium or higher without using a continue with Yun! Piece of cake! – 10G
</li><li>Up to Snuff – Clear Arcade Mode on Medium or higher without using a continue with Yang. It’s simple! – 10G
</li><li>Overwhelming Power – If you seek power, clear Arcade Mode on Medium or higher without using a continue with Evil Ryu. – 10G
</li><li>Transcendent – Ascend beyond oneself by clearing Arcade Mode on Medium or higher without using a continue with Oni. – 10G
</li><li>New Threads – Use a new Title and Icon, and fight in one Xbox Live match. Right on! – 10G
</li><li>Prep Time - You need study materials to make your battle plan. &nbsp;Follow one player in the Leaderboards. - 10G
</li></ul>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see the first two being a problem for me, I have only just managed to clear SSFIV on Hardest and there is no doubt in my mind that there will be conditions for meeting Evil Ryu and Oni that will make this a challenge.</p>

<p>My pre-order arrived yesterday and I managed a couple of hours on this last night. &nbsp;Evil Ryu and Oni play just like improved versions of Ryu and Akuma, much like I expected, and I felt very comfortable with them. &nbsp;Yun was easy enough for me to pick up but
 I didn't find the same with Yang.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not noticing any major differences with my main, Gouken, but I was getting slightly more wins than normal last night. &nbsp;Need to remember that his counter has changed though (could be a bit disorientating if switching between Vanilla and AE).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A small disappointment in that there is not unique opening scene's to the Rival battles, feels like they rushed this part. &nbsp;</p>
