            <p>Dear Community Members,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you for your inquiry. We are sorry that you’re experiencing an issue with your Logitech webcam.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
We have discovered that this is linked to a change Microsoft made in the Windows 10 Anniversary Edition where support of compressed MJPG and H.264 streams for webcams was dropped.<br />
<br />
Microsoft is working on an update to address the issue, but at this time we do not have an estimate for when it will be available. We will provide updates on this forum page as we learn more:<br />
<br />

Warm regards,<br />

            The only solution that works is if I uninstall the anniversary Windows 10 edition.<br />
<br />
The strange thing is that I have an identical machine to my wife's, same motherboard same memory same hard drive…<br />
<br />
I simply had to plug my camera into the USB 3 and it worked, the same trick failed on my wife's machine.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 not detecting my microphone</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm having a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have headphones with a microphone attached, and I want Windows to detect my microphone, but it won't. My computer has only one jack, which is a headphone jack. I bought a splitter to combine my mic and my headset wires into the jack, and when I plug it
 in, it doesn't detect an external microphone.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>I have checked it with another device. I checked it on my older computer (which uses Windows 7 and has a microphone and headphone jack) it it worked perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried methods like:</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Reinstalling sound drivers</p>
<p>&nbsp;-Checking to see if the microphone had any drivers that it needed</p>
<p>but nothing has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My sound on my computer works perfectly, and I have made sure the microphone I am using is not disabled.</p>

            <p>I'm trying to use a combo headphone/mic that came with Dragon Naturally Speaking, as well as an oId Labtec AM-232 mic, with Windows 10 Home on a new Lenovo desktop.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both these devices worked just fine with the standard Realtek driver on my Windows 7 laptop, but Windows 10 can't see either of them.&nbsp;&nbsp; They also both worked on my old XP desktop.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Labtec was bought by Logitec a while ago, and my mic isn't made anymore, so I can't find a specific driver for it, but as I say, this hasn't been a problem before.&nbsp; Also used the Dragon device on multiple versions of Dragon in XP and Win 7. &nbsp; So it doesn't
 seem that there's anything exotic about either device that the native Realtech driver shouldn't be able to handle.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something simple I can do to rectify this?&nbsp; Given that this is a new machine, I don't want to void my warranty by messing around with something that's risky.&nbsp;&nbsp; I appreciate any help you can offer.&nbsp; I've had so many time-consuming things to deal
 with since getting this machine, Windows 10 is driving me nuts.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hi Sangeeta --</p>
<p>As I noted above, this is a new PC so I don't want to do anything risky with it that would void the warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Fix Sound Problems page in Windows help (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-sound-problems#v1h=tab01), I've done everything except the last bullet</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If that didn't work, try using the generic audio driver that comes with Windows. Here's how: in
<span>Device Manager,</span> right-click (or tap and hold) your audio driver &gt;
<span>Update driver software...</span> &gt; <span>Browse my computer for driver software
</span>&gt; <span>Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer,</span> select
<span>High Definition Audio Device,</span> select <span>
Next,</span> and follow the&nbsp;instructions to install it. </p>
</li></ul>
<p>I didn't do that because following those instructions brings up a warning box that says the
<span>High Definition Audio Device driver can't be verified as compatible -- and if it's not compatible the hardware won't work correctly and the computer may become unstable or stop working all together.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>In the instructions above Arul_D also suggests running DISM.exe, saying that "</span><span>It detects incorrect manifests, cabinets or registry data, it may replace the incorrect data with corrected version available."&nbsp;
 I've always been told not to mess with registry data</span><span>.&nbsp; If something went wrong, I'd have to restore the system to factory default and that would mean I'd have to start from scratch to install all the applications I've been loading
 onto the machine -- and I'd be right where I started with no working microphone.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>That's why I asked for any other ideas that wouldn't potentially cause a major problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any other ideas?</p>

<h3> volkan akkale  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto repair loop. Can&#8217;t get into laptop.</h2>
                    I am using an ASUS X550LB laptop that came with win 8 and i later upgraded to win 10 a few years ago. It has been stuck in an automatic repair loop where it says “preparing automatic repair,” goes to a black screen for a few minutes and then shows the
 blue crash screen for a split second before restarting on its own and repeating the process. I cant do anything suggested by other forums because I cant even access any menu or interface. Immediately before this problem arose, I was getting another blue screen
 that gave an error code that looked something like 0x00000001 (i cant remember exactly) and prompted me to pick between pressing F1,F2, and F8 as best as i can remember. After trying all of the options on that screen for an hour or two, the new auto repair
 problem came up and I cant do anything without getting into a menu or the repair screen but that never loads up since it crashes before ever getting there.

<br />If the laptop has a removable battery, remove it, connect the AC charger then boot it up to see if it still continues the auto-repair boot loop. If it does, try the following:
<br />
<br />	Power on and off your computer three times
<br />
<br />How do you do that?
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off

<br />
<br />If not, boot into the recovery environment again, then try performing a startup repair.
<br />
<br />Perform the startup repair a couple more times then restart again to see if you are able to boot to the desktop successfully. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, boot into the recovery environment, then click 'Go back to previous version of Windows'

<br />If that does not work.

            Please run the Microsoft Genuine Diagnostics Tool then copy and paste the results in a reply here for further analysis:<br />

<br />
Microsoft's Response: Microsoft is committed to helping prevent software piracy, which often results in end users being the victims of software counterfeiters. Counterfeiters abuse product keys to create fake software packages and distribute these to the public.
 These packages are not licensed, do not have Microsoft support, and can also include dangerous malware and spyware.
<br />
<br />
Recently there have been a few keys purchased from auction sites showing up here as non genuine, they appear to be connected to this HROnline code HrOnline: 0xC004C4A2. If you purchased a key from EBAY please realize that the seller may have sold that key to
 multiple people resulting in that key becoming blacklisted. These keys were never meant for resale, they were meant for software development or evaluation depending on the program they were obtained through. If you purchased one of these keys and it has become
 non-genuine with the above code you may need purchase a new license for windows 7. Attempt to validate by going to www.microsoft.com/geniune and follow the links provided to repair windows.<br />
<br />
Added note. You only have a limited amount of time (45 days I believe) to file a claim with the auction sites. Stay away from these keys, if you purchased a key that has turned non-genuine and are within the 45 days of purchase file a claim. There are legitimate
 software vendors on auction sites but if it sounds to good to be true then don't buy it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;It seems you are running a license intended for a particular channel. Yes, you might have a perfectly looking hologram disk, but this doesn't mean the license is legitimate since its easy these days to make hologram disks. Persons who work at the factory can
 secretly create hologram disks they resell on the black market or purchase press machines to do the job.<br />
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Additional information<br />
<br />
Things to watch out for.<br />
<br />
Lately there have been several reports of instances of blocked MSDN keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media and reciepts, if you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the store you purchased
 it from and report it to www.microsoft.com/piracy&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you have purchased a key, with or without DVD's or packaging from EBAY or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN key because your key has been blocked you can check a few things yourself, if you received your key with the physical product
 go to www.microsoft.com/howtotell and verify your product however some counterfeit software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.<br />
<br />
To check your PID press the win key and pause at the same time, or open system properties through the control panel, scroll down to activation section and look at the PID It will look something like this 12345-067-1234567-54321, the portion you are interested
 in is the three digit section, if it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have an MSDN key.<br />
<br />
065, 066, 067, 068 for Ultimate, 220, 221 area for Pro and the 230, 231, 221, 232 area for premium, there are probably others but they should be close to those posted<br />
<br />
About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys <br />
They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose
 is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside
 of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses
 it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.<br />
<br />
In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere along
 the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.<br />

<h2>            ASP.Net WebInstaller takes hours to install&#47;cancel the installation</h2>
                    <p>I am downloading ASP.Net but I am stuck at the setup.</p>
<p>The Web Installer 5.0 comes up and I accept the terms but it takes hours but still the installation remains in the same status.</p>
<p>Last time I force shut down my pc and run the setup again it showed me some error(Azure Emulator cannot run without Localdb...)</p>
<p>so I made a system restore and ran the setup again.</p>
<p>If I choose to cancel it takes more time to even cancel it.</p>
<p><strong>Can anyone please let me know whether there are any alternate ways(or links) in which I can download and run the software.</strong> I am doing a training course on asp.net.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h3> toadthetoad  say:</h3>
<h2>            2 Xboxs, 1 Account</h2>
                    
<p>I own two 360s (one launch day one that is still humming along and a new slim one) with just 1 gold account (after all, I am just one person) and when I got them new one I did a license transfer for all of my downloads to it. I just bought a game on XBLA
 to play on my old one but I can't seem to find a way to do this. Is there a way to move the license for just one game to another console (or more fairly, play all of the games I purchased on both consoles that I own)? I've been searching for a while and can't
 find an answer to this question.</p>

<p><span>I am sorry to inform you that this cannot be changed because that is logo (color) for Groove music and changing which can cause copyright issues. You can customize the color inside the app however
 you will not able to change the color of the logo unless Microsoft (app developer) changes it.

                    My internet was working fine earlier but now it keeps saying "unidentified network" and I know it's not my internet because I have another laptop that is using the same internet just fine. Then when I try to troubleshoot it says "the default gateway is
 not available"...any suggestions?

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue you are experiencing may have been caused by an outdated driver.<br />
<br />
We would like to know more about your concern. Would you happen to remember which update causes the issue?<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, to help resolve your concern, we suggest that you install the latest printer driver for your device. To download and install drivers in Windows 8.1, refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15046/windows-8-download-install-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
If you suspect that an update causes the issue, you can consider performing a rollback for the printer driver. To do this, refer to the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Device Manager</strong> by pressing <strong>Windows key</strong> +
<strong>R</strong>, type <em><strong>devmgmt.msc</strong></em>, and then hit <strong>
Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Expand <strong>Printers</strong>. If your printer is not located in Printers, then you can consider checking it under
<strong>Other devices</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Right-click the printer driver, and then click <strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Choose <strong>Driver</strong> tab.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Roll back driver</strong>.<br />
</li><li><strong>Restart</strong> your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If Roll back Driver option is not available, then you can uninstall the printer driver and then restart your computer. In that way, a computer will install the default driver for your printer driver.<br />
<br />

<h2>            windows will not load from my user folder.  apparently using default.migrated&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I went home last night and left my windows 10 laptop updating. &nbsp;When i returned this morning and logged on i find a nearly empty desktop, all of my task bar items are gone and numerous startups have not started up. &nbsp;My user folder&nbsp;C:\Users\George is still
 there, but it is as if it is not being used. There is a folder&nbsp;C:\Users\default.migrated which has nothing in it and windows must be using it, because my documents folder is empty, unlike my populated&nbsp;C:\Users\George documents folder which is I left it last
 night. &nbsp;I cannot change users, because the control panel only shows one user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even tried logging on as local user, instead of with my Microsoft account, but still won't load things in my&nbsp;C:\Users\George folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely someone else has suffered this same dilemma and reached a solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note, ever since i updated to 10 from 8.1, Cortana "ask me anything" has been missing from the task bar, even through upgrade from 10 to 10.1 and numerous updates, but now, strangely enough, there she is on the task bar.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>"Default. Migrated" <span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span>folder was appeared because you have upgraded Windows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>"Default. Migrated" <span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span>folder was a path that contained your user account settings and data.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can leave it alone, as it contains migrated user settings and data.</span></p>

<br />
Another method to rebuild the icon cache in Vista:<br />
<br />
1. Right-click a blank area of your desktop and select <strong>Personalize</strong>.
<br />
<br />
2. Click <strong>Adjust Screen Resolution</strong>.<br />
<br />
3. On the <strong>Colors</strong> drop down menu, select<strong> Medium (16 bit)</strong>.<br />
<br />
4. Click <strong>Apply</strong>.<br />
<br />
5. When Windows asks you if you want to keep these settings, click <strong>No</strong> to revert your color depth to 32 bits.<br />
<br />
6. Restart your computer.<br />
<br />
If nothing worked, open <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>regedit</strong> and press the ENTER key. Browse to this registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Icons and export it as a text file (<strong>File</strong>,
<strong>Export</strong>). Repeat the same steps on this registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ShellIconOverlayIdentifiers. Paste the content of both text files into a reply to this message so that we can take a

            What is the Status and Edition listed in activation settings? Also run the troubleshooter there and report back what it finds.<br /><br />How was Windows originally activated on the PC? Enterprise is only used by businesses and organizations which activate with mass activation keys or volume license keys. Is it possible a shop or someone else activated or reactivated your install with an illegal key meant for Enterprise?

<p>I tried the troubleshooter, It just said I need a Enterprize key. I'm away from the machine now, will get you screen shots later today.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The whole thing is a bit weird, I didn't get a pro key when I did the order, but it shows I paid $99, so the order went through. I did another order (pro to workstation for another machine ) earlier in the day and everything was normal I got email and key.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What it looks like is I got updated to Windows 10 enterprise, (finger check ??? I don't know).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it's a different build than home, I most likely will need to reinstall windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is I don't have a windows 10 pro activation key ( the activation key doesn't show up on the order online, although the order itself does).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further I can't get hold of a person either on the phone or via online chat. to resolve the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't want and shouldn't need to to buy a new windows 10 pro activation.</p>

            I asked you how Windows 10 on the PC was originally activated.  Was this the free Upgrade, and if so from what Windows edition; or was it Factory installed WIndows 10, or a retail key purchased separately?  
<br />
<br />Do you know how Enterprise came to be installed on the PC?  It would not be Upgraded but had to be installed and is only to be used by business or organizations activating using special Volume or Mass Activation Keys.  
<br />
<br />If you know you originally had WIndows 1o Home Activated on the PC, then it will reactivate if you reinstall it following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />Skip the Product Key during install and it will reactivate with the Digital License assigned when it was first Upgraded after you connect to the internet.  
<br />
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br /> .
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I actually got to Microsoft tech support, and after about 4 hours got the problem was resolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everyone, me included, wondered how I got the enterprise edition loaded (most likely my finger check).&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>The fix was to reinstall windows 10 pro, and have a windows 10 pro product key generated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They did a great job, once I got in contact with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: the upgrade pattern on machine was: win 8 home to win 10 home and now finally to win 10 pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>

            Glad to hear it.  Did they acknowledge receipt of your $99 Upgrade in Store and issue a Pro key based on that?  I know they want the Upgrade done through the store via the keyless Digital Activation method normally.  So it would be nice to know if issuing a key is now routine or the exception.

<p>It was definitely an exception, it had to have a supervisors approval.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's some other thoughts on my problem:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>1: activation order: win 8 home to win 10 home (now to win 10 pro)</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>2: I don't remember the exact sequence, an option came up and I clicked on it accidentally (why it came up I have no idea)&nbsp; I had a conversation. going and was doing several other things on the machine at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>3: the Microsoft tech support team did a great job, once I got to them. I gave them 4 stars and should have given them 5.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>4: Microsoft should have an easily available live chat for these types of problems, as it is I went through enormous frustration getting to them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
5: the virtual agent system isn't working. It just causes frustration among customers and doesn't get the problems resolved. It needs an escape to live agents until&nbsp; a much higher grade AI available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
