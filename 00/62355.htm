<h2>            Automatic entry of email addresses</h2>
                    Windows Mail automatically enters email addresses on a hit and miss basis. How can I control what addresses are automatically entered?

            I believe if you click the Show Menu button and go to options .....then select the Send tab...there is a button to enable automatic addition of contacts after the third reply.&nbsp; This may explain the "hit and miss" basis.&nbsp; It only adds them after the third
 time you reply to them.

    <title>Netflix app will not start for some user account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prpman24  say:</h3>
<h2>            Netflix app will not start for some user account</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 user&nbsp;Microsoft accounts on my laptop, one administrator and two standard accounts. Netflix did work originally but&nbsp;will no longer load for the admin and one of the standard users. It still&nbsp;works flawlessly for the other standard account. I've tried
 uninstalling and reinstalling Netflix with no success. When I click on the icon in the start menu, nothing happens. No window opens, no error message.&nbsp;When I right click on the icon, I'm only given the option to unpin from start. No uninstall option. That
 has to be done through Settings/System/Apps &amp; features. When I reinstall Netflix, it always comes back with the same issue of not opening. Windows&nbsp;Store shows it as installed with no update available and&nbsp;naturally, Netflix's tech support is clueless.&nbsp;&nbsp;Has
 anyone out there had a similar problem? Is there a way to completely remove all files associated with the Netflix app and reinstall it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanx</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not made any changes to the hardware and it stopped working at different times for the different user accounts so it doesn't seem to correspond to any software updated or installed. I had tried the app troubleshooter prior and it doesn't find any
 problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The powershell command you gave me doesn't seem to work:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/df6fab81-5712-4b22-9079-7a129be29ee7" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>But through the blog site's&nbsp;process&nbsp;I did manage to get Netflix uninstalled. I wasn't sure if I had to do it for both accounts so I tried it on the standard account only to find out it had already been removed. I restarted my computer for good measure and
 then reinstalled Netflix on the admin account only to have the same issue of not loading.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled it from the school account the regular way, used powershell to uninstall it from the admin account. Then only reinstalled it from the admin account. Same issue, no uninstall option, clicking on the icon does nothing. No error, no attempt to
 load. Just as if i clicked on nothing at all.</p>

            <p>Shenan Stanley:&nbsp; Thank you for the help.&nbsp; It wasn't a direct answer, but it got me looking in the right direction.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Following your suggestion, I tried to install an older version (I wasn't sure which version was the correct version), but none would install.&nbsp; In each case, the install failed&nbsp;because the previous version wasn't uninstalled.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>What I noticed, however, was that for some reason, each downloaded application created its temporary install directory on my i: drive, an external firewire drive.&nbsp; I do not know why the programs would install there.&nbsp; In any event, I unplugged the i: drive,
 and this time, the temporary install directory was property created on my c:&nbsp;drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>To uninstall the partially completed Intellipoint applications, I&nbsp;interrupted the installation of the old version, leaving the temporary install directory on my c: drive.&nbsp; This allowed my to uninstall the two Intellipoint applications by pointing to the&nbsp;ip.msi&nbsp;and
 itp.msi files in the temporary install directory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Removal was a success!&nbsp; </p>
<p>I still haven't been successful in&nbsp;installing the new version (8.15, 64 bit) of the Intellipoint software.&nbsp; I receive a message saying that I don't have the correct version of the operating system (it's asking for a 32 bit version and I have a 64 bit version),
 but as long as the basic keyboard and mouse work, I doubt I'll spend any more time trying to fix it.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help and your prompt response!</p>

<h3> michael sn  say:</h3>
<h2>            HID Compliant Mouse Driver issues with scrolling</h2>
                    <p>i started having issues about a week ago, in file explorer on the tab to left with quick access etc. it would scroll up constantly, i have had this issue before months ago, i do not quite recall how i had corrected it at that point, may have just been a
 restart unplug and plug in after restart. now im having a more difficult time correcting the issue. i did go to device manager and checked on the drivers installed. i am getting multiple instances of "HID-compliant mouse", 4-6 of them, i went through and uninstalled
 all that were not the one actively using for the mouse, and noticed it was doing it again about 20-40 minutes later, after i got a sound notification that device was plugged in. i looked back and there were 4-6 of "HID-compliant mouse" drivers , (i also tried
 unplugging and re-plugging in the mouse and as soon as it saw the mouse 4-6 popped up right away. except for the scrolling issue i am having no other issues with the mouse. i was able to disable the problematic driver and now it is not having the scroll issue
 recurring (as of yet), but i keep getting audio notifications as if something getting mounted and ill see that the drivers for the mouse are back that i had uninstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be great as to why this is happening, as to why it keeps "refreshing" the drivers every 20 -40 minutes or so. and if there is a way to permanently remove the problematic/duplicated drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Hi Michael.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If it worked properly previously then let's see if we can roll back the Mouse driver to the working version.  Do this in Device Manager on Mouse device Driver tab, choose Update Driver, then Browse my Computer, then Let Me Pick from a List.  Work backwards until you find a properly working driver.  
<br />
<br />Then hide any other drivers pushed by Windows Update using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have any other performance problems go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Here are the Laptop information and driver page :</p>
<p>http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-list.pl?mdl=VGNFW599GCB</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And also minidump files :</p>

<p>The DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE (9f) errors reference the raspppoe.sys (RAS PPPoE mini-port/call-manager driver).&nbsp;These errors may be from the ESET software firewall which appears to be an outdated version.</p>
<p>I would suggest to uninstall the ESET/NOD32 software and&nbsp;see if the errors resolve.</p>
<p>Then, either&nbsp;install the most recent&nbsp;recent version of ESET/NOD32 or go with other security software.</p>

<h2>            Error code 80151014</h2>
                    
<p>Getting error&nbsp;80151014 every time I try to log in no matter what. I've tried restarting my console, and tested out a couple of different wireless networks. I've been an Xbox Live member for ~6-7 years and have never had this happen so I'm not sure what's
 up.</p>
<p>Also, when I look up the error code here (http://support.xbox.com/en-US/error-code-lookup) it says it can't find it. Seems a bit odd.</p>

<h2>            Webcam is not working in Windows Live Messenger</h2>
                    <p>My webcam will not activate on windows Messenger or when I click the webcam ikon. When I click the webcam ikon I get a popup screen that asks me If I want to allow&nbsp; a program from an unknown publisher to make changes to my computer. The publisher is webcamDell2.exc.
 I click yes and nothing happens. It sayst he file origin is the hard drive on my computer. My webcam use to work but I haven't used it in awhile. I think some settings in my computer&nbsp;are responsible but I don't know which.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Dale,</p>
<p>1. Was the webcam working earlier?</p>
<p>2. What is the make and model of the Computer?</p>
<p>3. Are you using an internal or an external webcam?</p>
<p>4. Are you trying to use the webcam with the Windows Live Messenger?</p>
<p>Perform the following method and check if it helps:</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Try updating the driver for the webcam and check if it helps. Also, try reinstalling the drivers.</p>
<p><b>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a>

<p>Does this mean you used this method to activate with the OEM key during the original installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the last 5 characters in the screenshot are different to the key you have for the OEM licence then input the OEM key again in Change product key. The error code suggest the code is in use on another device. I assume it has never been used on another installation.</p>

            <p>This has been a problem since day one with Windows 8.0, and through 8.1, and still an issue with Win 10. The obvious answer is Microsoft does not care whether we want to be able to create group lists with the Mail app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a work around on a Win 8 forum that worked until I upgraded to Win 10, and now it does not work.&nbsp; How to shoot the wounded Microsoft! The work around was to create a group name address, then type in or copy/paste all the addresses in to the address
 box, but separate each email address with a semi-colon. It worked fine on Win 8.1, and still works with my Surface 2 (RT) cannot be upgraded to&nbsp; Win 10. If you have a very large number of addresses for your group, this will probably not work or be fun to create.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Mozilla Thunderbird email client on my desktop and laptop computers.&nbsp; It's more user friendly.</p>

            <p>All right M/S, when are you going to listen to your customers.&nbsp; Distribution lists should be an important part of both the people and mail apps.&nbsp;Not only for your Home user community but also your Business users.&nbsp; The ability to send an email to multiple
 users without having to add each individual user to the address line is a big time saver. This was a problem with the Windows 8..1 apps but there was at least a work around.&nbsp; Now, with Windows 10, the workaround does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Mail and People app without the ability to create distribution lists is worthless and drives your customers to third party apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get it together guys. You claim to listen to your users.&nbsp; Here is your opportunity to prove it!!!</p>

            <p>Personally, I think we are all just to talking to ourselves.&nbsp; Microsoft is NOT listening, and does not care about this issue.&nbsp; It's been going on for too long for me to believe they are going to do anything for us. For small distribution lists, I can use
 my workaround.&nbsp; For large distribution lists, I use Gmail through the Google App on my Surface 2 RT, and through a web browser on my laptop or desktop running Win 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also use the Google App on my Surface 2 RT to access my Google calendar, since the Windows calendar app cannot be connected to&nbsp;my Google calendar. The Win 10 upgrade does allow me to connect my Google calendar to the Win 10 calendar. This my next irritant
 with Microsoft. If Win 10 fixed the calendar linking to Google, why can't the Win 8.1 RT calendar app now have that feature also?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>My workaround was to create a .txt file with the various groups listed with their email addresses.&nbsp; I copy the appropriate group addresses into the BCC field.&nbsp; Beats doing each one separately.&nbsp; I can also just use access to mail through IE instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's non=responsiveness to it's customers sometimes makes me think about switching to Apple.&nbsp; If they'd be more competitive in their pricing, I would probably already be there.&nbsp; Unfortunately, there are a few financial apps we use that are not Apple
 compatible.</p>

            <p>You'd be very disappointed if you moved to Apple then, because, guess what, in the built in Mail App you would have to type in all your BCC addresses. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get the more sophisticated facilities you want, you would have to install a 3rd Party App such as Microsoft Office, which includes Outlook; and is the most used commercial office product on Mac OS X; or LibreOffice/OpenOffice with Mozilla Thunderbird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your work-around is a solid solution for adding frequently used email address lists to the basic email programs included in Operating Systems, because that is what most built in apps are, i.e. basic solutions to get you going. To provide more would undermine
 the market for MSOffice/Outlook.</p>

<h2>            Ever since I got the Xbox One, I have had nothing but problems, and Microsoft&#38;&#35;39&#59;s support team &#40;if it even exists&#41; isn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t helping at all &#91;LONG&#93;</h2>
                    
<p><span><strong>My Xbox One Story</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> In no way am I inflicting threats or hate against Microsoft as you will learn in this story. I am still a big fan of them and have high hopes for the future, but
 nothing will be coming out of me until the following is dealt with.</span></span></p>

<p>I got an Xbox 360 in May 2005, and still have the consoles that I bought that day. They have been working flawlessly for more than 10 years. In fact, we bought 4 of them (3 in 2005, 1 in 2011) because my family liked them so much. My Xbox Live was always
 perfect, games were fun, friends were made. I talked to support some times here and there, but 99% of the time, the problems I came in with were left behind when I left.</p>

<p><span><strong>Fast forward to November 21st, 2013</strong> 11:45 pm EST (15 minutes before launch)</span></p>
<p>I waited for the entire line to pass by for around an hour and a half, and didn't leave with an Xbox because there were too many people there. They gave one away via raffle to someone that already bought 2 to begin with. I came back the next morning @ approximately
 9:00 am, where I finally left with an Xbox One. I don't know how many of you recall, but the Xbox One on the day of release had like 3 games. Dead Rising 3, being the biggest one. I stuck with it because I figured "Meh, the Xbox 360 is probably my favorite
 console of all time, we'll stick with the Xbox One because what could go wrong with Microsoft?" and oh, I was wrong. So, so wrong. At the time, people were only buying PS4 because they had a $100 cheaper price tag. I bought the One just so I could keep my
 stats, account, and gamerscore that I had been working on for years.</p>

<p><span><strong>Now, fast forward to some time in 2014</strong></span></p>
<p>My Xbox One broke itself. It now doesn't read discs, and breaks the ones it does. I had Evolve for less than 24 hours before my Xbox One devoured it. It cracked the entire center of the disc, and now it just won't read it.<strong> -$80</strong>. It also
 cracked my Advanced Warfare which it can only read after being put in at least 50 times, and that's if I'm lucky.
<strong>-$100 (Atlas Limited Ed.)</strong> - same case with GTA V. <strong>-$70 ($60 last gen + $10 for current gen upgrade)</strong> CoD Ghosts? Nope! The disc is fine, the Xbox just straight up doesn't want to install it, especially after all of the remedies.
 Again,<strong> -$70 ($60 last gen + $10 for current gen upgrade).</strong> Oh, and there's this awesome ticking/grinding sound that it makes when I put a disc in. I feel as if someone is just in there stabbing every disc I put in with a blade.<strong> TOTAL:
 approx. $340</strong></p>
<p>Another thing that this demonic console loves to do is sound like a fkn' jet engine when it spins a game. I'll put in something like Battlefield 4 (which has it's own story later), and it will scream like a jumpscare. The thing just vrrrOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMs
 for a minute or so (if not the entirety of my session), and it gets up to like 50 degrees (Celsius) whereas I can only imagine what it's doing.</p>
<p>Almost forgot about the controller. God, how I hate this controller in particular. Not the Xbox One controller in general, just the one I got. Man, is it terrible. I got a possessed box, seriously. Everything in the box just doesn't work. It drifts up, then
 when I point it down, it drifts down. The little "neck" (I'll call it) of the thumbstick is destroyed. It has a carving from all of the times I have pointed it up. Like, I literally just play and every time I do it carves when it is pushed upwards. Sorry if
 I described this so awfully. Basically, it is something that shows a defective, un-professionally made controller. I feel like I'm using a cheap Chinese knockoff controller. So, I bought a new one the other day,&nbsp;<strong>showing that I am still a loyal customer
 and still want to play the Xbox One.</strong></p>
<p>Not to mention the Kinect isn't even on half the time when it's totally plugged in.</p>

<p><span><strong>Fast forward to September 2015</strong></span></p>
<p>Alright, and now here's my current problem. After all of the networking issues ("oh, sorry, your network is limiting us from connecting you to this party" when it absolutely isn't or something like "you're connected, but there's a problem on our side" when
 there is no problem), installation issues (after every single possible solution), and the disc drive issues (described above);</p>
<p>I was on Xbox last night, chilling out after a good previous day of wrecking it up in Titanfall, and decided to play some Battlefield 4. So, I put the disc in. "Make sure this a Blu-Ray disc blah blah blah", so, naturally, I eject it. It doesn't come out.
 "veeeee VEEEEEEEEEEE veeeeeeeeee" is the sound this console starts to make. It sounds like a needle is just scratching the disc and I am hearing muffled sounds. It sounds like a robot moving it's arm (you know, that sound), so I look up some tutorials on manually
 ejecting this disc. Not only does it take me 24 hours to find something that fits in this pixel-sized hole (the one you have to poke into to push the game disc out), but when I finally do, nothing happens. I feel like I'm just pushing the entirety of the disc
 drive from one side of the console to the other. So, $-60.</p>

<p><span><strong>This console has destroyed over $400 worth of my property.</strong></span></p>
<p>Do you know what I could have bought with that $400? That's right. A PlayStation 4.</p>

<p><strong><span>Getting in touch with Microsoft</span></strong></p>
<p>Now, for all of the Microsoft fans like I am (trust me, I still like Microsoft, I am just very VERY disappointed in this train wreck of a console) this is the worst part of the story.</p>
<p>After all of these issues, I never really mentioned me getting in contact with Microsoft. That's because I just couldn't. First, I looked for an e-mail I could shoot them a message at. Nope. Wanted to talk to someone through their support live chat. Turns
 out they're all just ambassadors that know nothing about the console. Sure, <strong>
some&nbsp;</strong>of them (a very select few) actually give somewhat decent advice.&nbsp;I have a friend who is just a troll who is apparently an Xbox ambassador who chats with people truly seeking help and he doesn't know what the hell to do. The best part about their
 support team is that they all deliver the same automated/copy &amp; pasted messages over and over, as if Microsoft's building(s) are filled with a bunch of robots. Of course, none of these messages help anybody, like, ever. "Oh, your Xbox One exploded? Have you
 tried unplugging it?" - this is truly how I feel.</p>
<p>I once posted here and on Reddit when I first got the disc grinding and breaking issue. An MS employee responded and what they said was (something along the lines of):</p>

<ol>
<li>Turn off your console (yes, apparently they think this fixes everything) </li><li>Unplug your console </li><li>Blah </li><li>Blah </li><li>Blah </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If none of these solutions worked, your console may need to be replaced. Blah blah blah *replacement request link here* blah blah blah.</p>

<p>So, obviously none of the listed remedies worked. So, I clicked on the replacement request link which took me to a website where I can send my Xbox One in. However, this was going to cost me $200 to get done.</p>
<p>And then, I went back to Reddit and asked how to get my games replaced. A kind user gave me a link to Activision's website (for example), and I could send my broken Call of Duty discs to them and they would replace them for $20.</p>
<p>After this research, I just gave up.</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>So, Microsoft.</p>
<p>The console basically self destructed. Destroyed&nbsp;<strong>over $400 worth of my property,&nbsp;</strong>and you want me to pay an additional&nbsp;<strong>$200,&nbsp;</strong>and then&nbsp;<strong>$100&nbsp;</strong>for the games that your console broke themselves? Ha ha, good one!
 Not only that, but your support is a bunch of worthless robots. When I post this, I would like an authentic, original response from someone just to prove that it isn't a bunch of emotionless machines behind the screens.</p>
<p>For those of you like me that don't enjoy doing math, I have spent <strong>over $1,000 (incl. games &amp; controllers)&nbsp;</strong>(and more, when I get this drive replaced) on the Xbox One.</p>

<p>-</p>

<p>My name is Ryan Duncan (don't bother looking me up, this name is incredibly common and I actually hate that), and I support Microsoft. Over the course of 10 years, I have probably given Xbox somewhere around $5,000 alone. That includes my enormous games
 library, my many (2 Xboxes, 3 Xbox 360s, 1 Xbox One) purchased consoles, my Xbox One, my controllers, gamertag changes, game DLC, and tonight I am going to pre-order Black Ops III: Digital Deluxe Edition&nbsp;<strong>$120&nbsp;</strong>to add to the fact that I want
 to play the Xbox One with my friends. If this problem doesn't get fixed within the next year or if new, different problems develop, I will be moving over to something a little more...<strong><br />
</strong></p>

<p>...blue.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading if you made it this far. If you did, did you have any of the problems I talked about? Did you fix them? How? Did you pay? If not, go about the rest of your day, and again, thanks. Have a good one.</p>

<p>Ryan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I do hate to hear that you had/have issues with your console. As soon as the first disc got damaged, I wouldn't have put another disc in the console. First step would have been
<a href="https://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://myservice.xbox.com</a> to get a repair done. However, more importantly, the extended service warranty would have been the first thing I would have got as a big Microsoft support. This still would have
 covered your console. So without the extended warranty, you are stuck between a choice of getting the repair above or purchasing a new console. If it were me, I would have likely chosen the latter option to snag a 1 TB SSHD Xbox One or just a special edition
 on a 1 TB One.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As a side note, there are 2 chats you can do:</p>
<p>1) Chat with a Volunteer from the Community (Ambassadors, non-Microsoft personnel)</p>
<p>2) Chat with Microsoft Support (official Microsoft personnel)</p>
<p>If your issue was a hardware issue with a damaged disc drive, no sort of power cycling, different power outlets, etc. would have resolved your issue. A repair would likely be your only solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I personally have not encountered these issues but I also have the extended service warranty in the event they do. It seems like between 2014-2015 you quit having disc damage issues and then continued to play without issues (except the networking stuff)
 until the most recent B4 disc jam. Not sure if you are familiar with the disc eject process, but give the following link a shot to ensure you are actually finding the correct hole for the eject:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/manually-eject-disc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../manually-eject-disc</a> .</p>
<p>&nbsp;Once again I hate hearing the complexity and compounded issues you have been having, but as I mentioned above I would either recommend the repair process or purchasing a new console and buying the extended service warranty.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response eG x Thee Elf!</p>
<p>Just want to say I kept putting discs in because it took me a while to realize what the console was actually doing to them. It often didn't grind, and when it did, I thought nothing of it until my Evolve stopped working, and thats when everything went downhill.</p>
<p>I think in terms of repairing the console, I am going to send it to a guy I found online just to get the CD drive replaced as I believe that is my absolute biggest issue. From now on anyways, though, I think like you said, I will just start to download games.
 I have a 1 TB external drive sitting here that could go to good use!</p>
<p>I will take a look at the two chats. I'm not sure what the MS people will say about my issues, I think I have them all worked out, really. Just wanted to share my problems with the console. I really want to like the Xbox One but it doesn't want me to like
 it.</p>
<p>And regarding the manual ejection, I have tried, but for some reason, my clothes hanger (I used it to put in the hole) just either stopped as if something was blocking it, or kept going, past the point I think it was supposed to hit.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the response, I will look into everything. All I want is a smooth, as-flawless-as-possible console.</p>

<p>Ryan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;Although your online guy might repair it cheaper, I would advise against it as plenty of folks have been console banned for making unauthorized repairs on their console, regardless if they are out of warranty. I'd hate for you to spend the money on something
 like that, get console banned, and lose even more than you already have. I can only recommend going with the official repair process to protect you and your console although it might be a little more costly.</p>

<p>You can get console banned for fixing your console? Is this caused by someone possibly putting something in the console that can get you banned or is it because MS just wants to do it so it's all the same? Wow, this is just getting weirder and weirder the
 more I go into it. Thanks for the advice, nonetheless.</p>

            <p>Hey there Powersick!</p>
<p>I am truly sorry to hear about the console issues and I can definitely understand how frustrating that could be. To add to what eG has suggested, we recommend only having your console repaired by Microsoft. You can request a repair through our&nbsp;<a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/Pages/Welcome.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Service center</a>&nbsp;or by reaching out to phone or chat support from our&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a>&nbsp;page. Any form of self-repair or receiving a repair by anyone besides an official Microsoft Service Center will result with a voided warranty for your console. Also, tampering and modifications made to your console can result with a console ban, for further details, check out our&nbsp;<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/Home/CodeOfConduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Code of Conduct">Code of Conduct</a>&nbsp;page. Once again, I am truly sorry to hear

<p>So to add on to the excellence of the Xbox One, now I am being told that it cannot find a IP address? My NAT type says Strict when absolutely nothing is wrong. I've been playing on my 360 for months with out issues. I've been playing on my PC for months
 without issues. What the hell happened to the Xbox One? If anything it was a step DOWN from the 360. Now I can't even connect to a party to talk to people - I have to use my PC and my Xbox (Windows 10 Xbox App) when I'd much rather just use the console, but
 I can't. Oh, joy.</p>
<p>Mister Quimby,</p>
<p>If I were to just get a disk drive replacement, would that result in a console ban? I know JTAGs and crazy things like that certainly do, but what about something like that? My warranty expired long ago so I am not worried about that.

            <p>Hey there Schwank!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that a new issue has surfaced! As stated above, we only recommend having your console serviced by an official Microsoft Service Center. As we are unable to determine the outcome of an unofficial repair, we cannot determine if a enforcement action has been warranted. In the meantime, I would suggest running through the steps listed in our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Xbox One Multiplayer Game Solution">Xbox One Multiplayer Game Solution</a> page. When you get a chance, go ahead and follow the steps listed in the Multiplayer Game Solution and let us know how everything went. Thanks again!</p>

<p>I'm having the same problems as well. My GTA V disc is stuck inside and it won't come out. I've tried tapping the top, doing power resets, manually ejecting it. Nothing. This is the third X1 that I'm buying. It's frustrating that I have to pay $200 just
 to send it in and have them fix it.</p>
<p>Xbox One is nothing but annoying troubles. Power issues, disc issues, network issues. It's just not worth the money.</p>

<p><span>Hi MRMONEY,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You mentioned that you have found a solution for the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you reinstall XP to resolve the issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you been using this software on Windows XP earlier?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If not, I would like you to check for the compatibility of the software with the operating system. If yes, then check for any updates for the
 same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, reinstalling the Operating system could have been an option if the computer has many issues which are not getting resolved even after much
 troubleshooting. However, in this case, since it is only a particular program, we could keep this as a last resort. Or, we may not have to do this at all.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I see this game had a problem with C++ back in July that people were waiting to be fixed with a patch.</p>
<p>Is your copy of the game patched up to date ?</p>
<p>(I see a lot of people were having problems in Oct as well).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is patched to date, does the error specify a particular C++ version, eg- 2010 ?
</p>
<p>Have you looked for a sub-folder in the game install folder for a <em>vcredist</em> installer package (often with DirectX )&nbsp;</p>
<p>that you can use to reinstall that version of C++ ?</p>
<p>Or if you are using a disc version, you should be able to find an vcredist&nbsp; installer on the disc.</p>
<p>

<p>If you have not done any Windows updates or installed other new software it's difficult to know why the game would stop</p>
<p>running properly, as there should be no new conflicts.</p>
<p>I believe that most of the time when there is a problem with C++ the game does not work from the start, so an C++ error after playing</p>
<p>for a long time is unusual.</p>
<p>The problem is that Windows errors can be misleading sometimes, so the source of the crash may be something other than C++.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I know of to determine which version of C++ is used by a game is by the installer it uses. If there is no installer</p>
<p>(some downloaded games don't leave an installer in the folders) the only other way is if someone in a forum knows, or it is mentioned in</p>
<p>the developers support pages or the games Read Me file.</p>
<p>- If you have reinstalled all C++, both X86 &amp; X64 from '05 onward you have done all you can regarding verifying C++ is not corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Modern games don't use modified C++ versions as some older games did with C++ '05 &amp; '08, so the downloads you get from</p>
<p>MS should be correct for this game. I would guess this game uses C++ 2010 or newer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- It does not often help, but does at times. You may find a conflicting Service or Startup program if you run in Clean Boot.

</p><p>- Another long shot - You could try reinstalling the game.</p>

<p><em>"i think is the client that no work properly?"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibly. If anyone here has the game they may be able to help, but this sounds familiar to the issue people</p>
<p>were having back in July.</p>
<p>If Creative Destruction has it's own client program you will need to find what has to be done to repair the client</p>
<p>by inquiring with their support or forums, which is what I would have to do as well because I don't have the game,
</p>
<p>and this is the first I've heard of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I don't have C++ 2017 on my machine, but maybe if you uninstall 2017, and reboot 2015 will install ? Then try 2017 again</p>
<p>if you wish, but I very much doubt your game uses C++2017. Probably doesn't use 2015 either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"i not done any updates of windows"</em></p>
<p>Perhaps you should ? Some online multi-player games apparently require you to be on the latest version when using Win10.</p>
<p>I would enquire at the Creative Destruction forums to find if this is necessary with this game first.</p>
