            <p>Hi Carmelo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to Microsoft Community. From what I understand, it seems that you are trying to run wlarp.exe, but you are getting an error message. Please be informed that wlarp.exe is the application that is used to uninstall or repair Windows Essentials.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to clarify, are you trying to uninstall Windows Essentials? It would be better if you could provide us the exact steps on what exactly are you&nbsp;trying to do prior to&nbsp;receiving the error message that says it is not a valid application&nbsp;so that we can further
 assist you with this issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, may I know what is your computer's operating system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We look forward to your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your post. Let me assist you with that. Like what my colleague said, wlarp.exe is the application that is used to uninstall or repair Windows Essentials. What you need to do is to perform clean install of Windows Essentials. Since you are encountering
 the error message, it is possible that wlarp.exe has been corrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To isolate the issue, you need to download the uninstaller for Windows Live Essentials&nbsp;from
<a href="http://g.live.com/1rewlive4arp/wlarp.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://g.live.com/1rewlive4arp/wlarp.exe</span></a><span> and then run it. Let us know the results afterwards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you have successfully uninstall Windows Essentials, install Windows Live Mail here:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/essentials-other#essentials=overviewother" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Essentials: Other Programs</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To address your issue about updating to Windows 7, I would like to verify if you want to update your Operating system to Windows 7 or you will purchase another machine?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I look forward to hearing from you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Sharon,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for posting in this thread. I understand that you are also having the same error when trying to uninstall Windows Essentials.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>To troubleshoot this issue, try uninstalling Essentials using the CMD Line parameter method. Please follow these steps:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>a.&nbsp;Go to&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;-&gt;All Programs -&gt;Accessories</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;<strong>Right click</strong>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<strong>Command Prompt&nbsp;</strong>and select&nbsp;<strong>Run as Administrator</strong></p>
<p>c.&nbsp;Run the following commands to uninstall Windows Live Essentials:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>(32 bit) "<strong>c:\program files\windows live\installer\wlarp.exe" /cleanup:all /q</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>d.&nbsp;A dialog box shows status until uninstallation has completed</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let us know the results.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<br />
<br />Skype to Skype calls are free, you only have to pay if you need a Skype number and make also make calls to a landline.
<br />
<br />Make sure you add the person that you need to call and that's it.

<br />Refer to this.

<h2>            Windows 7 - Devices not working &#40;yet&#41;</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
I use Windows 7 version 6.1 build 7600 (final version I think, Academic license) and the following devices (that work absolutely fine under Windows XP and Vista) don't work under Windows 7 so far:<br />
<br />
E-MU Digital Audio System 1212m - E-MU technicians are working on a driver<br />
ASUS BC-1205PT Blue-Ray combo ODD - the bios (F8D, Gigabyte GA-X48-DQ6) detects the drive alright, the OS as well but won't read nor write anything (message - drive not ready); the ASUS technicians did not bother to answer nor to provide any firmware update<br />
GEMBIRD AUSI01 HDD (SATA/PATA to USB) adapter; the GEMBIRD technicians (appear to)&nbsp;have no clue so far<br />
<br />
Does anybody see any solution in the near&nbsp;future or should I say&nbsp;buy buy&nbsp;to the ODD and HDD devices (or to WIndows 7)?<br />
<br />
Regards
                </div>

            Hi stefan2009,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for visiting Windows Answers Community!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Methods to&nbsp;run the program in compatibility mode :</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Method 1: Visit the Windows Vista Compatibility Center
Visit the Windows Vista Compatibility Center to perform the following tasks. <br />
<ul>
<li>Determine which software and devices are and are not compatible with Windows Vista.
</li><li>Locate links to drivers and upgrades that will make your computer compatible.
</li><li>Provide input to help us improve the upgrade experience. </li></ul>
&nbsp;<br />
To get started, visit the following Microsoft Web site: <br />
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility</span></a><span> (http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility)
</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Method 2: Run the program in compatibility mode
When you select the compatibility mode option, Windows Vista emulates the selected operating system when you run that particular program.
<br />
To run the program in compatibility mode, follow these steps: <br />
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fkbgraphics%2fPublic%2fEN-US%2fVistaStartButton.jpg" /></div>
, and then type the name of the program in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box.
</li><li>In the <strong>Programs</strong> list, right-click the program name, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>. </li><li>On the <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab, click to select the
<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong> check box.
</li><li>In the list, select an operating system, and then click <strong>
OK</strong>. </li></ol>
If the program still does not work correctly, go to the next method. <br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Method 3: Run the program as an administrator
To run the program as an administrator, follow these steps: <br />
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fkbgraphics%2fPublic%2fEN-US%2fVistaStartButton.jpg" /></div>
, and then type the name of the program in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box.
</li><li>In the <strong>Programs</strong> list, right-click the program that you are troubleshooting, and then click
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Continue</strong>. </li></ol>
If the program now runs correctly, the program requires administrative permissions to function. For more information about how to force a program to automatically run with administrative permissions, see the "Step 2: Run the program as an administrator" section
 of the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:<br />
<br />
<div><span>(http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931362/ )
</span>Advanced methods to troubleshoot a program that does not run as expected after it is installed on Windows Vista</div>
If the program still does not work correctly, go to the next method. <br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
Method 4: Contact the program vendor or the hardware manufacturer
If a program will not run in Windows Vista, or a piece of hardware does not function as expected after you install Windows Vista, contact the program vendor or the hardware manufacturer for guidance about how to troubleshoot the issue. Typically, the software
 vendor's Web site provides a support section that you can use, for example, to search for an error message that you may receive from the program.
<br />
<br />
Frequently, the software vendor will be able to resolve the incompatibility issue by providing one of the following resolutions:
<br />
<ul>
<li>An update to make the current version of the program compatible with Windows Vista

For compatibility of the drivers check this link with windows 7 : <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

If all else fail You'd have to wait for manufacturer's to update the drivers and then you may visit the manufacturer's website and download the drivers.<br />

<h2>            Printing Booklets</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp; I trying to print a membership directory as a booklet.&nbsp; All the pages are in the correct order until I print where it comes out as two booklets.&nbsp; The Document is split in half and thus the page numbers&nbsp; jump from 16 to 35 and then from 56 to 17.&nbsp;
 I have tried playing with the page/print setting but nothing has worked?&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; I am using Window 7 2010.&nbsp; Thank you</p>

            "Windows 7 2010" or "Windows 7" with "Office 2010" installed?<br />
<br />
If the latter as I suspect - ask your question in a proper group - as this is not a Windows 7 issue - but likely a Microsoft Office Word issue...&nbsp; (Or Excel?)<br />

            <p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? See article for details:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_7-system/how-to-what-are-my-options-for-obtaining-windows-7/528163c1-0b2e-4ad2-a26d-7112851d1dc2"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">How to: What are my options

            <p>No problem if you ever get things sorted here are a couple more tips if you're interested :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might look into this it is the newest way to update after a clean install,</p>
<p>There are essentially 3 updates needed for a clean install of windows that will get you updated through April of 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB3020369 &amp; KB3172605 &amp; KB3125574 all can be downloaded from the M$ catalog using internet explorer</p>
<p><a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Install.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Install.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/windowsitpro/2016/05/17/simplifying-updates-for-windows-7-and-8-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/windowsitpro/2016/05/17/simplifying-updates-for-windows-7-and-8-1/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To manually install them you will need to ensure the built in windows update service is stopped and disabled first or it will conflict with the stand alone installers.</p>
<p>The easiest way is to download all three of these updates to a flash drive and never connect to the internet until they are all installed.</p>
<p>Then connect to the internet and activate windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise you'd have to switch your update settings to Never check for updates and make sure the update service is disabled before manually installing the updates.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Then start using free Macrium Reflect to use system images to a totally separate hard drive so you can restore your system if you ever need too</p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for responding.</p>
<p>It occurred sometime in the last 5 days.</p>
<p>The main thing I have done recently with software is Activate Office 2016, that was yesterday.</p>
<p>Looking at reliability history I can see a bunch of Metro app updates have been occurring on there own each day or so.</p>
<p>Yes I'm in desktop mode. The tablet notification icon is disabled, presumably as this is a desktop PC?</p>
<p>I ran the Start Menu troubleshooter 3 days ago before posting this, and there were no problems found.</p>
<p>Since then I have run the Windows Store Apps, Windows Update troubleshooters.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Windows Store App troubleshooter found the Store cache maybe damaged and looks like it failed to fix it.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Windows Update troubleshooter found Service registration is missing or corrupt and that was fixed.</p>
<p>Now my start menu has improved, but tiles are missing. All my programs are listed in the menu as New.</p>

<li>Run the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows Store App Troubleshooter (which also failed, but launched what appeared to be a working Windows Store)</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Run the&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows Update Troubleshooter (which reported a bunch of fixes)</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Run an Administrator: PowerShell and run&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</strong></span></li></ol>
<p>After step 3, my start menu was restored. Thank you for saving me potentially hours of troubleshooting. I don't use Live Tiles or Metro Apps (so I can't report if they were fixed), but the Programs Menu in the Start Menu is now back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further troubleshooting revealed that I couln't set the shortcuts on the left-hand side of my Start Menu anymore. I also had to apply the fix here:</p>

<p>CR's instructions fixed my "disappeared start menu" problem.&nbsp; For those of us who are not "power users," I add a few elucidations to his instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Step 3 actually is two separate steps. First, you run the <strong>PowerShell</strong> command, and then you run the longer command (which I am abbreviating)
<strong>Get-AppXPackage ... \AppXManifest.xml"}</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- You run both of those commands at a Command Prompt. Specifically, you need to run them at the Command Prompt (Admin). You can find that command by right-clicking on the Start button. A menu will appear, and you will set a few options, among them the Command
 Prompt (Admin) option. When you click on it, a window will open. Inside the window will the an old-fashioned command-line prompt. If you have worked with DOS or Linux, you will understand it immediately. If you have not, and if the window looks unfamiliar
 to you, fear not.&nbsp; Where the cursor is blinking, type PowerShell, then hit the "Enter" key.&nbsp; Wait a few minutes until the blinking cursor returns, and then do the same thing with the longer command. (You actually can copy-and-paste the longer command; but
 make sure you copy the full command, from the initial letter <strong>G</strong> to the
<strong>]</strong> bracket at the very end, and without any extra spaces before or after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- That second command also takes a few minutes to run. As it does, you will see a bunch of command lines scrolling up the screen. When I ran it, several of the commands were in red, indicating errors. The problem was that a Store App application was still
 running and blocking several of the corrective commands. I opened the Task Manager (Ctrl-Alt-Del), found the offending application easily in the Apps list on the Processes tab, and closed the Store App manually. Then I reran the second, longer command. This
 time, it ran without a hitch. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When all of this was finished, the Start Menu was back.</p>

            Hi. Steps 1 and 2 didn't do much but step 3 has restored what looks like the list of original Microsoft apps but no sign of any of the many apps I have installed. And there are no tiles in the start menu. Any suggestions please?

<h2>            suddenly cannot print</h2>
                    Windows 7 64 bit SP1<br />
All of a sudden, cannot print to any of 4 network printers.<br />
Troubleshooter says the printers are turned off.<br />
Printers are turned on; you can ping them; and we can print from 2 other Win 7 computers, a Vista machine, and a Mac OSX without issue.<br />
<br />
Today is Monday.&nbsp; On Saturday, this machine prompted that spooler.exe was trying to connect to the internet.&nbsp; Had never seen this before.&nbsp; Investigation said there was also a virus called spooler.exe so did not allow it to access the internet.<br />
<br />
Now, Monday, this machine will not print to any printer.<br />
<br />
Tried reinstalling drivers; no change in behavior.<br />
Tried looking for updates; noting important but let them install anyway.<br />
Tried restoring the computer to a week earlier; still no improvement.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have mentioned that Spooler.exe was trying to communicate with the Internet, there could be chances that the computer is infected with a virus. So to make sure that the computer is virus free, let's go ahead and run a full virus scan from Safe
 mode with networking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Boot the computer in <strong>Safe mode with Networking</strong> and run a virus scan.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</a></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Microsoft Safety scanner.</font></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0563c1">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</font></span></a></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Safety Scanner Disclaimer: There could be a loss of data while performing a scan using Microsoft safety scanner to eliminate viruses if any.</font></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">You may even perform a full scan using the antivirus software installed on the computer. Please do install the latest virus definitions before performing the scan.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">2.&nbsp;Try to print to any of the Network printer and check if it works. If not, then I would suggest you to Uninstall all the Printer drivers installed on the computer, unplug the Printer from the Router and then reinstall any one of&nbsp;the
 Network printer drivers and check if you are able to print. </font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">Note: You may disable the Windows Firewall and the&nbsp;antivirus software to make sure they aren't blocking the network printers. Once done troubleshooting, enable the Windows Firewall and the antivirus.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To delete the printer as well as the Printer driver, use the PrintUI.exe tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Printui is available in all versions of Windows 7 and has ability to delete printers (/dl) and drivers (/dd).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. If you have any concerns, let us know.</p>

            Thank you, Kevin. &nbsp;I appreciate the time you spent looking into our problem. &nbsp;Good ideas, but…
<div><br />
<div>A new part of the story. &nbsp;Noticed late yesterday that when Firefox was opened, instead of going to the defined homepage, a screen for Norton's Identity Safe Tutorial was opened. &nbsp;Looking into NAV, found it was not doing anything except displaying that
 screen; couldn't get it to do a scan, for example. &nbsp;Then my co-worker said that for the last several weeks, Norton had not displayed a summary of things fixed, usually tracking cookies, after the weekly full scan (overnight maintenance).</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, got onto the Norton site, found a way to get support, and after upgrading, everything is now working fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What happened to Norton? &nbsp;Don't know. &nbsp;Why did it choose to fw spooler? &nbsp;Don't know.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, after a day of deleting and re-installing printers, searching support, moving work to other systems for printing, etc., total wasted time over something that was not our fault? &nbsp;Well, at least we are up and running again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Bill</div>

<h2>            Skype classic will not log in, gives a java error, did nothing to my system</h2>
                    <p>As of today I can not get the normal skype to launch, it goes to log on but never gets to the password, the window is blank, or it will say I need java, yet I am on win 10 64bit, and never had this problem</p>
<p>I also hate the new version that launches from the browser, I have all the sound notifications disabled yet it still makes noise from any IM, even if I am in that window at high volume, changing the volume also seem to have no effect, I had no interest in
 the "try it now" if you will version.</p>

<p><span><span>I suggest you try this steps below and check if issue persist.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Go to Start &gt; Search<em>,&nbsp;</em>Type&nbsp;<strong>cmd.exe</strong>&nbsp;and right-click the result file and select&nbsp;Run as administrator<em>.</em><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: If you are on a 64-bit Windows OS, before you move to the next step, type&nbsp;cd SysWOW64&nbsp;and press the Enter key.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp;Type the following in the Command Prompt window and then press Enter each time:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regsvr32 jscript.dll<em>&nbsp;</em><br />
<br />
Regsvr32 vbscript.dll&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Regsvr32 jscript9.dll</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. You should see a message, saying&nbsp;<em>DllRegisterServer in jscript.dll is succeeded&nbsp;</em></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Then reboot your computer and repeat the JavaScript test using Internet Explorer. If you get a positive response, run Skype again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information helps.</span></span></p>

            <p>The Get Windows 10 utility only does a fairly basic check of hardware compatibility, primarily specific features required in the CPU, chipset and flags known incompatibilities the commonest one being particular graphics devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Manufacturers will only evaluate limited, newer hardware for running newly released&nbsp;operating systems, often because they would be current when issued pre release builds. They get no benefit for testing legacy hardware but to cover themselves anything not
 tested would be deemed incompatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel do not list drivers for the H61 chipset on Windows 10, these would be needed by Dell at least in order to incorporate them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be that your system WILL run Windows 10, nobody will confirm that officially.</p>

            <p>Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried three times over the last week without success. I followed recommendations to prepare the computer before upgrading. It downloaded the files for GWX, but it didn't install. Microsoft "Check computer status" indicated that the computer was capable
 of upgrading to windows 10. I even let the computer sit overnight, but nothing happened. I may contact my computer guy to see what he recommends. I have a AMD Radeon HD 6670 graphics card. My computer got a bit "weird" after the attempts, and required several
 reboots to clean up minor issues left behind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Worst case scenario, I can live with W8.1. With an i5 processor and 8 gigs of ram I have no trouble running anything. Good luck. Let me know how it goes if you try it.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Appreciate your response. &nbsp;The update process can be problematic. &nbsp;I have yet to read a clear post that states that someone with a Dell 620 computer has been able to successfully update to windows 10. &nbsp;In terms of my graphics, both Intel and Dell
 state that an upgrade cannot or should not be attempted. &nbsp;So I will probably stick with windows 7.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;There is a section on the Dell website that lists their computers which have been tested for update to windows 10. &nbsp;That section states that if your computer has not been tested, then it is not advisable to upgrade to windows 10. &nbsp;Mine is the Inspiron
 Desktop i620 running intel hd 2000 integrated graphics. &nbsp;I currently am running windows 7 home premium. &nbsp;Computer is about 4 and a half years old. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; jeff</p>

            Your statement was: "Dell says my Dell Inspiron 620 <strong>is not capable </strong>
of running on Windows 10..."&nbsp; (Emphasis added).&nbsp; Dell didn't say that.&nbsp; Your computer may well be capable, but there's really only one way to find out, which is by following Andre's advice further up the thread.&nbsp; I'm running now on a home-built PC with an Asus
 motherboard for which no Windows 10-specific drivers are available, but there are no problems.<br />

            <p>This basically means they have not tested your computer and therefore do not know if it is compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By definition the converse is also true, they have not tested your computer and so&nbsp;do not know that it will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran a 1st gen i7 with no issues at about 6 years old on technical preview. The compatibility check run during setup is fairly rudimentary but will identify key points, extensions in the CPU are required and a specific GPU issue has been reported fairly
 frequently. I have had the second problem on a Compaq desktop and was able to fit a card to get round that, Windows 10 works perfectly.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. Any files, but HTML and PDF are that really matters because Edge is associated as the default program to open those files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Yes, only Edge is broken. Internet Explorer works, Chrome works, all other programs work.</p>

</p><p>Sorry for the issue with your payment. Unfortunately, you are unable to use currency to pay a past due balance. You will need to use a credit/debit card as it is overdue. You can request a call back and speak with support agent.</p>

<p>I've contacted Xbox. I can login to my account. I've changed my Login for Windows live. But when I sign in to my account, all of my information is in another language. How do I change this. What else do I need to do. I'm a 40 year old guy so I'm not overly
 tech savvy and have no idea what I need to do from here forward.</p>

<p>When you called into Xbox support what did they tell you?</p>
<p>Have you noticed charges on any credit card on the account? Has your live ID been changed? Does it say your account is in a different region?
</p>
<p>If any of those are yes, I would call back and insist to file a UA claim. Sorry for the inconvenience! I hope this helps!

<p>It was moved to Columbia. They did buy 4000 MS point and tried to charge another 6000 which didn't go through. I don't know why it didn't go through because I have a very high limit on my card. I have already filed a UA claim but don't know if I should try
 to change passwords. Are these people using my account now? I just don't know what to do.</p>
<p>And how does this even remotely happen? I don't post my info on any websites. My kids are too young and uninterested to play with the Xbox. This is just baffling to me. This is completely out of the blue.</p>

<p>Broker, the 6,000 point purchase may have went through but then was refunded right away due to the anti-fraud measures MS has in place. If you have filed a UA claim then the work on your end has finished, all you need to do now is wait patiently for the
 investigation to finish. The investigation WILL take a long time, likely longer than the 21-25 days support told you.
</p>
<p>This is because your account has been migrated. They will have to re-build your account from the ground up, this sounds like it would be a simple process but it is not. Trust me.
</p>
<p>I could try to explain to you all the ways that they could get your information but we would both get bored very quickly. I can tell you the main causes: Giving account info to other people over Xbox live, going to websites offering Free MSP, not using a
 strong enough password, selling Xbox to someone else without clearing your info off the Xbox. These are the most common causes of UA.
</p>
<p>Some people will tell you that there are programs to locate the information on someone's account, but that is a VERY VERY rare circumstance.

<p>Suggestions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do what your instincts tell you.&nbsp; If you are unsure how this could happen, immediately change your WLID password and if set, secret passphrases.&nbsp; At this point I am a proponent of eliminating secret passphrases and use the Trusted PC function only; no SMS,
 no secret passphrases, no alternative e-mail.&nbsp; If the secret passphrase is guessable or if your alternative e-mail is somehow compromised, the Trusted PC function is your only 'true friend'.&nbsp; The SMS option is another alternative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Call your credit card company.&nbsp; Inquire.&nbsp; Find out if they accepted the first charge and if they received and then denied the second charge (i.e. their fraud detection kicked in).&nbsp; If either charge has shown (or any other charges from Microsoft services
 like Zune) -- work with your credit card company independent of your UA filing with Microsoft to have those charges removed.&nbsp; More paperwork yes; but it's your money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For my, while not proven and Microsoft won't admit to it -- I have enough evidence to suggest I was the victim of social engineering.&nbsp; I have plenty of SRs and account inquiries posted to my account / original gamertag that were not initiated by me -- several
 months prior to what is known as my first breach.&nbsp; This style of attack does not happen to everyone but it may be worth your while or interest to contact Xbox Live support again and validate the SR / contact history on your account.&nbsp; I received e-mails from
 Synovate (Microsoft's partner that sends out questionaires when SRs are closed) and phone calls from "PC Safety" apologizing for hanging up or losing connection on calls I did not make.&nbsp; Enough to suggest someone else was prying.&nbsp; Enough to suggest the source
 of the leak was Microsoft -- how else could someone map up my Gamertag to an e-mail address or other personal information.&nbsp; It&nbsp;was never posted anywhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some light reading . . .</p>
<p><a href="http://gameolosophy.com/games/sports/total-club-manager/how-hackers-get-your-personal-details-from-your-xbox-gamertag/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gameolosophy.com/games/sports/total-club-manager/how-hackers-get-your-personal-details-from-your-xbox-gamertag/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, if you have access to your WLID and can log in to your XBL account via your console; whether in Spanish or another language&nbsp;(Columbia?) -- at least changing your passwords and performing actions as suggested above will work in your favor.&nbsp; It
 would be less likely to be breached again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you come to find you too were a victim of social engineering (you could have played a game with some kid you taunted and pissed off who took it too far and jacked your account) after verifying 'extra' calls made at times you didn't initiate them -- consider
 changing your WLID entirely and moving your account to it via the console and changing personal information like address/phone number/zip codes, etc to fake or alternative data.&nbsp; Chances are, those people know who you are and know more about you than you want
 to ever know.</p>

<p>Well I am 40 years old. I don't go to any websites and I don't put my information on them. I don't do anything out of the ordinary. I just buy games and play them. Nothing more, nothing less. This is what makes it so puzzling for me. I appreciate the responses.
 I guess I will wait. Still haven't heard anything from Microsoft. Not one word.</p>

<p>Good luck. I had this happen to me as well.</p>
<p>I'm in the same situation except I didn't have a card on file so they were only able to spend my points I had on my profile. Also I mostly play single player games as well.</p>
<p>They've given me codes to replace my points and a 12 month gold as well. Then the initial investigation was closed with out them even informing me. I found out once I called back to see what was was going on with the investigation that it had been closed
 and never received contact in my email or alternate email. So I had them start another investigation and that was back in August. Also my account was Migrated to Brazil so everything is in Portuguese. The thing is I didn't even know that this happens or that
 they have Xbox down in Brazil until this all happened. This was back in July 9th and I'm still waiting to hear back from Microsoft. The last time I called the guy I spoke with seemed like he knew a lot more then people before me. Everyone else was saying when
 an account get's migrated that there's nothing that can be done. The last person I spoke to said that it when an account get's migrated that it adds about an extra month to the investigation. They have to contact the foreign countries side of things and investigate
 it on their end. He said they had to do that to override laws that are in place that prevent them from just being able to do migrate it back. It's these laws that prevent being able to self migrate accounts to the U.S. That was last week the last time I called.</p>

<p>Billowy, that's the dumbest thing I have ever heard. It took them less than one day to move me to Columbia. Microsoft needs to buck up and just give me the account back. Heck, just keep the $50 they stole from me. I just want the account back.</p>

<p>Hey Billowy they told you would get the account migrated back to the US? &nbsp;All I have been told that there is no timeframe over and over again and there is currently no way to migrate it back to the US. &nbsp;My account was stolen and migrated to Russia.........If
 what you say is true that is a relief and I hope I can get my full account back soon. &nbsp;Here is a link to my thread.</p>

<p>Ouch man, hopefully you are able to get it back eventually. Don't feel too bad, more than likely you were one of the many who had their account info leaked by either EA or XBL. Last time I called they said they were investigating it but since your account
 is already migrated it could be quite some time (months) before you get it back, if you do get it back.</p>

<p>Here is what I would like to see happen with this, and digital downloads.</p>
<p>Say my friend calls me up and says: hey, can I borrow your xyz game.&nbsp; All I have to say is sure, log into my xbox, go to his gamer tag, hit a menu that says loan game.&nbsp; tell the xbox to loan it to him for a week, and hit okay.&nbsp; Then&nbsp; he logs in, a message
 says, hey Vodad loaned you xyz for a week, Enjoy.&nbsp; Then in a week his license for it runs out and it comes back to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During this week, that game will not be available to me.</p>
<p>The only issue with this is, you would have to have the check in to transfer the licenses back and forth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now I do not normally loan my disc to people, because I do not want anything to happen to my $60 game.</p>

<p>you are able to loan your games all of them to 10 i believe of your friends, they dont need to ask you. add them to a list on the xbox and they have access to your games library. &nbsp;and the games are available to you all the time&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, but I have more than 10 friends, as I am sure most of you do. &nbsp;In my clan I have at least 25 people I talk to outside of gaming. &nbsp;So with family that have xbox accounts, I will be at 10 with them, so I would need a different way of loaning games to
 those that are not on the 10 people list. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If they came up with a system similar to this, it would allow game rentals as well, you go to the gamefly site, say what game you want, and gamefly's system would do all the loaning for a day if that is what you want.</p>

<p>Too easy to abuse. All it takes is a third party network of people who want to trade games to kill game sales entirely. There exist sites to do game trading now (Goozex). Removing the physical component from the trading would only make things worse.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to run Startup repair from Advance boot option.

<p>
</p><p><span><span>It may ask you to insert the Installation DVD/USB while doing startup repair.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you don’t have an installation media, you have to create an installation media for that.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may download an ISO from the below link:</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once your media is ready follow the steps.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>After you boot your computer using Windows 10 CD/ DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD". Press any key.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<span>Click on&nbsp;Startup Repair from Advanced Options screen.</span></p>

<span>Next, choose the operating system by clicking on its button.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Windows 10 will look for problems on hard drive(s) and verify that all required files are intact.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 date&#47;time formats for Finland - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eemelis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 date&#47;time formats for Finland</h2>
                    <p>With Windows 10 upgrade it became impossible to set the following date&amp;time combination for Finland:</p>
<p>"dd.mm.yyyy" AND "hh:mm"</p>
<p>This was correct in Windows 7, but now the time format is forced to "hh.mm" with a dot instead of a colon.<br />
<br />
In order to see the time in correct format I'm forced to use some other regional setting (like Europe) that allows the "hh:mm" time format, but the dates are then only available as e.g. dd/mm/yyyy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally I would keep using Eng (Europe) setting but so that the short date format was changed to "dd.mm.yyyy" as Finland has it.<br />
Is there any way round this so that I could use a date format which is not defined in the default options for a region?</p>

                    I was given Windows 7 upgrade coupon&nbsp;when I bought a computer.The compter seller is not responsible. There was no clear documention as date the the upgrade must be performed.&nbsp; When&nbsp;I&nbsp;went to do the upgrade I found it is unavailble. I feel that I bought
 this computer under false pretenses since Microsoft was offering an upgrade which I found out was a limited time. How can this be rectified

<p>Are there any deals for persons who acquire a PC with Windows XP or Vista today?<br />
<br />
The Windows 7 Upgrade Option Program debuted on June 26th, it provides anyone who buys a PC from a participating OEM or retailer with Windows Vista Home Premium, Business or Ultimate to receive an upgrade to the corresponding version of Windows 7 at little
 or no cost. The Windows 7 Upgrade Option Program will be available until January 31st, 2010 and is global.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of the OEM to provide this upgrade, not Microsoft.</p>

<p>Hello Craig,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question. Unfortunately, there is no way to view the adult account screen times. Reason being is it is an adult account and there is no limits for them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<h2>            The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck</h2>
                    <p>So my computer recently crashed on startup and made a bugcheck report. &nbsp;I tried scanning for viruses and found that adwcleaner wouldn't work because sqlite3.dll couldn't be loaded, but subsequent uses of adwcleaner don't give me this error. &nbsp;Here is a full
 report of the bugcheck:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bugcheck was: 0x0000001e (0xffffffffc0000005, 0xfffff800e479d8b8, 0x0000000000000000, 0x00000000000000a0)</p>

            <p>The make and model of my computer is an MSI GT722QD Dominator</p>
<p>I recently updated to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have restarted my computer several times without using safe mode and I have not had a single problem. &nbsp;It originally happened during startup, but since I have restarted the computer several times I would like to think that that means that either the problem
 was temporary or just a fluke. &nbsp;I have had problems with the Intel Rapid Storage Technology in the past with it not starting up properly and am wondering if this is a similar problem since when I started the computer up after the crash it said that Rapid Storage
 was not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know if doing Safe Mode or Clean Boot will do anything since it happened once during startup and not since. &nbsp;However, in terms of further assistance, could you tell me what that bugcheck means, as in what "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">0x0000001e
 (0xffffffffc0000005, 0xfffff800e479d8b8, 0x0000000000000000, 0x00000000000000a0)" says? &nbsp;I know it is supposed to say what the problem was, but I have no idea how to translate any of it.</span></p>
