<h2>            Nokia Lumia 630 -The phone is not shown in Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Hi Microsoft Team,</p>
<p>I am using Nokia Lumia 630 phone since last 15 months. Recently I am facing the problems to connect the phone to any laptop. It is being detected but didn't show up in Explorer window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting steps did so far:</p>
<p>1) Uninstall all USB and MTP drivers and connect the phone and reinstall the drivers.</p>
<p>2) Try different USB port. At some point it says USB 2.0 composite device is not compatible for USB 3.0 so update driver but couldn't fix the problem.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;Devices and Printers: used the troubleshoot steps from context menu but it says FIX CANNOT be applied.</p>
<p>4) Media Feature pack: Downloaded media feature pack from https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/confirmation.aspx?id=40744</p>
<p>but it says the Update is for Standalone installer and couldn't be applied on my OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Environment Details:</p>
<p>Windows 8.1 Enterprise</p>
<p>Thinkpad Laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me to get rid of the connection issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and Regards,</p>
<p>Mahesh R. Kulkarni</p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/fa63b17f-d60c-417e-be3a-83f09d7f12d1" title="marakulkarni">marakulkarni</a></p>
<p>I understand your problem.</p>
<p>The driver of Windows phone is shown in explorer.</p>
<p>Then its not a problem of driver.</p>
<p>This mostly happen when you have set the lock screen password for Windows phone.</p>
<p>And you haven't unlock it before connecting the phone to PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>SO unlock the lock screen and then connect the phone to PC.</p>
<p>And then try to browse files.&nbsp;</p>

            Do you get to see the device listed under Device Manager--&gt; Portable devices &nbsp;(with a Yellow triangle)? If so, right click on that and uninstall it. Now leave the phone connected to your laptop and restart it. Check whether it gets connected and shown
 in Windows Explorer ..

            Hi Herbie,<br />
<br />
The 6630 doesnt use over the air firmware updates (OTA), instead it can be updated on
<a href="http://www.nokia.co.uk/softwareupdate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nokia.co.uk/softwareupdate</a><br />
<br />
That page has full instructions on how to use the service.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There could be a lot of possible reasons when an app becomes unresponsive or slow. Lets narrow down the reasons by answering these questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did the issue start to happen?</li><li>Were there any changes/updates to your device prior to the issue?</li><li>Are there any error messages showing on your end?</li><li>What version of Windows 10 are you running? You can find this information by pressing
<strong>Windows key + R</strong> on your keyboard, type '<strong>winver</strong>' and then press '<strong>Enter</strong>'.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest running Windows 10 in a clean boot environment to make sure that issue isn't caused by software conflicts. Follow this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We look forward to your update.</p>

<h2>            Redirected to school login portal from work office</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently at work, using my work office account, accessing work sharepoints etc... on a work computer.<br />
I logged in to outlook online a couple of times to check school emails, using the school's login portal.<br />
</p>
<p>When I click on "Conversations" when I am on my work's sharepoint, however, I am redirected to a login page that is my school's, and there is no way I can find to change the login portal to my work's. Entering my work email address does not automatically
 redirect me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried logging out of my office accounts, but the address <em>office.com&nbsp;</em>automatically logs me back in (using either
<em>office.com/?auth=1</em> or <em>office.com/?auth=2</em>, 1 being personal and 2 being school account).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this ? Why am I not getting logged out ? I did try to forget the account, doesn't change anything...</p>
<p>

<p>Hi SavinienLaurent,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue usually happens when you use different accounts to sign in Office portal in the same browser. This is because the browser caches your account credential in one session. If you don't log out completely, your account credential will be submitted
 automatically to keep the session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While if you have already logged out completely but the issue persists, it's suggested to close all pages and restart the browser to check if it helps. If it doesn't help, your browser could automatically submit the credential so
 that the sign-in progress automatically proceeded in background. To avoid this situation, you can try to clear the browser cookies and web credentials in Credential Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1415f2f-a0a7-458b-a1e7-378865153261?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e1415f2f-a0a7-458b-a1e7-378865153261?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another workaround is to use different browsers to sign in different accounts separately. Or, you can sign in your work account in browser's normal mode, while sign in your school account in browser's private mode since the private mode won't cache any credential.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What precisely do you mean? You mean you want to define a new range, which consists of
<em>Range1</em> though with certain columns excluded? What defines which columns are to be excluded?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't you just define this new range explicitly?</p>

            <p>I mean, I want to select and name the Range: $A:$A, $D, $G:$T.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- So, normally, I will select each range above alternatively, by holding down control button, then name it Range1</p>

            <p>Sorry - I still don't understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't you just define it as you always do? I mean - what advantage do you see in being able to define it via excluding certain columns from an already-defined range, as opposed to defining it as you currently do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, both operations will require some manual input, so I'm at a loss as to what you are trying to achieve here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you can clarify?</p>

            <p>Ok, here is what I need to achieve:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I protect the worksheet by password. Then, I want some ranges can be edited. So, I select such ranges, go to "Allow users to Edit Range", name it Range1. I suppose Range1 is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>=$A$1:$C$17,$E$1:$E$17,$H$1:$H$17,$K$1:$K$17</p>
<p>(You see, I have to hold down Ctrl button and select 4 times)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I don't want some cells to be edited anymore, says $A$2, $E$2,$H$6.</p>
<p>I have two option:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1/ Go back to "Allow&nbsp;&nbsp;users to Edit Range", select Range 1, click "Modify", and in the row "Refer to Cells", I have to select the range again, by holding down ctrl button. Range1 now become:</p>
<p>=A1,A3:A17,B1:C17,E1,E3:E17,H1:H5,H7:H17,K1:K17</p>
<p>(You see, I have to hold down ctrl button and select 8 times. Imagine Range1 is much larger and not continuous, then how many time I have to select again</p>
<p>
</p><p>2/Go back to "Allow&nbsp;&nbsp;users to Edit Range", select Range 1, click "Modify", and in the row "Refer to Cells", remain the old range, just exclude $A$2, $E$2, $H$6 from the old range</p>
<p>(This way, I only need to select 3 times)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it make sense or there is a better way to achieve the same goal. Please help</p>

            You'll need to clear some of the names from the list.  
<br />
<br />Honestly, blocking spammer addresses is generally a pointless exercise as they change addresses often - rarely using the same address for more than one send.

            This is in outlook.com on the web? (not that it matters, it works the same on the desktop.)  Select the first one, hold Ctrl and hit the down arrow key to select all. Then hit the Delete icon. 
<br />

I wonder if your computer is trying to go into hibernation during a full scan?&nbsp; You may need to adjust your power settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suggest you review the following: <a href="http://experts.windows.com/w/experts_wiki/89.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>Microsoft Security Essentials – Installation Checklist and Frequently Asked Questions
</span></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>MSE is always working to protect you. &nbsp;It will update periodically with new virus definition files, and it will perform a scheduled scan at 02:00 Sunday morning (by default).&nbsp; You can change the scheduled scan by opening MSE, click on the Settings
 tab, and select “Scheduled Scan”.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>11.&nbsp; Will MSE scan and update while my PC is asleep?</strong></p>
<p><strong>No.&nbsp; The PC must be on (not off, standby, hibernating, or asleep) for the scheduled scan to occur and for updates to download/install.&nbsp; However, this
</strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/while-in-sleep-mode-security-essentials-will-not/4beb26be-ed1d-4793-8b75-e4cb8991aee5"><strong>thread</strong></a><strong>&nbsp;may be of
 interest to you.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>30.&nbsp; </b><b>What is the difference between a Quick scan and a Full scan?</b></p>
<p>Real-time protection is the real protection against malware.&nbsp; Next, a quick scan will find orphaned files and auto-starts and stop them from running.&nbsp; Finally, a full scan can find malware missed by the quick scan.&nbsp; A full scan will “deep” scan every file
 on your system, including archive files (i.e. zip, rar, cab, etc.).&nbsp; A full scan can take hours to run.&nbsp; The decision to run a full scan is a personal preference.&nbsp; You might choose to run a full scan after installing MSE, to know that your system is free of
 malware.&nbsp; After that, you might choose once per month, or before a complete backup.&nbsp; The decision is yours.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now let's try to address the "amber icon and haven't run a scan" issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Are you using
<span>CCleaner</span>?</span></b><span>&nbsp; Piriform has programmed it for some reason to remove part of the MSE History files and it's deleting the files MSE checks to determine the last time a scan was
 conducted.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Open CCleaner&nbsp;Applications Tab, Under Windows uncheck MS Antimalware...that should prevent CCleaner from deleting the MS Antimalware scanning history&nbsp;files.&nbsp;
 The actions of CCleaner&nbsp;should not have any effect on the antimalware protection provided by MSE.</span></p>
<p><span>You<b> may
</b></span><span>also need to uncheck MS Management Console.</span></p>
<p><span>To re-establish a scan history, you may&nbsp;need to run a "Quick Scan" and possibly re-boot the computer.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Do you use Advanced System Care?

Then it sounds like you have a corrupt file or possibly malware on the computer or you have witnessed the infernal computer gremlin glitch.</p>

    <title>Messages disappearing from my Hotmail inbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ken.s80  say:</h3>
<h2>            Messages disappearing from my Hotmail inbox</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Hope someone can help as for the 3rd time most of my received messages have disappeared from my Hotmail inbox on&nbsp;a Windows 7 PC.
</p>
<p>First time I lost all my messages apart from the last 3 or 4 received. Messages in other folders including sent, deleted and save were all there so just the inbox was affected. I tried to restore from the deleted folder and this did not bring&nbsp;back the messages
 I had lost. </p>
<p>It happened again a few months later so I checked settings, ran a security essentials&nbsp;scan&nbsp;and changed my password.
</p>
<p>Six weeks later it has&nbsp;now happened for a 3rd time but the last two weeks worth of messages still remain rather than just the last few.</p>
<p>Would appreciate any ideas on how to recover this data as I can't rely on my Hotmail a/c any longer to keep important documents or alternately how to stop it happening again!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Jesinta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. </p>
<p>I access my Hotmail account via an iphone, ipad and Windows 7 PC, using the PC as my main access tool. The Hotmail a/c is my only personal email and the only a/c I use on these devices which is why the loss of this data&nbsp;is all so concerning for me.</p>
<p>On my PC I use Explorer and log into Outlook via live.com&nbsp;to view mail. For the iphone and ipad I just use the standard Apple settings to connect</p>
<p>I checked rules last time I had a problem and rechecked before posting - there are none set up. I can't find any reference to Inbox and Sweep rules in the options menu.</p>
<p>Anyway appreciate any other thoughts you could share.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Ken</p>

            <p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the detailed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;suspect this issue may be due to the IPhone&nbsp;POP server settings. I would suggest you follow the steps below and check if you can find the emails.</p>
<p><strong>Method&nbsp;1:&nbsp;Search for your emails in Deleted folders.</strong></p>
<p>1. in to <a href="https://outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.com/</a> through your PC and expand the
<strong>Deleted </strong>folder.</p>
<p>2. If you can see a POP folder listed as one of the folders, then check if you can find your deleted emails in that folder otherwise search for your deleted email in the
<strong>Deleted</strong> folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot find the emails at all, then click on the link below and follow the steps in the mentioned article to restore deleted emails.</p>
<p><strong>Restore deleted email messages in Outlook.com </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/outlook/recover-deleted-messages</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Make the following changes in your Outlook.com account</strong>.</p>
<p>Login to <a href="https://outlook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.com/</a>&nbsp;through the web browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are upgraded to <strong>Outlook.com (preview)</strong> interface, then follow the steps.</p>
<p>1. Click on the <strong>Gear (settings)</strong> icon and&nbsp;select <strong>Options</strong>.</p>
<p>2. On the left pane,&nbsp;expand <strong>Mail &gt; Accounts</strong> and select <strong>
POP and IMAP</strong>. </p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Change the settings as shown in the picture below and select <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e790f44-2e74-4bbc-af45-2446a6379881" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e790f44-2e74-4bbc-af45-2446a6379881" height="154" width="359" /></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are still in <strong>Outlook.com </strong>interface, then follow the steps below.</p>
<p>1. Click on the <strong>Gear (settings)</strong> icon and&nbsp;select <strong>Options</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Under <strong>Managing your account, </strong>click on <strong>Connect devices and apps with POP</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Change the settings as shown in the picture below and select <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

<p>
</p><p>After changing the settings, check if the emails are still being moved to the deleted folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have made the changes, check if your emails get deleted now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please respond if you have further related queries.</p>

            <p>Hi Jesinta,<br />
<br />
Logged into mail today and a&nbsp;further couple of weeks of mail from my inbox (28/12 to 11/01) had disappeared. Looked in deleted folder but this had cleared all messages prior to 10/01. I didn't try to recover any this time as had been unsuccessful before. However
 have followed your instruction in outlook.com for POP setting and fingers crossed this will do the trick.
</p>
<p>Is an alternative to reconfigure my iphone to an imap server for incoming mail?<br />
Thanks<br />
Ken</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for delay in reply but I have been away for a few days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have once again experienced mail deleted from my inbox but this time after updating settings as suggested the Deleted folder now contains a sub folder POP1 which contains the deleted messages. This was never present before so I believe the new setting
 has made this visible and is at least a partial solution. However not sure what I should do - leave them there, move the messages back to my inbox or create an alternate new folder to save them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to the request for log&nbsp;files I am not sure if that would be helpful when the actual message deletion is random so I cannot capture a trace as the error occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also not sure if I can remap my iphone to an imap server the same as my ipad to overcome this issue fully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would appreciate any further advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks &amp; regards</p>

The best way to save your contacts is to synchronise with Outlook.

<h2>            Unauthorized Browser Change from Internet Explorer to AOL.</h2>
                    When I went to open Internet Explorer on my other computer this morning, it automatically opened in AOL and asked if I wanted to change my browser to AOL. I responded no, however, the page did not change, and several pop-ups appeared asking me if I wanted
 to retain by previous default, but my options for responding were limited to allowing the change to AOL. I then went to my Control Panel, which showed AOL as my default browser, and changed that back to Internet Explorer. When I restarted my computer and clicked
 on Internet Explorer, the AOL browser appeared again. Any suggestions how I can get rid of AOL and reset my browser to Internet Explorer?&nbsp;

<h2>            Source Control with Access 2016 and then Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>We currently use a lot of Microsoft Access applications, primarily as just a frontend onto our backend Sybase database. Reason why access was used was it was free (corp licence), easy and it had a good report designer. We are already looking at other applications
 we can use to replace our frontend so that we can move onto Windows apps or Web based solutions, however that might be a little while away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what is the best Source Control software we can use with MS Access objects that can give us the check-in/checkout option at an individual object level, i.e. form, report, query, macro etc ? We currently use MS Source Safe but that is not
 compatitable with Office 2016 and beyond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any assistance out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>An Access "program" is a file that contains all objects, so it's difficult to "check out" a Form from Access and mark it unavailable to others (if that's your question).</p>

<p><span>I'm aware that some virus scanners can cause Ivercy to deliver quite poor performance.
</span></p>
<p><span>Have you got virus protection enabled that is constantly monitoring the file system and scanning modified files? If yes, would it be feasible to exclude your .accdb/.mdb file from being scanned? Ideally you exclude the whole …_IvercyTmp
 sub folder as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Are you still using Visual SourceSafe as source code control backend?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As a rule of thumb, compared to the performance of the Microsoft SCC-PlugIn, Ivercy will be slower initially creating the local copy of your Access project from the repository. After that, performance should be in the same ballpark.

    <title>Word 2010 on Windows 8 computer cannot open downloaded docx file in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mary allen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2010 on Windows 8 computer cannot open downloaded docx file in protected view -- Application hangs</h2>
                    <p>First here is what happens when a docx file is downloaded from email or accessed on a network drive on our windows 7 computer using Office 2010 home/student version (OS &amp; Office are fully updated):</p>
<p>1. download the docx file from email</p>
<p>2. double click on the docx file &amp; the Word splash screen pops up saying "starting"</p>
<p>2. the word screen changes to "opening in protected view"</p>
<p>3. the document appears with an icon at the top of the screen that when clicked enables editing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The process hangs on our new windows 8 computer (OS &amp; Office are fully updated):</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Download the docx file from email to the downloads folder</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Double click on the docx file's icon; Word launches and changes its status from starting to opening in protected view.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The application hangs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happened first when my son emailed me a document, I helped him with some formatting and emailed it back.&nbsp; We both used gmail (mine provided by my isp, his provided by his university).&nbsp; Wondering if the problem was the file's location in the "downloads"
 folder or gmail, I moved the downloaded docx file to his desktop and tried again.&nbsp; I also put the docx file on my NAS disk, mapped the drive on his computer, navigated through Explorer to the file, and double clicked the icon.&nbsp; In both cases&nbsp;I got the same
 result ... Word opened with "starting" and then changed to "opening in protected view" and hung-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next I wondered about permissions.&nbsp; So I right clicked on the file and selected properties.&nbsp; The info on the permissions tab was fine, but before I closed the box, I read the General Tab.&nbsp; It had an entry I've never seen.&nbsp; Below "The Attributes" entry was
 an entry that read: </p>
<p><span>"Security: This file came from another computer and might be blocked to help this computer." To the right of that message was a button to unblock. When I clicked the unblock,
 the file opened normally in editing mode. Thereafter, if I right click on the icon and select properties, the "security" message quoted above is not there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I posted this info as an update to another question and was asked to test the situation in safe mode and in clean mode.&nbsp; When I restarted in Safe with networking, the file opened
 but Word fell over b/c it could not verify the license on the application.&nbsp; When I retarted in diagnostic mode after disabling all non-Microsft services and startup processes, the behavior reverted to hanging up while attempting to start in protected view
 mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Also, when I attempted to return my son's computer to normal start-up, I could not enable his anti-virus in start-up or services.&nbsp; I had to reinstall the program (Kaspersky 2013).
 While I now have a work around that I can teach my son; this problem is a big deal for anyone who works collaboratively. Over the years I have worked with hundreds of people who need help with Word. In my estimation most will be unable to remember to right
 click and select "properties."</span></p>

            <p>Hi Mary,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community. I will provide you the steps to determine the cause of the issue so that we can fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this happen with a specific word document sent to you or even if opening any word attachments from e-mails sent by others?</p>
<p>Are you able to open and access attachments created and sent using other Office applications such as Excel or PowerPoint?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>:<br />
If this happens only with Word attachments, then disable the Protected View and check if you can open. Follow the steps:<br />
1. Go to <b>File</b> -&gt; <b>Options</b>.<br />
2. Go to <b>Trust Center</b> -&gt; <b>Trust Center settings</b>.<br />
3. Click <b>Protect View</b> -&gt; Uncheck all the options under <b>Protected View</b> -&gt; Click
<b>OK</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>:<br />
If that does not work, change the default printer on Windows 8. Refer the following link on How to change the default Printer:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows-8/set-change-your-default-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows-8/set-change-your-default-printer</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Change the printer to the default settigs after we have performed the neccassary steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope one these steps fixes the issue. If not reply with results so that we can continue further.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank You.</p>

            <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I tested with *.pptx &amp; *.xlsx.&nbsp; The applications both hang.&nbsp; When I&nbsp; check properties on these files they do not have the "security" message that I saw on the .docx file.&nbsp; They do have "read only" checked and the "read only" attribute can not be cleared
 by unchecking the box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer was defaulted to "Send To OneNote 2010" for default printer.&nbsp; I changed that to the house printer.&nbsp; The applications continue to hang.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am aware that I can disable protected view in the trust center.&nbsp; I have tested that and it is a viable work around.&nbsp; But I would prefer to leave "protected view" on.&nbsp; I am now retired, but I used to do all the IT work for a small school and am all too
 familiar with the pitfalls of innocently opening something from another computer.&nbsp; My son leaves tomorrow for a term abroad so I must do something today.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>I have not seen a fix.&nbsp; But it is possible that Microsoft has posted a patch in&nbsp;office update.&nbsp; The computer that had this problem was my son's and I do not have it with me. &nbsp;As you can see above, Microsoft asked me to test in "Safe w/networking" and "Diagnostic"
 modes.&nbsp; the application did not hang in safe mode but did in diagnostic mode.&nbsp; That means some&nbsp;Microsoft service is causing the problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The work around is to disable protected view for each office application you use.&nbsp; Here are the instructions for Word:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on: File | options | trust center | trust center settings | protected view.&nbsp; Then uncheck the top 2 boxes.&nbsp; If you use Outlook, uncheck that one too.&nbsp; The procedure is the same for Excel and Power Point.</p>

Sadly, I do not think it is ok to trust an attachment just b/c you know the person who sent the email.  Fairly often I get emails that say they are from people I know, but when I look at the first several words I know they are spoofs (offers for ****, rolex watches etc).  And I would consider the sender.  I have known users who have all the bad luck.  If the sender is someone plaqued by computer problems, I would not trust the attachment.  In my experience that is the user who let the antivirus/internet security subscription expire.  In that instance you have no idea who is really controlling that person's computer. 



But I wouldn't be paranoid either.  For years, I have exchanged documents by email without incident.  In my work experience: I was always expecting the attachment; the message said something that made sense in the context; and typically the user was using a complany supplied computer with many layers of protection.  In that circumstance I would download and open w/o hesitation.

                    I receive emails (in Outlook 2010, Windows 7) from colleauges in an organisation using Lotus Notes - however, the body of their email is blank. We manage using subject line and attachments as their corporate IT support say its for Microsoft and IBM to
 sort out. Can anyone offer any more timely solutions?

            <p>Antivirus email scanning will cause this problem as well. Make sure any email scanning is disabled in the anti-virus software.</p>
<p>Could even be on the sender's end since it is showing blank/garbled in WebMail. And even with plain text format.</p>
<p>It could also be getting messed when it arrives at your email server, would need to talk to email/exchange admin about this though.</p>
<p>To be honest...not a whole lot you can do when you have corporate IT not willing to do anything but point fingers...</p>

<h2>            Final OneDrive Mac sync client &#40;version 17.3.6296&#41; crashes when setting up OneDrive Business</h2>
                    
<p>Uninstalled all references to OneDrive Mac Preview sync client. Downloaded New Mac OneDrive sync client released on 12/17/2015 (version 17.3.6296). Installed it successfully and logged into OneDrive consumer account, which created the OneDrive folder and
 is syncing successfully. Entered the command in Terminal window to allow sync client to add Office 365 account for OneDrive for Business to be activated within client. Once the Office 365 username and password are entered, it creates the OneDrive - Company
 name folder, but the OneDrive for Business program cloud icon hangs, and the installation window hangs. Have to force quit from Activity Monitor, and nothing syncs to the folder. Thus, sync client for OneDrive for Business sync client never gets successfully
 activated.</p>
<p>I've had a similar problem since the OneDrive Mac sync preview client. I tried resolving it through this forum, but no solution was provided (see
https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/153/t/419019). I'm starting to believe that it's a unique problem related to my system and/or OneDrive 365 Business Premium account, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>Please review the above and let me know if you can help. I'.ve been unable to sync my OneDrive for Business information for more than a month. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Juan,</p>
<p>From your previous thread I noticed the issue is related your Office 365 account as the test account worked fine. Could you try a test account with this new client to help us determine whether it is the same cause?</p>
<p>I have sent you a private message with the details. You can access it via the your details section on the right &gt; Private messages.</p>
<p>Best Regards,<br />

<p>Eric - Thanks for responding. I deleted the sync client and every related filed regarding OneDrive, reinstalled from App Store, tried adding your account, and the same thing happened. After selecting it to sync all folders on the test account, the "Open
 your OneDrive - company" &nbsp;window would remain open, the newtest account folder would not sync, and when I tried to close the window, the program stays hanging until I force quit it thorugh the Activity Monitor.</p>
<p>I was on the phone today with a MS engineer. He went through everything with me while watching my screen, and thinks that the problem is that I have file names which are too long (256+ characters). We set it up on a Windows virtual system through Parallels
 Desktop and immediately the error messages indicating long file names appeared. So, this may be the case, but then why does the app also crash when only trying your test account, which does not have these long file name problems?</p>
<p>It seems my experience might be isolated. Still, it's frustrating. I might be able to sync eventually via Windows client, but I would much prefer using a working native Mac sync client.</p>
<p>Any comments or suggestions will be welcomed.</p>

<p>Hi Juan,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
After renaming the problematic file, do you still encounter the same issue on Mac?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
What is the version of you Mac OS? Is it the latest? If not, you can try update the OS to check the outcome.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To further investigate this issue, I’d like to confirm the following things:<br />
1.Could you share with us the screenshot of the issue after finding the problematic files? We appreciate you can provide with us the screenshots of the steps about setting up OneDrive for Business account.<br />
2.Do any other Mac users in your tenant have the same issue?<br />
3.Dose the sync feature for personal OneDrive (consumer) work well? Will it crash only with your Microsoft account?<br />
4.If you follow the steps in the previous thread to install OneDriveDF, will the same issue occur?<br />
5. To ensure that we can give you a better support, please share with us the SR Number if you have. It will give us more information about the issue. I have sent you a private message for the SR Number. You can find the message via the URL
https://community.office365.com/en-us/user/conversations. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In addition, the issue with the test account may be not related with the problematic file, we need to look into it further.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tim</p>

<p>Hi Tim. Thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>1. I am running the latest version of MACOSX El Capitan, version 10.11.2. I am attaching a screenshot where you can observe on the left the setup window, indicating that the test account is set up and to click the button to open the new OneDrive Business
 folder created, and on the right the window that opened after clicking the button from the left window. As you can observe, no files from the test account are syncing. Up top, you can observe the OneDrive Business icon which is clicked, and the only option
 that appears is "Quit Onedrive". If I click on this, it won't quit the program, and instead the beachball Mac icon appears and won't stop until I force quit through activity monitor.</p>
<p>Also please observe on the bottom bar that the blue OneDrive cloud is still appearing, which relates to the setup window on the left. I can't close this normally, and can only right click it and force quit, or force quit through the activity monitor. If
 I instead click on the red button on the left window, nothing will happen. Thus, I must force quit. Any attempt to set up the account again through the OneDrive Consumer client will producte the same result. Exact same thing happens if I try to set it up through
 my business account.</p>
<p>The steps taken to set up the account are normal. Deleted all references to OneDrive on computer, downloaded OneDrive sync client from App store, entered Microsoft Outlook.com account information, OneDrive folder was created and started syncing correctly,
 clicked on icon, then Preferences, the Business Account, entered the company e-mail and password you sent me, chose creation of folder under same root folder where OneDrive Consumer folder is located, and then what you see in the attached screenshot and description
 above happens.</p>
<p>2. I don't have any other tenants at present.<br />
3. The OneDrive Consumer client works perfectly, and won't crash even with the problems described above. It is working perfectly independently.<br />
4. When running OneDriveDF, the sync client won't crash after setup. However, it will create only one folder nad its subfolders, and will not sync any files. I used previously another test account (see prior thread mentioned), and that one synced perfectly.
 The OneDrive Business client that I use prior to the DF client, and before upgrading to El Capitan, worked perfectly with my business account, with no issues.<br />
5. The SR number was sent in response to your private message.</p>
<p>Frankly, since the test account doesn't sync, it appears the problem has nothing to do with file limits or any other OneDrive Business limitations. So I gave up trying to shorten file names though the Windows OneDrive Business client for now.</p>
<p>I await your comments.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>-JLD</p>

<p>Hi Juan,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Mac OS is different from Windows. The long name folder may cause some issues on Mac OS although it can be synced well on Windows. It is suggested you rename it as a short one and then check the result on Mac with the new sync client from App Store.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue persists, it means the long name folder is not the root cause, and then there might be some issues with the sync client or your tenant account. For further investigation, I'd like to confirm the following things:<br />
1. Do the test account and your account encounter the same issue? If they have the same issue, it seems that the sync client has some issues.<br />
2. If they encounter different issues, please share with us the screenshot for the situation of your account.<br />
3. Your tenant domain.(yourdomain.onmicrosoft.com)<br />
4. Your work/school account and contact email address.<br />
5. Your Global admin's email address.</p>
<p>I have sent you a workspace to collect the information mentioned above via private message. You can find it via the URL&nbsp;

<p>Tim - I tried using the workspace through the link you included, but in my Safari browser there's no "send" button after writing my response, so I'm communicating through here again.</p>
<p>Since I have all OneDrive Business info backed up to my computer, I decided to delete all folders in OneDrive Business online, save for a folder containing 2 pdf files. On Windows, the sync client worked flawlessly by syncing said lone folder with two pdf
 files. On Mac, I tried adding the OneDrive Business account to the final OneDrive client (version 17.3.6296), and it crashed again as described above. So we can definitely conclude the problem has nothing to do with the long file names.</p>
<p>I uninstalled the final client and added the prior OneDriveDF client. Everything synced perfectly for the first time. Of course, this time around it's only one folder with two pdf files. As you may recall in previous messages, OneDriveDF client would either
 not sync any folders at first, or would sync only the first root folder with subfolders and no files contained within. So, the reason the OneDriveDF client would not download all folders in my account previously (before I deleted them all save for one, as
 explained above), might have to do with the long file name issue. I don't know. Again, this was not a problem with the even older preview client installed in Mavericks OS.</p>
<p>The consumer component has always worked flawlessly with both the OneDriveDF and the final client.</p>
<p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1. Yes, the test account and my account encounter the same issue whereby tOneDrive Business component (not the condumer component) crashes, but only with the final sync client (downloadewd from the App Store). They now both work flawlessly with the prior
 OneDriveDF client.</p>
<p>2. Not applicable</p>
<p>3. That's private information that I cannot send through the workspace you provided because no send button appears. Still, I believe it's irrelevant at this point.</p>
<p>4. (see no. 3 above).</p>
<p>5. I am basically the global admin. I administer this account and I'm the only tenant, and handle all technical issues.</p>
<p>I downloaded a tool from Microsoft which diagnosed my folders and identified all problematic file names, and supposedly automatically shortened them. I observed in the log file that it identified only some, not all, files, as in the log file were missing
 files which the OneDrive Windows client was identifying.</p>
<p>I have not yet added the folders to be uploaded to OneDrive Business online. I might just do that sometime today. In the end, with respect to the final sync client downloaded from the App Store, I believe that, after deleting almost all folders from my account
 online, it's pretty clear that the problem is with the program itself, not my Office 365 account.</p>
<p>Should you have any further questions, comments, or requests, please do not hesitate to contact me.

<p>Hi Juan,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For further investigation, we may need to contact you via emails. So, we need your work/school account and contact email address.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you can't click the <strong>Send</strong> button in the private message, you can use the User ID and password to access the workspace via the URL mentioned in the private message, and then upload a Word file with your account information. (Form1 in the workspace
 is just an example).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We appreciate it if you can share with us more screenshots about the issue (e.g. How and when does the sync client crash? Are there any error messages?).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks for your time.<br />

                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I am having a strange issue.&nbsp; This user that I am supporting, every once in a while gets his Outlook stuck in processing when opening it. I open it in Safe Mode, close it, open it normally and it opens fine and this keeps on happening.&nbsp; This has been happening
 ever since he got this computer.&nbsp; In attempt to fix this once and for all, I have used the Office removal tool https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-Office-2013-or-Office-365-from-a-PC-9dd49b83-264a-477a-8fcc-2fdf5dbf61d8 to remove
 every trace of Outlook and then reinstalled Office again and today six months later he calls me back with the same issue and&nbsp; then I have to do the same thing again. I have also tried disabling hardware graphics acceleration and I have tried to recreate the
 profile, as the removal tool forces you to do that.&nbsp; I am at a loss as to what else I can try.&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi Barry,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This could be due to an add-in that got corrupted or a recent update. To resolve your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>When did the issue start to occur?</span></li><li><span>Were there any changes made or updates installed prior to the issue occurring?</span></li><li><span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/what-version-of-outlook-do-i-have-b3a9568c-edb5-42b9-9825-d48d82b2257c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Which version
 of Outlook do you have?</span></a></span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As an initial recommendation, we can start with the basic troubleshooting steps below and check if the issue will be resolved:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Safe Mode<br />
<br />
</span></strong><span>Starting a Microsoft Office for Windows application in Office Safe Mode can allow you to safely use it when it has encountered certain problems. Refer to this support article
 on how to:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Open-Office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-Windows-PC-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Open Office apps in safe mode on a Windows PC</span></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Repair Office</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If an Office application such as Word or Excel isn’t working correctly, sometimes restarting it will fix the problem. If that doesn’t work, you can try repairing
 it. Refer to this support article on how to:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Repair an Office application</span></a>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Check for updates</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Keeping Office up-to-date ensures that you have the latest security updates and fixes. Refer to this support article on how to:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Install-Office-updates-2ab296f3-7f03-43a2-8e50-46de917611c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Install
