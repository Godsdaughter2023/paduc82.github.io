            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are 2 ways on how to reinstall the Windows 7 operating system on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Through a <strong>recovery disc</strong> or <strong>
recovery partition</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Through a <strong>Windows 7 installation disc</strong> or
<strong>USB flash drive</strong> that contains the Windows 7 installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For method 1, you can refer to your computer's manual or contact HP support for the steps on how to run the recovery disc/recovery partition. For method 2, you can follow the steps provided below. It is important to back up all your important files before
 reinstalling Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Make sure you have the <strong>Windows 7 installation disc</strong> or <strong>
USB flash drive</strong> which is usually comes with the package when you purchased the computer. If you don't have it, you can contact HP to get a copy of it.</li><li>Insert the Windows installation disc or USB drive into your computer and then restart it.</li><li>While your computer is booting up, you'll be asked to hit any key to boot from disk or USB drive.</li><li>Once you're on the setup screen for Windows 7, hit Install.</li><li>After hitting install, you will have 2 options.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Upgrade</strong> - This will leave your files and programs intact and will just replace system files.</li><li><strong>Custom (advanced)</strong> - This will perform a full re-installation of your Windows 7 operating system. You can select Custom if you want a clean install of Windows 7.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. After choosing Custom, you'll be asked to select which partition you're going to install the operating system. Normally, it will present 2 partitions. Never choose the
<strong>Partition 1: System Reserved</strong> since it cannot accommodate the full operating system installation.
<strong>Choose Partition 2: (C)</strong> and proceed with the installation process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Install the necessary drivers for your computer once the Windows installation is done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

<li>I do this all the time.&nbsp; I have done hundreds.&nbsp; This is likely to take an elapsed time of around 12 hours.</li><li>From this point onward, I am providing you with the process to install Windows 7.
<strong>IF YOU WANT WINDOWS 10, stop reading this now.</strong></li><li>You <strong>may </strong>be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.&nbsp; You may need a friend to do this part for you, but the rest is not really very
 technical or difficult for most people.</li><li>Do not do any formatting or partitioning.</li><li>If you made a set of disks for recovery or an image copy&nbsp;at the time your computer was new.&nbsp; This is the time you need them.</li><li>Start your computer on the first of the disks as instructed and in an hour or so, your computer will look exactly as it did then.</li><li>If you do not have that set of disks. You will need a legal reusable&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Product&nbsp;Key.&nbsp; You will need a Windows 7 install disk. The win7 disk must match the edition of your product key, and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows
 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; Hopefully, the disk you use will be labeled SP1 (Service Pack 1), because that will save you an additional 4 hours or so.</li><li>Place the Windows 7 install disk in the disk reader and start your computer.</li><li>Once the install process is started, choose CUSTOM.&nbsp; Ignore the check box about drivers.</li><li>When the installer asks you where to store the installation, click Advanced and delete all partitions except for the OEM partition, if one is there.</li><li>Once Windows 7 SP1 is installed, install the following:</li><li><strong>KB3020369</strong> Win-7 32 <a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/C/0/8/C0823F43-BFE9-4147-9B0A-35769CBBE6B0/Windows6.1-KB3020369-x86.msu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 working and has a lot of work to do.</li><li>After the install is complete, check Device Manager. Type device in the text box above the start globe when you click it and choose device manager from the list&nbsp;to find out if Win7 was able to supply the drivers you need.&nbsp; If the Network driver is missing
 (or has a yellow exclamation point, you are going to have to find that driver using a different working computer.&nbsp; You should get drivers only from the maker of your computer or Intel.&nbsp; Its best to get all the drivers at this point.&nbsp; Win7 install may have
 installed all of them or nearly.</li><li>Install your Microsoft Office software and then run Windows Update again and again till no more are proposed.</li><li>Defragment your drive.&nbsp; Type defragment in the text box above the start globe when you click it once.&nbsp; Choose the Defragmentation link.&nbsp; Wait till it completes all passes.</li><li>Check Device Manager once again.&nbsp; If any drivers are missing you need to find them now.&nbsp; Do NOT use any of those driver download sites.&nbsp; They are all bogus, have bad drivers, and install malware.&nbsp; Use only your computer manufacturer’s support site as a
 source of drivers.</li><li>Next, you will need to take steps to prevent Windows 10 from taking over.&nbsp; First step is to change the Windows Update setting to NEVER.</li><li><strong><em>New install tip:</em></strong></li></ol>
<p>After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<strong><em>before</em></strong> any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<strong><em>+</em></strong>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive, you will have a precise duplicate of your system as
 it was at this point.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time, and you will have saved yourself all the time you put in this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for PLUS R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>

<h2>            skpe display language changed from english to chinese</h2>
                    Bought a new PC, after restoring skype, the display and menu language changed to Chinese. Do not know how to change it back to English. In fact, all new Microsoft applications became Chinese applications. Regional setting reset to English does not help.
 Please advise.

</p><p>You can try to contact your device manufacturer or contact Microsoft support for further assistance regarding this issue, since you've mentioned that all Microsoft apps are affected and setting your Region and language settings to English doesn't help.

<h2>            executable files&#58; cannot access the file because it is being used by another process</h2>
                    hi<br />
i have created a file named test.bat on my desktop<br />
named it "test.bat" and sent it to notepad, written "REM" and saved it.<br />
then i closed notepad and reopened it, added another "REM" and saved the file again.<br />
then i tried renaming, moving the file to another folder and deleting it<br />
all went without any problem.<br />
<br />
but if i create the file and execute it, the command prompt will appear for a moment and then disappear,<br />
i can rename or move the file without any problem,<br />
but if i try to modify the file in notepad, i get this error:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process.<br />
<br />
and the file is not saved.<br />
<br />
also, if i try to delete the file it seems to be deleted .. until i press F5, the file reappears.<br />
when trying to rename/move that new file i get another error:<br />
<br />
File Access Denied<br />
<br />
You need permission to perform this action<br />
<br />
You require permission from the computer's adminstrator to make changes<br />
to this file<br />
<br />
it seems the file is unlocked (or gone if i choose to delete) after a few minutes, while it doesn't if i try to access<br />
the file (i kept pressing F5 every few seconds for 15 minutes and the file isn't gone)<br />
<br />
the problem seems to occuar with any file name, anywhere, not just the desktop or the home drive, not even on &nbsp;the same disk,<br />
while i didn't have any problem when i booted into an old windows xp installation and repeated the same steps.<br />
<br />
i tried using handle utility from sysinternals, this is what i've got:<br />
<br />
after creating test.bat:<br />
C:\Users\User&gt;handle test.bat<br />

            These things happen sometimes! Sometimes just a simple reset is all it takes. From time to time mine does the same thing, just a power cycle should be enough to help. If not try seeing if the modem needs to be reset or try an Ethernet. Best of luck!

<h2>            Memory_Management bsod&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    hi I have a &nbsp;Windows 7 desktop which is five years old. It has been running fine for the first few years. Then just in 2015, I downloaded ZoneAlarm, this free firewall and from then on I have been getting bsods so I Uninstalled it and the bsods reduced
 and for a few months there had been no bsods. but one day my whole screen went fuzzy and the computer froze. I forced shut it down and tried to turn it back on and it wouldn't turn on. Instead there was beeping and flashing LED lights. I checked out what the
 beep code meant and on the manufacturer website and found that it was something called a pre-video memory error. So I went out and bought a new stick of RAM matching the old ones and installed it and the computer turned on and booted. then just that day, I
 received a bsod by the name of memory_management. I check out what caused it using bluescreenview and found that it was a program called ntkrnl.exe. Please help me with this problem as soon as posibble because this is my work c

            originally there were two sticks in the machine and one was 6gb and one was 2gb, so altogether I had 6gb RAM. I replaced these two sticks with one 8 gb stick. I did run a memory test and nothing came up. Everything seemed to be fine.

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I would suggest you to follow these Methods : 
<br />
<br />1. Close the Peer to Peer Update Process on Your PC to Fix Slow Internet after Windows 10 Update
<br />Shut down the peer to peer update process on your PC. That is to say, you need to close the channel which you can download applications and system updates from other PC’s connected to the server since it limits your internet bandwidth seeding to other users.
<br />
<br />Step 1. Click Start menu and then type Settings to open it.
<br />
<br />Step 2. Select “Update and Security“.
<br />
<br />Step 3. Click the “Advanced Options” tab.
<br />
<br />Step 4. Click the option “Choose How Updates are Delivered".
<br />
<br />Step 5. Turn off the On button.
<br />
<br />2. Adjust the Internet Bandwidth Settings
<br />Since windows 10, by default, reserves 20% of the internet bandwidth for the system applications and its operating system, you can’t browse or surf on the internet with 100% internet connection. This solution speeds up the dropping internet speed by trimming down the bandwidth which is reserved for Windows 10 and system applications. Follow the step-by-step guide to tackle slow internet after Windows 10 Update.
<br />
<br />Step 1. Press Windows shortcut keys Win + R to open Run dialog box.
<br />
<br />Step 2. Type gpedit.msc and then hit OK.
<br />
<br />Step 3. Give permissions. A pop-up window will open with title of Group Policy.
<br />
<br />Step 4. Click on Computer Configuration on the right side of the window.
<br />
<br />Step 5. Navigate to: Administrative Templates -&gt; Network – &gt; Qos Packet Scheduler – &gt; Limit reservable bandwidth.
<br />
<br />Step 6. Click on Enable.
<br />
<br />Step 7. Change the Value from 20 to 0.
<br />
<br />Step 8. Apply and then click OK.
<br />
<br />3. Disable Window Auto-Tuning
<br />Window Auto-Tuning which is enabled by default improves performance for programs by receiving TCP data over a network. Slower internet speed after Windows 10 Update could hit your computer when Window Auto-Tuning feature is “ON”. While luckily, you can disable Windows Auto-Tuning level to improve the internet speed for the Windows 10 update. Use administrator privileges to process the following steps.
<br />
<br />Step 1. Press Win + X and then select Command Prompt (Admin).
<br />
<br />Step 2. Type the command netsh interface tcp show global in the window.
<br />
<br />Step 3. Check for Receive Window Auto-Tuning Level and if it is normal, you will need to disable it.
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 4. Type the command netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled to disable it.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />You can perform an internet speed test to see whether those adjustments improve your internet speed or not. If not, you can re-enable the Window Auto-Tuning level by typing the command netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal in the Command Prompt (Admin).
<br />

<blockquote>I want to swap the drive into a new computer.&nbsp; How will this affect my activation.</blockquote>
You will likely have to reinstall Windows 7 since moving it to a new computer will cause it to fail to boot. After you reinstall Windows 7 if it doesn't activate online you might have to call Microsoft and explain what happened to complete the activation.

<p>&nbsp;I have the same issue and there are no&nbsp; error messages...nothing it just doesn't launch. I&nbsp; have tried installing and uninstalling the applications to no&nbsp; resolution.&nbsp; The clean boot you refer too has no instructions for windows 10, I'm assuming&nbsp; they are
 the same as windows 7. Never mind&nbsp; you don't tell what to do&nbsp;&nbsp; after&nbsp; to go back to regular start, by removing all the other programs from starting&nbsp; tells you something but doesn't&nbsp; fix anything.

            I was having this problem after an update.<br />
<br />
It appears the file permissions for users was changed to read only and hidden.<br />
As a result the start menu tile icons disappeared, some applications disappeared and my saves for certain games stopped working.<br />
<br />
Try opening <strong>File Explorer</strong>, going to <strong>(C:) drive</strong>, right clicking the file
<strong>'Users'</strong>, under<strong>&nbsp;attributes</strong> make sure 'read only' and 'hidden' are not selected/the boxes are clear.<br />
<br />
This will advise you administrator permission is needed, which you may need to grant or have already.<br />
<br />
It will then come up with a message saying <strong>'Applying Attributes'. </strong>
This process may take a long time due to the size of this directory.<br />
<br />
Might need to <strong>restart</strong> your PC.<br />
That should fix those particular issues.<br />
<br />
Not sure if this was intentional by Microsoft or a glitch on my PC from the update, but there you have it.

    <title>Windows 8 KVM switch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamoflynn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 KVM switch</h2>
                    I have seen several questions like mine: I am trying to run one XP machine and one Windows 8 machine thru a VGA monitor. &nbsp;Both machines work fine when connected directly to the monitor, and the XP machine works with an older KVM switch. &nbsp;I cannot seem
 to find a KVM that will work with the Windows 8 machine. &nbsp;I don't want to spend hundreds on this thing, and so far no one including Microsoft has been any help. &nbsp;Any answers, anyone???

            <p>When I use my KVM switch, there is no signal or whatever from the machine that is powered on, but switched off, other than an indicater light on the KVM</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do know that which ever machine I am booting must connected by the KVM to the monitor and etc.&nbsp;ASAP after powering on.&nbsp; Otherwise graphics drivers don't load properly...along with some others.</p>
<p>USB keyboards and mice more than likely will have issues also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XP is much less sensitive to this for some reason, but still may end up with the graphics at 800x600 instead of 1280x1024 for example.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if it will solve your problem, but switch the KVM to the Win 8 machine before powering it on, or ASAP and see what happens. Start it first instead of the XP machine and see if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also...is it possible that your switch is malfunctioning?</p>

Is there a fix for Windows 7 as well? (the hotfix in http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2182466 is older than the current W7 version)<br />

BTW, I've <br />

To no avail.<br />

            Hi Zaki J,<br />
<br />
thanks for your advise. Method 1 didn't work, but offered a potential solution for the source of the problem. About three weeks ago, I got an 1719 error when trying to install WebEx meeting software (and then some others). I tried everything I could find, including
 http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/error-1719-windows-installer-service-could-not-be/a3d7a90f-5953-4b93-a536-d807e21e0b93, but neither some Fixits nor reregistering and restarting the Installer service nor our IT department could/would
 help. <br />
<br />
Hence, I did a repair installation, which got rid of the 1719 error, but now the VSS is not working anymore, again preventing at least some installaytions and slowing down the system to the extend that internet connections are timing out.
<br />
<br />
I finally managed to be able to "dual-boot" into the system of three weeks ago (1719 error) and the current system (VSS error). Given that I had not seen the FixIt you suggested , I tried it in both environments - to no avail.
<br />
<br />
Could I just copy directories from one system onto the other (preferably the components to fix the 1719 error onto the old system)?<br />
<br />
I also have (horribile dictu!) Hiren's PE, so I can just copy from one system onto the other without having to bother about which user is currently active and - that would be even more important - replace the files of the Installer that Windows had corrupted
 with uncorrupted files from the repair installation.<br />
<br />
One last question: To check whether "corruption" of the current user profile is the problem wouldn't it suffice to just log in as a different user and try from there?<br />
<br />
Knut<br />
<br />
Thanks, again, for your help!<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            After the repair installation caused more problems than it resolved, I decided to bite the bullet and asked Microsoft for paid help. After three hours, they still hadn't fixed the 1719 problem that let to the failed repair installation.
<br />
<br />
The suggestion by MS was first to run another repair installation and then - after realizing that there was little hope that this one would give better results than the previous one - to start with a clean installation and three weeks of getting all my software
 reinstalled. <br />
<br />
Luckily, I have 8 GB of RAM, so should be able to install linux as the host OS and run Windows in a VirtualBox. Fist, I will transfer my programs and settings from the current installation via PCMover to the VirtualBox. Then I can start moving tasks from an
 OS that even the manufacturer doesn't understand anymore (and cannot provide support for) to one that doesn't suffer from the interdependencies created by the Windows registry and installer.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your help and wish me good luck!<br />
<br />

            Hello Barry. I am sorry to hear you are having some difficulties with the install process.  I am just a community user, like yourself, and would like to share some ideas if I may?
<br />Have you tried to located the ISO (disk installation files) for Windows 10?
<br />I would delete it, and allow for a fresh new ISO to be downloaded.
<br />You can go to the following URL to get the ISO and download it to a USB drive, PRIOR to deleting anything.  Make sure you are downloading the correct version of Windows that matches your PC's architecture. With other words: 32-bit or 64-bit.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />I would also keep the attached peripherals to a minimum during this step.
<br />Disconnect external drives (if possible), scanners, printers. We are trying to make the install process as fast as possible and not hit any roadblocks because of an incompatible device driver.
<br />
<br />The process may still "loop" a few times but Windows 10 seems to have a built-in algorithm that makes it move or jump past those stumbling blocks.
<br />
<br />Summarizing:
<br />Download a new ISO file.
<br />Make sure it is compatible with the architecture of the PC (32-bit or 64-bit)
<br />Delete the old or original ISO which was used for the current install that is in a loop.
<br />Disconnect any legacy devices or equipment which may require special attention.  It is OK to keep the keyboard and mouse connected.
<br />I hope these pointers take you in the right direction.
<br />Give me feedback on your results, And best of luck!       
        </p>

            Hi Barry.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You should be able to download the ISO from the link below if the other methods to interrupt the boot loop in the first step don't work.  If Media Creation tool won't install on the tablet to create bootable USB media, then you'll need to use another PC to do this.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  An alternate download site is here: <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Using it Burn to DVD with Windows Image Burner or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using Rufus set to UEFI for GPT for a UEFI BIOS, or Legacy for MBR for a Legacy BIOS. 
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to do the Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Barry:
<br />Thank you for the feedback. I am sorry, but am not familiar with this scenario.
<br />We have two distinct platforms here.
<br />One is a Google Chrome Tablet, running the Chrome operating system.
<br />Second, is Microsoft Windows OS is designed for an INTEL/AMD architecture.  
<br />Windows will really shine and be robust on an INTEL/AMD platform, where the same holds true for Google Chrome. You could, maybe, possibly, (I have not tried doing it), run Windows in a virtual sandbox or virtual machine environment. That will give you a taste and feel for what Windows can do.
<br />I know this may not be the best answer to your question. I apologize if it is not. However, it is the best that I can do for now, with the first-hand experiences I share.
<br />Best of luck!

<p>Hold the power button until the computer turns off and then press the power button back on. Repeat that three times until you get a new page that lists a few options. The one you need is the Recovery Envirnment. Once there click into troubleshooting and
 then click Reset Computer. It will go through some stuff and then you computer will be how you left it before the update.</p>

<h2>            Updating the AMD ATI Radeon HD 4600 and ATI FireGL V7700 graphics drivers for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>The main problem is that people are using old Win 8.1 drivers and on build 10520 onwards this wont work.</p>
<p>There are many AMD devices with similar problems like, and so try this procedure</p>
<p>The principle is the same as on a laptop with built in drivers. Basically AMD does not hold these drivers available. They come from the latest &nbsp;update service on AMD Catalyst Control Center</p>
<p>as of 28/August/2015 from this <a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=Windows+10+-+64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
AMD Link</a></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/044fe1ef-765a-41ec-a0d2-955110fe3ccc" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Scroll down and download the AMD Catalyst installer.&nbsp;When installing it may be necessary to remove the driver. Windows 10 will request a manual reboot&nbsp;&nbsp;and uninstall the previous driver leaving the Windows 10 generic driver and screen resolution at 800x600
 default. This causes people to write questions on community help boards. They may have not fully read the on screen instructions, which ask them to restart the AMD Catalyst installer on restart.&nbsp;When&nbsp;the new driver is installed and a manual reboot is required.
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/46ac36e4-104e-4ef0-8ba7-2269b733f2ca" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>On restart the new driver,(<strong>Start bar</strong>-&gt; <strong>AMD Catalyst Control Centre)&nbsp;</strong>is now functioning and the resolution must be set using Windows 10 Settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right Click on desktop&nbsp;and select
<strong>Display Settings </strong>-&gt;<strong> Advanced Display Settings </strong>and Select recommended display setting for HDMI ( for example 1360 x 760), or for your VGA adapter. Older Inbuilt AMD Graphics Cards could have different lower resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A number of Cumulative patches are needed to get the Windows Update to deliver any new drivers</p>
<p>In the example below the driver for the AMD Radeon HD 6380G has been successfully installed, after installation of listed Windows Updates, some of these updates&nbsp;will be superseded in future.</p>
<p>The AMD Catalyst™ 15.­7.­1 Software Suite requires Microsoft® .­NET Framework 4</p>

    <title>Reducing the speed of Video&#47;Audio of an AVI movie - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexmo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reducing the speed of Video&#47;Audio of an AVI movie</h2>
                    I converted old 8mm films to digital but the old 8mm player was playing too fast and although the picture is a little fast, the audio sounds too fast and in fast motion which makes it hard to recognize voices.<br />
I want to reduce the speed of the AVI movie to match the original sound speed and hopefully make it sound closer to the original.&nbsp; Can I do that with Media Player (or movie maker or whatever other program out there)?<br />
thanks,

    <title>Controller Stuck Looking Up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guardedlearner3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Controller Stuck Looking Up</h2>
                    <p>Hello and thanks to all who try to help. I am having an issue with the white Xbox One controller. The right joystick module broke from the gray part that connects inside the thumbstick. It still worked but the joystick was now loose and rotated 360 degrees. I decided to replace the module with a brand new one by de-soldering and soldering on the new one. I am absolutely positive that I soldered it on the right way.&nbsp; As soon as I turned the controller on, the player points straight up (Black Ops). You can do everything but pointing up, so shooting, knifing, etc. . . I connected the controller to my laptop and ran the "joy.cpl" to do some testing/calibration. Something is definitely wrong with the right joystick because the "Y Rotation" is not functioning at all in the test or the calibration. Its just moving a little by itself. Thanks.</p>

Unfortunately there would not be a way to troubleshoot the stick drift issue that you are experiencing. You will need to purchase a new controller as it would now be out of warranty. </p>

</p><p>Yet this page says GTX 560M is supported in Windows 10.&nbsp; <a href="http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3710/~/which-nvidia-gpus-are-supported-in-windows-10%3F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Which NVIDIA GPUs are supported in Windows 10?</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Try running <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Automatically Detect NVIDIA Products</a> .&nbsp; THere are also a number of WHQL drivers offered doing a manual search.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I'd also try any Windows 8.1 driver for the GPU. </p>

            <p>I am using Clevo P151HM1 and using GeForce Experience I've updated to version 368.81. But the Windows Update Assistance still failed the update.</p>

            <p>Have you also tried any drivers offered on the Clevo Support Downloads webpage?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the Compatibility Checker can be buggy, refuse to reset with a better driver, and therefore since you already know the card works well on Windows 10 (correct?) what I would do is save a System Image and manually Upgrade using the media.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To try running the Update manually, save a <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3011736/windows/how-to-create-an-image-backup-in-windows-10-and-restore-it-if-need-be.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 10 Image Backup&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>so you can go back if necessary, then create the latest Anniverary Update media from
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation Tool</a>, open bootable media from desktop or double click ISO file to mount, right click Setup to Run as Admin.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same optmizations as for <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">
Overcoming Windows 10 Upgrade Failures&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>will smooth the way for the Manual Update to run better, and give you a better install at the same time.

<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.&nbsp; </p>
