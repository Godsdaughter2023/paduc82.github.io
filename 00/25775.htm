    <title>How do I switch between several text placeholder in one slide from the - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I switch between several text placeholder in one slide from the outline pane &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Powerpoint template including several predefined text placeholders per slide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I fill the placeholders from the main window (ie the WYSIWYG part of Powerpoint - I don't know the exact technical term), I can see in the outline pane that they appear as part of the slide with small numbers (1, 2, 3...) to identify them. From then
 on I can access them directly from the outline pane and fill them up / modify text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet, if I work from the outline and start a new slide, the default setting has me working in the main placeholder (nÂ°1) and I cannot access the other placeholders directly from the outline pane: using tab/TAB only promotes/demotes the text in the current
 placeholder, or moves it to a new slide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a key combination to use in the outline pane that would enable switching from one placeholder to another in the existing slide ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>The WYSIWYG view with three panes, slide, slide "thumbnails" and optionally Notes text is called Normal View. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally after typing the text for the slide title (the text directly next to the numbered slide icon) in outline view, you'd press ENTER then TAB to switch to typing text into the body text placeholder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's one of the two-content layouts, you can press Ctrl+Enter at the end of one of the body text lines to move into the second of the two placeholders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other text placeholders, I don't think you can access them from Outline view.</p>

                    <p>STOP and READ Before you give some obtuse answer PLEASE. &nbsp;(Sorry my expectations have not been met much around here.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I have a MicrosoftOnline account where I login at login.microsoftonline.com to my organizational account on a PC. &nbsp;There is only one email in my organization. It is the email address I sign in with. &nbsp;My Office 365 subscription is a Small Business (month
 to month) subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I administer my account at portal.office.com aka the "Office 365 admin center" because that is where my MicrosoftOnline login takes me on a PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I read my outlook email at outlook.office365.com because that is the link the portal at office.com takes me on a PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I WANT the same browser behavior on my android tablet as on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>INSTEAD, portal.office.com reports "<strong>Sorry, that didn't work</strong>" when I try to login.&nbsp; It even complains that I signed in with my Microsoft account (naming the correct email that I use for my login ABOVE) but expects me to login with some other
 work or school email that I don't have. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Sasichaitram,</span></p>
<p><span>You have specified "Project" as Business Application instead of Access... You probably won't get any answers...</span></p>
<p><span>However... I may help you A BIT... </span></p>
<p><span>MDWs are secured MDBs. You should be able to open it if you have your password. If you don't, then try a software or service which you can find online. You will have to spit the dough however. People in the Access forum might be able to help you for
 cheap or free. MVPs are reliable and professional.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck.</span></p>

 tapped on the Change Payment Method link, and got a single radio button with a "Visa 1234", but this is an old credit card that is no longer valid... So I chose to add a credit card. This brought me to Windows Live, where I signed in, etc, and added the appropriate
 credit card, "Visa 4567". Then I returned to the marketplace...but the credit card was not there! I rebooted the phone...nothing, still not there. I went to billing.microsoft.com, but it is showing up on the website.</p>
<p>I'm afraid that there may be no way to recover from this as I may not be the typical customer for the following reason:</p>
<p>1) somehow I have two billing accounts in billing.microsoft.com. when I added the credit card from my phone, as described above it ended up creating a NEW billing account for me, which is somehow not associated with the Windows Live ID that my phone is using
 (I think). So now my phone will still only recognize the other billing account with the invalid credit card.</p>
<p>2) I was living in the USA when I created the Xbox Live billing account associated with credit card "1234", and which happens to be the credit card that shows up in the marketplace on the phone. Later, I moved to the UK and got my Windows Phone. Still using
 the same Windows Live account that is associated with my Xbox live... </p>
<p>3) I think that because my Windows Live account has been split between US/UK that it had to create me another billing account for the UK rather than allowing me to add another credit card to the existing account, and this is why the phone is not picking
 up the credit card. Is there any way to merge these accounts so that I can just get the credit card to show up on the phone?</p>

            <p>Hi khig,</p>
<p>You would need to setup a different Windows Live ID in your phone as the primary account, as you cannot use the American account when making purchases in Europe.</p>
<p>In any case, I would suggest that you phone customer support for billing issues:</p>

    <title>VBA Macro&#47;Add-in security issues with latest Office 2016 First - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris------  say:</h3>
<h2>            VBA Macro&#47;Add-in security issues with latest Office 2016 First Release for Deferred &#40;C2R&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recently attempted to update to the latest First Release for Deferred channel Version 1705 (Build 8201.2102) for Microsoft Office 2016 (C2R) and have run into what seem to be some fairly major problems around VBA and add-in security settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give some background. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We use a number of macro template files and add-ins for office all of which have valid digital signatures that are imported to the trusted publishers certificate store on all machines.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have the Office security settings locked down by GPO as below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Disable Trust Bar Notification for unsigned application add-ins and block them: Enabled</li><li>Require that application add-ins are signed by Trusted Publisher: Enabled</li><li>Trust access to Visual Basic Project: Disabled</li><li>VBA Macro Notification Settings: Enabled (Disabled all except digitally signed macros)</li><li>Disable all trusted locations: Enabled</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>These settings have been working as expected, only allowing add-ins and macros to run from templates that have valid digital signatures which have been imported to the trusted publishers certificate store on the local computer, for all previous versions
 of Office 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However after updating from&nbsp;16.0.7766.2084 to&nbsp;16.0.8201.2102, Office will not allow any add-ins or macros to run with these settings in place. In addition, if I turn off the setting to disable the trust bar notifications, Office shows notifications about
 quiet a number of add-ins under C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft Shared that are disabled and the reason given is that they have no digital signature. However if I browse to these files and check the properties of the DLLs they show a valid Microsoft
 digital signature that is also already in the trusted publishers certificate store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I uninstall version&nbsp;16.0.8201.2102 and reinstall&nbsp;16.0.7766.2084 then everything works again as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not related to just one computer, I've attempted the update on four Windows Server 2012 R2 (RD Session Hosts) VMs and the results are always the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else use similar security settings with Office and have you experienced similar issues with the latest version of First Release for Deferred?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Thanks John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try there. However I'm not entirely sure you've grasped the issue I am trying to convey here, it's not an issue with a specific macro or add-in, rather an issues with Microsoft Office's security controls around all macros and add-ins. It's a problem
 with Office itself, not with an add-in or macro.</p>

<p>Hi Gary, I didn't get an answer but I have found that it appears to be fixed in September's update in the first release for deferred channel. I've not been able to test extensivley though as that version also brought some other compatability issues in our
 environment, it didn't play nice with some profile management software we use (FSLogix).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully that helps.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi yleclerc-, that is a strange message, if you already have the 64bit version installed . . .
<br />
<br />Follow these steps to perform a full repair of your Office installation . . .
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel - Programs and Features
<br />Click Microsoft Office in the list of installed applications
<br />At the top, click 'Change'
<br />On the resulting dialog, click 'Repair' - choose the Online Repair, it is a comprehensive fix
<br />
<br />That should fix any issues with your Office Installation . . .       
        </p>

<p>Besides what Dave mentioned above, I would like to check if this error occurs when you open one specific workbook. If so, please right click the workbook, choose Properties. Then check the Unblock
 option and Apply to check if it helps.</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it persists, could you please help confirm the information below, so that we can better understand your situation and help you?</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Does the issue occur when you launch the Excel application or open one specific workbook? If it occurs when you launch the Excel application, do the same
 error message occur when you open Word or PowerPoint applications? If it occurs when you open one specific workbook, do other workbooks encounter the same error message when you open them?</span></li><li><span>A screenshot about the error message you encountered.</span></li><li><span>Go to File&gt; Account&gt; Product Information, capture a screenshot about the product information with related Office version.</span></li></ol>

<p>Thanks for your updated information. We will continue helping you to further investigate the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As you mentioned, you would like to
</span><span>merge two CSV files together</span><span> then the error message occurs again. I still suggest you ensure these two files are not blocked to avoid possible issues. Besides, it will be much helpful if you can share with

<p>I can not give you screen shots.&nbsp; These two CSV files have our internal information that I am not allowed to send to anyone outside of the company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a acyle Linux based main system that I can generate a CVS file.&nbsp; &nbsp;These two files contain information from our two internal companies.&nbsp; These are automatically sent to my local system via Xmodem transfer protocol on a Telnet based access.&nbsp; Once on
 my system, I open these in Excel as a CSV files. I then fix the headings, columns widths and freeze the top row.&nbsp; These are done on both files.&nbsp; Then, in te older company's file, I high-light the the second row and &lt;Ctrl&gt;+&lt;Shift&gt;+&lt;Down arrow&gt; to select rows
 up to the last row.&nbsp; I right-click and select ask to Copy.&nbsp; &nbsp;I move over to the main company's file and head&nbsp; down to the last row of data.&nbsp; I then paste the copied rows, start at the next blank line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This process has work for past few years and now seems to be causing problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to note:&nbsp; The opening of the two files are done via a Macro, since the two files have the same names constantly.</p>

<p><span>Hi Y</span><span>leclerc</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand it may not convenient for you to share contents in the files. Just want to confirm the following to narrow down the situation, so that we can better investigate the issue and find possible
 causes for it:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>You mentioned the error message occurred when you would like to copy and paste contents in the CSV file. Have you tried copying and pasting contents in normal
 workbooks, will the error message occur?&nbsp; If you create a new CSV file manually and perform the same operation, does the issue occur?</span></li><li><span>Will the error message appear when you perform other operations in Excel 2016? How about other Office applications, such as Word or PowerPoint?</span></li><li><span>A screenshot about the error message you encountered.</span></li><li><span>Go to File&gt; Account&gt; Product Information, capture a screenshot about the product information with related Office version.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Yoga&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            apps corner issues</h2>
                    <p>For starters, thank you Microsoft for deciding or us that kids corner wasnt useful, I'm sure the few parents that were using it would beg to differ, but of course, you know best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said... m trying to use apps corner but I've noticed a few issues.... If I turn off things like the start, back and search buttons, they're getting turned off on the main account, making the phone almost unuseable. I also can't leave the app... Switching
 back to the main "desktop" locks up the phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how to correct this? </p>

    <title>Is MS Support the worst&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is MS Support the worst&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am going to be posting this in multiple locations as a warning to everyone who uses Microsoft's email service @outlook.com, @hotmail.com, etc. &nbsp;Sorry for being so verbose....just need to vent....thanks ahead of time if you took the time to read....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a loyal Microsoft customer for many many years. &nbsp;I first created my @hotmail.com email address when I was in 7th grade, which was over 20 years ago now. &nbsp;I endured the multiple changes that came with having this service for such a long time.
 &nbsp;The numerous modifications to the interface. &nbsp;Adding/removing of features. &nbsp;The hotmail.com to outlook.com migration. &nbsp;Coworkers laughing that I still used hotmail...haha. &nbsp;I even upgraded my free hotmail.com subscription to the Hotmail Plus $20/year paid
 subscription nearly a decade ago because I liked it so much. &nbsp;It just worked well when I needed it. &nbsp;I cannot recall any major outages during the course of this 20 years of use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is of course, until they decided to migrate me to Office 365/Azure this year. &nbsp;I use Office 365 at work and I love it. &nbsp;The migration to the new Office 365 initially went fine. &nbsp;I was able to see and use the new features available in Exchange 2016 via
 the web interface. &nbsp;It was really great...and for $20/year it was a steal. &nbsp;I was very pleased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week I couldn't log into the web interface to check my email. &nbsp;When trying to login, I received a message stating that "Something Went Wrong", followed by the specific Exchange error message detailing the problem. &nbsp;Not only that, I was getting messages
 from fellow colleagues and friends that any emails being sent to me were being bounced back and they were receiving NDRs. &nbsp;No emails were coming in, or could be sent, on my phone...etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously...having this as my primary email account, and having over 20 years of emails in my mailbox, the issue to me was urgent. &nbsp;I found a Microsoft support number and called immediately. &nbsp;Only to find via automated message, that, Outlook.com related
 issues are only supported via support.microsoft.com. &nbsp;Meaning, I would have to initiate a web chat. &nbsp;So I did....</p>
<p>
</p><p>After waiting 5 hours to get someone on the web chat, the level 1 technician asked me a bunch of questions that you would expect from a level 1 technician...basically, troubleshooting the issue as if it were a client-side/user related issue. &nbsp;After the triage,
 they told me a level 2 technician would contact me in 48 hours. &nbsp;So...as angry as I was that I'd have to go another 2 days without email...I obliged helplessly. &nbsp;They asked for a 3 hour window that I would like to receive my call, and I told them the window
 I wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 2 days, I received the call from the level 2 technician....2 hours after the specified window that I provided. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I wasn't by my PC at the time to assist because I gave up on them. &nbsp;I told them to call me back the next day, giving another
 3 hour window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily, they called the next day during the appropriate window, and the level 2 tech did some further troubleshooting (gathering fiddler logs, screenshots, asking questions, etc.). &nbsp;Basically, he ruled out that it was a problem with my computer or user
 error...which I was happy about. &nbsp;However, he stated that he needed to escalate to level 3, and that I should get a call from level 3 in another 48 hours. &nbsp;Again...helpless...no choice..I obliged. &nbsp;This time, I asked him to give me my ticket number, just in
 case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 days later....no call. &nbsp;I even waited 2 hours after the 3 hour window I provided. &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;Again, I went to the web chat. &nbsp;After waiting 3 hours this time, I gave them my ticket number, and told them I was supposed to receive a level 3 call and didn't.
 &nbsp;They looked up the ticket, and told me that a level 3 would call me in an hour. &nbsp;I said OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No call. &nbsp;I went back to the web session after waiting, and asked to speak to a supervisor. &nbsp;I got a call from the supervisor, and found it very difficult to understand him. &nbsp;He told me he was sorry I never got a call. &nbsp;He said he would contact level 3 and
 make sure they call me the next day. &nbsp;Figuring he was a supervisor and had "pull", I said OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next day, no call. &nbsp;Back to the web session. &nbsp;The level 1 tech told me they would ENSURE that a level 3 technician would call me in an hour, so I said OK...but, made sure the tech waited with me in the chat. &nbsp;No call in an hour...give me a supervisor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my surprise, it was the same supervisor that I spoke to the first time. &nbsp;He told me he was sorry but the level 3 technicians were just too busy to answer my call. &nbsp;He said that he sent them an email, to tell them to call me ASAP. &nbsp;I was like..."you can
 only communicate with them via email?". &nbsp;He said "yes, because they are in another country". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So....that was 4 days ago. &nbsp;No call. &nbsp;No email working. &nbsp;Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I have turned off the autorenew on my account, and have decided to abandon my email altogether. &nbsp;20 years of data...gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft support is the worst support I have ever experienced. &nbsp;For those of you who are using Microsoft hosted products...beware. &nbsp;If something does go wrong, be prepared for the worst service possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since created a new mailbox in Rackspace, which is hosted Exchange email, however, supported by people who actually GIVE A DAMN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Their support is just amazing. &nbsp;Very responsive. &nbsp;Excellent communication and service. &nbsp;Sure...I have to pay a bit more for my mailbox, but peace of mind is everything.</p>

            <p>I'm sorry to hear of your trouble getting the help you need, but sadly this forum has no connection to the Answer Desk where you were so badly treated. It seems clear that you didn't make contact with the people in a position to solve your problem - the
 Outlook.com product team. </p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>When trying to login, I received a message stating that "Something Went Wrong", followed by the specific Exchange error message detailing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;... fellow colleagues and friends ... were receiving NDRs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Without knowing the precise error you encountered, I can't be sure, but it looks as if the migration to the new platform didn't work properly for a small number of Hotmail accounts. There are thousands of servers involved, and it may be that the problem
 is confined to only one or a few of these. Please use the <em>Ask the community</em> option to start a new thread in the proper forum for questions like this. When you do so, copy and paste the entire error message you see when trying to access your Hotmail
 account. It might also be helpful to see one of the NDRs you mentioned. You could generate one by sending a message from your new account to the Hotmail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you've posted, please come back here and give a link to your new thread. We can then escalate the question in the hope that a Microsoft moderator will escalate the issue in the appropriate direction.

            <p>I totally agree ... MS is the worst in everything on all their software concerning support. I use to half an Apple computer, and there support was awesome and I mostly use their online tech support. Within 2-5 minutes I had the answer on how to fix due to
 there search engine. And able to understand and fix the issue. MS search engine is terrible and I can never find a solution to the problem even when using Event Viewer which links you to the issue ... etc. It just don't work!&nbsp;<strong>They should dump the process
 and look at Apple way solving issues. &nbsp;I have had it with MS ... going back to Apple next computer.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I've even try to contact somebody using the chat but still can't get an actual tech person I call on &nbsp;phone and they just make things worse.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To solve the problem I have to use YT or google search ... and then there's still no guarantee that it gets fix or pops up again in a couple of week. I eventually have to wipe the drive and re-install&nbsp;everything. &nbsp;JUST TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! And&nbsp;wasting
 my time!!! THEY SUCK!!!&nbsp;</strong></p>

    <title>Sync Contacts to Mac Address Book - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larry.mcj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sync Contacts to Mac Address Book</h2>
                    <div>Is there a way sync my Outlook.com contacts with my Mac?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I recently moved from Google Apps to Outlook.com and while I really like the interface, this is a case of form over function. &nbsp;Outlook.com has a super nice UI, but it's totally useless outside of itself. &nbsp;If I want to sync my Outlook.com contacts to my Mac
 address book..it's not going to happen. &nbsp;I can export the contacts from Outlook.com to a CSV file, but even that doesn't work properly. &nbsp;I have 387 contacts in Outlook.com and when I export them and import into the Mac Address book there are 527 contacts.
 &nbsp;And...then either the email or phone fields are missing in over half of them. &nbsp;Really a pathetic attempt at import/export.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As much as I like Outlook.com, I'm afraid I'll soon be returning to Gmail, where at least everything works....although it's a very ugly interface.</div>

            <p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's good to hear that you like the Outlook.com User Interface. I understand that you wish are having synchronization issue with your Mac. Rest assured that I will assist you with the best of my knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To share some information on this,&nbsp;Outlook.com can be sync to Mac mail client if the said account is added to&nbsp;a mail client. Please refer to this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/outlook/send-receive-from-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to be able to do so. However, with OS X Mountain Lion, Apple no longer maintains active support for Sync Services. For further, more detailed information on this, please refer to this

<p>I hope you're having a great day.</p>

<p>I would like to apologize for the confusion. I think the previous moderator suggested it just in case you might want to install the Microsoft Office Outlook mail client in your Mac computer.</p>

            I'm using Outlook.com, so I probably wouldn't want to install the Office for Mac mail client as this is 1000 times better, which is why I'm using it. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I sincerely appreciate the fact that this is a peer support forum, but the first answer I received had absolutely nothing to do with my original question. &nbsp;I think the best answer that can be given when a correct answer isn't known...is to simply not answer
 at all.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To reiterate my original question...I UNDERSTAND that Outlook.com contacts can't SYNC with my Mac Address Book. &nbsp;I can only export my Outlook.com contacts to a CSV file and import them into the Mac address book. &nbsp;And the problem with that is there are
 only 387 Outlook.com contacts but when I export them, there are 527 contacts that are imported. &nbsp;I was just simply saying that Outlook.com has a VERY LONG ways to go before it's functionally any better than Hotmail. &nbsp;It's a beautiful interface...but function
 is more important than form.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Maybe someday Microsoft will "get it"...but I won't hold my breath.</div>

            Easy guys.<br />
<br />
The volume controls for the Realplayer are not in the main volume controls but in the rocker/joystick. Press RIGHT to increase the volume, Press LEFT to decrease the volume.<br />
<br />
Other useful controls in RealPlayer:<br />
<br />
Press (and Hold) UP to Fast Forward<br />
Press (and hold) DOWN to Rewind<br />
<br />
Press 2 or 5 (depends on the model) to switch between full screen and normal screen<br />
<br />
Press the center select on the rocker/joystick to PAUSE/RESUME

            ipqtr, I'm not sure I understand what you are trying to say.<br />
<br />
But I've tried this and it works if you use the rocker (joystick) thing in the center of the phone, you can control the volume with it and also skip forwards/backwards in the video playback.<br />
<br />
For video recording you can also select to not record sound under Options.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,

The volume controls for the Realplayer are not in the main volume controls but in the rocker/joystick. Press RIGHT to increase the volume, Press LEFT to decrease the volume.<br />

<h2>            How to set Preview Text so it Shows Email Text Rather than Link</h2>
                    <p>I'm developing an automated business process that uses email to assign tasks.&nbsp; Users reply 'Done' when they complete task and the next task in process is assigned automatically.&nbsp; The first thing in HTML email is a logo.

<p>So&nbsp;<span> 'http://Company.com/image/gps.jpg' shows up as Preview Text in Outlook Desktop.&nbsp; On Outlook online and the phone it doesn't show link but shows first line of text in mail.&nbsp; See below:</span></p>

<p>I'm trying to figure out how to create HTML so email preview on desktop Outlook looks like Outlook online/phone. I've tried dozens of experiments with no success.&nbsp; I<span> want to fix this in HTML.&nbsp; This involves 100's people I can't ask them to
 change Outlook setting. </span></p>
<p>I'm using latest version of Office 365.&nbsp; Not sure what clients are using but I suspect Office 365 or Outlook 2016.</p>

            Eyyyy, Diane P., I've been wondering why Outlook doing this to me too. And this is an ingenious solution!
<br />
<br />But for best practices, please do not use CSS in e-mails. Avoid it.
<br />
<br />And I think the issue this thread discussing is a known problem with Outlook with its preview. Maybe we need to feedback Outlook team about this

<br />@mogulman52, I've just googled about this. Here is a constructive discussion about it: <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1030982/why-is-outlook-preview-pane-showing-html-not-text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://superuser.com/questions/1030982/why-is-...</a>
<br />
<br />TL;DR: use <pre><code>&lt;!-- HIDDEN PREHEADER TEXT --&gt;
&lt;div style="display: none; mso-hide: all; width: 0px; height: 0px; max-width: 0px; max-height: 0px; font-size: 0px; line-height: 0px;"&gt;

 top of the page), so that I do not have to scroll to the bottom of a potentially long page every time I access that page (this may or may not be a correct fear/concern because maybe One Note's latest versions may now remember the location where you left every
 given page/note within a section/notebook?).&nbsp;&nbsp;The downside of this approach is that I would have to add some space every time I add a new note in a page; but, considering how easy to use &amp; intuitive/visual the add/insert space feature in One Note was, I decided
 to go with this approach.</span><br />

 designed for adding space between notes, and not at the top of a page on a routine basis), therefore adding notes to the top of the page (newest/latest first) is not practical (as far as I can see) &amp; more so with Iphone/Ipad apps.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the original issue,
 of potentially having to scroll to the bottom of of a long web page, probably applies in this case for sure (if One Note on the desktop remembers, which I am not sure it does, as far as I can tell, the web app &amp; Iphone/Ipad apps do not remember, nor bring
 you to the bottom of the page so that you can enter a new note).&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess One Note may not remember in the PC neither, because how would One Note know whether you want to see/review your notes, or add a chronological note? Maybe One tastic could categorize
 notes to be either of chronological nature (in which case it automatically brings you to the bottom of the page) or of non-chronological nature (in which case it shows the top of the page)?&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there any setting within One Note for setting up this behavior
 even if it applies to all pages? (whether all pages with content in them are open at the bottom or top)</span><br />

Maybe you should rethink the way you use OneNote. My first thought when I read your post was that a way of working that gives you very long pages in OneNote is something to be avoided. You don't want to be scrolling all the time. Maybe&nbsp;each note should be on
 its own page. Navigating and reordering pages is easier than notes on a page, and you can easily use section and section groups as grouping mechanisms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is for instance how I organize my work and personal journals, or diaries: one page for each day, a section for each month, a section goup for each year. Yes, sometimes I get pages that have very little text on them, but so what - it doesn't cost any
 paper;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just my thoughts.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your input!</p>
<p>I have considered your approach, and like you mention, a balance needs to be found between number of pages/sections, and scrolling very long pages.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also did not like scrolling which is why, before the webapp existed, using the insert space function was a very quick way of 'moving everything down' to make room for a new (latest date) note.&nbsp; But since this is no longer possible in the desktop/cloud
 world, I will have to go back to shorter pages, but more of them.&nbsp; It would be ideal if MSFT added the 'add more space' feature to the webapp (&amp; Iphone/Ipad/mobile apps), but I do&nbsp; not see this happening any time soon.</p>

A "trick" I sometimes use is to work in a table with only one column. Each of your notes would be a separate table cell, and it is easy to add a new row at the top. This would also work for the web app, but I don't know about iPhone/iPad.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>net use q: \\http://my_web_address:myport</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can read/write files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From my N8 file manager, I can connect (no errors), but after that:</p>
<p>- the external drive seems empty</p>
<p>- can not upload files</p>
<p>- no error messages, just no action</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advice. I am also interested in any webdav server really working with N8. I'm using 4shared, but I just upload files; I see existing files but I'm unable to download them locally on N8.</p>

<p>Lucky you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can at least do something with webDAV.</p>
<p>For us it has been quite frustrating.</p>
<p>Nothing worked at all!</p>

<p>I get the same result with my N8 and Windows 7.<br />
N8 will connect but does not show any content.<br />
<br />
However , with the N8 Internet Browser, I can navigate to the WEBDAV Directory and will see all the files.<br />
<br />
It would be very good if the mapped WEBDAV drive could be accessed with the NOKIA MediaPlayer, this way you could play media from PC thru N8 :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to open files on disk with the NOKIA MediaPlayer ?</p>
<p>Or is there any other media player available for N8 ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was able to set up my N8 with webdav on 4shared.com:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nokian8blog.info/2010/10/nokia-n8-features-inbuilt-webdav-client.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nokian8blog.info/2010/10/nokia-n8-features-inbuilt-webdav-client.html</a><br />
<br />
I can see the folders &amp; files on N8.</p>
<p>I can also create a new folder with the N8 on the webdav drive and upload files from N8 to webdav drive.</p>
<p>However, I can not&nbsp;open or copy any files with the N8, it will throw an errormessage and disconnect the&nbsp;webdav drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: I've learned that 4shared free account has this limitation - upload only, no download.</p>
<p>It seems that N8 would work with 4shared webdav, however the&nbsp;Windows7 IIS webdav&nbsp;is&nbsp;not working&nbsp;correcty (can connect but cannot see anything).</p>
<p>Of course, this might be a configuration issue within windows/IIS/webdav.<br />

            FYI WebDAV feature from 4shared is just for premium users :/ You can only upload from free account.

            I found another article on the Blog site referenced which shows you how to setup many different cloud storage providers with the N8:<br />

I'm now using this with my Google Docs, DropBox, FTP and Amazon S3 accounts and it's working really well.

            as useful as webdav is what i really wnat is to be able to browse my phone from my computer over my network.<br />
<br />
it's not a difficult feature to code and this seems to be a huge omission. hopefully it will come in the next update.

            I did set up a webdav share on win 7 (64 bits though) and managed to access it from my N8.<br />
I'm using basic authentication, didn't manage to make windows authentication work.<br />
Remember that, using that type of authentication, http access is disabled. You must use SSL (hence generate your own SSL certificate, you can do it in IIS7 management console).<br />
I can list folders, download files, create folders from the phone. I CANNOT upload files, which is very weird and, since the share is working perfectly form other computers, i'm tempted to think that it's a N8 problem.<br />
But I'll try again with a different setup and let you know. If I succed, I'll post a step by step guide.<br />

<p>The n8 is a terrible device it does nothing right. Everything they have programmed has an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why they&nbsp;left out home media is beyond belief or part of the terms for accepting the contract for Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways back to webdav ..&nbsp; I'm running apache and like you can log in create folders copy from the folders but cannot upload anything to them with error and stop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not proficient with apache and the fault may lie with the conf side of things but I suspect they are fine. I'm using pr1.2 and 14.02. I hate the phone so much it's less than 7 days old and has some odd issues I deem to be faults so maybe I'll cancel
 my contract on the basis of the phone being faulty.</p>

    <title>Can you create a GLOBAL DEFAULT TEMPLATE in OneNote&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vnat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can you create a GLOBAL DEFAULT TEMPLATE in OneNote&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Been researching this and so far mostly just finding that you can set a default template for a particular OneNote section, but not finding any way to make a template default for ANY section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should be that you can set a default template globally, and then override that if needed on particular sections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But right now it doesn't look like OneNote supports a "Global" default template which is rather disappointing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is this really the case or am I missing something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
