<h2>            How to get rid of Gorillaprice</h2>
                    <p>I have searched the internet for the above.I d/loaded Spyhunter...It carried out a scan and found 244 threats.O clicked Fix It and it was looking monies.</p>
<p>Is there any free software that would get rid of this.</p>
<p>I have looked in Manage Add-ons and can,t see gorillaprice.</p>
<p>I know its still on my system cause there are ads popping up all the time.</p>
<p>I have done a scan with Malbytes an its still there.</p>
<p>By the way,I have MSE installed and with this it doesn,t pick up any malware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many Thanks.</p>

            Gorillaprice is adware....it's not malware which is why MSE. Malwarebytes and most similar products will not identify it.
<div><br />
<div>You have installed it with other software.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any recent downloads or new programs?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can you identify it in Startup and disable it?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Try Revo:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></div>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>And</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Run AdwCleaner:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/</span></a></p>

            Adwcleaner might identify it. Also try spybot. Also, Malwarebytes changed focus to adware too.
<div>Also, GorillaPrice comes with uninstaller, so you can try to uninstall it from control panel (sometimes fails) or use revouninstaller / manual file deletion. &nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Auto-lock keypad Nokia N73</h2>
                    I bought N73 unit a couple of months ago. I have a common problem that my phone makes call to a top listed number in Contacts by having pressed inadvertently. Would you please advise if I can set auto-lock keypad as i enjoyed in older Nokia units.

            There are some 3rd party applications available that provide that functionality - a quick search of this board will find a list of them.<br />
<br />
A more secure option though is to go to:<br />
<br />
Menu .. Tools .. Settings .. Security .. Phone and SIM<br />
<br />
And set the "Autolock period" to "5 minutes" (or whatever you prefer).<br />
<br />
This will then lock your phone and password protect it against anyone who might steal it.

            Hi riazrizvi,<br />
<br />
May i confirm with you that this problem causes your phone to dial out to the list of contact numbers in the phonebook without you notice?<br />
<br />
May i seek your advice what do you meant by "makes call to a top listed number in Contacts by having pressed inadvertently"? Was your phone already keypad lock when this happened?<br />
<br />
Please advice.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Howard

            put autolock on to my N73. Great job got me around not having one.<br />
<br />
I also use the phone on a wired connected car kit.<br />
<br />
Old nokia used to stay unlocked when I put it on the kit.<br />
<br />
The new autolock does not work the same phone locks after the timer.<br />
<br />
Something I can live with with just a tiny nuissance.<br />
<br />
Is there another variation of autolock that takes this into account.

<p>I have had this problem also and the simple thing to do is follow Microsofts directions on how to unblock your your account. I have 2 options a text to my cell phone where you enter the last 4 digits of your phone number to verify it is you and they will
 send you a code to unlock your account after unblocking your account they will ask you to change your password.</p>
<p>Heres where I get suspicious, after you do all that and you are using Chrome for a browser they ask you to sync your passwords with Google to secure your passwords. I do not like that idea, I keep a little log in a book with all my passwords in it. Also
 I have gotten email from other services about the same thing when I use a computer I haven't used before like if you buy a new one. Hope this Helps BTW I stay away from Skype. Note the person ranting said they entered their whole phone or thats the way I took
 it, Microsoft only asks for the last 4 digits. I initially set that up for just this type of problem</p>

<h2>            Nokia E5-00 says &#38;quot&#59;charging&#38;quot&#59; even when it&#39;s not charging</h2>
                    
<p>Dear All</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Every time when I switch on my Nokia E5(without connecting to the charger), it says "charging", then "unplug charger from power supply to save energy". I'm trying my luck- if anyone has met the same problem and solved it, please kindly share...</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>So far, I have written to Nokia support, and got 2 responses as below:</p>
<p>******1st Response from Nokia support***********</p>
<p>Here are the troubleshooting steps that you may follow to remove the said prompt:<br />
<br />
A. First, reboot your device by turning it off and removing the battery. Wait for around 5 minutes before you return the battery and turn it on.<br />
<br />
B. You may also try restoring the device to factory settings to refresh the hardware of your handset. You may restore your factory settings by following these procedures:<br />
<br />
- Go to Menu<br />
- Open Tools folder<br />
- Select Settings<br />
- General<br />
- Scroll to Factory Settings<br />
- Click Yes to confirm<br />
- If prompted, enter the lock code of your device (12345 is the default code unless changed)<br />
- The device will then restart after the above procedure<br />
<br />
C. Lastly, you may also opt to connect your device to the charger and safely unplug the charger from the device. This will remove the charging prompt on your device. You may email us back if the issue would still persist.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*********2nd Response from Nokia support***********</p>
<p>Step 1: Format your Nokia E5-00. Please make sure that you have made a back up by using the Ovi Suite to avoid data loss.</p>
<p>To format your device, please dial *#7370# while in the home screen.</p>
<p>Step 2: If the above procedure is not working, we suggest that you do a software update by&nbsp;using the&nbsp;same (Ovi Suite)&nbsp;program.</p>
<p>Step 3: In the event that the issue still persists, we recommend that you bring&nbsp;your device together with the proof of purchase to the Nokia Care Center to have it properly diagnosed the issue.</p>
<p>***********************************************************</p>
<p>Unfortunately, none of the above works. So the only option is to send it to Nokia care center. The trouble is this phone was just sent for repair 1wk ago, and only collected back yesterday. So annoying...So if everything else works except the charging prompt,
 I think I will bear with it by never turning it off, just to save another trip to its care center.</p>
<p>I'm so disappointed by Nokia this time....The only hope is that my E5 won't break down until I get a new phone. Of course, no Nokia any more!</p>

<p>Hi Jimmy</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply! Although that doesn't solve the wired thing, I feel better to have someone providing some help. :)</p>
<p>I tried the 2nd option you told me, but that doesn't help. As for the 1st one, I could not see anything in the power plug.</p>
<p>But it's OK. I'm trying to live with it...</p>

<h2>            Not receiving the verification code via SMS. Waited so long, and never came. What wrong&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Been trying to update my password for safety purposes. The problem is that I am not receiving the verification code via TXT which would allow me to continue to do so. &nbsp;Then it gave me the option to use an alternative email, but it said that the security
 update request will take effect after 30 days or something. However, on the same page there was an option to "cancel" my security update request (in case I was not the person who requested the security update), and it asked for the last 4 digits of my phone
 number which I entered, and THIS TIME &nbsp;I received a code via TXT successfully which I entered to verify my "request" to cancel my security update request. Indeed, my "request to cancel the security update request" (sorry it's a mouthful) was successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what's happening? How come the SMS system for changing the password does not work, but it works alright in other operations? I attempted to update my password again, and pressed resend code several times and no code arrived.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This normally happens if the local network provider doesn't recognize Skype as a medium for calling. To resolve this issue, please set up a caller ID on your Skype account, here is the FAQ link:&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up?q=caller+id" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What

<p>Hi Kenneth_F.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you arer proposing does not work at all. So please find an effective solution or do not make any propositions. We do not have time to waste. I have the caller identification set up and I still can not make phone calls. At the same time I can not contact
 &nbsp;anyone to ask for help . I have already start thinking to close my calling account and go to viper.</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not able to resolve the problem using Skype on my phone and could not access any support!! Terrible! I tried to uninstall the Skype App on my phone but as it came with the phone there was not an option do this. Instead I selected to disable it. Then
 I went and loaded a new Skype App from the App store onto my phone and it worked - because it is the old version without the updates. Am just waiting for Skype to update it again without any notice or my permission...…</p>

<h2>            I cannot send emails from outlook.com</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I have a hotmail.co.uk account for my cricket club which I have used for 3 years now. I have an email group of around 170 email addresses which I use 4 times a year to semd the club's newsletter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I set the account up, I went through all the verfication checks with phone numbers etc and I have never had any problem sending mass emails from the account. The number of subscribers has slowly increased but has never been less than 120.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of a sudden, I am unable to send emails from the account, regardless of which browser I use or which computer. It simply returns a message of 'your message cannot be sent' without any other comment or explanation. Before I dump outlook.com and spend
 time loading all the contacts into something else and starting again, can anyone please help me get outlook.com working again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice gratefull received.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h3> duvakautomatisering  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onedrive for business folders and files randomly &#34;deleted&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>We are currently in the proces of migrating all of our users personal documents from our local file server to Onedrive for Business. At first we started a test with only a few users (about 5). After a few weeks of testing without any big problems we decided
 to migrate the rest of our users.</p>
<p>Now we have about 20 users migrated to Onedrive and are experiencing some problems we cannot explain or reproduce. One of our users reported that all of his files went missing without him performing any kind of action related to Onedrive. The user has a
 Windows 8.1 laptop from the company which we configured to use Onedrive. He also has a personal computer which is a Mac on which he also syncs his Onedrive for Business.</p>
<p>At some point none of his files were appearing at either the windows laptop or the mac. When logging on into the portal there were also no files. After taking a closer look at the recycle bin all of his files and folders appeared in the recycle bin. However
 restoring was a painfull en time consuming task because of the maximum item restore limitation. This restoring method is unacceptable if it has to be used in this way for large Onedrive folders.</p>
<p>As of now we are analyzing this problem to see if we can find what caused it before we are migrating any more users to Onedrive for Business. If we are unable to find a reasonable explanation of why this happened we will most likely return to use our traditional
 file server instead of use Onedrive.</p>
<p>Aside from this issue we are also having some trouble with the limited configuration that can be done with Onedrive in a business environment (either through the client or GPO). Right now we hide all of the standard document folders such as documents, pictures
 and downloads on the local computer and force only the use of Onedrive and configured programs like Office and Internet Explorer to use the Onedrive sync folder as default.</p>
<p>Also we are still looking for a GOOD solution to use Onedrive on a remote desktop services environment and we are still confused on why there isn't any good solution available from Microsoft to do this.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Dave</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>As it was mentioned before, OneDrive for Business won’t delete users’ files automatically. The reason why all those files were removed from both the OneDrive portal and the Mac Book is when the files were deleted from one side, OneDrive would sync this change
 to the other side.</p>
<p>Since the files have been restored, we may not be able to view the Deleted items in the recycle bin. In this case, I suggest you enable the Audit log feature so that you can monitor the activity of Office 365 better in the future. You can enable it at
<strong>Office 365 Admin Center</strong>&gt; <strong>ADMIN</strong>&gt; <strong>Compliance</strong>&gt;
<strong>Reports</strong>&gt; <strong>Office 365 audit log report</strong>&gt; <strong>Start recording user and admin activities</strong>. For detailed information:

Search the audit log in the Office 365 Protection Center</a></p>
<p>If you encounter the same issue again, please feel free to post back.</p>
<p>Moreover, regarding those features, you can send your feedback at <a href="https://onedrive.uservoice.com/forums/262982-onedrive/category/86090-onedrive-for-business" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 can't add school or business emails to a personal outlook account. Why is this?

                    <p>My Laptop is not able to open any site with ONGC (e,g <a href="https://webice.ongc.co.in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p>
<p>It is to say that the operating system is windows 8.1 and MacAfee antivirus is active. I have tried with making the firewall off, but it did not work.

<h3> pens1fan66  say:</h3>
<h2>            Showing two forms within the same form window &#40;not sub-forms&#41;, and toggling one side between multiple forms</h2>
                    
<p>I am attempting to put two forms in the same window so that someone can compare the information on both forms. I do not want to use subforms because these two forms are independent of each other, not necessarily connected. Additionally, on the&nbsp;right side
 of the window I would like to be able to toggle between multiple forms so that someone could switch to whatever form they need to see based on the information on the form on the left side.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>You can place two unrelated subforms on a main form. This is a nice method because it allows you to use the 2007 feature of Anchoring to adjust the size of the subforms based on the screen size. The right-hand subform could include a Tab Control that allows
 the users to switch between different forms on different tabs.</p>
<p>If that won't work for you, you can display two independent form windows (the right-hand one including a Tab Control) and use the MoveAndSizeWindow command in a Macro to tile them. The hard part would be adjusting for different screen sizes &amp; resolutions.
 There is a thread in the old Newsgroup where some VBA code was posted to determine the size of the screen. You could possibly use that as input in the math to size your two windows. Here's the thread:</p>

<h2>            Cannot send emails thru Outlook 2003 after adding Zimbra as a new email account. Unable to connect to STMP server.</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hello everyone. I hope you all can help with my issue. Please bear with me, as I am learning as I go with this.</span></p>
<p><span>I am running Windows XP and the issue is with Outlook 2003.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Currently, my business receives email through Zimbra (offered by Homestead Websites). I wanted to view my mail through Outlook so I set up a new email account
 following Homestead’s exact instructions.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p><span>When setting up the account and clicking “Test Account Settings” I received a message saying that Outlook could not connect to my STMP server.</span></p>
<p><span>I clicked ok but then all my Zimbra email started loading into Outlook. I thought everything was fine.</span></p>
<p><span>I even started receiving new emails in the new Outlook account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have am having a few problems, but the MAIN issue is that I am unable to SEND emails on outlook. I get the following error message:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Task ‘mail.homestead.com – Sending’ reported error (0x80042109) : ‘Outlook is unable to connect to your outgoing (SMTP) email server. If you continue to receive this message,
 contact your server administrator or Internet service provider (ISP).’</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have contacted Homestead and they advised me they were unable to assist me and that I would need to contact Microsoft for support.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have searched through the forum and tried many different suggestions but nothing is helping. I have verified that I typed the POP3 and the STMP server correctly. I have
 also verified the Port numbers are correct (110 and 25).</span></p>
<p><span>I do not want to delete the outlook account and start over because when I set the account up, it completely deleted every email I had in my Zimbra inbox. So deleting the
 Outlook account and starting over would make me loose almost 100 emails.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve mentioned that my Zimbra inbox is now empty and I also am NOT receiving new messages thru that account but I AM getting them in the Outlook account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Any assistance you could provide on this issue is greatly, greatly appreciated.</span>

            1.&nbsp; Verify the Pop3 config is definitely correct<br />
2.&nbsp; Verify your firewall is not configured to block Pop3 or the ports you are using<br />
3.&nbsp; Verify you can download from another Pop3 account to your PC eg your ISP mail, Gmail, etc<br />
4.&nbsp; Verify you can download Hotmail via Pop3 to another device/PC eg a secondary PC, iPhone/iPad via Pop3)<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are still unable to get it working, then you might have the same problem I had.<br />
<br />
Are you running PeerGuardian or another blocking application that could be blocking the Microsoft Corp IP Addresses via one of the lists?&nbsp; Try temporarily disabling that list, or enabling the IP and test the send/receive.&nbsp; If it workds, you can then perminantly
 enable the IP/List.

I have a database to keep track of orders for some electronics components that I'm buying with friends. It takes time for us all to get our act together, so we send in the orders across multiple shipments, and each one of us orders some components on each shipment.
 As with most electronics bulk sellers, there are discounts on the unit price if the total amount of a component ordered in one shipment is greater than a certain number. I wanted to use access to keep track of all this since excel was getting unwieldly.<br />
<br />
One table has all the parts we order, plus each part's unit price at 1-24 units, 25-99 units and 100+ units. The other main table has the list of all the orders. The primary key in this table is a combination of the person who is requesting a part, the part
 number they're requesting and the shipment that they're making the request for, and then the fourth field is how many of that part they want.<br />
<br />
What I want is to use a query to determine a) how many of a given item have been ordered, across all people, in a given shipment, and b) what the unit price is of that item based on how many of it were ordered. I've gotten part A through a totals query (grouping
 by part number and shipment number, and then displaying the sum of the # of items ordered). However, part B refuses to comply. I have a conditional expression that will return the unit price based on the total number of items ordered, but if I put that in
 the same totals query, I get a "tried to execute a query that does not include the specified expression .... as part of an aggregate function".<br />
<br />
I can really tell that I don't understand what I'm trying to do here, so I'm not sure what information is necessary to help explain my problem better or fix it. Any suggestions on how exactly I should do what I'm trying to do?<br />

            <p>Well, SQL is the language of queries; the grid is nothing but a tool to build SQL, and it's a lot easier to communicate here in SQL. Please open this query that's not working in SQL view and copy and paste the SQL text to a message here. At this point it
 may look like a poem in Lower Slobbovian, but the volunteers here are fluent in Lower Slobbovian so that's fine &lt;g&gt;.</p>
<p>One likely problem is the design of your parts table. Storing the price in three fields is non-normalized, and will make your queries a lot harder to manage; in addition it will make updating your database much harder should you choose to change the price
 breakpoints. Better would be a one-to-many relationship from the parts table to a Prices table with fields like PartNo, BreakPoint, Cost, with values such as</p>
<p>123; 1; $2.50<br />
123; 25; $2.19<br />
123; 100; $1.95<br />
125; 1; $412.00<br />
125; 25: $395.00<br />
125; 100; $354.00</p>
<p>You could then join to this query with a criterion finding the matching partno and the largest breakpoint less than the number of items ordered.</p>

            Firstly, thanks for bearing with me. SQL is just not something I've ever dealt with so I try to avoid messing with the stuff I don't know.<br />
<br />
That rearrangement of my table is something I had not thought of, so I will get right on that. In the meantime, here is the SQL describing my current query for the total per item per shipment. This one does what it's supposed to do.<br />
<br />
PARAMETERS [Which shipment?] Short;<br />
TRANSFORM Sum(Orders.[# of Item]) AS [SumOf# of Item]<br />
SELECT Orders.[Item ID]<br />
FROM Items INNER JOIN Orders ON Items.[Item ID] = Orders.[Item ID]<br />
WHERE (((Orders.[Shipment ID])=[Which shipment?]))<br />
GROUP BY Orders.[Item ID]<br />
PIVOT Orders.[Shipment ID];<br />
<br />
And this is the query that doesn't work, similar to the above but with an attempt to find the acting unit price.<br />
<br />
SELECT Items.[Item ID], Orders.[Shipment ID], Sum(Orders.[# of Item]) AS [SumOf# of Item], Switch([SumOf# of Item]&gt;=100,[Items]![Unit Price (100+)],[SumOf# of Item]&gt;=25,[Items]![Unit Price (25-99)],True,[Items]![Unit Price (1-24)]) AS Expr1<br />
FROM Items INNER JOIN Orders ON Items.[Item ID] = Orders.[Item ID]<br />
GROUP BY Items.[Item ID], Orders.[Shipment ID], Switch([SumOf# of Item]&gt;=100,[Items]![Unit Price (100+)],[SumOf# of Item]&gt;=25,[Items]![Unit Price (25-99)],True,[Items]![Unit Price (1-24)]);<br />

            <p>You can't reuse a calculated expression in another calculated expression, for one thing; for another (worse) you have a circular-logic situation: you're trying to decide which field to retrieve in each individual record based on a sum of the records retrieved!
 At the moment Access is trying to decide which field to select, you don't yet KNOW the count.</p>
<p>I think you'll need to do this as a two query situation: first create a Totals query summing the item counts, and then create a second query joining this query to your price table using the Switch() function to choose the correct price.</p>

            Sounds pretty good so far, and thanks for your help up to this point. I think I'm a bit confused on the switch statement though. I've broken the prices off into another table, as you suggested, listing each item's unit prices by breakpoint. I'm not quite
 sure how to switch on them though.<br />
<br />
Here is the switch statement right now, as defined in the query design grid:<br />
Unit Price: Switch([E:Total Items by Shipment]![SumOf# of Item]&gt;[Item Prices]![Price Breakpoint],[Item Prices]![Unit Price])<br />
<br />
The output resulting from this is that i have a few rows for every single item (one for each price breakpoint on that item). In the column for unit price (the column controlled by the above expression), it'll be blank for all the breakpoints higher than the
 amount i ordered, and it'll have the matching price for each of the ones below. For example, a certain chip has prices for 1, 25 and 100+ items. It ends up having three rows, all with the same part number and shipment number. I ordered 30 of that chip, so
 the first of the 3 rows quotes its unit price as the price for 1-24 items, the second row for 25-99 items, and the third unit price is blank (because the switch is returning null).<br />
<br />
I sort of understand why this is happening, but I'm not sure how to get the behavior I actually want. I need to be able to tell the switch to pick the right unit price out of the ones that match the item number in question. What's the next step?<br />

            <p>You should not need the Switch() except for the non-normalized three-field table structure. A Subquery will work with the new table design.</p>
<p>Could you please post the current table structure, and the SQL of your query?</p>

            The idea of a subquery makes more sense. The current structure of my database is as follows:<br />
<br />
Table: Items<br />
Fields: Item ID (primary key), Description (text description of the item. largely irrelevant from an organizational standpoint)<br />
<br />
Table: Orders<br />
Fields: Name ID (primary key, indicates who placed this order), Item ID (primary key linked to the above table), Shipment ID (primary key, indicates which shipment it's a part of), # of item (how many of the item were ordered by this person in this shipment)<br />
<br />
Table: Item Prices<br />
Fields: Item ID (primary key, linked to the Items table as well), Price Breakpoint (primary key, if the number of items ordered is between this number inclusive and the next highest breakpoint exclusive, then the given price will apply), Unit Price (the unit
 price that applies to this item for the given breakpoint)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The query that calculates how many of an item were ordered in a shipment (this one works) is defined by this SQL text:<br />
<br />
SELECT Orders.[Shipment ID], Items.[Item ID], Sum(Orders.[# of Item]) AS [SumOf# of Item]<br />
FROM Items INNER JOIN Orders ON Items.[Item ID] = Orders.[Item ID]<br />
GROUP BY Orders.[Shipment ID], Items.[Item ID]<br />
ORDER BY Orders.[Shipment ID], Items.[Item ID];<br />
<br />
And the one that I'm working on, that produces the behavior described above (I should have included it when I asked... oversight on my part) is defined below:<br />
<br />
SELECT [E:Total Items by Shipment].[Shipment ID], Items.[Item ID], [E:Total Items by Shipment].[SumOf# of Item], Switch([E:Total Items by Shipment]![SumOf# of Item]&gt;[Item Prices]![Price Breakpoint],[Item Prices]![Unit Price]) AS [Unit Price]<br />
FROM (Items INNER JOIN [Item Prices] ON Items.[Item ID] = [Item Prices].[Item ID]) INNER JOIN [E:Total Items by Shipment] ON Items.[Item ID] = [E:Total Items by Shipment].[Item ID]<br />
ORDER BY [E:Total Items by Shipment].[Shipment ID], Items.[Item ID];<br />
<br />
Again, thank you so much for helping me get this far.<br />

I'm accustomed to my programming languages giving me a bit more to work with on errors, but that's all Access will tell me. Should I replace the X with the name of the query in question? (I left it as is. Replacing it with the query name did nothing and I suspect
 you would have told me if that was the case.) Again, sorry that I can't provide much other information on this problem. All the table and field names are correct.<br />

</p><p>Yes, they will receive a notification that you're trying to add them as your Skype contact and they should accept the request so you can continuously send&nbsp;them a message. It's the same thing if the user is using the latest version of Skype, if the request
 is not accepted, you will be limited to sending up to 10 messages only.</p>

<h2>            Will Outlook Rule looking for &#34;ADV&#34; in the subject line affect message body&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I created a rule in Outlook to send any messages with "ADV" in the subject line directly to the Deleted Items folder, as I get many&nbsp;"ADVertisements"<span>&nbsp;and did not realize that the
 rule was not case sensitive, and that it would be counted if it was part of a word.&nbsp; A few email&nbsp;"non-spam" emails were deleted inadvertently because of this rule.&nbsp; I had a problem, however, as about 1,100 of my emails were sent to my Deleted Items folder.&nbsp;
 I checked and most of them did not have "ADV" in the subject line, so I am not sure if this was caused by the rule looking at the body contents for "ADV" as well as the subject line, or if I exceeded the limits of my Outlook Mailbox storage (at times I have
 gotten close to 3GB worth of emails).&nbsp; Will Outlook "auto-delete" items if it is getting too full?&nbsp; Sometimes I also have random emails go straight to my Deleted Items without even hitting my Inbox.&nbsp; Here is the exact verbiage of the rule I set in Outlook:</span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p>Apply this rule after message arrives</p>
<p>with ADV in the subject</p>
<p>delete it</p>
<p>Any insight into this issue(s) is appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            The rule you cite should not affect messages not having "adv" as a string in the subject.&nbsp; The rule will not examine the body unless you use that condition (i.e., "in the subject or body") in the rule.

    <title>Writing files to a WRITE-ONLY IMAP folder in Outlook 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iremams  say:</h3>
<h2>            Writing files to a WRITE-ONLY IMAP folder in Outlook 2013</h2>
                    I have recently begun using Outlook 2013 to access a 3rd party servers IMAP folder that use WRITE-ONLY IMAP folders.<br />
<br />
However In Outlook 2013, its seem its now not possible to add messages to WRITE-ONLY folders in this latest 2013 version.&nbsp; (messages get added there via the interface, but due to the write only status of the folder, messages do no get moved at IMAP level)<br />
<br />
This has always been possible in other versions of Outlook&nbsp; (2007 &amp; 2010), as well as other main stream mail-clients like Thunderbird, and is still possible in those versions today without issues.
<br />
<br />
After speaking with a technical support representative on the telephone, they advised me to ask my question here, as this appears to be a known issue in Outlook 2013, and that it may be possible to bypass this using a certain technique.
<br />
<br />
Can anyone give me an idea how to do this?&nbsp; Or do I need to revert back to the older 2010 version.
<br />
<br />
Look forward to hearing from you <br />
<br />
With warm regards<br />
<br />

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Thanks for getting back to me. <br />
<br />
<pre>A "write-only" mailbox is a mailbox where the logged-in user has permission to APPEND <br />and/or COPY messages to the mailbox, but does not have permission to SELECT, EXAMINE, <br />STATUS, SEARCH, or FETCH (or UID FETCH) from the mailbox.  <br />It is used in the same sorts of ways that write-only folders are used in other areas, <br />like filesystems.
It appears from the Outlook debug log that when APPENDing or COPYing a <br />message to a mailbox, it first attempts to SELECT it, and if that fails, <br />then it does not attempt the APPEND/COPY.  <br /><br />This in incorrect, as selecting the destination mailbox is not required.</pre>
<br />
Warm regards<br />
        </p>

Is there any update on this?&nbsp; If this is just not possible , nor cannot be resolved, please let me know so I can revert completely back to an older version of Office.

            How can you tell if there's anything in a "write-only" folder, if you don't have read permission to see what is in it?&nbsp; Also, by definition, something that is "write-only" accepts anything you put into it.&nbsp; Somehow, I don't think you mean "write-only".&nbsp;
 I think you mean writeable only from the server side, but readable from the client side.&nbsp; That's not a "write-only" folder.

            The way in which Outlook now handles IMAP has still definitely changed.&nbsp; I have attached 2 logs (output debug from both Outlooks).
<br />
<br />
The steps in both were the same: <br />
<ul>
<li>Open Outlook</li><li>Navigate to IMAP Folder ".Caught"<br />
</li><li>Select 1 Message</li><li>Right click, move to folder ".Release"&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>As you can see from the 2007 log, It actually does what its supposed to:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>==========</p>
<pre>IMAP: 09:06:12 [tx] opa5 UID COPY 1 "Release"
IMAP: 09:06:12 [db] OnNotify: asOld = 5, asNew = 5, ae = 3

            Have you tried adding "Inbox" (without the quotes) to the root folder path field on the "Advanced" tab of the account settings? &nbsp;That seems to cure a lot of "ailments" in Outlook 2013's IMAP implementation.&nbsp;

Unfortunately this does not work, when I do this it just remove's the folders from the folder pane, and then you cannot even see the IMAP folders correctly.<br />
