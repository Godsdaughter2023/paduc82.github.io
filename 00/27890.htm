<h2>            Runtime versus accdr</h2>
                    Hi <br />
<br />
I am querying if anyone would know the advantages of using Runtime for the end user, versus just changing the file name from a .accdb to an .accdr.<br />
<br />
The intent being, that the end user would only have access to the forms reports, entering data etc and not have any access to the queries/filters, tables and / or any design elements to the database so that it can't be tampered with.<br />
<br />
thanks<br />

            Don't confuse the <i>runtime version of Access</i>&nbsp;with <i>a runtime database</i>.
<div><br />
<div>They are different things!</div>
<div><br />
<div>The runtime version of Access is an installed msaccess.exe crippled by the removal of most design tools. If all the user has is the (free) runtime version, then the design window buttons for forms, reports, VBA and so on are all greyed out, and they cannot
 even get into the mode to change the structure of things; nor can they even see your VBA code. It doesn't matter whether the database is named .accdb, .accdr, &nbsp;.accde, .mdb or whatever - the program itself simply doesn't contain the code to let them change
 the design.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, if the user has a full retail or corporate version of Access installed, then they CAN get into design mode. Changing the extension to .accdr just tells retail Access to behave as if it were the runtime version (it's good for testing to make sure
 that you aren't preventing the user from doing legitimate work). But it does NOTHING to protect the database; the user can just rename it back to .accdb and do whatever they like. Changing the extension doesn't affect what's in the database in any way whatsoever!</div>
<div><br />
<div>What you CAN - and should - do is to use the Make ACCDE option to "compile" the .accdb database into a .accde version. This compiles and hides all the VBA code, and turns off most of the design tools (e.g. you can't open a Form in design view). You can
 still design or change Queries, but not forms or reports. It's possible (using third-party tools you can find on the web) to convert a .accde back to a .accdb but it's not something most endusers will be able to do.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'd suggest keeping your own master copy of the frontend as a .accdb file, well backed up both onsite and offsite; make .accde files for your users, both for security and because they're usually a bit smaller and a bit faster. When they need a new feature,
 create and test it in your master copy and then make and distribute a new .accde. It's totally up to you (and your IT department if you have one) whether to buy each user a retail Access license and install the full program, or install just the runtime.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It's all but impossible to TOTALLY secure the backend. If the database is to be usable at all, then it must be open for reading and writing; if a user can (say) legitimately delete or change some records, then there's no easy way to prevent them from ILLEGITIMATELY
 deleting or changing some other records. &nbsp;If data security is a big issue, you'll need to go to SQL/Server as the backend, with data logging, hot multilevel backups, rollbacks and recoveries, and all the things DBA's get paid for. You just need to decide how
 much effort you need to expend for your particular situation - anything from having one shared .accdb backend (backed up both onsite and offsite at a minimum), to - well, the sky's the limit.</div>

            Ummm... when it comes to vehicles, which is the best to get? Is a Lamborghini sports car better than a Allison-Chalmers earthmover? Depends on what you want it for!
<div><br />
<div>SQL/Server is a Microsoft product available in many flavors, from single- or few-user versions that can run under a desktop Windows system, up to enterprise-scale versions that can use terabytes of storage and hundreds of networked processors. There are
 many competitors in the "server" database market - Oracle, DB/2, Alpha, MySQL, on and on. It would be a major research effort (which I haven't done) to even build a list for comparison, much less to evaluate them for suitability for some particular use. So
 there is no one answer to your question!</div>

<h2>            Media Player not recognizing CDs</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 and Windows Media Player v 12.7.</p>
<p>I have a large library of music ripped from CD to MP3 files. All has been working fine up until yesterday. Now I put a CD in adn it is not recognized by Media Player, right click it and choose Find album Information, the screen clear or a few seconds and
 I get "This Pae Cannot be displayed". My internet connection is fine and I have tried it with my Fireall (Bullguard) lowered without any luck.</p>
<p>Thanks Malcolm</p>

<p>Hi Andre</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the very detailled response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately it's not solved the problem. However Iit may have identified what the issue is which you may be able to help with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run the Windows Media Player troubleshooting it comes back with "Your Music Libary is corrupted", it does not offer any fix for this. I tried it again after going through all the steps but still the same. I found an article on the site that shows
 how to fix this and it says I should go to %userprofile%\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Media Player and delete all files, this has indeed forced Media Player to rebuild the library but still I cannot get to find information on a CD I put in the
 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping you can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Malcol</p>

<p>Hi Gina, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Skype name is a unique identifier that isn't possible to change. Before the migration of Skype to Microsoft, users were allowed to choose their own Skype name but that option is no longer available after the Migration took place. If you created your account
 using an email address, then what you have is a Microsoft account. You will be given a Skype name which will adapt the first part of your email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have further questions, do not hesitate to contact us back. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello friends, I need your help urgently. I have a Nokia 2700c and I need the answer of following questions serialwise : (1) Can Nokia 2700c be installed with Flash Player, Dictionary and PDF reader? If yes,then, how much memory size will it be covered?
 (2) In the internet advertisement, there is availability of PDF reader to be downloaded for Nokia 2700c with different memory capacities. Can that be downlaoded directly from the mobile? Can that be involved virus? (3) There is also internet advt for antivirus
 for Nokia 2700c to be downloaded. Can that be directly downloaded from the mobile? Can that antivirus itself be the virus? PLEASE REPLY.</p>

            Nokia Phones come pre-installed with Flash Lite. There's no way to update this via 3rd party means, or even to update the Flash Player on the phone. The update will only happen through a Firmware Upgrade if it is included by Nokia. Furthermore, S40 phones
 like the 2700 do not support office applications e.g. Pdf readers.

Please read the above information. The information specifically states that Adobe Flash is not available for your mobile device, nor will it ever new made available. Adobe (who are the developers of Flash Player) have stopped all development and support for
 mobile phones, so you will never see full Flash player support for your phone.<br />
All the best.<br />

                    I cant attach a picture, but after a reminder pops up, you get a second window show on the task bar preview in Windows 7 which is blank showing 0 reminders.&nbsp; You cannot show the window by clicking on it and it does not respond to the close command or a
 click on the red x.&nbsp; The only way to get rid of it is to restart Outlook.

<h2>            Customize list search feature</h2>
                    
<p>Llst search is useful because it's fast - it doesn't require a page load like a filter does.</p>
<p>But it would be so much more useful if it included the following options:</p>
<p>1/ the ability to specify which fields are searched (with a drop down like the site search has).</p>
<p>2/ the ability to highlight keywords used in a search that&nbsp; appear in the results.</p>
<p>Seems like a no-brainer - why aren't these options included?</p>

<p>Thanks but I've never seen even the most popular suggestions on user voice get implemented so I'm asking here for any ideas from users.</p>
<p>One more thing which is actually a bug that should be fixed:</p>
<p>If your view has an item limit and the results returned exceed that limit, the pagination that gets triggered doesn't respect the search parameters. In other words if you click page 2 of the results, the search parameters are lost and you get random results.
 If this was built properly, you'd go to page 2 of the results. It seems like Msft creates things and then forgets to finish their development.

<p>It's not an "abnormal" page. It's the normal pagination initiated when the results in a view exceed the item limit set in the view settings. The problem is the filtering that's applied when you do a list search gets overridden by the pagination. Click page
 2 and you appear to go back to an unfiltered view instead of seeing page 2 of the search results - you can tell from the pagination url it continues with the next name in the ALL results view:</p>
<p>https://xxx.sharepoint.com/Pages/xxx.aspx?Paged=TRUE&amp;p_<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Last_x0020_name=<strong>namehere</strong></span>&amp;p_ID=350&amp;PageFirstRow=11&amp;View=xxxxxx547f-46d9-b240-ee996c3e4f4e</p>
<p>The way it obviously should work is the search parameters still get applied OR the view item limit should be ignored when doing a search.</p>

                    <p>Obviously, we ALL hate spam pollution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Might there be a way for Microsoft to automatically delete spam / phishing email from MY Hotmail account when a significant number of Hotmail users report it as such?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To effectively cleanse, you can have algorithms that look for a 95% match of the Subject Line and/or email content, just in case spammers find that subtle changes will spoof this protection.</p>

            Dear Douglas ,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />I understand that this is frustrating to receive lots of spam and unwanted emails. It is even more frustrating to receive scams, spoofing and phishing emails. Scammers nowadays are using multiple methods to intimidate users.
<br />
<br />Please note that Postmaster ( <a href="https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.com/pm/junkemail.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://sendersupport.olc.protection.outlook.co...</a> ) is actually blocking lots of spammers ( and I quote ):
<br />For example, we've implemented a number of mechanisms to reduce the burden of junk email which currently prevents nearly 4.5 billion email messages from reaching Outlook.com users every day!
<br />
<br />There are couple of ways to deal with scammers and unwanted emails and improve how your anty filter will work (I am sure that you are aware of some and you are using them, but maybe additional information in support articles will help you):
<br />
<br />1. First of all check your spam filters and see suggestions on how to keep spam out of your inbox <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-keep-spam-and-junk-email-out-of-your-inbox-in-outlook-com-a3ece97b-82f8-4a5e-9ac3-e92fa6427ae4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/help-k...</a>
<br />2. Report the phishing, spam and unwanted emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-with-abuse-phishing-or-spoofing-in-outlook-com-0d882ea5-eedc-4bed-aebc-079ffa1105a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/deal-w...</a>
<br />3. Add emails or domains to block sender (those that were actually used to send emails - see #5) list <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-senders-or-unblock-senders-in-outlook-com-afba1c94-77bb-4f50-8b85-057cf52f4d5e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/block-...</a>
<br />4. Create specific rules for subjects or common phrases that are present in those emails <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-inbox-rules-in-outlook-com-4b094371-a5d7-49bd-8b1b-4e4896a7cc5d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/use-in...</a> and add conditions, that are common for those emails, for example additional keywords, recipient address includes etc.
<br />5. Nowadays some scammers have learned how to mask their emails addresses that you can see in the emails. However, in the message source you will find the real one (and the real domain) In order to view message source please check this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiving-email-from-blocked-senders-in-outlook-com-265923a0-b52c-4157-92c8-370385215da1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/receiv...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also check tips on how to stay safe online from Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/digital-skills/online-safety-resources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/digital-skills/...</a>
<br />
<br />Hope this will help your email free from Junk!

            Oh I understand this is a community of moderators we are not employee's of Microsoft. I would send feedback there is either a feedback button with in your outlook or a smiley face or within your office documents. I would post comments within the application. The other place to voice your opinions is Uservoice as you seem to have some ideas as to maybe how or what they would need to include that would mark an email as spam. 
<br /><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293349-outlook-for-ios/suggestions/8733700-mark-email-as-spam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/293349-out...</a>
<br />I do understand your frustration with it and if everyone recognised some emails as Phishing and Right clicked on email select Junk Mail and report as Phishing they maybe able to do more but with that said the people doing it change their send methods contantly. It's all computer bots. Please take the time to put your comments within User voice. We are only a community of Moderators people like yourself trying to help others. We are not Employees of Microsoft.

            Hi Douglas,
<br />You may also want to voice your opinion on user voice. 
<br /><a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/601444-new-experiences-in-outlook-com/suggestions/32166301-blocked-emails-are-not-being-blocked-they-still-s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/601444-new...</a> 
<br />I had also read that because emails are going into the junk mail folder by default rules do not apply. The junk filter is gets them which runs before the rules, so then your rules never touch the messages.
<br />Hope this helps in understanding you and me and millions of people out there don't want to see emails in their junk folder. Add your comment to user voice and maybe they will delete blocked mail or at least quarantine it before it hits the mail box. It would give users a chance to release it if it was a valid email. 
<br />Regards,
<br />Sam

<h2>            Calendar notifications for shared mailbox</h2>
                    We have a few shared mailboxes setup in our organization via Office 365 and the users have been populating the calendars within those shared mailboxes but they are not receiving notifications or reminders for them. How can I enable that or get that done?

            <span>Hi PaulStoric1711,<br />
<br />
I understand that the users have access to these shared mailboxes and want to receive the notifications for the shared mailbox calendars. However, in the Outlook client and OWA (Outlook Web App), it is not feasible to receive the calendar notifications for
 the shared mailboxes. Users can only receive the calendar notifications for their own calendars. Only if these users are listed as attendees in the appointments of the shared mailbox calendars, they will receive the notifications. Given the situation, I suggest
 you submit feedback via the link below:<br />

<p><span>Hi Cole,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For the “ Move” option I mentioned in the previous reply is the files which were stored in the Team “File” Tab, not the Conversation Tab( chat ). In the File Tab, you can see the “ Move” option as below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p />
<p>
</p><p><span>On another hand, if “Moving files” you mentioned is referring to the files in the conversation tab, since we cannot directly move the files in the conversation tab ( chat) to other channel. If you concerned about moving files from the conversation
 tab ( chat) to pther channel in the team. It is recommended that please give a feedback to

<h3> virginactive  say:</h3>
<h2>            5610 and 5700</h2>
                    the 5700 has loudspeakers with "Hi-Fi" quality. what does this mean. is it louder than the 6233 through loudspeakers or was nokia exaggerating when they claimed it has "Hi-Fi" quality through loudspeakers.<br />
<br />
in terms of sound quality through headsets. which is louder between the 5310, 5610, 5700, and the n91 8G. which is the loudest.<br />
<br />
and is it possible for nokia to make a better version of the 6233, maybe call it the 6233i or 6233 Music Edition. lol. it has the most powerful loudspeakers in the market but lacks proper music features such as an audiochip and a 3.5mm jack. they could try
 improving the sound quality through loudspeakers.<br />
<br />
i'd be very very delighted if nokia worked on the 6233.<br />
<br />
thank you.

    <title>Cannot launch Office on Demand - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulc307  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot launch Office on Demand</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a current subscription to Office 365 Home Premium. Unfortunately I can't seem to launch the 'Office on Demand' functionality. To be precise, I cannot even locate an option to launch Office on Demand, instead constantly shuffled to the Web Apps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I sign into the <a href="http://www.office365.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.office365.com</a> website I get the Office home page with six options across the top: Home, Products, Support, Templates, Store, Office Online. However, if I click on Office Online I am always presented
 with the Office Web Apps page which only offers Outlook, Word, Powerpoint and Excel (and ancillaries). Neither Access nor Publisher are available, and, of course, the others are the 'cut down' versions of the applications. I require the streamed versions of
 the full applications. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to launch Access through the Office on Demand functionality some time ago, before the apparent redesign of the Office 365 web page. Similarly I had access to the full functionality of Excel whilst streaming. However, as I say I cannot even find
 the option to launch Office on Demand at the moment. It almost appears as though the pages are assuming I don't have a subscription, although I have checked my account details and everything is in order.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the ActiveX controls and they are set correctly, and I have even reset my copy of IE11 using the Microsoft 'Fixit' utility. I have tried to gain access on a different computer, again through IE11 but also through Chrome, and always end up
 at the same 'Office Web Apps' screen with no option to access the functionality that is part of my Office 365 subscription.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would welcome any assistance in resolving this matter. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS - I would point out that there is no 'Office Topic' that relates to the streaming/online functionality, so I apologise if this is incorrectly described.
</p>

<ul>
<li>From Office Online: From the Edit Document menu, click Edit in Word (or <br />
Excel or PowerPoint)</li><li>From OneDrive: Click the checkbox next to the file you'd like to open in <br />

</p><p>Your solution would be fine if my question was about the Office Web Apps. It is not. The very first paragraph makes that abundantly clear. I want to launch Office on Demand. I want to launch the streaming versions of the full applications that are part of
 my Office365 subscription.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make it simple, I want to open an Access database that I created in a streamed version of Access. Access is not a web app, and so the database was created in Office on Demand. Where is Office on Demand? Where is the streaming version of Access?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Reading the&nbsp;description of the "web app" Templates in Access 2013, such as that for the Contacts database that appears when you click on that template, it does say quite clearly that the "template requires SharePoint."</p>

            <p>I appreciate the reply, but this still doesn't address the problem and completely misses the point that Office on Demand is not available. Last year I had access, from the Office 365 page, to a tab called 'My Office'. That included an option to launch streamed
 versions of the full Office applications, including Access. I had that screen, others with the same problem had that screen, multiple websites around the world reviewing Office365 have screenshots of that screen, so I didn't imagine it. I created a database
 using it, I didn't create or want to create a web app as per the link cited. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the link, it clearly states (quote):&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">"When you&nbsp;</span><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/redir/HA102749782.aspx?CTT=5&amp;origin=HA103998864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create
 a web app</a><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">&nbsp;from the Access 2013 start screen, you need to select a web location for the app." and&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">"Before
 you can create an Access web app, you need to have a SharePoint site".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst I am sure you are right about a 'web app', that is not what I ever referred to. just a normal, straightforward 'accdb' Access database that I created beforehand where a local copy of the database was stored on the local machine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For that matter I want to stream the full version of Excel, with support for Paste Transition, pivot tables, charting etc. without going through the office online/web apps. I can understand that you may be saying Office365 Home Premium users from now on
 will have to go through Web Apps/Office Online to get to Office on Demand, although it seems a completely unnecessary step when a simply choice of which version to use would suffice, but that doesn't address the issues surrounding Access and, for that matter,
 Publisher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I ask (yet) again.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How do I launch Access to create/edit a standard, normal database? How do I launch Publisher to create/edit a standard, normal publication?
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are saying that Microsoft's development of the online services now means that paying subscribers no longer have access to full Office applications, or any way of launching Access/Publisher online, then that would make sense, although it would be somewhat
 odd as it is still advertised as functionality of an Office365 Home Premium subscription and no change in the status was notified.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I fail to understand why this is causing so much trouble. The question is simple and straightforward. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I want to stream Office applications online through the Office on Demand functionality that is part of my Office365 Home Premium subscription.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't matter whether it is Word or Excel or Access or Publisher or any other application within Office, which is why I posted it under this topic (there not being one for Office on Demand). I just want to stream the products that used to be simply and
 easily available from the 'My Office' tab after logging into www.office365.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't believe that there isn't a single person associated with this forum who has knowledge and/or experience of the Office on Demand functionality and can just say where it is launched from, or when it will be fixed, or confirm that it has been removed
 without notification.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand! </p>
<p>I'm not using the Office365 - instead my new laptop came with Office Home/Student - and, all I needed to do was activate with the key... Should be easy... Done this before with other systems... But, this is my first experience with Windows 8. The "START"
 page had the Office icon on it before I activated it. After supposed activation - it is GONE. No trace of Office on the system! I have logged on to my Microsoft acct and Office acct (which is new for me) - and, no sign of my Office program being activated
 or available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WT...X!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, I'm quickly disliking this new 8.</p>

            <p>I understand completely what you want to do and I have provided the instructions that I received from a member of the Microsoft Word Product Team for how to access Word or Demand and I believe that a similar process will give access to Excel on Demand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, as advised, I am trying to get information for you on the situation with Access on Demand.</p>

</p><p>What you do not seem to understand is that for the most part, the people who respond to questions in this forum are your peers and probably there are not that many people (either people how ask questions or those who respond to them) who have had occasion

</p><p>This forum - Install, Upgrade and Activate would probably be the worst one that you could have selected for&nbsp;the issue that you raised as most of the people who post to this forum are those who are having issued getting Office 2013 or Office 365 installed

<p>Yes, I do see the background, and when I copied&nbsp; the text into Word it showed up there too. The style inspector identifies it as shading (not highlighting).&nbsp; Because the shading is applied as character formatting (we can tell that because the shading does
 not extend from margin to margin and because the paragaph mark is not included in the shading), you can use with CTRL+spacebar (On U.S. keyboard layout) to clear it and any other direct font formatting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note, though, that if the non-ASCII characters (such
 as <span><span><span>á)</span></span></span>are not Unicode characters, using Ctrl+ spacebar may ruin the text. The&nbsp; bit of text in your
 message contained Unicode characters. So&nbsp; if they all are&nbsp; this easy&nbsp; fix will work.</p>
<p>If you must preserve font formatting, select the shaded text and click the shading icon (it's on the table toolbar in W2003) that you have set to "no color".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the shading is applied as character formatting, your selection must exactly match the
 shaded area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just for further information, if you select an entire paragraph, including its mark, and apply shading, the shading will extend from margin to margin.&nbsp; This is paragraph level formatting.&nbsp;&nbsp; If instead, you select just part of a paragraph and apply shading,
 the shading covers only the selected text.&nbsp; This is character formatting.&nbsp; More Word power that&nbsp; can confuse on first encounter.</p>
<p>HTH,</p>
<p>Pam</p>

<h3> just another tech...  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Search&#34; option from &#34;home&#34; tab in Outlook 2013 has different results than when clicking on  &#34;people&#34; then &#34;search&#34;</h2>
                    <p>One of those odd Office issues, that I do not know if it is by design, or what...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a user is in Outlook 2013, and clicks on "search" from the "home" tab, she gets just a card with the persons name and email address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the user goes to the bottom of Outlook 2013 window, and clicks on "people", then clicks on ''search", she gets a full card with all users contact info, phone number, everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is when doing a search for any contact in her contacts.&nbsp; The user does not like this, because having to go to "people" and then "search" is actually an extra step, then just doing a "search" from the "home" tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why doesn't ALL user contact search info appear when doing either search method?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't find an explanation for it.&nbsp; </p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for choosing Microsoft Office Community and posting your query.<br />
<br />
A quick question before proceeding:<br />
<br />
Which option is selected, while searching for contacts from the Home tab?<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20c7789c-9271-4e27-b007-88057e8e2f42" /><br />
What happens when you select <b>All Outlook Items </b>and then search? Are you able to find expected result?<br />
<br />
By default when you search from <b>Home</b> tab without selecting <b>People</b>, Outlook searches for email not contacts as email is the default content under Outlook Home tab.
<br />
<br />
When you're in <b>Home </b>tab under <b>People</b> option, by default search query fetches results from Contacts and the same applies to
<b>Calendar</b> and <b>Tasks</b>.<br />
<br />
You may also press <b>Ctrl+Shift+F</b> to open <b>Advanced find</b> and select <b>
Contacts</b> under <b>Look </b>and then search and see if it helps.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86d3fafa-69d5-4eba-a1db-246b8d10f384" /><br />
<br />
Hope the above information helps. Reply with the result for further assistance. <br />
<br />
Thank You.<br />

            <p>Hmmmm,,, in automatic mode, you should be getting the time and date from your cellular provider's network.&nbsp; The only reason I can think that it wouldn't be done properly is either a) the 'region/time zone' settings on your phone are incorrect; or b) there's
 a problem with the time setting software on your phone.&nbsp; (It's HIGHLY unlikely that the provider has the wrong time on their network).</p>
<p>You might want to try a 'soft' reset (power down/power up) of the phone and/or a hard reset of the phone (Settings/About) to see if that puts things back where they should be.&nbsp; If the hard reset of the phone doesn't solve the problem, then it's likely there
 is something wrong with the phone from a hardware perspective and you should take it back to the provider.</p>

<h2>            How do I get a subtraction formula to return N&#47;A is text is entered into cell</h2>
                    I have a simple subtraction formula that calculates the number of days between two dates
<div><br />
</div>
<div>=If(D82&gt;0, D82-E50, 0)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However sometimes people will enter "N/A" into cell D82 because that does not apply to the specific project, when that happens the formula returns #VALUE!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I get the formula to return an N/A or a 0 if text is typed in D82 instead of a date?</div>
                </div>

            The IFERROR() function is designed to wrap around a formula, returning the regular result if there is no error and any alternate number, text or empty string if an error code is returned from the calculation. For your purposes (as above) one of these would
 do,
<div><br />
<div>=IFERROR(<span>If(D82&gt;0, D82-E50, 0)</span><span>,"")</span></div>
<div>
<div>=IFERROR(<span>If(D82&gt;0, D82-E50, 0)</span><span>,"n/a")</span></div>
<div>
<div>=IFERROR(<span>If(D82&gt;0, D82-E50, 0)</span><span>,NA())</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>You could also get a little fancy with,</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>
<div>=IFERROR(<span>(D82&gt;0)*(D82-E50)</span><span>,"")</span></div>
<div><span>=IFERROR(</span><span>(D82&gt;0)*(D82-E50)</span><span>,</span><span>"n/a")</span></div>
<div><span>=IFERROR(</span><span>(D82&gt;0)*(D82-E50)</span><span>,</span><span>NA())</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>The last formula(s) produce an actual #N/A Excel error rather than text that looks like
<i>n/a</i>.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>This function was introduced with Excel 2007 and removed the need to double up formulas, once to check if there was an error and another for the result if not. IFERROR() does both with one instance of the formula.</div>

<h2>            Grouping a symbol and text</h2>
                    &nbsp;I'm trying to create a chant text that needs to have triangles above or below certain syllables of words. Is there any way to link the symbol to a syllable, so it will remain there if font size is changed or text is moved? I can put the triangles in small
 text boxes and position the, but of course they won't move if anything else is changed.&nbsp;

            <p>I may&nbsp;have part of an answer. See the article at <span>
<a href="http://wordfaqs.mvps.org/CombineCharacters.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff">http://WordFAQs.mvps.org/CombineCharacters.htm</font></a>&nbsp;and note that these combined characters can be saved as AutoText entries. If the triangles can be placed above/below
 specific letters, then this approach could be used (though it requires a bit of trial and error to set up).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As for the combining character to be used, some fonts (such as Times New Roman) have filled triangles in the Miscellaneous Dingbats character subset, but I assume you want unfilled triangles, and you can find
 those in the Wingdings 3 font. You can insert them using Insert | Symbol, and then you'll need to format them to the desired font size and raise or lower them using the controls on the Character Spacing tab of the Font dialog. Of course, your line spacing
 will need to be large enough to accommodate the characters. Although they will not adapt to a changed font size, they will move with the character.</span></p>

<p>I mean , really, you see an item like a pic or video and you would think there is a way to right click and delete or something but there is nothing!?</p>
<p>Do i just need to close zune and manage things with windows explorer and delete the file manually that way?</p>

<p>When you right click on a picture or video, you don't see anything like this menu? See the delete option just above 'Mixview?' Could you post a picture of what your right click menu looks like when selecting a picture? In the pictures view, the delete option
 should be above 'Properties.' Also know that if you delete a photo from the Zune software there is no option to simply remove a photo from your collection without deleting it. As a result, deleting a photo with the Zune software will also delete it from your
 PC.</p>
