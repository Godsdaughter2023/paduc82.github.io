    <title>Not enough storage to download Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tommydaelo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not enough storage to download Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>So I have a laptop which has a total storage of 28.8GB, pretty bad because my parent bought it without knowing about the storage space, there is 11,2GB reserved already for the system along with pre-installed thing on the laptop, leaving me with under 3GB
 of storage and unable to download window 10 as it needs 8GB. I've already tried factory resetting the laptop, trying to install Windows 10 for it to say I don't have enough storage. I've followed several tips to try and increase the storage space but I am
 still unable to install it. Any ideas as to how I can install windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also another question. my laptop has recently started to crash when I only have 2 or more windows open at the same time, this has started to happened ever since my McAfee Livesafe expired. My laptop screen either turns black, then i have to restart or the
 windows just close by themselves.<br />

</p><p>Did you do a complete disk clean up</p>
<p>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Administrative Tools&gt;disk clean up</p>
<p>after 1st scan select clean up system files</p>
<p>after 2nd scan select all boxes except you install log files</p>
<p>then select the&nbsp;more options tab and select to delete all restore points but the current one. Confirm yes</p>
<p>then click on OK and it will delete what you checked in the boxes</p>
<p>Note: during the scan and deleting files, windows update clean up can take a long time, especially if you do not clean them up often or never have.</p>
<p>Then restart PC, Note: windows update clean up may still finish the clean up on restarting PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to My computer or My PC and see what the total&nbsp;free space&nbsp;is.</p>

</p><blockquote>

<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Well if you did complete clean up as I mentioned, uninstalled some programs and deleted some personal files and that is all that is left, I believe you will need to Buy a bigger SSD (Drive) and install windows on it and go from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would copy all your personal files you want to a DVD,.BlurRay, Thumb Drive or the public folder on another PC you might have on your home network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would then use Windows back up and restore(Win7) and also use back up and back up your personal files into a back up file to the back up location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>****Now I would in Windows back up and restore(Win7), create a system image. This will restore the new hard drive back to the exact state your system is in now. This will eliminate needing your back ups you created as mentioned above and prevent you from
 having to reinstall and set up your PC again on new drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after in Windows back up and restore(Win7), you create a system image, then select yes to create a repair CD and make one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You probably will need to save the image on another PC on your network public folder location. This would be
\\THE NAME OF THE OTHER PC.
</p>
<p>or save it on a Large size thumb drive if one is large enough to hold your image and leave the thumb drive plugged in to USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>then when you start up with new drive and with repair cd in, when prompted,&nbsp;hit any key (spacebar numerous times) and the repair files with load. Note: this takes some time and screen will be black, just be patient as the files are loading. then select to
 restore from a system image. Then if it can not find the image,&nbsp;you will have to select the location.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t recognize second monitor</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>recently i tried to attach a second monitor to my desktop, but it refuses to recognize the old one, the one i had first, now that it is not running over VGA. The new monitor only has a VGA in, so I had to try something else for the first monitor. Both of
 them definitely work, the DVI in on the first monitor works with the Dvi/HDMI cable i'm trying to use and a chromecast, and the new monitor, running over VGA, is detected and working properly.</p>
<p>My system:</p>
<p>AMD A10-7700K</p>
<p>Asus A55BM-A/USB3</p>
<p>1x4Gb G.Skill Sniper 2133MHz</p>
<p>First monitor: Acer X203h</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for replying.</p>
<p>I tried everything you suggested, and still have the same problem. The HDMI and DVI out both work, I tested them with my TV and it worked fine.</p>

    <title>A Unified Console - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sdrol 117  say:</h3>
<h2>            A Unified Console</h2>
                    
<p>I am sure this idea has been tossed around many times, but why has it been rejected? Besides the outrageous pride and greed of big name corporations like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, this would bring nothing but good to the gaming community. A single console.
 The Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii, all brought together in a single package. This idea may be necessary for the actual video game industry to thrive. I'll break it down:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part 1: The Console</p>
<p>Obviously the console would basically be a PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii combined. It should be packaged with a fully functional Blu-ray drive, the same processing power as the PS3, the built in Wi-Fi, and everything else built into the top notch consoles. How
 would this help anybody? Well for the consumer it is obvious, how many of us are segregated between our friends, being unable to play with many of them, because they own a different console? Should you have to pay another $300 just to play the same game you
 were playing on a different console? It would connect everybody in the world together who plays console games under one united roof, breaking the barrier between them, and ending all the unnecessary console wars. It would also help the manufacturers. The Wii
 would not have been left behind in the move into HD gaming, the Wii2 (or whatever it will be called) would not be rushed onto store shelves within the next year or so in order to keep up with the competition, the Xbox would have the Blu-ray it would very much
 benefit from, and the consoles would generally be built better under the united roof because they would not have to be rushed out to fit consumer demands and to beat out the competition in sales. Revenue with the console could easily be divided 1/3 profit
 to each company, guaranteeing a revenue to everybody and allowing more production money to make better games.</p>
<p>Part 2: The Controller</p>
<p>This is barely even an issue, as the PS3 and Xbox 360 controller have the same number of buttons but different layouts, each user could use whatever controller fit his preference. Obviously, the Xbox 360 controller would need the added six-axis that is standard
 on PS3 controllers. The Wii and the Move controllers are basically the same and would be easily combined. The controllers would only need to be swapped depending on the game played. The controller you chose to buy would be one of the ways each company get's
 their own money (buying an Xbox controller would give straight profit to Microsoft for example). Peripherals would be created by each company and revenue for them (light gun, Kinect, Balance Board, etc) would be given to the company that created it.</p>
<p>Part 3: The Games</p>
<p>To start, the games themselves would be of much higher quality. How many multi-platform games are plagued with bugs and glitches on a certain system? Fallout: New Vegas was glitchy in general, but it is well known that it was even worse on the PS3. Black
 Ops had major frame rate issues on the PS3, and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion had game ending bugs on the PS3. There were many more problems with many other games, these I just know off the top of my head. These bugs, glitches, and overall quality of games
 would easily increase if developers were able to concentrate on one console, instead of having to port it over to others. Exclusive games (Like Halo, or Killzone) would still be exclusive to the company, and all revenue from that game sold would go straight
 there. Most of the competition between companies would be between games instead of consoles, causing a major upgrade in game quality and a major revenue increase to each company (who here can't say they never wished Xbox 360 had God of War or Uncharted?) and
 would cause a much more widespread appeal with games and consumers would be much better off.</p>
<p>Part 4: The Online</p>
<p>The Online would be one of the biggest problems, but it could be easily done with the power of all the companies. You would now be able to play games with all your friends, and wouldn't be stuck picking sides with what console you would buy to play with
 them. The servers would have to be upgraded to deal with everybody on them, but a single unified server would also keep the strength up and could also prevent events like the recent PSN fiasco. With all the companies working to keep the network up, I am sure
 the security would also be top notch. Having a pay for online would be a must, as it helps keeps the companies going and keeping things up to date.</p>
<p>Part 5: The Third Party Companies</p>
<p>Many Third Party Companies have tried and failed to succeed in the gaming industry, especially on the Wii. If the third party companies could attempt to stay on board one console, instead of being required to go multi-platform in hopes of making profits,
 they may be able to increase the quality and increase their own personal revenue, promising future good titles on the console, and we may see many more interesting and innovative things.</p>
<p>Part 6: The Money</p>
<p>This idea would instantly cause a cheaper outlook on games. One single console, instead of owning all three to get the full experience. The console makers would still be making loads of money, because the consoles will still sell like fire (maybe even more
 so). But with all the games coming out for a single console, consumers may also buy more games, because more options will be available, games will be of higher quality, and they won't miss out on exclusive titles. Consumers always buy peripherals and other
 gear, so companies would still be reeling in money.</p>
<p>I think this is what the industry needs in order to take a giant step forward and become what us gamers truly expect it to be. Any thoughts/comments/concerns/questions would be great!</p>

<p>Competition would still be among the games themselves, the current competition is what is making the crap. A new Wii so soon would be unnecessary and Xbox 360s are made out of the crappiest material they can find (I am currently awaiting my 5th Xbox 360).
 All three business would still have the financial support because millions of consoles still sell, online would be payed for, and games still rack in more money than consoles.

<p>Wow what a terrible idea. If I were owner of a company and other companies that werent doing as good as mine wanted to merge and split profits? HELL NO. Splitting profits on the exact same hardware is the dumbest idea I have ever heard. Yuo realize the online
 service would skyrocket to maybe 30$ a month? And it not even be that great because the companies cant afford to support that many gamers at a time? Please reference the month of April for PSN only much worse. Quit saying "greed of (fillinblank)" its not greedy
 when a company makes money. </p>

<p>Shocker i could barely understand what you said. From what I could tell, there is no reason the price would sky rocket to $30 a month, and I never said they are greedy for making money, the greed causes the consumers to suffer. there is a difference between
 making profits because you earned it and making profits because somebody has went through five of your crappy products.</p>

<p>This whole idea is completely ridiculous. These companies participate in espionage to try and discover what each is doing on a daily basis. They compete for a market and try to dominate. It is impossible to even consider them 'working together' on some kind
 of 'super console'.</p>

<p>That idea is okay... but you inspired an interesting concept I heard back in the day.. People on PSN playing competitive or Co-op &nbsp;with players on XBL</p>
<p>It would help keep some of those online games out there alive longer if they could do it that way

                    Has anyone recieved a solution for this problem yet? I am using 2 500gb SSD's with new installation(Windows 10) and a "not enough free space" error when attempting to mirror the first partition using Windows 10. I experienced this problem b4 but only when
 it came time for the last partition which is easy to correct by shrinking the volume. This job is being done using the MBR partitions.

<h2>            How can I get &#34;Copy as path&#34; to appear immediately when I right-click instead of having to press Shift first&#63;</h2>
                    In Windows Explorer, I am always using the "Copy as path" option and it is a pain to always have to press Shift to get this and some other additional context-sensitive menu options.<br />

</p><p>I have just set up a guest account for my newly ex hubby as I didn't want him accessing all my files, emails, Onedrive, etc. He got on the internet ok, but now says he cannot print from his guest user account. I obviously don't want him having access to
 everything, but being able to print is essential.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He says the printer does not even show up as being there, and it says administration access required.</p>

<h2>            the windows search service on local computer started and then stopped.  some services stop automatically if they are not in use by other services or programs</h2>
                    indexing will not rebuild.&nbsp; when i search in explorer indexing is off and i am prompted to turn on.&nbsp; windows search service shows error of missing file.&nbsp; the file may have been deleted during uninstall of other programs.

            <p>Hi Robertfludd,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sorry to know that you are facing an issue with Windows Search. It would be helpful</span><span>
 if you could reply to these questions to assist you further.</span></p>
<p>1. When did the issue start?</p>
<p>2. Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the system?</p>
<p>3. Which missing file error message are you receiving?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s try the following steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>You may try running the
<span>Search and Indexing troubleshooter and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/is-IS/windows7/Open-the-Search-and-Indexing-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open the Search and Indexing troubleshooter</a></p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2: Rebuild the Search Index.</p>
<p><span>a. Open Indexing and Search Options by clicking the
<strong><span>Start</span></strong> button, clicking<strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>, clicking
<strong><span>Indexing Options</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click
<strong><span>Advanced</span></strong>, click the
<strong><span>Index Settings</span></strong> tab, and then click
<strong><span>Rebuild</span></strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 3:</p>
<p>If the troubleshooter doesn’t fix the issue, you may turn-off the Windows Search feature in Turn Windows features on or off, restart the computer and turn-on
 the same again.</p>

    <title>Why dont my speakers reach full volume&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris_305  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why dont my speakers reach full volume&#63;</h2>
                    I have a set of&nbsp; Altec Lansing speakers (120V 60 hz, that are probably little outdated but have always worked great and can get loud. I only use the front two speakers which are plugged into the subwoofer, which is plugged to my laptop with a output cord
 with a light green tip..&nbsp; I don't think any of my speakers or cords are damaged, I think my connection to my laptop is fine, and I actually think this problem is new. I have had my Toshiba laptop for almost 2 years, it runs Windows 7. Recently when using Netflix,
 pandora, or really anything, my speakers do not reach their full potential volume. The adjustment bars in the program settings is at max level, the computer adjustment bar is at the top, yet the green light indicator of sound only peaks at about half the bar.
 Both speakers are producing sound equally, with no distortion and good sound quality, its just too QUIET. I can't understand how the bars are maxed out for the speakers and the computer, but the sound is only getting put out with half the volume. One interesting
 thing is that the control panels says my speakers are Conexant CX 20671 SmartAudio HD, and I can't find any program or driver on my computer for any altec lansing speakers. Does my computer maybe need the correct driver to use my speakers and I just haven't
 noticed this whole time?<br />
Please help me watch netflix on my tv again. :)<br />
THanks, Chris<br />

            Most often when a device doesnt workl it is because of a driver.&nbsp; Try re-installing yours.<br />
<br />
This works for win 7 &amp; 8<br />
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly?SignedIn=1<br />
<br />
<br />
1) After installing Windows 7 - have you installed the newest audio drivers? If not download them from the manufacturers website, or if they don’t have any try Windows Update. Update driver for hardware that isn't working properly:<br />
<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly<br />
<br />
<br />
2) If you have external speakers - are they connected properly to the computer? If they need power are they plugged in? Are they turned on?<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Have you set the correct sound device? Click Start, type: sound. Then click Sound under Control Panel. Then set the default sound device.<br />
<br />
<br />
More options:<br />
<br />
4) Is the sound device disabled?<br />
<br />

<br />
B. Select "Playback Devices"<br />
<br />
C. In the white empty space right click and select both Show Disconnected/Disabled Devices<br />
<br />
D. Do you see icons for your sound device now?<br />
<br />
E. If you now see it you may need to right click on the correct sound device and select "Set as default device"<br />
<br />
<br />
5) You can also try the troubleshooter to find any connection issues:<br />
<br />
A. Click Start, then click Control Panel<br />

<p><font color="#000000"><font><b><span>Fast startup</span></b><span> is turned in by default in Windows and is a setting
 that helps your PC start up faster after shutdown. Windows does this by saving system info to a file upon shutdown so when you start your PC again, Windows uses that system info to resume your PC instead of restarting it.</span></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font><b><span>Notes</span></b><span>: The fast startup setting doesn’t apply to Restart. You need
 to shut down and then start your PC again for fast startup to take effect.</span></font></font></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font><b><span>A power plan</span></b><span> is a collection of hardware and system settings (like
 display, sleep, etc.) that manages how your PC uses power. The power plans you can use depend on the kind of PC you have.</span></font></font></p>

<p>
</p><p>I've&nbsp;searched the internet and can not find a good PowerShell script to verify all my domain PC's are activated.&nbsp; The Domain controller is 2016 standared and about 130 PC's.&nbsp; 1/2 are OEM licensed and 1/2 have been imaged with a Volume license MAK key.&nbsp; I
 believe most are activated but I run across some that are not.&nbsp; I would like a complete, definitive answer if they are all activated.&nbsp; The ones I found that are not activated have an error the indicates the Microsoft Activation server cannot be contacted.&nbsp;
 Would you have a script or other tool that could help?&nbsp; If I have a list of un activated PC's I can manually add the VL MAK key and activate them.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi 123rainbow,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Do you face similar issue while playing movies from a CD or DVD?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>ISP means Internet Service Provider. It is nothing about downloading Cwdjr just wants you to know that the display
 of movies might depend on the internet speed offered to you by the internet service provider. Also some players do have an option to adjust the download rate of data from the website which may or may not be possible in your case.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>It might be an issue with your graphics card. I would suggest you to change the hardware acceleration and check if this helps -<br />
a. </span></span><span><span>Close Expression Media if it is open.<br />
b. Click <strong>Start</strong> and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>. <br />
c. Click <strong>Appearance and Personalization</strong>, and then click <strong>
Personalization</strong>. <br />
d. Under <strong>Personalize appearance and sounds</strong>, click <strong>Display Settings</strong>.<br />
e. Click <strong>Advanced Settings</strong>, click the <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> tab, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Change Settings</strong>.
<br />
f. Move the <strong>Hardware acceleration</strong> slider to <strong>Medium</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong> three times.
<br />
g. Close <strong>Personalize appearance and sounds</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>By default the hardware acceleration will be high, so reduce the hardware acceleration to medium level and check.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

If the movie is fairly new and is blury and is downloaded completely before you play it, there indeed likely is a problem on your computer. However if you watch a movie that is streamed online, the problem may be that the download speed of your isp is low.
 Many streaming movie services will adjust for lower Kbps streaming. In some cases you can select a rate and in other cases the adjustment is done automatically. Even at the highest streaming rate available the resolution of a movie usually will be much less
 than that of a good DVD, to say nothing of a good Blu-ray disc.&nbsp; I can stream some movies from Netflix at the maximum rate they provide. I nearly always rent the DVD from them instead because the resolution of the DVD usually is far superior. However my idea
 of a blury movie and your idea may be different.<br />

<h2>            Demoted in COD 4 Modern Warfare</h2>
                    
<p>Folks,</p>
<p>I know this is an older game but I just got started a few days ago.&nbsp; This evening while playing, I was suddenly demoted to Private status (I was level 13, Staff Sgt, I think).&nbsp; Every time I killed a player, I lost 4,000 XP, and through the game, the message
 "UNVERIFIED" would appeared on the screen repeatedly.</p>
<p>After the match, I noticed that not only was I demoted, but I couldn't access any of the matches on the menu; the menu was "greyed" out so I can't engage in any multiplayer anymore on this game - can't even try to level my guy back up.&nbsp; Oddly, though, my
 other stats are as they were before.&nbsp; Same challenge stats, same equip.</p>
<p>I restarted the console twice; same deal.</p>
<p>An XBOX Ambassador said what the other forums suggest: that the lobby was jatged, and discouraged me from looking into other hacked lobbies where I may be able to get help.</p>
<p>So, what do I do now?&nbsp; Is there a way to get my XP and rank restored?&nbsp; Please advise. Very frustrating.&nbsp; Was finally getting good at the game.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi there, unfortunately it sounds like you were in a modded lobby and there isn't much you can do to get your rank back.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If you did wish to look for support on this issue it would be best to get in contact with the developer of the game here: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.infinityward.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.infinityward.com/</a> though as a heads up because they
 have a more recent title out they no longer support MW.</p>

<p>So, here's a question: is this lip service, or do I take them at their word? I'm, frankly, a little surprised they'd be making this investment in an older game (and, well, more surprised that they DIDN'T to do so when it was a newer game).</p>

<p>They probably are unable to do anything the thing is they would have to spend alot of money &nbsp;to patch an older game so they normally don't ,and just continue with the new things like MW3 and BO2</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Try performing SFC scan on the computer.</p>
<p>SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with the /scannow switch, the tool will scan all of the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as necessary.
</p>
<p>Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues. Considering that, plus the fact that SFC /scannow is completely automatic and very easy to use, the tool should usually be one of your
 first troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<p><strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 update crashed computer</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I don't have exact dates or times, but my old laptop updated to windows 10 without me wanting it - I specifically remember not wanting it at all and closed every notification about the update.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, my laptop updates to windows 10 and a few days later, 2 days before my final assessment for University, my laptop crashed. Luckily, I had backups saved on my memory card, but this potentially could've cost me my degree.<br />
<br />
As a result, I also had to buy a new laptop (the one I'm using now, it has windows 10 and works fine) which cost £349.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I believe that the windows 10 update crashed and the thing that made me post this was a link posted to Facebook of a woman who recieved $10,000 compensation for a similar problem.<br />
<br />
(http://www.iflscience.com/technology/microsoft-pays-out-10000-after-unwanted-windows-10-update/)<br />
<br />
Now, I'm not asking for 10k, as I was fine (luckily, no thanks to Microsoft) and could do my work at University, but I also had to buy a new laptop as a result of this.<br />
<br />
Is there anything Microsoft can do for me?<br />
I don't want any fixes or solutions or anything like that. My laptop completely f*cked it due to this stupid update which, again, I DID NOT WANT. I would, however, like compensation as the woman in the article appears to have gotten.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
If nothing comes of this, I would just like to address that in the future, if there is an update for microsoft... DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT WITHOUT MY PERMISSION. Extremely p*ssed off customer.</p>

Had backups. And yes, whilst Microsoft isn't a bank, it IS a world leading technology company, so why have there been several cases of the new update crashing computers?<br />

Also, why did it update without my permission?</span>

            <p>I too had a PC upgrade when I specifically did not want this to happen. When it did it messed up my internal network, I could not move files around as I could before. It took hours to discover that not only do you have turn on network discovery, printer
 and file sharing, share the root, then the specific folder, then you have to tell Windows 10 to share it with<em> everybody</em> in Advanced sharing. None of the help screens mentioned the last Advanced sharing, I found it by accident.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think its very arrogant of Microsoft to force this crappy bug filed software on us. Updating with out permission should never happen. So I am currently in a position with one PC that upgraded without permission and caused me an afternoon of hair pulling,
 and one PC that I did want to upgrade but will not because it will not see my other drives, USB included.</p>

            I kept declined the update but it ended up installing itself. My computer crashed and won't&nbsp;go past an initial install screen. It did once after being turn off for several weeks but then it wouldn't accept my Windows pass key/code or whatever it is. Also
 couldn't connect to the internet. SUCH A HEADACHE. I tried to override and boot up from a disk and no go either.&nbsp;I had just FINALLY got a refurbished working desktop that was halfway decent and now I want RIP MY HAIR OUT. Thanks a lot Windows 10.

            I have a computer repair shop, I see this all the time even now in Nov, 2017. My own computer did a "Update and Shutdown" one night. It never booted back up, despite my efforts to recover the OS. I've had several Windows computers to updates on their own
 and literally take 5-6 hours to complete. I'm working on one now that failed in an update and looks like I'll be reloading Windows 10 for this person. Such is the way of Windows.<br />

<h2>            Unable to download and install Framework.net 4.6.1 &#38; 4.6.2</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello, </p>
<p>I'm trying to install the latest Framework.net 4.6.1 and 4.6.2, but in both cases, I get an error message and an Installation Failed message, despite being connected to the Internet. I don't understand why, and I need it to install several softwares such
 as Windows Paint.net and Website X5 professional 13 for my upcoming business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely, ever since the release of the Framework.net 4.6.1, I also started having issues of latency with my audio drivers when using external hardware (that is for the ASIO drivers, or the MME/DirectX drivers) that I didn't have before the releases. Are
 the two issues related?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Alienware X51 R2, Windows 8.1 64 bit.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Hello, thank you for the links.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried them (at least the 4.6.1; I wanted to wait for the 4.6.2 until the 4.6.1 was installed first), but it still gave me an "Installation failed" error message.</p>

            <p>I don't know if you got my last reply for its been some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But while I was waiting, I made some researches, and found several troubleshooting solutions, such as deactivating my A/V, clearing a Download folder, etc. And finally, I used the Framework Repair Tool, but nothing yet. My Framework 4.6.1, both with the
 online and offline installers, still won't install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Repair Tool afterwards gave me a list of logs to be reviewed, so here it is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8i_5E-tsRA0T004Z3BvbkRIblU</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope we can find a solution, because I really need the Framework, to finally install an important software for my business and upcoming project...</p>

<h2>            personal and work accounts no longer associated</h2>
                    <p>Interesting challenge this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My skype account (and therefore the name I have always used) was associated with my personal Microsludge account when MSN messenger was discontinued (I trecall saying they needed to be one account from there forward).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On this origianl skype account my work email address has always been associated as the primary email address and the hotmail (personal one as above) was there too incase of trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, as a skype user rather than anything else in the past (Skype for Business being a complete waste of effort as it does not communicate with Skype! What's that all about!?) I need to maintain the 'SKYPE NAME' and consolidate these randomly generated
 accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason today, one of my contacts can no longer send me messages and it appears that it's all because I now have these three accounts!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest how I go about getting back to the way it was?</p>
<p>It wont let me add my work account as a skype alias because... Well who knows why!?<br />
It wont let me add my hotmail as a Skype alias because it already is an account in it's own right<br />
I never created skype accounts other than MY account and now msft have created another two accounts I cannot use, but somehow interfere with the original account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want all accounts removed except one but I can't even see how to delete an account so I can move email address over.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/afb6bc68-97d8-4338-ac2a-f9422f386368" title="MatthewRobbins1">
<p>
</p><p>You need to make sure that you are signing in using the <strong>Skype name</strong> (username) instead of the email address. One possible reason why you are seeing&nbsp;more than one&nbsp;accounts under one email address is because you might have signed in to Skype
 using your account's associated email address instead of your Skype Name without merging them first, thus resulting to a new Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All Skype accounts were transitioned to basic Microsoft accounts last October 2016, although users with legacy accounts (Skype Name-created accounts) still need to fully update their accounts to enjoy the benefits of a full Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We, at Skype, no longer have an option to delete accounts. Microsoft aimed to bring convenience on your end and that means you do not need to contact us to process the cancellation. You may click this link for the step by step process in deleting your account:&nbsp;
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-skype-account?q=close+skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I close my Skype account</a></strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To set your expectation, if you proceed to delete your Skype account, the associated Microsoft account will be closed as well. This is due to the full migration of Skype to Microsoft and one credentials to all Microsoft Products. If you are using other email
 domains such as Yahoo, Gmail, etc., you can still use the email for signing in to any other email account but can no longer be used to sign in to any Microsoft Products
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your account will be closed after 60 days, but you if you change your mind anytime during the 60 day period. All you have to do is sign in to your account again to cancel the closure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The 60-day waiting period helps keep hackers from changing an account’s security info as a way to completely take over that account. This waiting period gives the real account owner enough time to be alerted of the change and to cancel it in case they didn’t
 start it. Hope this helps! Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Touchpad Problem on ASUS Laptop. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronlacy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Touchpad Problem on ASUS Laptop.</h2>
                    <p><span>I looked for previous responses from Microsoft to FIX my problem regarding an ASUS laptop Touchpad!</span></p>
<p><span>The Touchpad is SO sensitive that I cannot even use it at all. I tried to use it to write THIS question but spent a wasted 20 minutes typing it in the Microsoft support website and then have the cursor jump around and delete text, I eventually had
 it EXIT the whole message !!!!!!!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I read some other question regarding Touchpad problems, BUT they always give the SAME ANSWER! I have posted other question regarding Windows 10 and I also have ALWAYS gotten the same answer, "TRY UPDATING THE DRIVES!"<span>&nbsp;
</span>Don't you have any REAL technicians at Microsoft? Anyone can read and type THAT DUMB answer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have been working on and using computers for 33 years, did programming, built over 20 computers and did computer consulting for 10 years. Been using Microsoft products since 1987, MS Dos 2.0 and Windows 2.0. I Beta tested Windows 95 and others.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also started Beta/Technical testing Windows 10, back in February or March.<span>&nbsp;
</span>What I did with it was pretty minimal, on an old laptop! <span>&nbsp;</span>I guess I did not test it enough, on ALL of my computers? I have had NUMEROUS problems over the years with Windows and their updates. I would often have to trouble shoot problems
 and found drivers causing some of the problems! If I was unable to FIX IT, then I would BLOCK that update. It got so bad that the last 5-6 years I set my updates to "Download the updates but do not install them". THAT way I could keep track and usually ID
 the problem, when it WAS UPDATE related.</span></p>
<p><span>But NOW with AUTOMATIC UPDATES MANDITORY we are stuck with BAD UPDATES.</span></p>
<p><span>I tried going to ASUS and updating the Touchpad drivers but found NOTHING for Windows 10. The old driver IS what is causing the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I NEED to either be able to ADJUST the sensitivity or to disable, or uninstall it?
<span>&nbsp;</span>I NEVER use the touchpads on ANY of my laptops, they always cause MORE TROUBLE than they are worth! I have already spent SIX hours today and EVERY TIME I do ANYTHING Windows 10 re-ENABLES it or re-INSTALLS the drivers. I CANNOT even touch the
<span>&nbsp;</span>I NEVER use the touchpads on ANY of my laptops, they always cause MORE TROUBLE than they are worth! I have already spent SIX hours today and EVERY TIME I do ANYTHING Windows 10 re-ENABLES it or re-INSTALLS the drivers. I CANNOT even touch the
 keyboard but the cursor JUMPS all over the place! I know that it IS an ASUS problem and the hardware, but it IS MY computer but now Microsoft THINKS that THEY own it now because I installed THEIR WINDOWS 10 O.S. on MY computer!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>IF I have one more problem with Windows 10 like THIS I AM DONE WITH IT. And I will NEVER recommend it to ANYONE!</span></p>
<p><span>So IF you have any real technicians what would your answer be.</span></p>

<p><span>I looked for previous responses from Microsoft to FIX my problem regarding an ASUS laptop Touchpad!</span></p>
<p><span>The Touchpad is SO sensitive that I cannot even use it at all. I tried to use it to write THIS question but spent a wasted 20 minutes typing it in the Microsoft support website and then have the cursor jump around and delete text, I eventually had
 it EXIT the whole message !!!!!!!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I read some other question regarding Touchpad problems, BUT they always give the SAME ANSWER! I have posted other question regarding Windows 10 and I also have ALWAYS gotten the same answer, "TRY UPDATING THE DRIVES!"<span>&nbsp;
</span>Don't you have any REAL technicians at Microsoft? Anyone can read and type THAT DUMB answer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have been working on and using computers for 33 years, did programming, built over 20 computers and did computer consulting for 10 years. Been using Microsoft products since 1987, MS Dos 2.0 and Windows 2.0. I Beta tested Windows 95 and others.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also started Beta/Technical testing Windows 10, back in February or March.<span>&nbsp;
</span>What I did with it was pretty minimal, on an old laptop! <span>&nbsp;</span>I guess I did not test it enough, on ALL of my computers? I have had NUMEROUS problems over the years with Windows and their updates. I would often have to trouble shoot problems
 and found drivers causing some of the problems! If I was unable to FIX IT, then I would BLOCK that update. It got so bad that the last 5-6 years I set my updates to "Download the updates but do not install them". THAT way I could keep track and usually ID
 the problem, when it WAS UPDATE related.</span></p>
<p><span>But NOW with AUTOMATIC UPDATES MANDITORY we are stuck with BAD UPDATES.</span></p>
<p><span>I tried going to ASUS and updating the Touchpad drivers but found NOTHING for Windows 10. The old driver IS what is causing the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I NEED to either be able to ADJUST the sensitivity or to disable, or uninstall it?
<span>&nbsp;</span>I NEVER use the touchpads on ANY of my laptops, they always cause MORE TROUBLE than they are worth! I have already spent SIX hours today and EVERY TIME I do ANYTHING Windows 10 re-ENABLES it or re-INSTALLS the drivers. I CANNOT even touch the
 keyboard but the cursor JUMPS all over the place! I know that it IS an ASUS problem and the hardware, but it IS MY computer but now Microsoft THINKS that THEY own it now because I installed THEIR WINDOWS 10 O.S. on MY computer!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>IF I have one more problem with Windows 10 like THIS I AM DONE WITH IT. And I will NEVER recommend it to ANYONE!</span></p>
<p><span>So IF you have any real technicians what would your answer be.</span></p>

<p>Hello Billion Debbarma<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>November 11, 2015</span></p>
<p>First THANKS for your response, I was pretty upset, all together I spent 10 hours yesterday working on this problem and was
<strong>never able to fix the problem.</strong></p>
<p>SORRY!! </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>THIS is pretty LONG!! I promise that any further communications will be much shorter.</p>
<p>My computer is an ASUS laptop G56JK-EB72. ASUS cannot help and they do not even have drivers for this laptop in Windows 10, for ANYTHING except a
<strong>BIOS update</strong> and the <strong>Manual</strong>, which I already have both and have installed the BIOS #202.</p>
<p>I had already TRIED <strong>everything</strong> yesterday, that you mentioned, EXCEPT Troubleshooting because in 25+ years Troubleshooting usually does not work, and is a waste of time! But I tried it anyway, since you suggested
 it. I am willing to try <strong>anything</strong> but I tell you IF I cannot fix it by Friday I will
<strong>have to</strong> go back to Windows 8.1!</p>
<p>I really like Windows 10. I installed it on a Windows 8.1<span>&nbsp;
</span>8 inch tablet and it works great.<span>&nbsp; </span>The tablet had 32 GB of RAM but 8 GB was
<strong>reserved</strong> for the operating system, <strong>limiting</strong> what was available to 24 GB for programs and data.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, somehow Windows 10 returned 4.4 GB to be available?<span>&nbsp; </span>
So now I have 28.4 GB instead of 24.0 GB. It also seems faster, I like the new menu setups, and it seems like a much cleaner setup than Windows 8.1 or Windows 7.</p>
<p>However, IF I am stuck with this problem and more future problems because of the Microsoft's new policy of
<strong><em>Mandatory</em> 'Automatic Windows Updates'</strong> <span>(read </span>
previous post where I talked about UPDATE problems over the last 25 years years) then I will stick with Windows 7 or 8.1.<br />
<br />
The routine you outlined in <strong>STEP 1</strong>. is different on my computer:&nbsp;
<strong>Windows + X&nbsp;key</strong> -&gt;&gt; <strong>Control Panel </strong>-&gt;&gt; Typed <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong> in Search Bar -&gt;&gt; <strong>Control Panel</strong> -&gt;&gt; <strong>
SMALL ICON</strong>&nbsp;- I could NOT run <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> as Administrator.&nbsp; I ran Troubleshooting anyway and it did nothing!<span>&nbsp;
</span>I know that often I can right click an icon and it will give me the option to run as Administrator. So I made a new shortcut on my desktop for
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and tried that. The option was NOT available. I even tried clicking on the PROPERTIES and then ADVANCED
<strong>but</strong> the option to run as Administrator was GREYED OUT?? By the way this is a Home version of Windows 10, not Pro or any other version??</p>
<p><span>I have tried <strong>
Deactivating</strong> the <strong>ASUS Tablet</strong> and <strong>Uninstall</strong>ing it at least 10 times
<strong>EACH</strong>, <strong>yesterday</strong>.&nbsp; Both requires a <strong>Reboot</strong> and the Reboot
<strong>ALWAYS</strong> REACTIVES the Touchpad, or it REINSTALLS the driver for it. Like I said I worked on the PROBLEM for 10 hours yesterday, and I have LOTS of experience with computers and MANUAL trouble shooting and fixing literally THOUSANDS of problems
 (hardware and software) over the last 30+ years.<br />
<br />
There is <strong>NO WAY</strong> to UNINSTALL the driver for the Touchpad and <strong>
NO WAY</strong> to DEACTIVATE IT, since Windows OR ASUS always reinstalls and reactivates the Touchpad every time??<br />
<br />
I have also tried ADJUSTING the Touchpad.&nbsp; In the ASUS driver for Windows 8.1 you could adjust it or turn it off but you
<strong>CANNOT</strong> do anything like that in their new driver, called <strong>
Smart Gestures</strong>.&nbsp;There are some adjustment in that driver but nothing worked! I tried changing the DELAY to LONG DELAY and that helped a little. IT said that if I was having, "a problem when TYPING to adjust it to LONG DELAY", which I did.<span>&nbsp;
</span>But as I said it only helped A LITTLE!&nbsp; IT STILL JUMPS around, all over the place.&nbsp; It is so SENSITIVE that even holding my hands UP OFF of the top of the laptop, and only touching the keys, the problem continues.&nbsp;Touching keys even CLOSE to the Touchpad
 acts like I touched the Touchpad!!&nbsp; The keyboard is to SOFT and flexes too much in the middle.</span></p>

            <p>None of the responses here helped. I even went to ASUS and they did not help. They had lots of ideas but none worked. Eventually I remembered, MAYBE I can change it in the BIOS? That is what I did. There was an entry titled, INTERNAL POINTING DEVICE.&nbsp; I
 DEACTIVATED it and then the Touchpad STOPPED working, that is what I wanted. I never use the touchpad and Windows 10 drivers DID NOT work as good as the Windows 8.1 drivers worked. With the 8.1 drivers I COULD ADJUST the sensitivity or I could turn it off.
 With the Windows 10 driver I could do some other things, but I could not adjust it or turn it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Funny I see that MOST people have the problem that the Touchpad does NOT work, I had the opposite problem IT WORKED but I could not even touch the top of the keyboard or even KEYS near the touchpad but then the cursor jumped around like a monkey!</p>
<p>
</p><p>SOOooo, at this point I AM still using Windows 10, but I do have some other issues. I hated Windows 8.0 but LOVED Windows 8.1, I still might go back to it?</p>

            I followed his advice and I'm still having this problem. &nbsp;I don't know what to do now. &nbsp;My Asus is barely a year old. &nbsp;I can hardly get through a sentence without the curser jumping around. &nbsp;It's ridiculous.

            <p>You're a lifesaver OldFox1947. &nbsp;This has been driving me insane since I was bullied into upgrading to Windows 10 a couple of months ago - victim of the hitting the x in the Windows 10 upgrade pop-up thinking I was saying 'go away' but was in fact saying
 'go ahead'. &nbsp;I HATE being bullied....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I have followed your advice I can type without having to triple check where the cursor is/has been and constantly correct.</p>

            Having the exact same problem. Roll back didn't work and uninstalling didn't work. 2 finger touch makes it worse and totally unpredictable as to where the cursor will go AND what it will open.&nbsp;
