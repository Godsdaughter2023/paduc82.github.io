    <title>Printing envelopes via Mail Merge - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Printing envelopes via Mail Merge</h2>
                    <p>I've set up custom envelope size 155mm x 155mm for my cards.&nbsp; The data from my spreadsheet imports fine and I appear to have 54 square envelopes ready to print, with an 'If undelivered..' line at the very top.&nbsp; When I try to print one as a test
 the first line just about comes out at the bottom of the envelope.</p>
<p>I've checked File/Page Setup and that shows a size of 155 x 155.&nbsp; I've checked Format/Document and that looks OK too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using an HP Deskjet 3050A and this worked this time last year.</p>

<p>Hi Rena,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spent most of the day on this without any joy so I've given up.&nbsp; I've used labels instead of printing directly to envelopes.</p>
<p>Maybe you could propose a change of policy to your colleagues by suggesting they make Mail Merge easier every year rather than more difficult!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying to help</p>
<p>Steve</p>

                    Hi

</div>
<div>I have a bell.net account and a hotmail account. I cannot seem to figure out how to switch between the two accounts without not having to sign out of one and sign in to the other. It's a nuisance. I log in under the loop. How can I have both accounts open
 and just switch between the too on my tool bar.</div>

<h2>            Downloaded Font Won&#39;t Show Up in Word 2016 Even Though It Downloaded Correctly</h2>
                    <p>I recently downloaded a font off the Internet and onto my computer for use in Word 2016 - specifically Helvetica Neue Condensed Bold - but whenever I go into Word Processor, it doesn't show up and documents I have that used the font in the past revert to
 Arial. In fact, all it did was replace some of the fonts on various Internet sites I visit with the downloaded font in question. The font is already located in the fonts folder, so the chances of that being the problem are minimal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do in order to use this font in Word? Any advice would be helpful.</p>

            Hello Greg,<br />
<br />
As per the description of the issue, you are unable to use the font that you have downloaded. For you to use the font that you have downloaded, you'll need to install into your operating system for you to use it. Here's an
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Download-and-install-custom-fonts-to-use-with-Office-0EE09E74-EDC1-480C-81C2-5CF9537C70CE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> that you can refer to. In here, you'll see a simple guide on how to install fonts to your operating system.<br />
<br />
Hope this information is helpful.

Standards compliance doesn't equate to compatibility. Also take note that the bluetooth standards define several "profiles" for things such as audio streaming, dial-up networking, human interface devices, so on. Windows Phone 7 supports the headset bluetooth
 profile. I've not checked what profiles that OS X supports but chances are there's no overlap in the profiles it supports. If this is the case then there's not really any interaction the phone and your computer have so stating they are not "compatible" would
 make sense if this is the case.&nbsp;

</p><p>Whenever I receive an incoming call to my Skype account, whether it's video, audio, or to my Skype number, it will automatically reject the call.&nbsp; I cannot find a setting that is making this happen, I have everything set up to accept incoming calls.&nbsp; I can
 make outgoing calls without any problems, it's only incoming calls that I cannot receive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also do not receive any notifications that I "missed" a call unless they end up leaving a voice message.&nbsp; I am getting pretty frustrated with this, as it's been doing this for a few months now.</p>

<h2>            New Contacts&#58; arbitrary birthday and anniversary of 1&#47;1&#47;1601 automatically added</h2>
                    <p>Hello, <br />
<br />
When I add a new contact, after a few moments the contact info is automatically updated with an arbitrary birthday and anniversary of 1/1/1601.&nbsp; I am unable to delete the birthday and anniversary from Outlook People (Preview).&nbsp; This also causes an issue viewing
 the contact from Outlook 2013.&nbsp; If the birthday and anniversary of 1/1/1601 is present, the People Pane view of Outlook 2013 does not show the contact info.&nbsp; The view must be changed to List View, then open the contact , click on Details and delete the birthday
 and anniversary.&nbsp; Once done, the contact then shows correctly in the People Pane view of Outlook 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;birthday and anniversary of 1/1/1601&nbsp;is automatically added if the contact is created from Outlook People (Preview) and from Outlook 2013.&nbsp; Even with Outlook 2013 closed out, the birthday and anniversary is still added when the new contact is created
 from Outlook People (Preview).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dustin </p>

            <p>1.) I have an iPhone synced to this account.&nbsp; However, I've tested this with the iPhone powered off and the birthday and anniversary are still inserted.&nbsp; The only common denominator so far is Outlook People (Preview).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Are you using&nbsp;the built-in mail app or Outlook.com app for&nbsp;IPhone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I would suggest you to remove the account from the app,&nbsp;create a test contact and check if you still face the issue.

<h2>            Outlook for IOS app, not showing email content on SMIME signed emails.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Multiple users who are using the Outlook for IOS app can´t see the content of all emails that are digitally signed with SMIME.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All it shows is an attachment of the public SMIME cert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have announced that you will very shortly have support for sending digitally signed emails using the Outlook for IOS app with SMIME certs this should be a real issue for you and all of us users who are a bit more concerned and spend money on certificates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix this issue, since your app is the only good app to use with Office365 Outlook on mobile devices. Currently we have to force all our users to use the buil-in email app and calendar app..</p>

<p>Hi Jesper Eklöv,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. After reading your reply, I did more research and found that our team released support for S/MIME for iOS in Office Insider via TestFight (version 3.30.0 and later) last week.&nbsp;To use S/MIME with Outlook for iOS, the user’s mailbox
 must be in Exchange Online. Moreover, S/MIME support in Outlook for iOS and Android will begin rolling out for general availability later this summer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more details, please see:&nbsp;<a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Intune-Customer-Success/S-MIME-functionality-available-in-Outlook-for-iOS-TestFlight/ba-p/734885" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">S/MIME functionality available in Outlook for
 iOS TestFlight</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope above information helps. If you have any other concerns or questions, as mentioned in above article, we recommend you to open a in-app support ticket in the
<strong>Menu </strong>&gt; tap the <strong>?</strong> &gt; <strong>Contact Support</strong> in Outlook for iOS APP to get further suggestions and assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We sincerely appreciate for your understanding and cooperation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Jennifer</p>

<h3> tana-cst  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot open or print multiple documents in Word</h2>
                    <p>I need to be able open or print multiple documents at one time in Word 2010 on a Windows 7 PC.<span>
</span>When I right-click on a document in the Open dialog box, the context menu comes up but I get the error “The command cannot be performed because a dialog box is open.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Click OK, and then close open dialog boxes to continue.”<span>&nbsp; </span>I previously had this version installed on an XP computer. It had the same problem but I could get around it by selecting “Print” from the Tools menu.<span>&nbsp; They would then print
 out of order but they printed.&nbsp; </span>That option is no longer available in Windows 7. The only option from the tools menu is "Map Network Drive".&nbsp; I can print from outside Word but doing so is slow and tedious as it opens and closes every document and starts
 giving me problems if I try to print more than five at a time.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I know others have had similar problems but none of the solutions I've found have helped.&nbsp; I don’t have Norton (or any antivirus software) installed. (It’s a new PC and I’m trying to get everything working before I install antivirus software.) There are
 no add-ins in startup. I’ve also tried running as an Administrator, running in safe mode, repairing Word, and when that didn’t work uninstalling and reinstalling.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I even consulted with a Microsoft tech, who couldn’t help and told me I'd have to pay for premium support (I can't afford it and my boss will never agree to cover it.).<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is only happening in Word. Excel works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m just frustrated enough to consider "downgrading" back to Office 2000.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This is only one of several issues I have with 2010 but it’s the most frustrating and time-consuming of the bunch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had this problem and found a fix?</p>

                    <p>
</p><p>I've recently started using OneNote 2010 to edit notebook files on my OneDrive. &nbsp;I've set this up properly on two of my laptops, but the 3rd laptop doesn't see or sync the OneDrive notebooks I have. &nbsp;Unlike other two Win7 laptops, this last Win7 laptop shows
 some linkage to the old Windows Live Skydrive. &nbsp;I'm guessing that's the problem. &nbsp;How can setup this OneNote 2010 to look and sync with notebooks on my OneDrive? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching the web for an answer, I found references to removing Windows Live Essentials which I've done already. &nbsp;That didn't help. &nbsp;Please advise. &nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            <p>So far no success using suggestions from article above. &nbsp;I've noticed that installation of OneDrive app on this laptop also does not work properly. &nbsp;The local Onedrive directory is created but it does not sync or show the file, pix, and OneNote files that
 are stored there. &nbsp;I wonder if there is some sort of firewall issue or Windows Live Essential settings that are preventing both OneNote and OneDrive apps from properly synchronizing as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll fiddle with it some more tomorrow ...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question here in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear that your files and emails are missing. We're here to help you on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven’t access your account for long period of time, you may have lost them due to inactivity. Once an account becomes inactive, all the emails and folders will be deleted. There will be no option to recover these. Incoming emails will be sent back
 to sender undeliverable. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Another possibility would be, your account was hacked and they had deleted your emails. You may try retrieving your lost emails by following the steps provided by&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/083c9ada-567f-4b1e-ba21-8a0585616bee" title="ZigZag3143 (MS - MVP)">ZigZag3143
 (MS - MVP)</a>. Note that emails will not be recovered via recovery link if they were deleted from email clients like Windows Live Mail, MS Outlook, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is not the case, then we need to review your account. For us to do that, please submit a private support request through the article provided above. Just click contact customer support link found at the bottom of the page. In this way, we can assist

            Hello
<br />A pleasure to help you.
<br />
<br />
<br />The only way to achieve this is to create an inbox rule, but this rule should be programmed every 10 days of the interval you select.
<br />Anyway, I share how to do it.
<br />Log into <a href="http://outlook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://outlook.com</a>.
<br />
<br />Towards the top right hand corner, choose the gear icon.
<br />
<br />Select Manage rules.
<br />
<br />Select the option 'New.'
<br />
<br />Under 'When e-mail matches' drop down menu, choose 'Older than.'
<br />
<br />Besides that, select the days.
<br />
<br />Under 'Do the following', select Delete.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope it will be very helpful.
<br />Let me know.
<br />
<br />Greetings Dayamis

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>KB2267602 is the Windows Defender (WD) definitions update but the definitions nomenclature may change several times per day.&nbsp; Since that specific update&nbsp;appeared in your Windows Update cache there have been other definitions released and if they're already
 installed on your version of WD, there is no need to install the failed update since 1.193.3192 is the more recent update and "supersedes" the failed update. &nbsp;Delete it, hide it, ignore it, whatever you need to do.</p>

Hi, my lumia 920 (RM-821_APAC_Indonesia_311 with WP10 TP OS Version 10586.36) stuck in airplane mode too after update to 10586.11. I tried many suggestions to fix &nbsp;my phone (soft reset, hard reset, downgrading, flashing with or without sim card, flashing with
 other RM-821 variants) but still stuck in airplane mode. Last night, I tried to emptying the battery and let it empty for a couple of hours. This morning, I charging my phone and I can use my sim card but with unstable signal (airplane mode turn off by default).
 but happened in my phone for less than 1 hour, my phone restart by it self dan back to stuck in airplane mode. I hope emptying the battery first can be a solution to fix the problem other lumia 920 or other lumia type. Maybe there are other solution to fix
 this airplane mode problem in this forum. thank you, and sorry for my bad English.

Hi, my lumia 920 (RM-821_APAC_Indonesia_311 with WP10 TP OS Version 10586.36) stuck in airplane mode too after update to 10586.11. I tried many suggestions to fix &nbsp;my phone (soft reset, hard reset, downgrading, flashing with or without sim card, flashing with
 other RM-821 variants) but still stuck in airplane mode. Last night, I tried to emptying the battery and let it empty for a couple of hours. This morning, I charging my phone and I can use my sim card but with unstable signal (airplane mode turn off by default).
 but happened in my phone for less than 1 hour, my phone restart by it self dan back to stuck in airplane mode. I hope emptying the battery first can be a solution to fix the problem other lumia 920 or other lumia type.
<strong>Maybe there are other solution to fix this airplane mode problem in this forum.
</strong>thank you, and sorry for my bad English. </blockquote>

<p>I am so sorry Antoneth.&nbsp; I thought I had replied to your answer, but it appears I didn't. Really, so sorry.</p>
<p>I intended to let you know that I do not have Windows 10 installed in my PC anymore. I just had too many problems with it, si I had Windows 7 reinstalled.&nbsp; And I do not use Internet Explorer as my browser, I use Google.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I very much appreciate you trying to help though. And, I don't know what happened, maybe I reset some of my preferences in Google just the right way, as everything is back to normal now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I realize it's been a month since your reply, but I did not want to leave you feeling that you tried to help, but I was just plain rude and never gave you any feedback!&nbsp; I know it would bug me!</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

<p>I understand what you are saying.&nbsp; I am just stuck on 10 and 11.&nbsp; How am I supposed to give you an indication that I have worked on it.&nbsp; I'm not some stupid 18-year-old, I'm an adult.&nbsp; It DOES tell me what to do, but when I 'run' it, its not working, so
 I thought I would ask for help.&nbsp; I don't need anymore of your snotty comments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand your frustration&nbsp;but I do think you should not have posted the bit about "snotty comments" as this is a tight-knit bunch and John is a well respected member of this forum.&nbsp; What he states is quite accurate and we here, as do most forums, frown
 on people posting what is perceived as being an attempt to get people to do their homework for them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me point you to a post where I answered someone's homework problem for them and I posted the reason why I did so that others who have a similar need can follow the way they did it.</p>
<p><a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/accessdev/thread/68ce6770-034e-4312-b018-2c34d5b80f72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/accessdev/thread/68ce6770-034e-4312-b018-2c34d5b80f72</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What John was getting at was that you need to ask specific questions about what problem you are having, not posting the questions you were asked in your homework.&nbsp; Post what you have tried, where you currently are, and then specific questions about your
 problem.</p>

<p>I am taking a basic computer class that provided me with a free trial of Office 2010.&nbsp; My copy quit working, and my school basically told me that I'm on my own.&nbsp; I've been using Office 2007 and its costing me points, and when I do the online tutorials for
 2010, then try to do it in 2007, its just different enough that I'm spending more time that I should be on this class.&nbsp; I guess what I'm trying to say is that this is what made me snap an ugly reply to you.&nbsp; I apologize too.</p>

            <p>I'm guessing you put this in the CRITERIA row of the grid? That's the problem if so!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open the query grid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the very top row - the Field row - find a vacant cell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Type</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MatchingDonation: [Amount] * .25</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The text to the left of the colon will be the new fieldname (it's best not to include blanks in fieldnames, though you may be able to get away with it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In question 11 note that you usually cannot use a calculated field in a further calculation - recapitulate the expression instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note also that new Access users for some reason REALLY overuse the LIKE operator: LIKE is used
<em>only</em> in criteria, and <em>only</em> when you want to use wildcards for partial matches. For instance, a criterion of</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LIKE "Jo*"&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>will find Johansen, Jones, Joseki and other names starting with Jo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LIKE "*se"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>will find Jesse, Milanese, and other names ending with se. If you're not using wildcards there's no benefit to using the LIKE operator!</p>

<h2>            Linked Images from Excel don&#39;t work in Outlook MSG since last update</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually use default emails created by me to reuse them. I save an outlook email like a MSG file (*.msg). This email have HTML format (text with bold and italian format, colors,...) and linked images from Excel cells. The intention is to open the MSG file
 every day, update the linked image (right click button and click "Update" option or similar) and send the email. I am using this way since lots of months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, some weeks ago my PC received some updates for Office and every MSG file that I was using now don't work. If I try this exactly MSG file in another PC, it works, but when this another PC receive the updates, the MSG file leave to work. So, the MSG
 file is fine, but when I open it, Outlook convert content in plain text (originally, text is in HTML) and linked images disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I restore Office installation, the same MSG file that before didn't work, now works again (anothe proof that MSG file works properly), but after some days, updates come back and problems come back too. I was testing, reading, answering to IT supports,...
 but I didn't find the solution. IT supports told me that some people are having this problem with last updates, because it seems that an specific update corrupts any library or similar. We don't know what update is, or what library is corrupt, or if the problem
 is another different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I come to community to ask you because I have not solution and this is a very useful option to me because I can earn a lot of time. Could you help me with the solution? Or with any idea to look for the problem and the try to find the solution?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your time. Best regards.</p>
<p>

    <title>Can&#39;t sync my Outlook.com contacts with my Android phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markinthebox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t sync my Outlook.com contacts with my Android phone</h2>
                    This problem has been posted MANY times, and always results in Microsoft doing some secret "tweaking" of the affected Outlook.com account to get the problem resolved. &nbsp;Well, I'm also having the problem and my account needs the magic tweak.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem:</div>
<div>I'm using Android's (4.3) native Email app to access and sync my @outlook.com email, contacts, and calendar. &nbsp;When I first add my account to the Email app, most of my contacts are quickly brought down to my phone (not sure why there's a couple that never
 get synced, but I've got bigger problems right now). &nbsp;So far, so good. &nbsp;The problem is that after that initial sync, the contacts are never synced again - not automatically nor when I explicitly tell Android to sync the account. &nbsp;Specifically:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Changes made to a contact directly on the phone (using Android's native People app) are never synced back to the server</li><li>Changes made to a contact directly on Outlook.com via the web are never synced back to the phone</li><li>The addition or deletion of contacts also fails to get synced</li></ul>
The only way to get my contacts synced again is to delete my account on my phone and re-enter it. &nbsp;This is totally unusable.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please work your magic on my account so that 2-way sync will work like it should.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Where are my Word 2007 Backups&#63;&#63;&#63; Lost a day&#39;s worth of work.</h2>
                    I'm running Word 2007 on Windows 7 Home Edition.<br />
The file in question does have "Always Create backup copy" checked. I do save frequently as i work, without even thinking about it. I made a change, accepted the change, and realized after that the change wasn't such a good idea, but can't find the backup file.
 In fact, I can't find any backup files!! I searched for files with name "backup" and "wbk" and no luck. (This is a laptop I don't use that often. I know if I searched on my desktop Vista, I'd find tons of backup files.)
<br />
I really need to find the backup file since it represents a day's worth of work. On my desktop PC I have Vista but no such luck on my laptop.<br />
Please tell me how to find the back up, or the earlier version of the file.<br />
<br />
I looked in my Autorecover folder and recycle bin and it's not there. I haven't rebooted since this happened. Would using restore help?
<br />
<br />
And, less urgent question, what can I do to make this not happen in future? Why aren't backup files being created automatically like they are on my Vista PC?
<br />

            The backups are typically in the same directory as the file.<br />
<br />
You may also want to look into the backup 'versions' made by system recover. Right click on the file, select Properties, then "Previous Versions" tab.<br />

<p>I recently tried this tool (Office Regenerator). It claims to recover files from deleted file fragments. It seems to work. On my 100GB data partition it ran for about 1 hour and found 691 files, 450 MB, going back almost 7 months! I don’t
 remember if that was the last time I used a wipe freespace tool on my drive They definitely were not in my recycle bin.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Don’t do first auto run . The interface provides lots of Filter criteria such as: date created range, last saved range, last printed range, title, num pages, editing time, revision number, file type, author.

<p>All of the recovered files I looked at were properly structured.</p>

<p>I gave it a try and it looks like a really handy tool!</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;System Restore Explorer is a tool which allows you to browse system restore points on your computer and select individual ones for deletion should you wish to free up some disk space. It also allows you to mount the contents of
 a restore point into a folder so that you can browse and copy individual files, without the need to perform a full system restore.</p>
<p>When you select a restore point and “mount” it the tool will create a shortcut to that particular restore point in the root folder of the drive, which will allow you to browse the contents and copy files. &lt;/snip&gt;</p>

Here ae some links to macros that can be used to create a true autorecover feature. The macro can create SAVE AS copies of the file with date/timestamp added to the file name. Really good for those files you work on a lot and are REALLY important.<br />
<br />
<br />
<span><span>1<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b>True Autosave Macros for Office</b>
<p><span>Unfortunately, although Office apps have been around since the the mid 1980’s, MS has not figured out that we need a good “Autosave” backup feature. In the past there was a “versions”
 feature in some office apps, but it only kept incremental copies of files, not ful files. Windows 7 has a file “versions” feature, but it is tied into “System Recovery Points”. Not very useful.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The following links tell how to setup macros that run automatically and use SAVEAS to save full copies of the file with the date/time included in the file name. You have to manually delete the “extra” backup files, but you control the process rather
 than Windows or Office. It is a bit more work, but I find it worth it for very important files that are changing frequently.</span></p>

<p>In the last issue of WordTips there were a number of readers that got the idea that I was suggesting that people should use the FastSave feature. In fact, I got quite a bit of feedback on that tip, some of it
 quite pointed. (According to one reader, I was even “irresponsible.” Another stated that I was doing a disservice to readers.)</p>
<p>I am sorry if I gave the impression that I thought FastSave is a great idea. That is far from the truth; I do not. There are several other “features” of Word that I think are ill conceived or totally unnecessary,
 as well. It doesn’t change the fact that they are features and people can use them, if they desire. WordTips are not designed to promote one method of doing something over another, but to provide alternative ideas that people can incorporate into their Word
 use, if they so desire.</p>
<p>With that being said, let me point out specifically why you should
<b><i>not</i></b> use the FastSave feature.</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Other word processors may not be able to open Word documents saved with the FastSave feature enabled. For instance, WordPerfect says it can open Word documents, yet some versions of WordPerfect cannot open FastSaved Word documents.</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Third-party software designed to work with Word documents (such as some grammar checkers, document management programs, and desktop publishing software) will not work correctly with FastSaved Word documents.</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Find File (either in Word or in Windows) may not work correctly with FastSaved Word documents.</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>FastSave results in more complex files being saved on disk. Any time you increase complexity, you run the risk of corrupting the files easier.</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>FastSaved files take up more disk space.</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>There have been reports of macro viruses “living on” in FastSaved documents, even though you thought you had them removed.</p>
<p>The list could go on and on, but you get the idea. In short, unless you have a specific need to use FastSave (such as if you are only creating simple documents using Word 6 on a slow 286 machine), it is probably
 a good idea to turn it off. The FastSave feature is turned on by default in all versions of Word, even in the original Word 97. Only if you are using Word 97 SR-1 is it turned off by default.</p>
<p>As a side note, according to the Microsoft Knowledge Base there are several circumstances under which a FastSave is not done by Word, even if you have enabled the feature. These circumstances include the following:</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When you save a document for the first time. (This makes sense, right?) This includes when you choose Save As to save under a new name or in a new location.</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When your document is saved on a network server or remote volume. (Word only performs a FastSave to a local volume.)</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When Word reaches the limit of how much information it can save using the FastSave option. In this case Word does a normal save, and then again starts using FastSave for future saves.</p>
<p>Nuff said? (I hate it when I’m irresponsible.)</p>

            The backup files are ALWAYS created in the same folder as the original document. There is no mechanism to allow them to be saved elsewhere. If the flag is checked in Word's options to always create a backup copy and that copy is not being created, it is
 possible that the word data key in the registry where these options settings are stored is corrupt or not being updated through reasons of Windows security.<br />
<br />
You could try creating a document and saving it a couple of times, checking for the presence of the backup in the same folder that you saved the document. If that bacdkup is not present, try starting Word as Administrator, turn off the option to save a backup,
 then turn it back on, to rewrite the registry value. Then test again. If that doesn't fix it, delete the registry key - HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\12.0\Word\Data - with Word closed, then restart Word which will cause a new default key to be
 created. Reset the option to create a backup and see if it works now.<br />
<br />
As always check for orphan temporary files which can cause all sorts of grief - <a href="http://www.gmayor.com/what_to_do_when_word_crashes.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.gmayor.com/what_to_do_when_word_crashes.htm </a><br />
<br />
The backup is only created if you click Save. It does not create a backup if you SaveAs an existing filename and elect to overwrite at the prompt. The chances of recovering that original document are minimal. Forensic data recdovery may be able to rescure some
 of it, but I wouldn't hold my breath.<br />
<br />
Once you close the document the undo stack is wiped from that document.<br />

                    I have several hyperlinks to archived web pages (.mht). No problem there. But I want them to open automatically full screen (maximized). But they never do. Don't want to 'maximize' or click 'new page'. Just click the hyperlink and see full screen. Using
 win8 and IE10.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are other 'full screen' options but they seem to apply only to the page displayed at the moment. Alt X Files/Full screen seems to persist for all IE10 instances until de-selected.</p>

            The first thing is that the zoom factor is 53%. Use the slider in the lower right corner to set it closer to 100%, or click the box that shows "53%" and choose the percentage you want.<br />
<br />
The other part is that you have the "white space between pages" hidden, which will also hide any headers or footers you create. You can change this by putting the cursor at the top of the page, just below the ruler, and when the cursor becomes a pair of white
 blocks, double-click. Alternatively, go to Office button &gt; Word Options &gt; Display and check the box for "Show white space between pages in Print Layout view".<br />

<h3> zubair chowdhury  say:</h3>
<h2>            Macro to print specific sheets in workbook</h2>
                    <p>I have an Excel workbook with many worksheets. One of the worksheets is called "INDEX". On the "INDEX" worksheet, these are some menu names in column C and against each menu names, there is either "YES" or "NO" in column F (see table below). Each
 menu has a corresponding worksheet with the recipe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a macro that will print all the recipe worksheets that are specified as "YES".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:</p>
<table>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
MENU</td>
<td>Available Today</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
CHICKEN BIRYANI</td>
<td>
YES</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
VEG BIRYANI</td>
<td>
NO</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
STEAMED RICE</td>
<td>
YES</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
FRIED RICE</td>
<td>
YES</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
CHICKEN KABSA</td>
<td>
NO</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>

<p>You should either rename the sheets to the menu names (CHICKEN BIRYANI etc.), or create an extra column that lists the sheet names corresponding to the menus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you rename the sheets, you can use the code as posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you list&nbsp;the sheet names&nbsp;in another column, you only have to change the line</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a(n) = .Range("C" &amp; r).Value</p>

<p>
</p><p>if H is the column with the sheet names.</p>

<h2>            lumia 640 lte sd card failure following W 10 update</h2>
                    Recent W 10 update disabled (Sandisk) SD card working fine before update. Formatted reinstalled+ "nothing". Replaced with new card, a bit better and the card recognised + "nothing". Another new card same problem. Microsoft Support said phone now out of
 warranty, but caused by W 10 update and should not be chargeable cost, use b2x.com. Support.b2x.com is not accessible unless you pay £8.92 and advice was "software not up to date" and "that was the problem" (ref 1411226767). I said if not "the problem" I did
 not want to pay twice. Polite brush off here and "to contact Support to resolve". Needless to say Update did not solve problem. See later, but I think initial W 10&nbsp; Update disabled both SD card PLUS phone card reader software. Because old and new card(s),
 both not readable despite pre format. Remembering&nbsp; Hard Reset from Symbian days, not that keen on the "nuclear option". However, backed up everything to OneDrive, Reset and reinstalled the W10 software (not W 8.1 the goods
