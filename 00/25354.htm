    <title>Windows Defender did not detect PUP.Optional.BrowseSmart.A - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> surreyuser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender did not detect PUP.Optional.BrowseSmart.A</h2>
                    <p>While installing a friend's laptop I inadvertently infected it with the PUP.Optional.BrowseSmart.A malware virus. He asked me to install adobe reader and I accidentally clicked on the first entry from google. I knew I had done something bad as the popups
 that followed were of body-builders flexing their muscles.</p>
<p>I run the fully updated scan of windows defender but it found nothing. I run malwarebytes and it identified the virus and removed it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is why didn't defender protect me, or detect the virus? And&nbsp;is there a better combination Windows Defender and Malwarebytes) or an alternate virus checker that would have averted this infection?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3> jessica494  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t work out why my COUNTIFS function won&#39;t work&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a very frustrating problem! I have a spreadsheet for each of my 26 different teams and all of them use the exact same formulas etc, I went to add a new line in to count the number of rescue dogs they are seeing each month and literally just copied
 and pasted the formula which worked perfectly for 24 but won't seem to work for the other 2. I have checked each name, I have tried deleting, re-adding and re-naming the column I am working on and cannot seem to find the problem!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The formula I'm using is&nbsp;=COUNTIFS(InductionDate,"&gt;="&amp;DATE(2018,1,1),InductionDate,"&lt;="&amp;DATE(2018,1,31),RescueDog,"yes") this works for all my other columns and it seems to be the "RescueDog" bit that it's having a problem with and showing a #VALUE! error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or ideas would be really appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

                    I have an unlocked samsung omnia.<br />
<br />
I just installed windows marketplace and everything works and runs smoothly.<br />
<br />
What I would like to know is if there is away to specify where windows marketplace installs the applications?<br />
<br />
The omnia separates it's storage into 2 sections .5 gig where windows mobile is installed and 15.5gig of 'my storage' separate.<br />
<br />
The marketplace is installing on the main directory and I won't be able to install many apps before it is full.<br />
<br />
Thank you!

There's no marketplace supported way to do this.&nbsp; There's <a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/marketplacewindowsmobile/thread/099335d5-9fde-4537-9148-626763617c07" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Adding text to multiple files in same folder</h2>
                    I have 50 or so Risk Assessments that have been created in Excel 2003 in a folder and numbered consecutively. All contain the same text and I now need to add two lines of text to each of the 50. Is there a way of copying and pasting to multiple files at
 the same time? Regards, Tony

<p>Hi&nbsp;LemAllen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I would like to confirm how you downloaded and installed Office application on your Mac.</p>
<p>Here is an article for installing for your reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/download-and-install-or-reinstall-office-365-or-office-2016-on-a-pc-or-mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US#InstallSteps=Install_on_a_Mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download
 and install or reinstall Office 365 or Office 2016 on a PC or Mac.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can see that Office Home and Student comes with a product key, before you install Office for the first time, you need to sign in with an existing or new
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/why-you-need-a-microsoft-account-with-an-office-for-home-product-d1b81992-d824-4e3f-8351-e2c03172df62" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft account</a> and enter your product key at <a href="https://office.com/setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
office.com/setup</a>. Redeeming your key is what links your account with Office so you only have to do this once. Please check if you have already done this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have already done this and cannot install Office in www.office.com, could you please capture some screenshots to clarify so that I can provide further help for you?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Gloria</p>

<p>Hi Pennymc48,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate the case, I am requesting for the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the exact version of Skype that's installed on your device? </li><li>Are you trying to place a call or send a message to your daughter through Skype?
</li><li>Is the issue specific when you are trying to reach her is it also happening when you're trying to contact other contacts?</li><li>Is it possible that she accidentally blocked you? Kindly advise her to check her blocked contacts list to confirm.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your response.</p>
<p>

<p>I have a similar problem Jomel. I have a live, in credit, Skype account but when I try to contact anyone on my contacts list there is no response and the call is immediately terminated after a couple of seconds without making contact with the third party.
 I can use Skype ok o n my I pad but I need to be able to use it on my laptop (windows 10)</p>
<p>Skype version is:- 12.10.572.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you advise please</p>

            Dear William,
<br />
<br />I am an independent advisor, and I am trying to help other users in Community with my experience in Microsoft products.
<br />
<br />You have posted in Outlook.com forum, so I assume you are using it in browser.
<br />
<br />All folders and subfolders that you are creating are sorted alphabetically by default. They will be sorted accordingly in the main folder that they were created.
<br />
<br />Is it happening otherwise in your situation ? Please provide more information.       
        </p>

            Are you using Outlook on the web? They should sort alphabetically in the Folders section -- after the default folders, which can't be rearranged (in the red box in the screenshot). The Favorites section can be arranged in any order. 
<br />
<br />Outlook installed on the desktop has a command to sort A- Z.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f401a44c-8614-40c3-b61f-921f581bdb45?upload=true" />

    <title>ActiveSync problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robrem  say:</h3>
<h2>            ActiveSync problem</h2>
                    <br />
&nbsp;A friend has a Palm Treo 700. He has lost the ability to sync his Palm with his laptop (Dell Inspiron 6000).<br />
&nbsp;When the phone is connected to the computer, the Activesync program recognizes the phone is plugged in, and tries to establish a connection, but can't. The process stops, then&nbsp; a troubleshooter opens, and ActiveSync scans for problems. The only one it finds
 is there is no connection between the phone and the computer. <br />
&nbsp;I have removed all firewalls, upgraded from ActiveSync 4.2 to 4.5, uninstalled, and reinstalled ActiveSync (with restarts), and erased the partnerships that exist between the phone and the computer. I have tried installing the software on another computer,
 and the same problem presents itself. <br />
&nbsp;I think the problem is with the device, not the wire. My friend has a tendency of pulling the battery out of the device to turn it on and off. When the device is turned on, there is an error message that appears stating there is a problem with services.exe.
 It gets no more specific than that. <br />
&nbsp;Is there any way of reinstalling software on the device without losing all my personalized settings?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
&nbsp;Rob<br />

            It seems like some files got corrupted. A hard reset should fix that. You will lose your settings and data too. I assume you have a backup of your data?

<p>There is a device reset sapplication you might want to use to perform the hard reset.&nbsp; Now you may ask how do you install it if you can't sync ... not to worry.&nbsp; Download the file, extract&nbsp;it and copy it over to the device SD card.&nbsp; I believe you can run
 it from there or you can just move to the My Documents folder and run it as instructed.&nbsp; The following is from Palm:</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The Device Reset application performs an erase on all the information that has been added to your Treo 700w/wx or 750 smartphone. This functions as much more than a hard reset by formatting the user storage on your smartphone and erasing all third-party
 applications, personal info, and settings. The Device Reset application should be used to ensure that your data has been deleted from the device:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Prior to exchanging the device for a replacement. </li><li>Prior to sending it in for a repair. </li><li>Prior to transfer to another party. </li><li>If you simply want to clean out your smartphone <br />
so that someone else in your family can use it. </li></ul>
<p>You can get it here:</p>

<h2>            AMD APU &#38; GPU temperatures extremely high with Build 10122</h2>
                    <p>I've started this post to try and find out what the average temperatures of AMD APU's and AMD GPU's are within the insider community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for myself, I have been closely monitoring the temp's of my laptops with every build since January. Until I installed build 10122 I really had no reason to be concerned.
</p>
<p>Knowing that these are "evaluation" release builds I have taken into consideration that the driver sets provided by Microsoft as well as AMD are "works in progress" and are constantly being modified and/or re-engineered on a daily basis.</p>
<p>The average temp's that I have encountered since build 9826 and up to 10074 have maintained themselves between 130 deg F up to 170 deg F respectively.</p>
<p>Since I have installed build 10122 my average temp's have increased dramatically, now my average temp's range from 175&nbsp;deg F up to 198 deg F respectively.</p>
<p>These averages are based on default settings with NO overclocking or tweaking of any kind and in fact the latest figures are noted while the computer is pretty much running at idle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My goal is simply to compare my systems with similar units within the community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The specifications for my laptop are:</p>

</p><p>And these are my current temperature readings:</p>

</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 Technical Preview is much appreciated.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since Windows 10 Technical Preview is still in development stage (testing environment), certain features might not work in the usual manner. Hence you may face some issue with Windows 10.We are looking forward
 to improve it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>High temperature or Overheating may be caused due to bad cooling design, severely multi-tasking the PC makes the CPU operate at high capacity and this generates a huge amount of heat in the process.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the below methods and check if that helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><strong><span>Get
 the latest hardware drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to update the latest Chipset drivers from the manufacturer and check if it helps. Install the latest drivers for any newly installed hardware device from the manufacturer‚Äôs website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Sometimes faulty RAM (Random-Access Memory) can cause intermittent problems within Windows. Use the Windows Memory Diagnostics Tool. Follow these steps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>On the Start screen, type <strong>
memory</strong>. Click <strong>Settings</strong> and then click the result <strong>
diagnose your computer's memory problems</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select the option to run the tool.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span> Check in Safe Mode:</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the below Article on Safe Mode:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Applies to Windows 10 as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 4:</span></strong><span> Perform the Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><span>Try to set your computer in clean boot state and check for the issue. Setting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying any third party applications or
 startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>
<p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start
 as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the below blog on the latest build for PC‚Äôs:</span></p>

            <p>I also have had heating issues requiring me to turn off any overclocking as it would cause instability and lock ups.&nbsp; Primarily the GPU (AMD r9 270x Vapor-X) will not be able to handle the same tasks that on Windows 8.1 would run cooler by almost a full
 ten degrees C.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Primarily I notice this when playing games, and to even get them to run without constant driver crashes or total lock ups all settings had to be dropped from ultra/high to low/med at best with a reduced windowed screen output.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also isn't just something with this current build of Windows 10, as I have encountered this with at least four other builds which forced me to roll back to 8.1 as I was unable to work on 3d applications for app/game development.&nbsp; I have noticed from
 the posts it seems to be a bigger issue with the AMD cards; however none of the suggested methods yield results, as I can roll back to 8.1 and my GPU load stays less than 95% and never above 62 C.&nbsp; Whereas even under minimal load it easily will top 70~75 C
 with Win 10.</p>

<h2>            Trying to import contacts form Windows Phone, but Windows Live -account is corrupted&#58; WP gives sync error 85010014 and Live-singin &#34;Sorry, there was a problem&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>my Windows Phone can't sync and backup to my Windows account (gives error code 85010014), and I can't login to my Hotmail-account (hotmail.com -signin gives error "Something went wrong"-error on page https://outlook.live.com/owa/&nbsp; )
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to import my contacts from my good old Nokia 1020 to new Android phone (Sony Xperia Compact Z5) , but cant get to my contact list from my Windows account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that by factory reseting the phone I could login to another Windows-account, but doesn't that also erase all my contacts?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way to get the contacts from my phone? </p>

            <p>Btw, I can login with that same username/email + password to Onedrive (onedrive.live.com) and sync photos from my phone there. So the "outlook.live.com" (wich seems to be also part of people.live.com) where the contacts are saved/synced seems to be the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also from there the "account.microsoft.com/" works, but as I open there "Looking for Microsoft email? Show Inbox-folder", which takes to outlook.com again the same error message. I can see my phone from there, and where it was located last etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when I login to Office365 -services (also Outlook.com) with my business-account (same username/email, different password), those work fine. But my personal accounts contacts are not there, ofcourse. (the phone is synced to the personal account).</p>

    <title>Automatic response or Bounceback for a Domain Alias - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Automatic response or Bounceback for a Domain Alias</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Office365 Team,</p>
<p>I have a client with a number of domains attached to their Office365. They wish to retire one of the domains but would like to set an automatic response for a period of time to alert their clients of the change before removing it altogether.</p>
<p>For example: Let's say the main domain is 'businessname.com' and all the staff have aliases configured with the domain 'retired.com'. Is it possible to set up some kind of automated response for all mail sent to the domain 'retired.com' and none of the other
 domain aliases?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there also any way to determine the amount of mail still sent to this domain?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Steven</p>

<p>hi steven,<br />
<br />
i understand that you want to set up an automatic response to the senders who send emails to the email addresses with domain ‚Äòretired.com‚Äô. based on my research and test, there are no direct automatically reply options to do this.
<br />
however, if you can accept, as a workaround, you can set up a transport rule to reject the emails sent to the email addresses with domain ‚Äòretired.com‚Äô and put a notice in the reject email that the senders would send emails to the email addresses with domain
 ‚Äòbusinessname.com‚Äô domain. please note that it requires an admin account of your office 365 tenant to do this. if you are not an admin, please involve an admin to help. here are the detailed steps to do this:<br />
1. login to the office 365 eac (<a href="https://outlook.office365.com/ecp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">exchange admin center</a>) with an admin account.<br />
2. mail flow-&gt;rules, create a new rule.<br />
3. click more options and set the rule as the screenshot below:<br />
<a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=0e8bffda-c8b4-4d4f-a763-743aa194ec73" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d0e8bffda-c8b4-4d4f-a763-743aa194ec73" /></a><br />
note: you will need to type the ‚Äòretired.com‚Äô domain into the ‚Äòto‚Äô header includes field.
<br />
after that, if an external sender send an email to the email address containing ‚Äòretired.com‚Äô, the sender will get a rejected email with the explanation.<br />
<br />
regards,<br />

            Unless your computer is otherwise infected with malicious browser add-ons, you cannot get a virus or malware from the use of the Bing Image Preview feature or clicking through to view the image in its own web page. Malicious redirection add-ons like
<i>Conduit</i>&nbsp;are one example of an add-on that can be potentially harmful but that problem resides in your browser, not the Bing Image Preview feature.

<div>Visiting the site where the image originated from and clicking on anything is another matter.</div>

    <title>Cannot Install on a Blank Hard Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sturalke  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Install on a Blank Hard Drive</h2>
                    <p>While attempting to install Windows 10 TP on an old Dell XPS 400 with a blank hard drive I have encountered this particular error five or six times in a row:</p>
<p><strong>Your PC needs to restart.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please hold down the power button.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Error Code: 0x0000005D</strong></p>
<p><strong>Parameters:</strong></p>
<p><strong>0x00000000BFEBFBFF</strong></p>
<p><strong>0x0000000020100800</strong></p>
<p><strong>0x0000000000000000</strong></p>
<p><strong>0x0000000000000001</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen this particular error code reported by other users as a problem with Virtual Box But this is a blank hard drive and therefore I cannot get any sort of access to dump files. Could this be something to do with the hardware in my system? If so I
 will have to go swap out a few of the parts with the pile of stuff me and a friend of mine have amassed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the full list of hardware components in this particular Dell:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intel Pentium D 2.80GHz</li><li>Stock Dell XPS 400 motherboard</li><li>Nvidia Geforce GT 600 video card</li><li>ASUS Xonar DG sound card</li><li>Nanya NT2GT64U8HD0BY-AD <span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">
2GB DDR2 SDRAM PC-6400 Memory (x4 so a total of 8GB)</span></li><li>Hitachi Deskstar HDT725025VLA380 250GB HD</li><li>Edimax EW-7128Gn 802.11n wireless card</li></ul>
<p>I have disconnected the stock CPU fan because of the noise level and replaced it with a Corsair SP-120 quiet edition connected to a molex powered fan controller. The ribbon cable for the VGA output on the GT 600 has been cut so I am using a DVI to VGA adapter
 for the Dell E156FP monitor. I used the program ISO to USB to format a Sandisk Cruizer 8GB and extract the x64 TP ISO. Also, the motherboard has the A07 BIOS revision.</p>

            How many gigs of ram are you using? That might be a factor, but then again I don't think so because you have twice as much ram as I&nbsp;do.&nbsp;I had the same problem as well with my computer. I would suggest that you create another partition first &nbsp;is what I
 did and name it Windows 10 TP. Make sure it's formatted NTFS. These are just my experiences. If USB fails...it's best you burn the image to a DVD...USB didn't work for me and the best tool to use is Windows 7 USB download tool if USB is your only alternative.
 Try that...my installation only took 14 min.

            when you go to install. Delete the partition and create a new one. This version of windows wants a GPT partition not a MBR. Try that and see how you go.

            <p>Can you confirm that the Pentium D supports NX PAE and SSE2 if it does not then there is no way that you can install Windows 8, 8.1 or 10 on that computer. Which version of Windows did the computer originally come with.<br />
</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>upon doing some more digging I came up with this link which will explain that this error code eludes to the things that I was discussing in the previous paragraph. It seems that you will be unable to install W10TP on that particular machine. I am confident
 that it would handle Windows 7 or Vista pretty well with the 8Gb of RAM of course you would need a 64x install in order to utilize all 8GB of RAM.</p>

            <p>It appears that the Pentium D supports these technologies:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Pentium_D_microprocessors</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was attempting to install the 64bit version and getting the error above almost immediately.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the 32bit&nbsp;version, installation is successful.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 on the Pentium D seems just as fast or faster than Windows 7.&nbsp; I can't verify if the limit to 4 GB's of RAM still holds, since this&nbsp;OLD box just has 4 GB's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note, I'm running Windows 10 on my primary development box and it's super sweet fast (64bit with 16 GB's RAM).&nbsp; I like the shadow on the windows.&nbsp; I don't have any other comment on the UI, other than I was already happy with Windows 8.1.</p>

            <p>Had the same problem as the OP -- but then, I used the Installer to create a partition -- and even then, the installer did not see the new partition.&nbsp;I had to migrate a copy of Win8.1 to the new drive, and only then, would the installer see the partition.&nbsp;
 And, BTW, the drive is partitioned MBR, not GPT.</p>

</p><p>I don't think this particular error has anything to do with hard drives or&nbsp;partitions.&nbsp; After installing Windows 10 (32bit) successfully, I attempted to install the 64bit version (clean install from a DVD).&nbsp; I immediately got the same error, just as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During the 32bit install I deleted the existing partition and had&nbsp;setup create a new one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Pentium D is one step above the original poster's Pentium D.&nbsp; These are 64bit processors which seem to support all the necessary technologies.&nbsp; I suspect that there is something in the 64bit installer that leverages some aspect of the necessary technologies,
 32bit/64bit related, that does not account for these older processors.</p>

            Yeah it is kind of strange that you can install in 32x but not 64x even though you have a 64x processor that supports those micro processes.<br />

    <title>IE security settings, medium or high, details of changes please - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sammysupper  say:</h3>
<h2>            IE security settings, medium or high, details of changes please</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, I have a query about the security settings in Internet Explorer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is probably going to take quite a bit of explaining, so please bare with me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I realize everyone's computer has different software on it, but hopefully, you'll be able to recreate yourself what I experience and maybe either be just as puzzled as I am, or maybe you'll know the answer... anyway, here goes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Internet Explorer Security tab settings, there are some pre-set values that I can opt for, or I can customise to my own settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My&nbsp;everyday settings are a customised version, which is only slightly lower (weaker security) than the pre-set high version, and a customised (higher security) Advanced tab setting too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To set my customised Security tab settings,&nbsp;I'll first select the pre-set High setting, and apply it, and ok the remaining windows to close them.&nbsp; Then I'll go back to the settings and change a couple of the values from disable to enable, and apply them,
 and ok the remaining windows.</p>
<p>I'll then delete browsing history.</p>
<p>I can do all of that via the control panel, so no internet pages are open at any time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now then, some web pages are unable to load fully&nbsp;because of my more restrictive security settings, and I'm fine with that in most cases, but there are occasions when I would like to view some sites that are prevented.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where I'm about to tell you the issue that is puzzling me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to view those sites, I've found that the&nbsp;only way, is to go back to the Security tab again and select the pre-set Medium-High setting and apply it.&nbsp; Those sites will now load.</p>
<p>What is my problem? I hear you ask... I'm not done yet!&nbsp; I'm getting there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I now change the pre-set values of the Medium-High setting to my own (restrictive) customised values, and apply it, the site will still load!&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's just rule out some obvious things here... I've closed the web page and deleted browsing history (all check
 boxes are ticked with the exception of the top one - Preserve favorite (sic) website data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what I'm wondering is, what exactly is remaining in place with the security settings, even though I've surely over ruled them again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On another note, do you know what I would dearly love Internet Explorer to have as well as the trusted and restricted sites settings?&nbsp; A further setting, where I could choose individual settings (including the advanced tab settings) for each individual site.&nbsp;
 At the moment, I constantly have to change the settings for particular sites, and it's a nuisance .&nbsp; If the ability to set parameters for each site separately were added,&nbsp;I would&nbsp;personally give each developer&nbsp;a huge kiss!</p>

<p>Hi Dann,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took a look at the Uservoice website you provided a link for (thanks for that), but I'm sorry to say, I'm a little confused as to just what that site is about.&nbsp; I read a few posts there to try to get an understanding, but it all looked somewhat more technical
 and was&nbsp;rather over my head.</p>
<p>Are you saying I need to post into that forum my question above about why are the security settings not working as expected, or are you saying that's where I should post my (last paragraph) suggestion of a way I would love for developers to improve Internet
 Explorer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this will get bumped to the top of the post again, to everyone, I'm still after an answer to my original question... Why doesn't changing the pre-set values of the Medium-High security settings to my own custom settings, override the default ones?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to all who answer.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Word 2016 is crashing every time I attempt to change already typed text&#39;s font color</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a MacBook Air 2017, and was able to get Microsoft Office for free through my University. On my other HP laptop, which I also used my school's free version of Microsoft Office on, this was never an issue.
</p>
<p>If I type something in a color, highlight it and click on the icon to change font colors, Microsoft Word crashes as soon as I click, or it waits for me to choose a color and then crashes. However, I'm able to change the font color before typing. I can type
 whatever I want, in whatever color I want, as long as I change the color before typing. I've tested both ways with various colors, including the Automatic Black. Any suggestions on how to fix it? I'm also wary about deleting the program and re-downloading
 it, as my school's website says only one download is permitted per account.</p>

<p>I suggest you firstly try running Word alone in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a> to see if the issue still exists.</p>
<p>If the issue persists, to help us clarify your scenario, please provide some more information:</p>
<p>1. The version of Office and OS. (You can check Office version in Word &gt; About Word)</p>
<p>2. Does the issue occur to one file or all files? Please create a new document and try again to see the result.</p>
<p>3. What had you done before the issue began? (e.g. update Office or OS)</p>

<p>Just tried&nbsp;out, and&nbsp;I can not replicate your issue sounds like you have a defective install of Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Before following steps below go to&nbsp;Microsoft Support site and&nbsp; see if I am accurate with the steps, if different follow those. I don't want to be responsible for messing up Word worse than it is.)</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>If Excel and PowerPoint are working;<br />
you'll need to go into the User Profile/Library and locate two Directories.<br />
</li><li>Both are located In Group Container Directory<br />
<br />
</li><li>One is Directory is Office.xxxxxxx&nbsp;(x indicates a a number).<br />
The other is Word.xxxxxxx (x indicates a a number).<br />
<em><strong>If you have any custom Templates save the templates<br />
folder in another location for safekeeping.</strong><br />
<br />
</em></li><li>Restart Word. It should rebuild those two Folders.</li></ol>

            You will probably have to contact MS to get your region changed (if that is possible). You can change your location on the laptop, but you will probably have to download a new Office 365 installation file for the Saudi Region.<br />

<span>How to Change the Region for the Windows 8 Store &amp; Windows 8 Apps
</span>
<p><a href="http://www.7tutorials.com/how-change-region-windows-8-store-windows-8-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.7tutorials.com/how-change-region-windows-8-store-windows-8-apps</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<div>
<p>
Maybe, the region has been ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù changed, check to confirm it is still correct.</p>
<p>
The region or the home location is a rather hidden setting in Windows 8 which is important when using the operating system and even more important when trying to find, access and use localized apps. If you have set the wrong region, you won‚Äôt be able to find
 certain apps or access relevant content for your location. Here‚Äôs how to change the location in Windows 8 so that you can solve such problems.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<div>
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>‚Äúcontents are not allowed in your region‚Äù /
<span>&nbsp;</span>"US Trade Restrictions"</span>
<p><span>The US government says that MS cannot sell or download the full versions of Office in certain countries. The encryption used in it is considered a "munition".&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip from MSLT&gt;</span></p>
<p><b>GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTIONS.</b> If the software is marked as requiring activation in a specific geographic region, then you are only permitted to activate this software in the geographic region indicated on the
 software packaging. You may not be able to activate the software outside of that region. For further information on geographic restrictions, visit
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=141397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=141397</a>.</p>
<p><b>EXPORT RESTRICTIONS.</b>&nbsp; The software is subject to United States export laws and regulations.&nbsp; You must comply with all domestic and international export laws and regulations that apply to the software.&nbsp;
 These laws include restrictions on destinations, end users and end use.&nbsp; For additional information, see
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/exporting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/exporting</a>.</p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>The download site thinks you are currently located in one of those restricted locations. The download site uses a "who am I" service to determine your location based on your IP address. Sometimes the "who am I" service
 gets it wrong.&nbsp; For example, the first time I saw this questionI tried 4 "who am I" services. 2 had me located properly, 2 displaced me by 2000 miles and an international border, Oops.</span></p>
<p><b><span>What can you do:</span></b></p>
<ul>
<li>When doing the download, make sure to <b>
SAVE to HD</b> rather than Run the installation concurrent with the download</li><li>Make sure the page is pointing to the right country. Look in the Upper right or lower left corner to see what the country is. There are ‚Äúregion specific‚Äù downloads</li><li>try to contact the download site, probably not. MS does not provide user support for trials</li><li>contact your Internet Provider to see if they can talk to MS to find out which "who am I" they are using so that your Provider can contact them to get their database fixed.&nbsp; Maybe, but your Provider probably isn't too concerned
 about the error. &lt;sigh&gt;</li><li>perform your download from a location that uses a different Service Provider, say a friend's house or work.&nbsp; Install and activate there also!</li><li>Try a different download site / link</li></ul>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Please let us know which, if any (or even none!), of these suggestions worked for you. Thanks.</p>

</p>
<p>Check out following steps to fix the problem:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Windows 8 upgrade offer is available in selected countries and regions by Microsoft, so first make sure your country or region is available for the upgrade offer by visiting
 following official terms and conditions page given at <a href="http://www.askvg.com/fix-windows-8-not-available-for-download-or-purchase-in-your-country-or-region/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>Terms and conditions for Windows 8 Pro online upgrade</b></a></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> If your country or region is present in the given list but you are still receiving the error message, following trick will help you in removing the error message:</p>
<p><strong>2.a.</strong> First close upgrade assistant if it is running and then go to the folder which contains upgrade assistant's EXE file.</p>
<p><strong>2.b.</strong> Now right-click on EXE file and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2.c.</strong> Go to
<strong>Compatibility</strong> tab and enable "<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>" option. Select "<strong>Windows XP (Service Pack 3)</strong>" from the drop-down box.</p>
<p><strong>2.d.</strong> Apply the changes and run upgrade assistant again.</p>
<p>Now you'll no longer receive the error message and you'll be able to purchase or download Windows 8 from Microsoft.
<em>Checked and confirmed...</em></p>

<span>The Microsoft Office Configuration Analyzer Tool (OffCAT) is a program that provides a detailed report of your installed Office programs. It scans one application at a time This report includes many parameters about your Office program configuration
 and highlights known problems found when OffCAT scans your computer. For any problems that are listed in the report, you are provided with a link to a public-facing article (usually a Microsoft Knowledge Base article) on the issue so you can read about possible
 fixes for the problem. If you are a Help Desk professional, you can also save the report to file so that the report can be viewed in the Office Configuration Analyzer Tool on another client where the tool is installed.

<p>You can download a portable copy in ZIP format, or an MSI Installation file (Personally I prefer the ZIP installation).</p>
<p>For me, the first run for Word 2010 identified 2 hotfixes, even on an up-to-date Windows Update machine. Same for a 2007 installation, 2 hotfixes</p>

            <p>Yes, that is a feature of the MS anti-counterfeiting system.&nbsp; They manufacture and sell products for specific geographic regions.&nbsp; Products sold for one region CANNOT be activated in another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 2 likely causes for this problem.&nbsp; First, you bought Office from a distant region (ie a cheap copy from China or India) and you live in another region (like North America).&nbsp; Or second you bought and initially activated Office in the correct region,
 but while you were travelling abroad (for example on business) and for some reason Office decide to check your activation status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only fix is "simple". Make sure your license and activation location match.&nbsp; If you can't do that you are S.O.L. .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Calling the "normal" support number probably will not work.&nbsp; They can't deal with activation problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would have to do a phone activation. When you phone in, don't reply to initial prompts.&nbsp; Wait a LONG TIME, until you are eventually offered the option of talking to a live "service" rep.&nbsp; Explain the problem to them.&nbsp; Then (REPEATEDLY) ask to speak to
 a supervisor because the front line support person will not be able to help you, they will just waste your time.</p>

<p>Nokia Support Discussions is a peer-to-peer troubleshooting forum, Nokia is not able to respond directly to individual requests for support via this forum. You are at liberty to ask for assistance from our members, but you need to call or e-mail if you need
 to discuss your issues with Nokia staff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Attempting to disrupt the operation of this forum will not solve your issues, this forum is not a source of official support from Nokia technical support staff.</p>

<p>It has been posted here for two weeks with no response: 
/discussions/board/message?board.id=communicators&amp;thread.id=48890</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>E71 reboots randomly. AT&amp;T DID discontinue their E71. Both AT&amp;T and unbranded E71 users report their phones randomly rebooting. I already tried hard reset, update, etc, etc it did not help at all. So I contact support via email and they send me a bunch of
 gibberish, none of which really relates to the actual question I had for them. I sent the phone for service to PELCO and that did not help, if anything it made it worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My co-worker has the same phone but on the T-Mobile network with no issues such as mine. If I disable 3G in my phone it doesn't restart randomly. I want Nokia to acknologe if infact these rumors are true and in either case offer a solution to me. As it stands
 both companies have not admitted anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was very happy with the E71 before this started to happen. I used to recommend it all day long. Sadly now due to the poor service Nokia has provided I can no longer say the same. I have recieved worse "care" than if I would have acquired one of the "free"&nbsp;
 phones from my carrier because at least with AT&amp;T or T-Mobile I can ring them and practially no questions asked they would have mailed me a new phone.</p>

<p>That's right, perhaps the comment was kinda rude. But sometimes when we're stuck in something in some flaws and the guys at Nokia simply "do nothing" about some very documented issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take this simple example:&nbsp; IPSec VPN.&nbsp; I spent THREE MONTHS trying to connect my cellphone to my VPN hub, Linux-based.&nbsp; Changed from Racoon to Opeswan, tried ALL THE CONFIGS in the Internet. Doesn't work.&nbsp; I rewrote the .pol file a hundred (yes, hundred)
 times. Nada.&nbsp; Yesterday, I discover VPN client received the MODECFG values, but it doesn't ACK, so the VPN hub believes the client never received it.&nbsp; OK, anooooother flaw, update the VPN client.&nbsp; Downloaded the client for update, ran the .SISX... guess what?
 "UPDATE ERROR".&nbsp; No one knows how to solve this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can understand this is not an official Nokia support but, if you put a forum in a Nokia web server, I supposed it's not for playing jokes, isn't it? I can understand Nokia will not give free support for (sometimes) stupid or useless questions, but here,
 I saw VERY VERY VERY HARD TO SOLVE issues, that anyone can see that these issues are NOKIA FAULTS and anyone can see no one at Nokia say a little word.&nbsp; But if anyone "disrupt the forums", quickly a guy from Nokia appears...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't misinterpret me. &nbsp; This is a constructive critic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think the main issue is Nokia "Care" I understand most support these days is outsourced (and I have a huge issue with that... not because it is outsourced, not because they are in India or Manila, but because in the end even if they are in the same country
 as me the reason it is outsourced is to reduce costs... This works fine when my mother needs to ring Nokia and ask for a repair because her LCD is cracked, but obviously in my case it does not work.) but the level of service I have gotten is just not acceptable.
 When I call Nokia USA in New York the "escalations" department I talked to is also outsourced to non-employees and they have the same problems that led me to seek an escalation from Nokia "Care" to begin with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is an example of one exchange I had with Nokia "Care:"</p>

Dear Mr. Andrew Joakimsen,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for your response. We are glad that you are choosing Nokia for your mobile needs.<br />
<br />
With regard to your inquiry about the issues with the device regarding the WCDMA in Miami, we would like to inform you that currently we have no information regarding the issue concerning the WCDMA.&nbsp; Regarding the E71x it was manufactured by Nokia but was configured
 by AT&amp;T, we suggest you to check with AT&amp;T the WCDMA in Miami, currently the WCDMA of E71x is 850/1900 MHz, HSDPA, it might be that&nbsp; the WCDMA is different in Miami than your phone supports.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I hope the information provided proves useful.<br />
<br />
If you have any additional questions, please don‚Äôt hesitate to contact us again. To ensure proper handling of your case, kindly continue using the current subject line.<br />

Subject:&nbsp; RE: Technical Support<br />
<br />
I am specifically seeking more information regarding the&nbsp; issues users in Miami, FL are having with their phones. AT&amp;T has discontinued their E71 phone because of this.<br />
<br />
As stated in the previous email my software is already up to date and I have done a reset of the phone.<br />
Sent from a Nokia E71.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if Nokia just would come out and acknowledge the issues I am reporting and state there is no solution at this time, it would raise other issues but guess what in the end it would stop me from wasting your resources in support and customer communications.
 As of now I will just keep on sending my phone to PELCO for "repair."&nbsp; If this is really what I think it is doing so will do no good, it is only a waste of money on Nokia's part but I am left with no other alternative. Posting here again more effort is spent
 by Nokia and their employees or contractors to delete posts and ban people that could have been put forth towards actually resolving my issue or adequately answering my questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still don't have a contact at Nokia I can talk to. I still have not received any response to my repeated requests to escalate my matter. Please don't take it personally, but not even the moderators here have the ability to help me it seems, even if it
 is just to put me in touch with the right person. This is large systematic and companywide problem!</p>

<p>I whole-heartedly support the notion that Nokia must improve its customer service. Perhaps committing to solving issues raised in this forum is a GOOD start. Then making wholesome products is an on-going cost-cutting measure to reducing reliance on overall
 customer service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Failing all these some serious competition from other heavyweight rivals is always best.</p>

<p>Its been &gt; 8 months since the first reboot issue was reported. Yet the newest firmware available for my phone is 200.21.118 dated 27th Nov 2008.</p>

<p>I have had several malicious, yes purposefully evil Nokia Care people screw me around about OVI music. After that, if I have a problem, I come to this forum. I think my nokia is running smooth and I feel bad for the people that have a bumb phone that Nokia
 cannot take care about. And yes, there is a lot that Nokia cannot take care about. Charge another 50 bucks a phone for the smartest phones, and tell me that you have lines to engineers to solve any problems and I will pay up for this service. I dont want to
 waste too much of my time talking about Nokia care, but when the phones are getting so sophisticated, you need sophisticated people answering the calls when we call. That way, I will continue to buy nokia. or, I will go to HP or something windows based because
 that is what I have experience with. Please Nokia, help us buy your phones! Fire the people that are idiots on the phone with us. We work so hard to get our phones' settings just right and after a year of using your PC Suite, reinstalling the settings we have
 saved just wrecks our phone. why? waste of time. I hate that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I say one thing now. I am looking for a new laptop. with my exprience with PC Suite, there is nothing inside me that thinks that nokia can build a computer that will synch completely with my&nbsp;phone. I would like a nokia laptop to take care of my&nbsp;e71 and
 the nokia i will buy&nbsp;(we will see what comes out&nbsp;after the e90/e72/n900) but i just dont think that it&nbsp;can. that is not very good&nbsp;for you guys to hear i am sure, but&nbsp;why should i have terrible service from nokia when i know that the service from sony canada
 (in toronoto) is very good. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I totally agree, there is no way you can reach any competent Nokia personnel. This forum was created by nokia for its users so it should as a mater of duty to be monitoring what it's customers about their nokia products since they use their hard earned cash
 to buy nokia products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&nbsp;&nbsp; have a right to complain about the bugs in our phones and complain very loudly, but some people on this very forum would suggest&nbsp; we write directly to nokia, I don't know how they get their phones maybe nokia gives them for free to them but I pay for
 mine in full, and when I have a complaint to make nokia should listen and act.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bet you if the buying public stoped buying nokia phones and their market share drops due to buggy phones, nokia will act very quickly to improve.</p>
