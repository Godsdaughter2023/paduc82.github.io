<p>Press windows key+r and type "shutdown -s -f -t 00" including spaces without quotes. and press enter. Hope this command shuts down your computer. If yes you cant create a shortcut of this command on desktop by right click on desktop and new&gt;shortcut type
 this whole command and click next and give name of your command and finish. you can shutdown using this shortcut that you have created. Hope it helps.</p>
<p>Good Luck!</p>

<div>Hi chana fletes,</div>
<div><br />
<div>In addition to <strong>Vanshaj Daga's</strong> suggestion, I have few questions to ask.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. How are you trying to switch the computer off?</div>
<div>2. Have you connected any external devices which could be the reason for your system to not shut down properly?</div>
<div>3. Do you remember any changes to your machine prior to the issue occurring?</div>
<div>4. Are you using a laptop or a desktop?</div>
<div>5. Does it get stuck at any stage "Logging Off" while trying to switch the computer off?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This may mostly happen if the programs running on the computer do not quit I would prevent the computer to shutdown this may also happen due to any third party software or its services interrupting the shutdown process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest that you try the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot</a> procedure and check if you are able to turn your computer off.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Do not forget to reset the computer to start as usual as mentioned in step 7.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Unable to join minecraft multiplayer through xbox live due to how my account was set up &#40;apparently&#41;</h2>
                    <p>When I try to go onto a server it says 'You cannot play online multiplayer through Xbox Live because of how your account is set up. This can be changed in your privacy &amp; online safety settings on Xbox.com' however I cannot access these settings as the account
 is a child account and I haven't been able to get a 'Microsoft Family'&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to play multiplayer before hand, and I don't see why I should be barred from it for something I did not choose to turn on/off. I only have a Microsoft account as the student discount was helpful, and so I don't see what setting that could have
 triggered, and would like Microsoft to just turn off the settings that are barring me from playing games with friends as this is just ridiculous.</p>

<p>Hey Xander,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you bought it through Amazon then it will not be listed on your Microsoft account. Unless Amazon provided you a 25-digit Xbox Live code for the game and you redeem it from an Xbox or Microsoft.com, it will not appear on your&nbsp;Xbox account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox requires an Xbox Live Gold subscription to play Minecraft on it's platforms, which includes the Xbox 360, the Xbox One, and Xbox on Windows. So the original error you were receiving was due to your account not having an active Gold subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what the original issue was with the game license you got through Amazon, but on the Xbox side of things you will need a subscription to play Minecraft on the Xbox servers.</p>

    <title>High CPU Usage on Wake - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phil ip  say:</h3>
<h2>            High CPU Usage on Wake</h2>
                    <p>I've seen and posted in&nbsp;the thread from Oct, 2013, but&nbsp;I think that this issue is slightly different. It presents similarly with 26-30% CPU usage but only occurs after waking the SP2 from sleep (not sure about hibernate)&nbsp;and only involves the "System" process
 rather than both System and System Interrupts. Generally, it only occurs after waking the device maybe 2-4 times, after which, sleeping or hibernating does not remove this constant high usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only started getting this issue recently, shortly after Update 1 OR after plugging in an SD card for the first time (I coincidentally got an SD card when Update 1 came out) so I can't say for certain which was more likely to be the cause. I can say for
 certain, however, that there is another, distinct high CPU usage problem concerning waking the device from sleep with an SD card in the slot which seems to go away when audio is played or remains loaded in a media player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I really hope that this gets isolated and fixed so that I can get back to using my 256 GB Surface Pro 2 without having to worry about whether my battery will unnecessarily drain due to high CPU usage every time I wake it up or having to close
 everything I was working on to reboot to get rid of the high CPU usage. If there is some info that I can provide which would help isolate the problem, please let me know (eg. event log data).</p>

            <p>Serendipitously, I just discovered something new about this behaviour: I was on the bus and checking my task manager after waking it from sleep, found it using 24-30% CPU, and was about to start disabling devices in Device Manager to see if anything would
 help&nbsp;while navigating with my stylus when I noticed that, suddenly, it went down to 10-15%. Shocked, I moved the stylus away and the CPU usage almost immediately jumped back up to 24-30%. This phenomenon also happened when just touching the display constantly,
 such as by dragging Device Manager around my desktop with my finger. It wasn't completely linked in that there were a few occasions where merely hovering over a small part of the screen wouldn't trigger the drop in CPU usage but, after moving the stylus cursor
 over certain selectable elements, it would then retrigger the usage drop.<br />
<br />
So this high CPU usage might be related to the touch sensing somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should note that I am using the recently released Wacom Feel driver but I was having this problem even with the stock driver.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't think that it was activating any sounds: I was merely moving the cursor around, mostly on top of the Task Manager. In any case, I think we've definitively concluded in other threads that the high CPU usage that is affected by sound is due to the
 SDcard/USB3.0 high CPU usage which should not have been present here.<br />
<br />
I just had the high CPU on wake happen again with no SDcard in slot nor any USB devices plugged in. Unfortunately, touch/stylus had no effect this time around so either that previous finding of mine was merely specific to a certain circumstance or there are
 even more variants of high CPU usage scenarios on wake than we may have thought. Time to reboot my device.<br />
<br />
My advice to anyone reading this while a fix has not been issued is that, whenever you wake your device, check your Task Manager for 24-30% CPU usage happening from the "System" process for no reason. You might also notice when your device gets hot for seemingly
 no reason. This is a sign that you need to reboot your SP2 to preserve your battery.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: I should note that I was using the latest Feel driver previously but am now using the default Windows tablet driver. That is one difference between my previous finding and today's test.</p>

    <title>Samsung 500T Microsoft Update Broke Sound. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dononewco  say:</h3>
<h2>            Samsung 500T Microsoft Update Broke Sound.</h2>
                    <p>Okay I am starting my own post since others have asked similar questions but nobody got an Answer that worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So here is my problem, I bought my Dad a Samsung 500T a while back and I even updated it to windows 8.1, it took some doing but it was up and running. Well it was up and running until a Microsoft Update happened and made the computer unbootable. So I have
 been working on this thing for a nearly 2 weeks, I tried everything I could find online and through extensive trial and error I found that the error was occurring in the way Windows 8.1 and the realtek audio drivers were talking. If Its not installed everything
 else runs great, but as soon as it is installed, no matter if I use the installer or manually install it using device manager, or safe mode, clean boot or any other possible way it doesnt work. The sound is fixed until its time to reboot then it hangs indefinitely
 at the Samsung start-up logo screen. The problem is that it did work before Microsoft added something in one of the updates, and it does work for a little bit til its time to reboot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please do something about this instead of passing it off as user error and making us feel like its not working because of something we did. I can find nobody with a Samsung 500t that isn't having this problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to save time this is how I went about getting to this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I did:</p>
<p>1)reset windows 8 to factory specs</p>
<p>2)uninstall all unnecessary apps and programs (Including antivirus programs) *Restart</p>
<p>3)Update windows 8 all the way (*restart)</p>
<p>4)Update any remaining apps all the way (*restart)</p>
<p>5)uninstall realtek, then clean the disk out of junk (*restart)</p>
<p>6)Setup the clean boot and restart</p>
<p>7)Go to the Microsoft Store and Update to 8.1</p>
<p>8)After 8.1 finishes IMMEDIATELY ENABLE DISK PROTECTION AND CREATE A RESTORE POINT.</p>
<p>*From this point forward any progress you make and get a successful restart create a new restore point.</p>
<p>9) Clean the disk again and undo the clean boot settings</p>
<p>10)Start with important Windows Updates small chunks at a time (5 or so at a time restarting and creating restore points between each)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then tried many different ways of installing the sound driver, SW Update, Setup Installer and Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else you can think of?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe someone can write a script that would load sound drivers after the computer booted up, since we can install drivers and they work til reboot, seems to me that might work if someone knows how to do that kinda thing.</p>

            <p>Okay I have given this some thought and read up on drivers and how they are handled. Depending on if the driver needs to be loaded during boot up or if it can operate in a plug and play basis the drivers can be loaded at different stages. I am thinking since
 this driver works when it is first installed but then has issues the next time you reboot the computer then it is capable of running in a plug and play setting and may not be required to load during boot and therefore if it were loaded later then it would
 not prevent the system from booting. The problem is, even though I understand that it is possible to do that, I am not a programmer and therefore cannot fix this myself.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also looked at the driver Setup Information file and it has the driver listed as SERVICE_DEMAND_START which means it should be handled at a plug and play device and not even interfere in windows booting up, but 8.1 for some reason is being affected or
 is trying to load it before it is time. Whatever the case the driver is not being handled properly by Win 8.1.</p>

<p>&nbsp;1. I have tried the files from SW Update (Samsung), from REALTEK, and from a 3rd party Lenovo who has a tablet that runs the I2S setup. All have the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Compatibility mode had no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been all over these forums and many others and this is a quite common problem and nobody has solved it, most give up but that I dont think we should just give up, it should be solvable.</p>

            I Agree.&nbsp; I have been to countless forums, tried every single option given, and proven over and over that RealTek's driver is not working right with Windows 8.1 on this specific Samsung tablet.&nbsp; Either the problem is with RealTek, Windows 8.1 or Samsung.&nbsp;
 It is NOT a user problem, nor a hardware problem since the sound works fine in Windows 8.0.&nbsp;

            So is this being swept aside? I mean I know that the Samsung windows 8 tablets are a competitor's item and that a lot of people are switching over and buying Microsoft Surface Tablets as a result of this problem, but common this is a very small driver
 configuration issue that should be easy to fix for the windows update team.<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for keeping us updated on the status of the issue and </span><span><span>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>This issue can be caused due to incorrect sound settings or driver corruption.
<span>Let’s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Check the status of external speakers under “Playback devices”.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. <strong>Right-Click </strong>on the <strong>Volume icon</strong>&nbsp;at&nbsp;the Task bar notification area and select ‘<strong>Playback devices</strong>’.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b. <strong>Right-click</strong> on the blank area and select “<strong>Show Disabled Devices</strong>”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c. If it shows any disable device,<strong> right click </strong>on it<strong> and
</strong>select “<strong>Enable</strong>” and also select “<strong>Set Default</strong>”.
</span><span>Check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above settings are correct and issue still persists, then method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try to remove the hidden sound card drivers from the Device Manager and restart the computer.
</span><span>Let the Windows install the generic drivers and then see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press <strong>Windows Key + X key </strong>and click on <strong>Command Prompt</strong> (Admin) from the task list.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Right-click <strong>Command Prompt </strong>from the start search list and then click
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow.</strong></em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. At the command prompt, type the following lines, pressing <strong>Enter
</strong>after each line:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1 </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>cd\ %SystemRoot% \System32 </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>start devmgmt.msc </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Device Manager window will open.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. Click on <strong>show hidden devices</strong> under View menu Tab.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>6. Expand all the nods under device manager<strong>.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>7. There would be many greyed out entries in device manager <strong>
uninstall all the greyed out entries </strong>under all the nods and then restart the computer<strong>.
</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>8. <strong>Expand</strong> the<strong> Sound, video and game controllers</strong>.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>9. <strong>Right click</strong> on sound drivers and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>10. Follow the onscreen instructions to uninstall the current version of the driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>11. Restart the computer. Let the Windows install the generic drivers and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

            <p>I did a clean install, using USB ISO of 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed every driver from the SW software that comes with Samsung Smartpc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Except the sound driver, for same reason as posted here many times, it goes on endless loop, the reverts back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all has been documented here by users who invested a lot of time troubleshooting this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can find no drivers that are grayed out to uninstall, I don't want to keep on reinstalling/reimaging endlessly, so far probably have done that about 20 times!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here I find the most accurate description of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far no good driver for 8.1 while everything worked fine with 8.0 as far as sound drivers.</p>

Done. Yet somehow the issue persists. It's like listening to a broken record to get a resolution for this issue.

            Like everyone else i have not been able to get past the realtek audio driver problem with windows 8.1 and now windows 10.&nbsp; I rather keep a current machine without sound than have a dated system with sound, so for now the search for a fix continues. Does
 anyone know of a generic audio driver that can be used as a substitute?&nbsp; Samsung nor Microsoft have figured it out so maybe everyone should write to realtek tech support for a solution, but to Microsoft's credit they are offering help in the forums.

<p>I can confirm that if you use the sw update tool and download the 8.1 sound driver after upgrading to windows 10 the realtek driver is working correctly! No boot hanging or anything.&nbsp;

<p><span>Disabling the touchpad drivers from control panel varies depending on the manufacturer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try the following steps and check if that helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Click
<b>Start</b>, and select <b>Control panel</b>.<br />
b. Click <b>Mouse </b>under the classic view.<br />
c. Click the <b>Device Settings </b>tab.<br />
d. Select the touchpad device. <br />
e. Click <b>Disable</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to download the manual for the correct model and check if that helps.</p>

<p>Hey there, GMR Wilks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe there is a means to check as to what was said. It just means that someone reported him.</p>
<p>I would review the information on the <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
home page of the enforcement website </a>and maybe look around in Enforcement History for any options.
</p>
<p>If it doesn't let you file a case review, then you'd most likely have to wait out the communication ban</p>

    <title>Screen Blacking Out during Multiplayer...help&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Screen Blacking Out during Multiplayer...help&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings all.</p>

<p>Having an issue with my MW3... I don't know if it's my disk or lag, or whatever, I figure this is the place to ask around. I have a new 360, an HDMI cable for it, 1080p, 1080p capable flatscreen.</p>

<p>When I'm playing multiplayer, I have an issue of the screen blacking out on me occasionally - like I'm going to lag out, but things are still going on (I think). I haven't had this problem in single player.</p>
<p>I figure someone else must have had this problem, at least at one point, could someone help me?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Asus Laptop Wont Boot and getting error message &#34;FAULTY_HARDWARE_CORRUPTED_PAGE&#34; with black screen.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 10 Asus Laptop Wont Boot</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Asus laptop has been getting "FAULTY_HARDWARE_CORRUPTED_PAGE" every so often since I updated to Windows 10. I looked this up when it started happening and it seemed common on Asus laptops. Today it happened again but after it wouldn't boot right. It went
 to the Asus loading screen and loaded then it would go to black screen. I rebooted multiple times and it kept doing it so I looked it up and found a few pages that said to unplug battery and hold down power button for 30-60 second then plug battery back in.
 I tried that and after the Asus loading screen it went to "Recovery It looks like Windows didn't load correctly" and gave me advanced options and restart option so I click restart. Then it went to Asus loading screen and black screen again like it was doing
 before! At this point I figured I would try and get help from the internet. ;-;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I managed to system restore to 3 days ago (4/8/2016) and after the system restore was done I clicked restart and its still giving me black screen after Asus loading screen. I also plugged it into my monitor and the Asus loading screen would show up
 on there too but after that the monitor went to the No Signal screen.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Barb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all due respect, one of the things with 802.11 standards is to ensure backwards compatibility. &nbsp;If MS doesn't test for this, they are not following the wifi standard. &nbsp;I do understand where you are coming from. &nbsp;With 802.11ac vs b/g, there are several
 differences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However this issue is pretty wide spread. &nbsp;Many different wifi router vendors have been used and had the problem. &nbsp;Down grading the driver to .151 seems to work for most people but not all. &nbsp;MS should just fix the driver and be Done with it. &nbsp;Seeing this
 one thread and many others like it shows that MS driver quality is about the same as Apples or worse, which is unfortunate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The history that this same issue plagued windows 8 should have been a learning experience. &nbsp;MS has simply repeated past mistakes in driver quality control. &nbsp;Although I understand the technological reasoning behind suggesting a customer to upgrade to ac,
 for some it is just not possible. &nbsp;I have 40 buildings and we'll over 1000 APS to upgrade. &nbsp;That is not going to happen any time soon. &nbsp;The driver spy needs to be fixed. &nbsp;It's no wonder that my users want ipads instead of a surface.</p>

            <p>First, I agree with everything you say. If you want to post details of your APs, I can see if we can get a support case opened for you - if they know then AP brand/model/firmware and config, I would hope they would try to replicate. On October 24, I emailed
 some folks at MSFT with your previous post (and will assume that they didn't get in touch with you):</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong><em>"I would like to weigh in on this as I have run into this issue as well.&nbsp;
</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>We have a mixture of surface 3 and surface pro 3 devices running windows 8.1 and windows 10.&nbsp; The have the 15.68.3091.193 version of the Marvell AVASTAR Wireless AC driver.&nbsp; All devices
 are using the same driver.&nbsp; We have a mix of 40 buildings with Cisco 1142, 3500, 2600 and 2700 APs.&nbsp; The 1142, 3500 and 2600 are all 802.11n APs, but the 2700's are 802.11ac APs.&nbsp; All of these APs are running the same version of code as they are controller
 based.</span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span>We are finding, like many others, that when we connect to APs, if we force the driver to 2.4 GHz then everything works fine.&nbsp;
</span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><em>Here is another issue we have discovered.&nbsp; The surface 3 and pro 3 has an 802.11ac card in it.&nbsp; Most of our APs are 802.11n.&nbsp; With this driver version, regardless of windows 8.1 or 10,
 we have the 5 ghz issue.&nbsp; However, if we connect to an 802.11ac AP, we have no issues.&nbsp; It is almost as if this driver has a backward compatibility issue with 802.11n on 5 GHz."</em></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Community Moderators/MVP's are unpaid volunteers. I'm a consumer, just like you. I am appalled at the continuing issues with the Marvell WiFi drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going off the reservation with the following, so do this at your own risk&nbsp;- if you go to
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49040" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49040</a> and download the
<strong>Surface3_WiFi_Win10_151109_1.zip </strong>(yes this is Surface 3, not Pro, but the Marvell drivers are the same), extract the zip and take a single test&nbsp;SP3 and update both the WiFi and Bluetooth Marvell drivers with the newer driver in this zip. The
 version in the zip is <span>15.68.9032.47 - newer than the .41 for the SP3. <em>
<strong>Microsoft didn't announce this release even to S3 owners, nor is anything about it documented</strong></em>. But the fact that it includes the word WiFi in the title certainly implies (to me) that this zip file is for WiFi fixes.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could take a test SP3, create a system restore point, and then update the drivers from device manager, have disk/let me chose and point to these drivers and reboot. I'd love to know if these drivers make a difference. There's a regedit fix for the
<strong>.41 </strong>driver (if that is what you are using) that may or may not help, and I wouldn't think you'd want to deploy this Enterprise wide)</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Press Windows button. Search for regedit. Open it</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Navigate to the following path:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\mrvlpcie8897</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Find the item labeled “TXAMSDU”. Double tap and modify the value from 1 to 0</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Restart the machine</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Cause:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Microsoft states there a known issue with .41 that results in low throughput with specific access points. The issue is specific to MAC layer aggregation (AMSDU over AMPDU) and only
 impacts a small subset of access points. They state they are working on a fix for an upcoming update. Until the fix is available, please update the registry key setting to work around this issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's up to you whether you want to try the driver from 11/9. And again, I don't speak for Microsoft, I'm just trying to help.</p>

            The 10586 November update now available has the new Marvell wireless&nbsp;15.68.9032.47 driver. Can you test on one of your devices and report back on whether or not this fixes your issue?

            <p>Hi,<br />
i use the WiFi driver version 15.68.9032.47 (Surface Pro 3) and my upload was 0 kBit :-(.<br />
After the registry change (TXAMSDU) from 1 to 0, i again full upload speed :)<br />
My DSL Router is "Fritz!Box 7390".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Have you updated to the November Update to build 10586.3? (the big OS update).
</p>
<p>After you have updated to 10586.3, can you test again? With and without the reg hack?
</p>
<p>Does it still fail when TXAMSDU is set to 1?<strong> Be sure to reboot after changing the registry each time</strong>.

            <p>I bought the Surface on Friday and on Saturday a major update including BIOS has been downloaded . Thereafter, the wireless connection did not work anymore .<br />
After several attempts, the WiFi settings ( only 2 GHz ) to change , I have Windows freshened ( Not factory settings ) . After that there were still problems with the Wi-Fi connection ( Upload = 0 kbit / Download = 50 Mbps) .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Through the WiFi error also an error in the Windows Update hangs together . If the WLAN card has this bug , then simultaneously enters the error 0x8024401c in Windows Update .</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error in Windows Update I first tried to repair . But that was unnecessary.<br />
</p>
<p>Currently the Windows version 10.0.10586 is installed .<br />
</p>
<p>After changing the registry still no problems .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many greetings<br />

            Sorry, I can't tell from your post if you are still have a problem. Are you saying that after you installed 10586 that your wifi is working and you don't need the reg hack anymore?

            <p>Hi Barb,</p>
<p>after install 10586 on saturday the WiFi Card does not work (very slow upload speed).<br />
Then i applied the registry hack (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">TXAMSDU set to 0) and the upload speed is 10 mBit (speedtest.net).</span></p>
<p>If TXAMSDU again adjusting to 1 and reboot surface, then the upload speed is 0 mBit again.</p>
<p>The problem can be reproduced.</p>

<h2>            Windows Explorer in Windows 7 - buggy</h2>
                    Why is it that when I expand a folder on the left, the position of the folder I'm expanding does not stay stationary. In all previous Windows versions Explorer was quite stable (well maybe not Vista but I skipped over that mess). This is very annoying.
 The whole thing is unpredictable. It's like it's slippery and can't stay still. Even on the right, I find that when I mouse around, the whole list of folders/files suddenly shoots to the top for no apparent reason. It's very unstable. You'd think after 3 years
 or so they would have fixed these bugs. On the left, whey you expand a folder, it will suddenly shoot to the top or the bottom of that pane or even go completely outside the pane so that you can't see it. Quite annoying. Please fix this microsoft (yeah, I
 know, this is a peer to peer forum, so shoot me)<br />

<h2>            Remote Desktop Connection to Windows 8 PC from other computers crashing</h2>
                    <div>Hi all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Was hoping someone would be able to help me with an issue I'm having.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm trying to get a LAN remote desktop connection established to my Windows 8 laptop. It's an HP ENVY 17t-2100 CTO 3D Edition Notebook PC. Note that I'm running Windows 8 Pro only - not 8.1 as HP haven't released 8.1 graphics drivers for this laptop and
 probably never will. The computer has a single user profile that has full administrator rights.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have followed numerous web tutorials on how to turn on Remote Desktop. I've gone into Advanced System Settings &gt; System Properties &gt; Remote &gt; checked "Allow Remote connections to this computer". All seems ok to me.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The problem comes when I try to establish a connection. When the connection is made, it almost instantaneously crashes the session on the computer or device trying to connect. The RDP client on my Windows 7 laptop, Mac OSX or Mac running Windows 8.1 Pro
 just crashes, while the RDP iPhone or iPad app simply flickers for a few seconds then goes back to the main screen. Meanwhile, the HP ENVY loads the lock screen and displays a message saying XXX device is connected remotely and it won't let me log back in
 to kill the connection or do anything. I have to restart the computer from then to be able to use it again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm convinced there's not a problem with my local network as the HP ENVY can RDP into the Windows 7 laptop or Mac running Windows 8.1 without any problems. All computers are connected via Ethernet to a Linksys/Cisco wireless ADSL modem router which supports
 Gigabit. The iPhone and iPad of course connect to the wifi network from the Cisco/Linksys modem router</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've also had a brief look at the RDP local connection logs. From what I can make out, they confirm that a user has successfully logged in, but they don't provide a crash log or a log of the user ever disconnecting, probably because I have to restart the
 computer to continue using it. Dead end there, it seems.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The HP ENVY is connected to 3 external HP LED monitors. I've disconnected them and tried all devices with no luck. I've also played round with the RDP client settings to not mount drives or printers and the HP ENVY has no printers connected anyway, though
 I've done all I can to remove any printer drivers as I've read elsewhere that they are what could cause the problem, but I've had no luck.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone can suggest anything more that I can try, I would be unbelievably grateful! I'm more than happy to provide screenshots or videos of what happens when I try connecting. I'm not sure what you experts would find immediately helpful so just ask away
 if you think I can provide anything.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>

    <title>Realtek&#47;Driver Microphone issues. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ambientwaves  say:</h3>
<h2>            Realtek&#47;Driver Microphone issues.</h2>
                    <p>I'm at this point broken down almost at trying to find everything to fix this problem. My Mic works find tried on other PC's, Tried both front and back headphone and mic jacks, tried even a USB audio converter that takes voice/sound in.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've tried literally every single thing I could.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- BIOS checked/updated - Check (Nothing)</p>
<p>- CMD /sf - Check (Nothing/No problems found)</p>
<p>- Repair/Trouble shoot - Check (Not a single problem found)</p>
<p>- Windows update/checked for updated - (Didn't solve)</p>
<p>- Reinstall drivers from realtek - (didn't work.)</p>
<p>- Ran installer for realtek in windows 8 comparability - (Didn't work)</p>
<p>- Disabled/Enabled drivers in the manager - Nothing.</p>
<p>- Used CCleaner to check system/uninstalled though it and reinstalled realtek - Nope still there,</p>
<p>-Uninstalled ALL sound drivers and restarted PC - Nothing.</p>
<p>-Changed everything I could in audio settings for the Mic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things that are showing up/happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Microphone High Definition Audio Device Currently unavailable.</p>
<p>- The Wizard could not start - Make sure your Audio hardware is working properly and check your audio configuration in the audio device and sound themes control panel.</p>
<p>-&nbsp;\4&amp;2afd1705&amp;0&amp;0201 requires further installation. (Which to me makes very little sense.) As I literally installed the driver from the website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried two Headsets, Steel Series Siberia 650 and a Audio-technica both have sound but no mic.</p>

 is no free space on the hard-drive and no free space in the C: paritition but if you look in Computer explorer window it says there is 79gb free. How can this be accomplished?<br />
