<h2>            0xc000000e Boot Error, Keyboards not Working&#33;</h2>
                    <span>Recently, the error 0xc000000e started appearing whenever I try to boot. While the computer is in the error state, no USB devices function (including any keyboard I try in any USB port), so all I could do was turn the computer on and off.
                    <span>Recently, the error 0xc000000e started appearing whenever I try to boot. While the computer is in the error state, no USB devices function (including any keyboard I try in any USB port), so all I could do was turn the computer on and off.
<br />
<br />
Here's a picture of the error: </span>http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=b9a5310f-5cf6-4318-a79e-378ce1c5c628
<span><br />
<span><br />
<br />
I eventually remedied the error once by unplugging one of my hard drives (not the one with my system partition on it), which worked for some unknown reason, but now every time I boot the computer I have to either unplug or plug in the drive, which is very annoying
 as I have to partially disassemble the case every time to do this. If I don't do this, the 0xc000000e error happens.
<br />
<br />
I need a way to fix this error permanently. Please help!</span>

            <p>&nbsp;I just bought a new Asus ROG ZX50VW-MS71 laptop running Windows 10.&nbsp; The program must have came pre-installed on the laptop.&nbsp; I occasionally get a pop up with NW.JS in the center but nothing else - I can't see where to open or access anything in the pop
 up?!&nbsp; I close out the window and it goes away.&nbsp; I looked on the control panel and there is no program listed under either name.&nbsp; I ran the program De-**** My Computer and it did not find it.&nbsp; When I search my C drive, I can't find it.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>I found this on the internet and it made me wonder if it had anything to do with Windows 10 "apps.":</p>
NW.js (previously known as node-webkit) lets you call all Node.js modules directly from DOM and enables a new way of writing applications with all Web technologies.

<h2>            Windows 8 Full Version</h2>
                    How can I return the Windows 8 Upgrade download including Backup DVD that I purchased from Upgrade Assistant so I can buy the system builder version from Newegg to avoid having to reinstall Windows 7 every time I wipe the entire track zero of the drive?&nbsp;
 What if the Windows 7 DVD cracks in the center hole and shatters in the DVD drive during reinstallation of the DVD.&nbsp; The center hole can wear out every time the DVD is inserted or removed from the packaging.&nbsp; The DVD could crack&nbsp;radially if spun at high speeds
 due to wear on the center hole from too many insertion/removal cycles on the&nbsp;retail package.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I doubt you will be able to return that version, especially since you have activated it.<br />
<br />
However you can download Windows 7 and make a DVD so you are ready to use<br />
it as needed (see below).<br />
<br />
And if you use these&nbsp;it is likely you will never need to have the disk (though it would
<br />
be wise to have it on hand).<br />
<br />
Windows 8 includes special methods to Refresh (keep files and settings)&nbsp;or a&nbsp;Reset
<br />
(new install removing all).<br />

    <title>GTA San Andreas Loading Saved Game Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ooanesthesiaoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            GTA San Andreas Loading Saved Game Problem</h2>
                    
<p>I've tried looking up this problem and tried many solutions and now I am at lost at what to do.</p>
<p>I'm at the point in the game where when I save it, it is saved under the name "Doberman". I cannot remember the last mission's name or the next one. It's at the point where I was able to finally claim gang territories and after that mission, that's all I've
 been doing. I saved after claiming almost half of the gang territories in CJ's original house last night and today, I was not able to load it. When trying to load the game, the bar will go all the way to about 98% then just freeze. You can't pull up the Xbox
 menu or anything. Usually, the bar never goes to full, it'll stop at 98%, the bar will disappear then a few seconds later, the game will load. Well, with this save, it will go to 98%, disappear and just stay at the picture loading screen.</p>
<p>Looking up this problem all over the web, I've only been able to find problems with either not being able to start the game at all or not being able to play a mission. I couldn't find many answers about not being able to load a saved game. I also just found
 that this game for the 360 has many issues but I had no issues before this one.</p>
<p>Steps I took to troubleshoot: Cleared my game cache. Uninstall from game details page and reinstalled. Uninstalled from Storage Settings and reinstalled. Copied my save game data to a flash drive before all this of course. Cleared my system update file and
 reinstalled the system update then reinstalled GTA an additional time. I also tried loading the game from my hard drive and my usb flash drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can play a whole new game, but the fact that I put in hours on this game already and can't play it, *** me off. I even saved the game in two different slots just in case and both games in the slots won't play from either the hard drive nor the flash drive.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated. It feels like I've tried everything and nothing has worked.</p>

<p>I was reading on Rockstars website here is the link &gt; <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/communities/public/questions/203596686-GTA-San-Andreas-Remastered-Crashing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.rockstargames.com/.../203596686-GTA-San-Andreas-Remastered-Crashing</a> &nbsp;. &nbsp; &nbsp;all i could say is try turning off the autosave on the game.
</p>
<p>This is what someone wrote on there website</p>
<p>I managed to get past it! Don't know what i did exactly, but here's everything i tried.</p>
<p>I reset my cache</p>
<p>I walked to the checkpoint, met sweet then it crashed again.</p>
<p>Out of the six save slots 1&amp;2 had home coming saved the rest were blank, so i saved to slots 3&amp;4, turned off my xbox then loaded Gta again and instead of loading the autosave or slots 1&amp;2 i manually loaded slot 3 which i had just saved.</p>
<p>Upon starting the mission there was normally 2 cars on the driveway to take, but the time it worked there was only 1 (The classic Mercedes looking vehicle, furthest from you next to the wall and out of the 2 cars the one in front) so i used that and drove
 slowly to each checkpoint. SUCCESS! Finally.</p>
<p>I hope this helps some of you, good luck guys!</p>
<p>I hope this helps,this game is kinda old so i dont think rockstar will fix anything anytime soon</p>

<p>Would you know how to turn off autosave? I've tried looking in all of the options and can't find it anywhere.</p>
<p>I also can't do the suggested solution because I can't load the game at all so I can't blow up any cars. I can start a new game, but can't execute the solution because of differences in where the game is at that point. I did try a new game and tried blowing
 stuff up and saving it then tried loading it either from the game or restarting my Xbox and loading it from the start screen. But to no avail.
</p>
<p>I also tried clearing my cache again, deleting the Title Update, tuned off Xbox live, started the game and tried loading it but still freezing.
</p>
<p>I'm guessing I might just have to start all over again. </p>
<p>Which is completely stupid, after buying a game, you expect it to work and be able to play with no problems.
</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h3> bob is interested  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network cards and Windows 7&#58;  Are a lot of cards not compatible with Win7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I plugged in several old network cards and not one is working.&nbsp; One was recognized by Win7 but in System Information, Problem Devices, it says "This device cannot start".&nbsp; So helpful.&nbsp; Of course the troubleshooter is useless.&nbsp; I wonder if that thing ever
 helps anybody anywhere in the world.&nbsp; The last 50 times I've used it, it was a resounding no.&nbsp; Could anything in Services.msc be stopping it from starting I wonder?&nbsp; My network connection works great when used off the motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I wondered if the problem may be just a driver issue because this is such old hardware.&nbsp; I used Windows Update to see if there was anything available but there wasn't.&nbsp; In Device Manager they aren't even recognized.&nbsp; I thought they'd at least be recognized
 and I'd be told that there was a problem but that isn't even happening.&nbsp; Its like they're invisible and they're plugged into PCI slots.&nbsp; Another problem with these cards is that they are often generically made with no discernible model on them to find a possible
 driver for.&nbsp; If I was an expert in LAN cards I could probably get a model from the name on the chips being used.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's probably what you will need to do... Look up drivers for the chip, if there is no other Manufacturer's Identification or Model Number...</p>
<p>Regardless of who made the card, the drivers are primarily for the "Chip" anyway...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose that if the cards are old enough they will not work on a more modern machine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... sometimes they can be found under Hidden Devices in Device Manager... Click on the "View" tab...</p>

<p>Wow, I've never looked at hidden devices on this page.&nbsp; Normally I always have options like that displayed.&nbsp; Missed that.&nbsp; Great suggestion.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see Microsoft ISATAP Adapter listed.&nbsp; Below that 8 Wan Miniports.&nbsp; These look software related so probably not important.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I'll hunt down that chip name.&nbsp; Also have a sound card that stopped the computer from starting when plugged into its PCI slot but then, when I moved it to another slot the computer started, after a delay.&nbsp; Its not recognized but&nbsp; once again, its old
 and may not have Win7 drivers.&nbsp; Its comical really....I'm using an old OS and still its not old enough to be compatible with still older hardware!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an old Asus DDR2 type motherboard with 6 audio jacks.&nbsp; Most are for surround sound which I don't use.&nbsp; Does anyone know if its possible to re-assign one of those jacks as a 2nd audio output?&nbsp; I want to have speakers and headphones connected but as
 I don't have front headphone jack connections for the motherboard or case I have to plug and unplug the speakers/headphones using the Line Out jack.&nbsp; Any way I can do something in the registry?&nbsp; Must be a driver that is controlling which plug is used for what.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might take a look at this for the Wan Miniports... One may be what you are looking for... This is for Win 10, but would apply to 7 as well..</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/4w45ds/where_did_all_these_wan_miniports_come_from_is_it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/4w45ds/where_did_all_these_wan_miniports_come_from_is_it/</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a clue as to how a Audio output could be configured from another port...&nbsp; Unless maybe you have a Auxiliary port as well..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do know that headphone speakers can be used as a microphone when plugged into the Microphone plug, but I doubt the Microphone could be used for speakers...</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you might try is to use a splitter of some type to furnish two audio plugs...</p>
<p>If both the headphone and speaker are both plugged in at the same time, it would reduce the power output to each a little...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might even be able to find a splitter with a switch to use one or the other, or both.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>I can't have both on at the same time so a splitter won't work.&nbsp; Externally one option would be a 1/8" style switch.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I realize I don't need to worry about a myriad of miniports.&nbsp; As technology changes they need to offer connecting solutions and also need to be able to connect to older components using older technology.&nbsp; So there are a bunch of connections there.&nbsp; No
 worries.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I found one PCI Realtek RTL8139/810x Family Fast Ethernet NIC seems to be recognized.&nbsp; Device Manager says its working fine.&nbsp; But even when I've tried to plug in the same LAN cable (and another one) it keeps on saying "network cable unplugged".&nbsp; Huh?
 How could it not detect the cable being plugged in if its recognized as being installed?&nbsp; I've tried plugging and unplugging.&nbsp; Normally a light comes on and it did momentarily then no more.&nbsp; I've restarted the computer a couple of times.&nbsp; Don't you just love
 hardware installs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any problem with having 2 LAN cables from the router going to the built in LAN jack on the motherboard and a PCI network card?&nbsp; I also tried it with just one to make sure but it still wasn't recognized.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I noticed about the miniports was that one of them that was listed was a connection to a PPoE… Which would be a DSL Modem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess with the ReakTek is that it has a bad connection internally in the card or in the plug... It's chip can be recognized by Device Manager, but the chip can still not recognize the cable due to a bad\dirty socket or other failed internal circuitry..</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't have two connections... You need to choose which connection to use...</p>
<p>You can have multiple connections going to the same router from multiple machines but not the same computer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a setup similar to what you describe except that I was having issues with the internal motherboard connection... I added a PCI network adapter that is of a higher speed rating... They both show up as a available Network Connection, but only one can
 be used... The one with the cable plugged in...</p>

    <title>Memory leak &#40;unknown driver - 100&#37; memory&#47;disk usage&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Memory leak &#40;unknown driver - 100&#37; memory&#47;disk usage&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go straight to the problem: My laptop's memory (or sometimes its disk) reaches 100% of utilization just about one hour after I turn it on. From that point on, my laptop becomes slow and finally turns off the screen and I have to restart it. I don't run
 anything but Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched different forums and communities for a solution. It looks like it is a memory leak, so I installed Windows Kits and then used the
<em><strong>poolmon.exe</strong></em> tool to find which processes are eating my RAM. First, I identified that my SATA AHCI Controller driver is eating up the memory and so updated it. That resolved the issue. But after a few days, the problem reappeared.&nbsp;</p>
<br />
This time it was not the SATA AHCI Controller driver. Again, I used poolmon.exe to find the process tag that eats the memory. The process tag was "MmCa". Using
<em>findstr </em>command in the <em>drivers</em> folder, I identified the following files that contain the tag MmCa:<br />
<br />
<em>exfat.sys,&nbsp;fastfat.sys,&nbsp;ntfs.sys,&nbsp;portcls.sys,&nbsp;rdbss.sys,&nbsp;refsv1.sys,&nbsp;savonaccess.sys,&nbsp;udfs.sys</em><br />
<br />
However, I could not find which hardware driver(s) are related to these files and so could not update that driver. I checked the details of each of the above files and searched for a driver update for them, but I could not find anything.<br />
<br />
Some details: I upgraded to Windows 10 last year. No problem at all until I tried to upgrade it to the Anniversary Upgrade. The upgrade failed and then this issue started to appear.<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated. I essentially cannot use my laptop for an extended period of time (more than 1 hour).

            <p>Hi Monica,</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows 10 Anniversary update failed to install on my computer. I had explained the problem with Anniversary update
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/failed-windows-10-anniversary-update-at-40-iis/d70f3ae7-bd74-4c89-8690-3e40b2741434">
here</a>.</li><li>There is no Flash drive connected to my computer, but I use an external monitor which is connected to my laptop via HDMI port.</li><li>Yes; I get an error message when the memory usage gets close to 90%. The error wants me to close the programs and if I don't, it starts to disable them automatically. However, I don't get any error message when the disk utilization hits 100%.</li><li>I have already run sfc /scannow and also used the DSIM tool. Those tools have not detected any violation, missing, or corrupted system file.</li></ul>
<p>I appreciate your support.<br />

            <p>The issue has reappeared for the past few weeks. I have already disabled all the startup services (except DrobBox, Dell display manager, and DW WLAN Card Wireless). However, and Once every few days, the memory usage or disk utilization jumps to 100%. Do
 you think DropBox or Dell display manager is causing the issue?&nbsp;</p>

<h3> maxipes6  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update - Folder Icon</h2>
                    <p>Good day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a clean installation of Windows 10 x64 Anniversary Update I found that if you copy the folder in which I have set a different icon (the icon is either from shell32.dll or imageres.dll) as the default, so I copied over the default settings icon.&nbsp;New
 folder contains in itself Desktop.ini file in which I see that my chosen icon assigned. The problem is that after copying the folder will change the attributes and when they manually change the read-only, so the icon is now set back to mine.&nbsp;<br />
I just any copy of the folder icon anywhere and will not be set on or after restarting my PC.&nbsp;When moving a folder icon will remain unchanged. The problem I was in no previous Windows (7,8/8.1, 10 without Anniversary Update).</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. - Sorry for my bad English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your answers and advice</p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem. I did a fresh install of windows 10 Anniversary edition on 3 different Laptops and the issue is consistent.
</p>
<p>The issue is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If i have set an icon for my folder, when I copy it to another location, the icon is reset to the default one.</p>
<p>2. Also when I copy hidden folders to another location, they become visible and read only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically the folder Attributes are not getting copied along with the folder.</p>

<h2>            Why I can&#39;t Install an get to work iTunes 64 bits on my Windows 10 AU Laptop&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hello People. Since I updated my Laptop to Windows 10 Anniversary Update, I have severe problems to connect to WiFi so I had to do a RESET to my System and the Connection to WiFi was Fixed. Now when I tried to Install the latest version of iTunes 64 bits,
 which was working perfectly before I did the RESET, now it won't let me Open itunes. It will install with the error:<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>HS: 0x80073715</strong></span> and it will not Open. I have follow instructions fron this site
 and other sites but nothing seems to work?. Any ideas on how to solve this problem and get iTunes working as before the RESET??. Thanks a lot.... Aaron...

Thank you Krishna. I resolved the issue by downloading from Microsoft Download Center: Visual C ++ 2005 Redistr. 64 + Visual C ++2008 Redistr. 64 + Visual C ++ 2010 Redistr. 64. Then erase all Apple products fron my Laptop using Control Center and from C://windows/data.
 Downloaded a fresh copy of iTunes 64 from Apple website and VOILA it works flawlessly and permanently. Aaron....

<h2>            How Do You Change &#47; Set Parameters for &#34;Junk Mail&#34; Selection in Windows Live Mail&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Several times I have had problems with Windows Live Mail 2011 automatically routing mail that I wanted to receive to "junk mail".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In going through settings I couldn't find how to access and change parameters for selection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the mail that was routed automatically to junk was common cellphone mail servers such as gmail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But today I saw an email with an attached proposal on my cellphone (cellphone is setup for IMAP to leave emails on server). Then when I returned home to my desktop, to download and print the MS Word proposal ; I couldn't find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking further I found it in "junk mail" on my desktop computer. The email with proposal was from an address that was a companyname.com. I can't think of any reason it was automatically routed to "junk mail".</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Blank Desktop</h2>
                    <p>My desktop sometimes (once or multiple times per day, then several days with no recurrence at all) will appear blank. &nbsp;No icons, tool bars, just blank. &nbsp;sometimes my mouse cursor shows up and responds to mouse, but to no avail since nothing to click on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This only happens when the computer has been sitting idle for a short time, when I "wake up" the monitor I get a blank desktop. &nbsp;Only way to get out of it is to power down and up. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand you are having issue with desktop icons. They disappear when you leave the computer idle for some time.
</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>Did you make any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</li></ol>
<p>This issue may occur due to one or more of the following reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>Software issue.</li><li>Missing or corrupted system files.</li><li>Missing update.</li><li>Damaged or corrupted drivers.</li></ul>
<p>You can try the below methods and check if that helps.</p>
<p>Method 1.</p>
<p>Run the Power Troubleshooter. The Power troubleshooter checks things like your computer's timeout settings, which determine how long the computer waits before turning off the monitor display or entering sleep mode.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Power-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Power-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p>If issue persists, then try method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2.</p>
<p>Try to put the system in clean boot. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1. It starts Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.<br />
How to perform a clean boot in Windows: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" in the above link.</p>
<p>If issue persists, then try method 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3.</p>
<p>Try updating the video card drivers. You can refer to the section “To update and install a driver yourself”:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly#update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly#update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly=windows-7</a></p>

                    Reminder for those using older builds of Skype on Macs - the easiest way to update to Skype version 8 is to go to
<a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.skype.com/download</a> to get the latest version of Skype or manually check for updates on your device. If you don't, you might see a message which says "Unfortunately Skype
 is not available right now."&nbsp;

    <title>Can&#39;t connect to external display after Windows 10 download - - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to external display after Windows 10 download - Lenovo Yoga&#47;Windows 10&#47;Intel HD Graphics</h2>
                    <p>I recently downloaded Windows 10 (from Windows 8) on my Lenovo Yoga laptop in the last month or two, and quickly realized that I couldn't connect to an external display. I never had problems before I made the switch to Windows 10. After opening device manager,
 the display adapter driver "Intel HD Graphics Family" is giving me the generic Code 43: "Windows has stopped the device because it has reported problems."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had driver version 10.18.15.4240 installed on my machine, and attempted to search for new driver updates. It gets to the installation phase and then I get a notification telling me "WIndows encountered a problem installing the driver software for your
 device. Windows found driver software for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install it." After I close out of that window, I now have driver version 20.19.15.4312 and I still have Code 43 when I look at the driver details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other things I have tried: I have rolled back to an older version and it did not fix the problem. I reinstalled Windows 10 and that did not fix the problem.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Satchmon,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your concern. Let me help you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I appreciate your time and effort trying to fix the issue. Let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps in resolving the issue. Follow the below methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I recommend you to uninstall/reinstall the display adapter driver and check. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and click on <strong>
Device manager</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Locate for <strong>display adapter</strong> and click on it to expand.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the <strong>device </strong>and click on <strong>
uninstall</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once you are done uninstalling the driver, restart the computer. It will automatically install the generic display adapter driver.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persist, I suggest you to install the display driver in compatibility mode and check if this helps.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right-click on the setup file of the driver and select<strong> Properties</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check Run this program in <strong>Compatibility mode</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If that does not help, I recommend you to contact Intel support team for further assistance.<span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Let us know the result. </p>

            Why do I smell a rat ?<br />
At first I thought -&nbsp; malware/spyware, but...<br />
Does the message specify who should be doing this service ?<br />
Did you buy the machine from these same people ?<br />
What do the people who do this 'service' tell you about this environmental safety
<br />
problem, and if the message<span style="font-style: italic"> was</span> caused by malware why did they not remove the malware ?<br />
<br />
If they cannot answer these questions find another PC shop to deal with and report them
<br />
to the consumer authorities for installing software (malware of a sort) that is fraudulently
<br />
telling you it needs this service.<br />

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. I will certainly help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Did you select the all files while renaming a file name?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to inform you that in Windows you can also rename several files at one time, which is useful for grouping related items. To do this, select the files, and then follow the steps above. Type one name, and then each of the files will be saved
 with the new name and a different sequential number at the end (for example, Renamed File (2), Renamed File (3), and so on).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Unfortunately once the file name changed, the original name can’t be reverted automatically. In that scenario you need to manually rename that file.
</span></p>
