<h2>            MCEP with offline install&#47;update</h2>
                    I have MCEP installed on an offline 32bit copy of Windows 7 Prof.&nbsp; When I try to update it using the nis_full.exe (downloaded separately and ran from the HD), it acts like it works, but it never updates the application.&nbsp; I'm missing a setting somewhere
 as the application, when you click Update, heads to the Internet which is not accessible..&nbsp; Any idea?&nbsp; Thanks.

<p>Thank you but you didn't answered my question. The article you provided only explains how it works, not how I disable that option, and I never asked you to explain how to recover emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll make it clear: I want it not be there anymore. When I empty my dumpster, I want my deleted messages to away. I don't want to enter in the 'Recover Deleted Items' and select the option empty folder again. I want to empty my dumpster folder and that's
 it. I don't want it go 'Recover Deleted Items' folder, I don't want that folder to exist, I don't want that option to be in there. I thought I explained that.&nbsp; The question was to archive this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please if you don't know how to answer my question, limit yourself to the question only.</p>

            Dear Roni ,
<br />
<br />In order to answer question I need to understand what exactly you mean. That is why I asked the question in the first place.
<br />
<br />As for your request - it is not possible. First of all Deleted items is a system folder and cannot be deleted or disabled permanently. If for some reason system folder will be missing, your account will not work properly and you will not be able to use it.
<br />
<br />If you do not want to go to deleted items you can log here <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/handling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/mail/hand...</a> and enable option to empty deleted items folder when signing out.
<br />
<br />If you are still unhappy with the limitations of functionality in Outlook.com all I can suggest is to leave your feedback to developers here <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/</a>

<p>Thank you. I kinda new it was not possible to disable. I wish I could stay in the old version of Outlook instead of this crap.
</p>
<p>So I have to say congratulations Microsoft for making my life even worse; now I have two different dumpster to handle individually.</p>
<p>Microsoft never cease in amaze me in how futile and crap their service can become. I think its time to move on to google.</p>

            Dear Roni ,
<br />
<br />I am sorry that you feel like that, but I am also a user like you. I am just sharing my experience. Microsoft does release new updates for Outlook.com from time to time so it is inevitable.
<br />
<br />It might be hard to adjust to new UI, but you can try to adjust to new UI (it took me a while). New UI has new features and "supposedly" is better than classic version, but it is harder to navigate, especially after classic version. In this article <a href="https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/get-help-with-the-outlook-com-beta-fa2e5110-fa17-4b3b-88c8-87812230a048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/get-he...</a> you will find lots of suggestions on how to use new UI.
<br />
<br />New UI also has a feature that allows you to export your mailbox <a href="https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/export" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.live.com/mail/options/general/e...</a>

            <p>Not sure what you mean by RT format. The Zune software is how you put content on WP7 - except it can't be used for books.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can access your Kindle books using the Kindle app on your phone -&nbsp;on your phone open the Kindle app and tap&nbsp;Archived items&nbsp;to see all&nbsp;the Kindle books that you've bought. Tap and hold a book then choose Download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br />
I have been participating in the Windows Insider program for the past few months, it's been working great and recently I have upgraded my computer (new motherboard, new CPU, etc.)<br />
How can I keep using the Windows 10 license on my new computer? I will NOT be using the old computer anymore.<br />

            <p>Not sure you can. The license is for the life of the device and when you change the motherboard that is a new device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a retail copy of Windows 7 or 8 then you can install and upgrade. Or just clean install build 10586 and use the key. (or you could use a new OEM)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Windows 10 still installed on our hard drive then you could try connecting that and see if it activates, if not ring customer services and plead your case.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2010 with GoDaddy - IMAP folders stopped auto syncing</h2>
                    <p>Around Sept 10, 2015 all of our PCs configured for IMAP email thru GoDaddy stopped syncing automatically at their set time intervals.&nbsp; The manual Send/Receive function doesn't work either.&nbsp; The only way to get new email is to manually select any folder&nbsp;other
 than the Inbox and then switch back to the Inbox. </p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the configuration settings are correct&nbsp;and have&nbsp;been re-checked numerous time. I have created new Outlook profiles and recreated the email accounts&nbsp;all with no success.&nbsp; I've restored Windows 7 back to a time before the problem started with no success.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few PC's still run POP3 email thru GoDaddy and they are fine. The problem is only with the 6 PC's using the IMAP protocol. All of the PC's are running Outlook 2010 under Win 7 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone having a similar problem?</p>

            <p>GoDaddy support is of little help with their legacy products.&nbsp; Their response is always the same....&nbsp;If you can see the email message using their webmail&nbsp;then there's no further support. &nbsp;No support whatsoever for email clients even when the evidence supports
 that they're involved.</p>

            <p>Yes! I have been having the identical problem since roughly the same time. It's affecting at least 10 different users. Some of them are mobile users, so I've ruled out any internal network issue.<br />
GoDaddy initially suggested it might be affecting accounts that were "too large" in their opinion. However, the file size of the account is irrelevant because I have one user whose email I created a few weeks ago and has only 40 messages in their inbox. They
 are experiencing the same problem.</p>
<p>When you select another folder and come back to the inbox, Outlook does a&nbsp;"updating cached messages" (visible briefly in the status bar) to compare the number of messages locally vs. the GoDaddy server. This seems to trigger Outlook to download/display the
 new messages. A regular Send/Receive doesn't work.<br />
I have tried setting up the same account using IMAP with a different email client. Opera Mail has the same effect. The Check All button (similar to Outlook's Send/Receive) will not download the new messages waiting on the mail server. Opera Mail has a Resynchronize
 All Messages option. I'm assuming this is similar to Outlook's "updating cached messages", because this option will force Opera Mail to download the new messages. I have yet to find a button or option in Outlook to trigger the "updating cached messages" without
 navigating away from and back to the Inbox.</p>
<p>If I make any progress on the issue, I'll be sure to post it here.</p>

<h2>            Why does MSE require the DCOM service for it to update &#91;definitions&#93; properly&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I am running Windows XP with all the lastest SP and windows updates.&nbsp; I also have MSE and keep it up-to-date.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>A day ago I disabled the DCOM by following the info at this link (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/825750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/825750</a>) and then disabled the "DCOM Server Process Launcher" from the services tool.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Now my Windows MSE won't update , and I get an error when I try to do so.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have since undid the DCOM disabling and re-enabled the service, and now MSE works fine (it updates now).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So my question is, why does MSE require the DCOM service to run, as I'd like to disable unneccessary services to close TCP/IP listening ports and improve my computers sercurity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>R.</p>

            In the article you mentioned (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/825750" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/825750</a>), it is clearly mentioned:<br />
<br />
<i><b>Warning:</b> If you disable DCOM, may you may lose operating system functionality. After you disable support for DCOM, the following may result:</i>
<ul>
<li><i>Any COM objects that can be started remotely may not function correctly.</i></li><li><i>The local COM+ snap-in will not be able to connect to remote servers to enumerate their COM+ catalog.</i></li><li><i>Certificate auto-enrollment may not function correctly.</i></li><li><i>Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) queries against remote servers may not function correctly.</i></li></ul>
<p><i>There are potentially many built-in components and 3rd party applications that will be affected if you disable DCOM. Microsoft does not recommend that you disable DCOM in your environment until you have tested to discover what applications are affected.
 Disabling DCOM may not be workable in all environments.</i></p>
<br />
<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials share a pipeline through Windows Update for getting its updates. WMI has a role in Windows Update functioning and disabling DCOM hinders functioning of WMI, as stated above. Don't be so "over-caring" about your PC security that
 you alter Windows functioning.<br />

            I think you mean Datasheet view, not database view and that the things that don't match are the field names on the datasheet header.&nbsp; If that's the question, check the table design for the Caption property of each field.&nbsp; You probably want to clear out
 any Captions that are not empty.

<h2>            Access 2010 - Cant export report to excel using runtime version.</h2>
                    <p>I have two machines, one running the full version of Office 2010 and the other machine is running&nbsp;Access Runtime 2010 with SP1 + SP2 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have one .adp file which has a custom ribbon; when the user is previewing a report, they can export the report to Excel by using a button I have added to the ribbon - the button uses the built-in command to export the report to Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine with the full version of Office 2010 manages to do this successfully and no errors are observed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When running the exact same report from the exact same .adp file and exporting to the exact same excel format - I get the error -&gt; &nbsp;"The format in which you are attempting to output the current object is not available".&nbsp; It doesn't matter what version of
 excel I try to export to (and I'm not worried about not having the ability to export to XLSX) - I always get the same error.&nbsp; For information purposes, I have Excel 2002 installed on the machine that errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this was a problem within Access 2007 which was fixed in SP2 - why am I getting this using the runtime version of Access 2010 though - and more importantly is there a way round this that exactly replicates what the Export to Excel is trying to
 achieve.</p>

<p>
</p><p>you're right. The new design doesn't work on an old WinXP machine that has IE8. No problem with IE10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So they force to abandon XP prematuraly as there's still &gt;1 month of support.&nbsp;;-)&nbsp;Ok, to be fair many other websites do the same already&nbsp;for years.</p>

</p><p>BTW Dear friends at MS: Can it be that you messed the Reply box up with your "improvement" last night? It's incredibly tiny and almost unusable now.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>The runtime version I am running is v14.0.7104 - so it is already up-to-date with SP2.&nbsp; So if I understand the improvement in SP1 correctly, it doesn't alter the fact that I cant output a report to Excel.<br />
<br />
I have decided to remove the functionality altogether as there doesn't look like an easy fix/workaround.<br />

    <title>Where are &#34;Layout Options&#34; in Word for Mac&#63; I do not see - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maggiebrit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where are &#34;Layout Options&#34; in Word for Mac&#63; I do not see them under File &#62; Preferences &#40;Mac&#39;s &#34;Word Options&#34;&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>I'm having difficulty with the Paragraph setting "Space before" at the top of a table cell. The setting is there, but the space doesn't show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found the solution online (http://wordribbon.tips.net/T006015_Getting_the_Expected_Space_Before_a_Heading.html), but I cannot find where to make the necessary change to "Layout Options." In MS, it is under File &gt; Word Options &gt; Advanced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Word for Mac 2016 (15.19.1). I understand that in Mac I look under File &gt; Preferences, but I cannot find the "Layout Options" anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>The article you're referencing indicates in the Note at its very start that it pertains to Word 2007, 2010, &amp; 2013, all of which are versions for the Windows OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Word 2011 &amp; earlier for Mac [most of] those settings were available in <strong>
Word&gt; Preferences&gt; Compatibility</strong>. (<em>Preferences</em> on a Mac are the approximate equivalent of
<em>Options</em> in Windows programs.) Those Compatibility Preferences do not exist in Mac Word 2016. I'm not sure why those settings were excised, but the bottom line is that they are gone... whether they were retained in Word 2016 for Windows I have no idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I don't recall any of those settings having to do with space before <em>
first</em> paragraphs in Table cells. Allen's article focuses on how Word treats that formatting attribute when a paragraph to which it is applied immediately follows a Page Break or a Column Break, especially when applied to Headings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The basic settings for Space Before/After Paragraphs are in the <strong>Paragraph</strong> group on the
<strong>Layout</strong> tab of the Ribbon. Those as well as additional settings can be found in the
<strong>Format&gt; Paragraph</strong> dialog, but you may also have to check the Properties of the Table, itself. From what I can tell here, when using default settings, Space Before applied to the first para in a table cell most definitely is apparent. E.g.,<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/956fcb87-fd32-48d6-bf72-c75c544415d8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/956fcb87-fd32-48d6-bf72-c75c544415d8" /></a></p>

</p><p>If you can't resolve it, please provide a screen shot along with a more detailed description... A link to a sample file shared on a cloud would be even better.</p>

            <p>Hi Ted,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my experience, by clicking File&gt; Print after opening the meeting, the basic information will show automatically in the preview page.
</p>
<p>If there are no attendees, the <strong>Required Attendees&nbsp;</strong>row will not show in the preview page.
</p>
<ol>
Here is a screenshot of the preview page in my side:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17d6d4b6-f7dd-4658-83e5-e80444c4ea05" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/17d6d4b6-f7dd-4658-83e5-e80444c4ea05" /></a></ol>
<p>So If there are attendees in your meeting but not show in the print preview page. I would&nbsp;like&nbsp;to collect the following&nbsp;information for further analyzing:</p>
<ol>
<li>A screenshot of the meeting details including the attendees.</li><li>Another screenshot of&nbsp;no attendees in the print preview page.</li></ol>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Amanda&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Skype name is the best information you can provide to your contacts so they will be able to search for you on&nbsp;Skype. There are two options on how you can check the Skype name of your account. You can either do
<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
password reset</a> or go to the Purchase history page of your account in the website. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<span>Sign&nbsp;in to </span>
<span>Scroll down and look for
<strong><span>Account details</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>Under<strong><span>Billing and payments</span></strong>, select
<strong><span>Purchase history</span></strong>.</span></li><li>
<span>You will see your Skype name on the top right corner of the Purchase history.</span></li></ol>
<span>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

            <p>the insiders and regular users are receiving exactly the same updates at the moment as insider builds are on hold. So, you will NOT be receiving 'insider' specific things.</p>
<p>You CANNOT turn off auto updates in win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In settings, update and security, click advanced, if there is an option to GET insider builds, you are NOT in the insider program. If there is an option to STOP insider builds - you ARE in the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates - especially the cumulative one(s) are failing on many machines. MS needs to sort that out.</p>
<p>Machines with AMD chipsets or processors appear to be an issue, but many other things can cause it that MS have obviously not tracked down yet.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I too am getting an update titled "Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro", but it&nbsp;tried to install the Insider Preview, which I never requested. I canceled it,&nbsp;went to Windows Update and hid that update, then clicked on the "Get Window 10" icon to try to restart it,
 but it failed with code C1900208. Restarting again, it shows the "downloading" screen, but it never finishes (10 hours later). When I click on "view progress" I get the Windows Update screen saying there are no updates.</p>
<p>Will I get the correct update? DO I have to manually install Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. My&nbsp;system drive&nbsp;is a SATA&nbsp;SSD connected to&nbsp;a PCIe slot via an Apricorn adapter.</p>

    <title>In the Notebook feature of Word, how do I add multiple notes and put - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hannahrudder  say:</h3>
<h2>            In the Notebook feature of Word, how do I add multiple notes and put them in the same tab&#63;</h2>
                    I want to add a note for every lecture that I have to take notes on so that they each have their own title and date but I would like to keep them all in the same tabs (the tabs that are on the right hand side that you can change the colors and names of).
 I have tried to do it and when I open a new note my tabs aren't still on there it just says "section 1", "section 2", and "section 3" rather than "Geography" and "Psychology" that I had changed them to. I am not sure if this is possible but it would really
 help me if it was. If it is not, then what is the purpose of the tabs?

<p>I have 16gigs of RAM and only ever since I upgraded to OFICE 2016 is it difficult to mouse from cell to cell. Excel just acts crappy. Clicking from cell to cell is slow or stuttered or just cant plain make it move without using the arrow keys.</p>
<p>Sorry I was forced to upgrade.</p>

<h2>            Sync contacts with GMail on C7-00</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am having problem syncing my phone (C7-00) contacts with gmail. After configuring the mailbox, if I have to send a new mail, I am not able to see any contacts available. The only option that did work was to add an e-mail address to a contact. This is very
 tedious... One cant be expected to manually enter email address for each contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there some way wherein gmail contacts get automatically synced with the phone contacts...???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> cherche  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Outlook.com &#40;Hotmail&#41; sign-in page &#58; Autofill&#47;Autocomplete not working&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Today a <strong>new style of sign-in page</strong> appeared for Outlook.com (Hotmail) — and
<strong>autofill/autocomplete doesn't work for the e-mail address field!</strong><br />
<br />
I have several e-mail addresses, and until now I've only needed to enter the first letter to get the dropdown list. Now there's no dropdown list. I have to type the full e-mail address each time I sign in. As I often switch between accounts, and you have to
 sign out of one to be able to sign in to another, this loss of autofill is very frustrating and time-wasting.<br />
<br />
It's not a browser-related problem: it happens in 3 different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, IE).
</p>
<p>It's not computer-related: it happens on 3 different computers. </p>
<p>It happens only with the Outlook.com (Hotmail) sign-in. On other websites, autofill still works for e-mail address fields.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only assume that Microsoft's developers have blocked autofill/autocomplete on this new sign-in page.&nbsp;If this is a deliberate choice, then
<strong>why?</strong> It's extremely annoying and time-wasting. If it's just a mistake, I hope that MS will correct it very quickly.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else discovered the problem? &nbsp;Does anyone have a solution or a workaround?</p>

<p>Hi Syed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion. I've tried entering one of my addresses manually eight times. Still no sign of autocomplete reappearing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've mentioned this to a couple of friends who use Outlook.com. &nbsp;They also can't get autocomplete to appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks as though the problem is affecting everyone, and that something needs fixing on that sign-in page.</p>

            <p>This is the same problem they had the last time Outlook was changed. &nbsp; Harshavardhan Rathod a moderator for MS tried to evade the problem by asking about what Outlook was running and on what platform. &nbsp;This is a developers error and it took a few weeks before
 MS acknowledged the issue.</p>

            <p><strong>Cross-posted with Syed's last post (please also see my next post):</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In case anyone in Microsoft thinks this problem is unimportant, please consider the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main reason that Outlook.com and all other e-mail systems have a Contacts list is to avoid the tedious typing of e-mail addresses every time. That would be very time-wasting and, as JimPZP has said, would result in frequent typos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sign-in autocomplete does exactly the same for one's own e-mail address(es).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The disappearance of the&nbsp;sign-in autocomplete is akin to removing the Contacts function. If Contacts suddenly stopped working, how long would it take MS to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Might I suggest that the same urgency be attached to this problem with the sign-in page (especially as it's probably a simple mistake that would take two minutes to fix).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could Syed, or any forum moderator or other MS representative, please escalate this problem to the people responsible — and let us know that that's been done?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Reformatting calendar&#59; removing creator name from appointments</h2>
                    We recently upgraded from Office 2003 to Office 2010.&nbsp; I found two changes that I would like to reformat - combining Sat/Sun in one column to optimize the size of the weekdays on a monthly calendar and 2- eliminating the creator's name from appointments
 printed on the calendar.

            They had to drop the compressed weekends as the overlay doesn't support it (and they could not make it work) - this was introduced in Outlook 2007 and they are aware that some people want it back (along with the week planner view that is also gone, for
 the same reason).

<p>Neither are possible in Outlook 2010.</p>
<p>If you use Exchange server, the admin can remove the organizer name from the subject in resource room calendar. See<a href="http://www.slipstick.com/emo/2010/up100325.htm#1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.slipstick.com/emo/2010/up100325.htm#1</a>&nbsp;This does not affect the calendar
 display for users as user's calendars display the organizer name but don't add it to the subject.</p>

    <title>Alcatel Idol freezing every ten minutes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cornelius heinrichs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alcatel Idol freezing every ten minutes</h2>
                    <p>I bought an Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows 10 in December and it ran a few days until it kept freezing and vanishing on every screen or app. If this happens on a Lumia I power it down and on again or, if really bad, take the battery out and back on. Since
 this phone has a non removable battery, the only thing I managed to find out, if I keep the power button pressed until it vibrates, it restarted and gave me another ten minutes before everything collapsed again. A couple of hard resets did not resolve anything.
 So I ended up shipping the phone back and receiving a refund.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a couple of months I decided, instead of buying a phone with Android OS I desise so much, to give the Idol another try. This time it came with blown speakers, so I decided to ship it to Richardson TX to have it repaired. After that it ran smoothly
 - for exactly 10 days. Now after a restart I can open Whatsapp, read the last message, but then everything freezes or shuts down. I am trying to back up everything to hard reset, but this whole thing is tiring me out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this how you treat a loyal WP fan? Is this a hidden plan to make us hate Windows phone as it is phasing out? Can I have my last Windos phone working please????</p>

<p>Hi Cornelius, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this up. We understand how important it is for you to resolve this issue on your Windows phone, so you can use it smoothly. Based on the initial information you’ve provided, there’s a possibility that this issue is caused by the software
 or the hardware components of your device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So we can help you accordingly, allow us to ask some questions. First, we’d like to know the current operating system (OS) build installed on your phone. To check this, kindly go to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>About </strong>&gt; <strong>
More info. </strong>You mentioned that “Now after a restart I can open Whatsapp, read the last message, but then everything freezes or shuts down.” Just to clarify, is the issue only happening when you open the said application? If yes, are you getting any
 error messages? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you still remember if you’ve made any changes on your phone prior to the issue? If yes, please tell us the changes you’ve made on your phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We’re looking forward to your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.<br />
</p>
        </p>

<p>I just did a factory reset. Until then the BTX app said I had the last version. Now it is&nbsp;</p>
<p>Version: 1709</p>
<p>Os compilalation: 10.0.15254.401</p>
<p>Firmware: 1052.16.09031.50700</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can I remember if I made any changes on your phone prior to the issue? The only change I made, after the phone came back from the repair center, I was unable to connect to cellular network. So I contacted TCL support
 and they sent me instructions of how to reset the sim card settings and I made it work. Sadly, in 10 days I had to do it a few times more as it seems to automatically re-unset.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is the issue only happening when I open the said application? No, it is happening all over the system. The camera seems to get the worst part. Just now I launched the camera and I cannot switch between front and rear
 cameras, not turn flash on or off, and I cannot shoot, not even with the physical camera button. The shoot button is partly hidden behind the menu bar.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Photos, Microsoft Edge....everything is crappy. As I mentioned, i just did the factory reset. From my experience in December: I never managed to do a MDRT reset. Only error messages.</span></p>

The phone froze. I have to shut down. But the good bye screens stays on forever unless I keep pressing the power button until it vibrates and then it will restart. Here is what happened after a restart today at about 12:15 PM (mountain standard time).</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
&nbsp;I open FB app, seems to work properly (FB app on Windows 10 is not really good). I open camera with the physical button and it opens, but I cannot take a photo, can not turn flash on or off, can not change between front and main camera. The circle (button)
 on the screen where I would normally tap to take a pic is half hidden behind the menu bar. Everything frozen.&nbsp;I close phone. When trying to open again, the original wake up screen comes on, with the photo of a sea, rocks and cloudy skies. Nothing more. I try
 to scan fingerprint - nothing. I try to put it to rest again, nothing. Physical camera button - nothing. I take another phone and dial myself - on phone 2 I have the tone that I am making a call. On the Idol, there is nothing. I am asked to leave a message
 as I seem to not answer. The Idol is still there - with its beautiful pic of ocean, rocks and clouds. The only thing I can do is - force it to restart again.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
12:28 PM. Phone is restarting after I keep the power button pushed till vibration.&nbsp;I open with my PIN. Phisical camera button - camera opens. I switch between main and front cameras and it works. I shoot a photo. Seems to work. I tap on the little photo to
 switch to open photo gallery.....and here it comes: totally black screen, just with the menu bar on botton, with back, home and search buttons, Phone totally irresponsive again. I press the power button&nbsp;slightly and yes, Phone rests. I press the power button
 again, am asked for PIN, I write it in and the black screen with menu bar&nbsp;comes back. I receive a notification of a new whatsapp message. I tap home and home screen opens. I cant believe! MOre than I expected. I tap on the Whatsapp shortcut&nbsp;and another black
 screen with menu bar. I tap home. Home screen opens. I long tap back button. Camera and Photos are shown to run in background, whatsapp never launched. I tap on photos to see the familiar black screen. Long tap back again. I tap at camera app and it opens.
 I shoot a photo, seems to work. I l<span>ong tap back again, close both apps. Home screen on. I swipe
 right and open Photos from the list. I discover that I have no new photos. I open camera again with physical button. it seems to open but with the circle half hidden behind menu bar. I know what that means: camera is frozen. I long tap back button to get the
 multi task screen. Swipe down to close camera but the camera screen comes on again. I repeat it and same thing. I put the phone down to keep writing here. Suddenly home screen comes on. I swipe down to go to the quick action center and open camera from there.
 Samething, the half hidden shoot button. I try to close and it closes. I open whatsapp from the shortcut on home screen. launching- - launching - and it collapses. I receive a notification: I missed call (the one I made to myself). I swipe to the all app list
 and try to open whatsapp. Starts to launch but collapses. I tap on candy crush shortcut on homescreen. Starts to open and -against all I expected - runs. I am not really interested to play, so I open multitask and swipe down. I open whatsapp again. Does not
 launch.&nbsp;</span>The only thing I can do is - force it to restart again.</p>
<p>
<br />
<span>12:50 PM. Phone is restarting after I kept the ower button pushed till vibration. I write my
 pin. Open whatsapp. Open the last message and discover I was sent a photo. Tap on it and yes I am able to download it and see it. I go to home, swip to all apps and open camera.Camera opens with&nbsp;the shoot button half hidden behind the menu bar. Meaning: I
 wont be able to shoot a photo. I have to restart. I long tap back to go to multitasking but camera app keeps coming back even after I swipe it down.&nbsp;</span>The only thing I can do is - force it to restart again.<br />
</p>
<div>
<span>
<p>12:55&nbsp;PM. Phone is restarting after I kept the power button pushed till vibration. I write my pin. I swipe right, open camera which seems to be OK, shoot a photo. I close the cam and go to app list to open Photos and yes! After 42 minutes, I have a photo,
 and read my last whatsapp messages! Amazing what an Alcatel Idol 4S can do for you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting tired. It is my second Idol 4-S and both had exactly the same problem. No wait: the second one came with blown speakers and after a repair, with cellular data disabled. From the expereince of the first phone I know that restore to factory settings
 wont help. I am running out of options. I still keep wondering: Can Alcatel perhaps make a phone that actually works?</p>

<p>Already reset it twice (with back up). First reset: tried to do it from Settings, System, About, Reset. Never passed the "good bye" screen, so I tried to do the "volumen up, volumen down" thing. Seemed not to work. So it seems like on an Idol the procedure
 is simply keeping the power button pressed until it vibrates and do the same thing again until the two wheels appear. After restoring backup, I immediately noticed that everything was still the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a sleepless night I tried again from Settings, System, About, Reset. This time it ran smooth. I restored again and everything seemed good until I downloaded Whatsapp and did not manage to open it. Nerviously opened camera to found it frozen. Everything
 since is the same. Multiple apss failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to restore from the WDRT Exactly as with the Idol I bought in December (and returned to Microsoft for refund), the software never recognized the connected device and, after choosing manually the requiered software version, I was required to
 do the&nbsp;"volumen up, volumen down" thing. Since that does not work on the Idol, I gave up.</p>

            Based on what you have explained, it appears that the issue is caused by the communication app that you are using. You may need to report this issue to the developer of the app in question.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I recommend that you uninstall the aforementioned app so you could use your phone.<br />
<br />
Regarding your concern about restoring your device using the Windows Device Recovery Tool, please try to resolve the issue by restarting your computer and Internet connection.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know how it turned out.

            Suddenly, a few hours after the second hard reset, it is running fine, I suspect (and fear) it is a problema that will come and go. The "aforementioned app" is not the probem. With the time, I have discovered a very basic test: if I can push the power
 button and swipe down to shut down, means the phone is OK. If I have to keep the power button until it vibrates to restart, I will have malfunction with every app and screen. If you dont hear from me soon, it will mean everything is running like a Lumia.

<p>As suspected, I had another malfunction episode yesterday. As usual, the <span>
"aforementioned communication app" and camera the most evident failures. Plus the problem shutting down.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Suddenly, I realized that I had inserted a SD card into the phone about an hour before the failure. So, I took out the SD card and forced a restart and&nbsp;<strong>voilà&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;everything
 fine again: the "aformentioned communication app" is&nbsp;<span>running smooth, no problems with camera, even shutdown with the standard swipe down etc. It seems that somehow, the SD card interferes with the OS. I guess, now that
 I found the diagnostic, it is your (or Alcatel's) turn to find a solution.</span></p>

            In this case it is quite possible that the SD card was corrupt or damaged. Try formatting it or even better, try a different card, make sure it is a genuine memory card from a proven brand.<br />

            I'm seeing others having the same issue after updating their phone to the Nougat version. Let's see if future updates for Office will fix the issue. This is what I'm doing if I have an issue with the apps on my phone - in-app support: https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Get-in-app-help-for-Outlook-for-iOS-and-Android-218a22d1-9fa5-4889-b689-de1c63493243?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US&nbsp;
