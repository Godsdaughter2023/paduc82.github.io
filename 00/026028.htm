<h2>            Cannot Sync Phone. Does not find the phone.</h2>
                    
<p>My phone was working fine to I installed the latest beta of Office 2010 x64 bit. I know it was not supported to I moved my phone to another PC running Office 2k7 Pro / Win 7 x64 to sync till Office RTMed. At one point I was no longer able to sync. The phone
 thinks it is connected but nothing shows up in the Sync center. I tried BlueTooth and USB Cable.</p>
<p>I decided to try it on my main PC this time, except I had already removed the beta and installed the RTM 32-bit. It first saw the phone, deleted all my contacts but the ones I probably added till I could not sync. It never synced the calender. I went into
 device center and it said no mail client installed. So I removed device center (had it installed to try to get to work with the beta). I cannot get it to show up tring to pair it with bluetooth and same issue with USB cable.</p>
<p>I am amazed that when you setup a partnership something always gets wiped out.</p>
<p>I have a BlackJack II running WM for SmartPhone 6.1</p>
<p>Any ideas how to get it to work?</p>
<p>Would a data block on ATT side cause this? I was sick of pocket surfing charges.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>I tried this</p>
<p>Please reinstall Windows Mobile Device Center.&nbsp; WMDC will need to reconfigure itself for the new version of Outlook in order to allow you to sync with it.</p>
<p>I installed 6.x64 1 on WIn and only files are selected. Contacts and tasks say that mail client not installed.</p>
<p>I got a unidentified device installing drivers buy saide device unplugged. I plugged it in. I ran the isntaller again still get it. The remote something or other failed so maybe I need to try to reinstall again.</p>
<p>My phone is in sync cneter now.</p>

    <title>Multi Display Optimization Options have disappeared - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multi Display Optimization Options have disappeared</h2>
                    <p>I recently had our IT department upgrade my office suite from 32 bit to 64 bit.&nbsp; The first few times I opened it, the display settings button on the status bar would appear asking if I want to optimize for performance or compatibility.&nbsp; I am trouble shooting
 another issue so I tried setting this to performance (which yields somewhat blurry results on my extended monitors).&nbsp; After a few reboots, the button no longer appears so I cannot change it back.&nbsp; I came across the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.office.com/en-ie/article/office-options-the-general-tab-c51b7db7-d59e-448a-aa8a-7e9310cebae3</p>
<p>
</p><p>But those options do not appear for me.&nbsp; Is there another way to access these settings?</p>

<p>Hi WorkLogin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to my test, I also cannot see the two options under User Interface options group in Office 365 ProPlus version 1803 (Build 9126.2295) Semi-Annual Channel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The two options are in Semi-Annual Channel Targeted and Monthly Channel, Monthly Channel Targeted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can switch to these three Channels by run following scripts in command prompt:</p>
cd C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\ClickToRun<br />
OfficeC2RClient.exe /changesetting Channel=Monthly<br />
OfficeC2RClient.exe /update user
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Gloria</p>

<h2>            Apps not working on Nokia Icon with Windows Phone 8.1</h2>
                    As of yesterday, many of my apps are no longer working.&nbsp; They appear on my start screen, but nothing happens when I click on the app.&nbsp; Other apps open but then close immediately.&nbsp; Email app shows new emails on the live tile but won't open.&nbsp; Some apps show
 up in the app list as "@{Microsoft.MSCalendar......etc.}.&nbsp; I've tried a soft reset to no avail.&nbsp; Short of doing a hard reset, any other suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks!!

            <p>wish I could waive a magic wand for you @nixone but sounds like you have corrupted files somewhere on the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this does happen periodically, I have been on vacation in Las Vegas and opened a door with one hand, and had my nokia in my other hand, and there was a dust/sand storm going on.&nbsp; I got zapped really bad, and that toasted my device that I had to reformat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt you have had anything that drastic, but it is very plausible that if it was working fine before and suddenly is wacky, there is corrupted files in the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>did you install any apps in the last couple of days? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, was there any updates that were installed to the device for the apps you already have installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>you can check by: <strong>store/(...)/downloads/history</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>from there, see if any updates were installed before you had this happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if so, try deleting those apps one at a time, with a reboot in-between to see if that was it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it may be tedious, but takes less time than a reformat/restore, unless it will be required even if that doesn't fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h3> dudeinc  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Internet Security Warning&#34; Outlook 2016.</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a new computer in Oct. of 2015 that is running Windows 10.&nbsp; I purchased Outlook 2016 at the same time.&nbsp; I have had NO problems with either ...UNTIL... roughly the 1st of March.&nbsp; Since then I have been having problems with my Outlook 2016... the
 multiples of same emails seems to have been fixed ...BUT... now EVERY TIME I launch Outlook it always starts with a box opening with... "Internet Security Warning" ... "The server you are connected to is using a security certificate that cannot be verified"
 ... below that... "The signature of the certificate cannot be verified" ... then it has a button "View Certificate" (explain in a moment) and below that button it states "Do you want to continue using this server?" ... if I click "YES" then it allows Outlook
 to load and receive messages ...BUT... every time I want to send a message it has me verify my account from the pop up window that shows my email and password to click "OK". &nbsp; When I click on the "View Certificate" it loads and states... "The integrity of
 the certificate cannot be guaranteed. The certificate may be corrupted or may have been altered."&nbsp; I have contacted my ISP twice to check on the certificates being used and the configurations and all is correct on their end.&nbsp; Does anyone know if there is a
 current problem with Outlook 2016?&nbsp; Is anyone else having this problem?&nbsp; If so... do you have a solution? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

One this that may be causing the issue is e-mail hosting company. I have my own domain name along with e-mail services and to setup Outlook I have to use the hosting companies domain for the imap.hostname.com and smtp.hostname.com versus using my domain.net.
 The p email service would or could be the same.<br />

    <title>How can I force Outlook 2010 to send a Fully Qualified Domain - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gmolotsky  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I force Outlook 2010 to send a Fully Qualified Domain Name&#63;</h2>
                    My school's network administrators recently changed the security settings on their Apple Mail server so that it requires a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).&nbsp; Since Outlook sends the computer name in the HELO not the FQDN of the computer I can no longer
 send mail via SMTP through the school's network.&nbsp; Other mail clients will work (Ex: Thunderbird) but neither Outlook 2010 or Outlook 2013 preview seem to be able to send an FQDN.&nbsp; Is there a way to force this through a registry fix or is it possible to address
 this in Outlook 2013 before its release?

            <p>I'm connecting via IMAP.&nbsp; Over a port specified by my school's mail server.&nbsp; The issue arose when they upgraded their network.&nbsp; In talking with the network admistrator he told me this is a known problem (see
<a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.apple.com/kb/TS3023</a>) and that the only solution was to change mail clients.&nbsp; Thunderbird does work with the same settings as outlook.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I would prefer to use Outlook.&nbsp; Here's the outlook error:</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Server error: '504 5.5.2 &lt;jk85&gt;: Helo command rejected: need fully-qualified hostname'&nbsp; where "jk85" is the name of my computer.</span></p>

<h2>            Corrupt contacts making Outlook difficult to use and cannot be deleted</h2>
                    <p>I have Office/Outlook 2013 and am having a nasty problem. My contacts are not searchable from the search box and they are not visible in the "People" tab. The item count at the bottom left is fine so the contacts are there but the view says "We didn't find
 anything to show here ". I also know the contacts are there because the reminders on those contacts keep popping up.
</p>
<p>"Show this folder as an e-mail address book" check box is checked and grayed out. It is not a corrupt profile issue as I have created and deleted multiple sets of new profiles trying to figure out this problem.
</p>
<p>After a lot of tedious work, I narrowed down the problem to a handful of corrupt contacts and one corrupt email. (there may be more but this is what i have found so far). Unfortunately, scanpst aborts with an error and cannot fix the PST. I ran many passes
 on scanpst over several days without any luck. It always fails right at the end of “Looking for lost data…” “Phase 6 of 8” with the error message “An unexpected error prevented access to this file. Use a disk error checking program…”</p>
<p>There is no problem with the disk and I have defragged it and checked it multiple times.
</p>
<p>I can delete the corrupt email but when I try to empty the "Deleted Items" folder, it crashes Outlook.
</p>
<p>For the contacts, some of the corrupt ones, I cannot even open but some other contacts I can open but cannot delete them (I can edit them but cannot save the edits. Tried various edits to see if I can get Outlook to save the revised contact but no luck).
</p>
<p>Hard Delete (Shift + Delete) on the corrupted contacts does not work and crashes Outlook.</p>
<p>Outlook safe mode is of no help. I cannot delete the corrupt email or the corrupt contacts even in the safe mode.
</p>
<p>I have tried exporting the contacts hoping to start from a fresh file but no luck there either. When I use the Import/Export facility, I get the message saying "The items in the "Contacts" folder cannot be imported or exported. The file C:\\***privatepath***
 cannot be accessed"</p>
<p>Scoured the web and no help anywhere.</p>
<p>Is there a way to recover from this?&nbsp; How can I delete the corrupted items or export to a new file so that I can start fresh.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a lot of contacts built over 30+ years with notes so manually recreating the contacts is not an option. The last known non-corrupted back-up appears to be over 6 months old (backups after that seem to have PST errors) and I cannot go back to that
 as that data is too old and a lot of records have been revised since then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The goal is to either remove the corrupted items to make the current Contacts folder usable OR to export the non-corrupt contacts to a new file and start using the new file instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for any help you can give.</p>

                    MS word won't start - goofy starting problem<br />
<br />
it worked fine yesterday, honest!<br />
<br />
Today, when I try to start (either by clicking on a file or the app), it goes through a list of RTF files that I had opened last time (yesterday) and tells me that it can't read RTF files - and then it craps out, the program does not open...<br />
<br />
it seems to be trying to open at the new screen, when you first install the program and have to put in your serial number...<br />
<br />
anyhow, can someone tell me what to do?&nbsp; Is there a pref file somewhere that I should be trashing???<br />

            <p>There don't appear to be any windows 10 drivers for your laptop wireless card on the HP site. Yo/u could try contacting Broadcom directly, or a quick fix would be to buy a wireless USB device you could plug into a USB socket and use that instead of your
 internal one. </p>

            <p>I have the same issue of not being able any longer to connect to the Internet via a Wireless Network; from my Dell 7400 Desktop; which currently has a Windows 10 Beta Preview Build installed.&nbsp; Its the 'slow ring' release from a few weeks prior to late June
 2016....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to connect via wireless using other computers; running the Release Version of Windows 10; in the same location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue started recently on the Beta Test version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have confirmed that my software is up to date on the Netgear WNA 3100 Genie Wireless adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My modem firmware is update on my QWEST PK5000 modem; and all other computers I have (all with Windows 10 Release Version) connect OK to the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem computer seems to recognize the network being present but will not connect to the Internet any longer....</p>
<p>
</p><p>It used to connect just fine.......</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may be way out in left field here, but I wanted to post a note about my own experience with my HP Laptop and my wireless connection...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that somewhere along the line after upgrading from Win 7&nbsp;Pro SP1&nbsp;to Win 10, my wireless connection suddenly needed a security login to connect the laptop to the router... This was something that was not needed with my Win 7 setup, and had me scrambling
 to find the password...</p>
<p>
</p><p>May or may not be related to your issue..</p>
<p>
</p><p>On another machine with a wired connection, I had to do some searching for a Network Adapter driver... The one supplied by Windows 10 was newer than the one I had been using, but was very temperamental about connecting...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I eventually found one that would work from the adapter manufacturer that was newer than both of the previous... It would not install in the normal method...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to manually browse to the driver .INF file in Device Manager...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem has since been fixed, and I no longer need to do this...</p>

<p>Now I'm in the verification loop, and nothing is helping.</p>

<p>I can verify my account, can give you a new email.</p>
<p>Could someone contact me via email and please help.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Annecardell,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you give us the model of your phone? basically, Zune monitors Pictures/My Pictures folder on your computer. All photos stored on My pictures will appear on Zune under Collection&gt; Pictures. On Zune, while phone is still connected, you can go to Phone&gt;
 Pictures then drag and drop photos to the icon of the computer at the lower left corner. On the computer, click Start then go to My Pictures/Pictures folder and look for the photos. From there you can copy and paste the photos to your flashdrive.</p>
<p>Hope this will help you. Please let me know. Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Microsoft Access table with no primary key. What is the default - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nadiasteyn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Access table with no primary key. What is the default sort&#63;</h2>
                    I'm using an Access database at work (I didn't create the table). It has no primary key. There are no sorts applied, but the records appear to be in a random order. I add a new record at the bottom and it jumps up and settles somewhere else. My question
 is, what is Access sorting this table by? IDEALLY I'd like every new record to stay at the bottom, i.e. oldest record at the top and latest at the bottom (but date/time is not a field so I assume that would make it difficult). I don't want to start a numbering
 system now because it will be completely arbitrary (since the records are already scrambled). Is there a way to turn off ALL sorting/automatic ordering of data?

<p>I'm not sure that is a logical question. Put yourself in Access position. The user opens a table in grid view. What to do?</p>
<p>If a PK it's simple.</p>
<p>If no PK, the records will be displayed as well, and naturally they have to be in SOME order. There is no hidden date stamp or record number, so I would assume there is SOME algorithm that decides how to display them. This algorithm has not been published.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do yourself a favor, and add a PK asap; an AutoNumber if you have to. At least going forward there would be some semblance of order, and one less violation of the all-important rules of relational database design.</p>

<p>If you can't modify the table, create a simple select query using the table as source.</p>
<p>In the query, you can apply the sorting exactly as you prefer.</p>

</p><p>Now, use the query when you enter data.</p>

<h2>            Hotmail account on Iphone 6 won&#39;t allow me to send emails says username or passowrd is incorrect which is not the case becuase can log onto PC using log in details</h2>
                    <p>Since updating software on my iphone 6&nbsp;i cannot send emails on phone, states that username or password is incorrect which is not the case because i can log on to a pc and send/receive and also receive on my iphone but not send.</p>
<p>Spoken to Apple technical support last week and they state that they have done all the relevant check incoming and outgoing server checks etc and it's all correct so problem is with hotmail account.</p>

<p>I suspect what is happening is you are still using the overall account password and not the app generated password.&nbsp; You will still get mail until you log the device out (which is a good idea anyway) and then you will need to generate a password
 (on the pc in outlook.com) and "trust" the mobile device. After which it should not do that.</p>

<p>You can also install the outlook app so anytime you need a "passcode" you can approve it directly on the mobile device</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>OK, figured out how to do it, with help from our web hoster. Took him every bit of 10 minutes. I can access the HTML code from our email server which uses Smarter Mail and&nbsp;enter&nbsp;"center" commands. I can then do a reply or forward the email and it shows up
 with the body of it centered.&nbsp;The problem is figuring how to access the HTML commands from Publisher. It seems like a fairly straight forward and simple fix. Why can't a company the size of MS figure this out.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
I have no answer for your rhetorical question and don't know what to tell you other than to say again that there is no built-in method to overide the left justifying default setting from Publisher 2007. I can say I don't expect MS will be making&nbsp;any changes
 to Pub 2007, so if you can't live with its limitations then move on to a program that does what you want it to do.</p>

<p>Hi Mahesh,</p>
<p>If the users save their files to a team site library in SharePoint Online, we would like to confirm the points below to narrow down the issue:</p>
<p>1. Does the issue occur to other folders in the library?</p>
<p>2. Do they upload the files via OneDrive for Business sync client, Open with Explorer feature or directly dragging and dropping them?</p>
<p>For reference:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2796734" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.microsoft.com/.../2796734</a></p>
<p>3. Create a new library and upload the files to see if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>HI Hale,</p>
<p>thanks for your response.</p>
<p>Please find below answers to your questions:</p>
<p>1. Does the issue occur to other folders in the library?</p>
<p>Mu colleague has uploaded to 3 different deal folders and the files all ended up in the parent folder.</p>
<p>2. Do they upload the files via OneDrive for Business, Open with Explorer or directly dragging and dropping them?</p>
<p>For reference:</p>
<p>support.microsoft.com/.../2796734</p>
<p>she has been dragging and dropping since my OneDrive for Business is not synching. Before her email was migrated she was populating the site via Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>3. Create a new library and upload the files to see if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>I have created new library and uploaded file, it seems to work fine. I have asked my colleague(who faced this issue) to upload, I will let you know.</p>
<p>thanks</p>

                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm trying to update a PC to Windows 10 build 9860 and it gets stuck at 45% and doesn't move. I reset it the first time and it went back to the previous version so I tried again and this time it's been stuck at that same point for 12+ hours.<br />
<br />
Anything I can check, logs I can get etc tow work out what is happening?<br />

            As much there are improvements in build 9860, its quite unstable and does not feature the polish of a milestone build such as 9841. I personally have seen some regression in areas such as Networking, performance, application compatibility&nbsp;and even sleep.
 If you are not interested in experimenting with such a early build, it is probably best you wait until the next major milestone which will be available to consumers in the near future.

            Yes, it does seem very buggy.&nbsp; Nice animation effects, but have some printing issues using Firefox.&nbsp; Guess i'll have to boot to another h/d until the next release.

    <title>Catch-22 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cbeningo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Catch-22</h2>
                    I have 2 hotmail addresses, one old one I use primarily as a spam dump and a newer one that is my primary email account. My primary one is linked to my Microsoft account. The old one isn't, and I cannot find any way to sign in to hotmail without going
 through a Microsoft account. Therefore, I have been unable to access this account, despite the fact that I know all the necessary login info (if I could find a place to enter it). My biggest problem, beyond not having access to that account, is that in order
 to update my Microsoft account's security info, Microsoft insists on sending me a code through the old email. Without access to the old email, I will have to submit to a 30-day waiting period, basically putting a hold on my account. Now, personally, I don't
 think that's at all reasonable, given that it's Microsoft's own new protocols that are preventing me from accessing that old hotmail account.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know how to access an old account without going through a Microsoft account, or another way to get around this problem? I do have a phone number associated with my Microsoft account, but sending a text or call isn't even listed as an option
 for my account security login. I'm beyond frustrated at this point, so any helpful info will be greatly appreciated.</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

            <p>Hotmail addresses ARE Microsoft accounts, provided they aren't aliases of another account.&nbsp; Log into that account by logging off of the "primary" account and then connecting to
<a href="http://mail.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://mail.live.com/</a>.&nbsp; Enter the "old" Hotmail address as the username and whatever password you gave it when you last updated the security information for that account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Hotmail address is an alias of another account, you can sign in with the alias address as the username and the primary account password as the password or you can simply use the primary address as the username.</p>

            <p>I'm stuck in a Catch-22, too.&nbsp; I can log into in Microsoft (Hotmail) account successfully, but Microsoft is requesting an additional security code to validate my identify to log my system into Microsoft.&nbsp; To get the security code, MS wants to send this to
 my backup email address.&nbsp; I enter the backup email address, but I never receive the code.&nbsp; I have no way of confirming whether this backup email address has a typo, or if the email is never sent.&nbsp; When I enter the address to confirm it, there is no error message.&nbsp;
 It just moves to the next screen and waits for&nbsp;me to enter a code I never receive.&nbsp; If I click on "use a different verification option", it just cycles back to same email address request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to update my Account Setting using the web browser interface, I also encounter the same catch-22 issue.&nbsp; I can access my Hotmail, but I can make any account setting changes.&nbsp; I'm stuck.&nbsp; Thus, I can't log my Windows system into Microsoft, nor
 can I install any news apps from the Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 8.1 Pro with Media Center.&nbsp; I'm now stuck watching NCAA games on my iPhone since I can't get my Windows 8 laptop to install the March Madness App.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks!!!</p>

            Five hours later I receive a batch of five emails from Microsoft with security codes.&nbsp; No explanation for the delay, as other emails were processing fine in that timeframe.&nbsp; I try to use the codes, but they do not work.&nbsp; I request a new security code be
 sent to the backup email account, and again nothing happens.&nbsp; At least I know the backup email account address is correct.&nbsp;

            <p>Success at last.&nbsp; Fortunately, the alternative email attached to my Hotmail account was correct.&nbsp; The issue I was encountering is that the emails with the security codes from Microsoft were delayed.&nbsp; When I received the security code five hours later, it
 did not work.&nbsp; Upon trying again, I received the code two hours later and it did not work.&nbsp; All other email was processing just fine at the time.&nbsp; This morning, I received a code with only a 10 minute delay and was able to successfully login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sequence I was trying to execute was:&nbsp; </p>
<p>1.)<span>&nbsp; </span>Windows 8.1 Mail sign-in OR Install App from Store</p>
<p>2.)<span>&nbsp; </span>Switch to Microsoft Account on this PC request</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-- I confirm my local password</p>
<p>3.)<span>&nbsp; </span>Sign in to your Microsoft Account</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-- I enter my Hotmail account and password</p>
<p>4.)<span>&nbsp; </span>Help us Protect Your Information</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-- I re-enter my alternate email account to receive security code</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (taking it on faith that this email address matches the one on record)</p>
<p>5.) Enter the Code you Received</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>--<span>&nbsp; </span>I never get the code.<span>&nbsp; </span>When I finally receive a code hours later, it does not work</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank goodness the alternate email was correct, since there is no way of verifying.&nbsp; When I logged in to mail.live.com and went to Account Settings, it would not allow me to edit (or even view) my security settings.&nbsp; My only option was the unsuccessful security
 code catch-22.</p>
<p>Bottom line -- I was finally able to install NCAA March Madness Live, although missing the live broadcast of the first 16 games on Thursday.</p>

            I'm glad to hear you were succesful.&nbsp; One should always keep the security information of the account, particularly the alternate email addresses and the cell phone associated wth the account, up to date.&nbsp; It is also a good idea to have more than one alternate
 address.

            <p>What can I do if my alternate account cannot be accessed? In my case, microsoft does not recognize the account even though I am certain the email is correct (I used it for years). I am trying to log into the old account but I fear microsoft has deleted the
 account due to lack of use. Despite having all of the personal info requested I am not being let back into my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the case then microsft has locked me out of my account and if the primary account has been hacked then I can only abandon it to the hackers.&nbsp;</p>

            That's why you always have multiple alternate addresses, connect a cell phone to the account, and enable two-step verification.&nbsp; Hackers can't take over the account then.
