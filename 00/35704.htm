<h2>            Xbox 360 freeze only one game no RROD.</h2>
                    
<p>Hey Guys!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have this problem for about 3 weaks, after I bought this new game.</p>
<p>I tried to play some other games, but then I have no problem.</p>
<p>I went back to the shop, and they give me new one, but the same problem. :(</p>
<p>Sometimes I can play the game for an hour, but sometimes it freezes after 10 min.</p>
<p>My xbox is from around 2007, I now&nbsp;it's getting old, but the strange thing is, that I have only problems with one game!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone knows??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>It might help knowing what game it is, but you could try <strong>clearing your cache</strong>.<br />
<br />

<p>Well I tried the thing that you said, grey pilgrim. but it doesn't work.</p>
<p>It's just frustrating that I have it only with this game (top spin 4).</p>
<p>Yesterday I had some friends here, and we played PES 2011, for about 5/6 hours, with no problem.</p>
<p>When they went home, I was giving a shot on tp4, but after an hour it was freezing.</p>
<p>My xbox is already went back to mircosoft, in I think 2009, when they put in a new dvd-drive.</p>
<p>Never had problems with it, after now.</p>

<p>Hey guys, it's possible that the issue here is the game in question is causing your console to overheat. Is your console well-ventilated? Can you check the ports to be sure that they're not backed up with dust? You can clear the ports with canned air, or
 by carefully running a vacuum hose over them.</p>

<p>I have just tried to download the latest 5 updates - the July "malicious removal tool" and 4 others:&nbsp; 971961, 976662, 981332, and 2229593.&nbsp; All downloaded, but only the malicious tool installed.&nbsp; The 4 others failed - showing error code 0x8007F0DA.</p>
<p>This is the first time I have had such a problem.</p>
<p>I tried each of the three steps outlined in KB 958050.&nbsp; After each of these, the 4 updates still failed to install.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when I then tried to System Restore (having created a restore point before making the registry changes in 958050) the Restoration did not fully complete - a popup said the system could not be restored to that previous point.</p>
<p>I searched, and have tried two other solutions.&nbsp; The change described in KB 934648 did not help (the 4 updates still wouldn't install).</p>
<p>I found a forum post which suggested ZoneAlarm might be part of the problem (though it has never obstructed updates before).&nbsp; So I disabled ZA, and tried again.&nbsp; Still the updates wouldn't install.</p>
<p>I seem to have almost run out of options and solutions.&nbsp; Curiously, when I clicked on an onward link to the MS support pages and newsgroups, IE said the page could not be displayed (this may be unconnected, but I wonder).&nbsp; I am now logged into the MS answers
 forum via Firefox, my usual browser,&nbsp; in my user-account.</p>
<p>Can anyone figure out a solution from these symptoms (the IE aspect may of course be unrelated - I have only recently installed IE8 and I'm suspicious that it might be playing up...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the behavior persists after doing the reset, there is a very good chance that you are seeing the effects of a hijackware infection!</p>
<p>NB: If you had no anti-virus application installed or the subscription had expired *when the machine first got infected* and/or your subscription has since expired and/or the machine's not been kept fully-patched at Windows Update, don't waste your time
 with any of the below: Format &amp; reinstall Windows.&nbsp; A Repair Install will NOT help!</p>

<p>Thanks PA Bear - though this is rather alarming advice.&nbsp; I haven't yet tried the FixIt you suggest to reset the Windows Update components (I am just about to...) .&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing that puzzles me is - if there is a glitch in the Update components, how come the "malicious tool" update installed but the other updates, all downloaded at the same time, didn't?&nbsp; I don't want to go and try FixIt if it isn't addressing the actual
 problem.</p>
<p>I'm also surprised and concerned at the idea that this problem might be the result of hijackware.&nbsp; Not only do I have ZA firewall and AVG 9.0 antivirus, I also have AdAware and SpyBot S&amp;D, and I periodically check my computer with Malwarebytes Anti-Malware.
 Is it likely, despite this, that my system is infected?&nbsp; I have never yet - touch wood - had any such infection.</p>
<p>Rgds</p>

<p>The MSRT only checks for a very specific set of infection variants. The current MSRT dates from 13 July.</p>
<p>Few of us "security nerds" have a very good opinion of AVG (free or paid). I'd say over 95% of infected computers are running AVG or a freebie Norton or McAfee suite from an ISP.</p>
<p>Speaking of Spybot &amp; Ad-Aware, is Spybot Tea Timer and/or Ad-Aware's Ad-Watch enabled?</p>

<p>Latest sitrep...</p>
<p>A Malwarebytes Anti-Malware quick scan reported no infections.&nbsp; Now I know that may not be conclusive, but still...</p>
<p>I have just gone to KB 971058 to do the Windows Update reset.&nbsp; Clicked on the FixIt button, and then "Run".&nbsp; The Windows installer started to run it, then came up with a message that it had encountered an error in the package (or some such wording) and couldn't
 complete.&nbsp; Error code was 2755.&nbsp; When I clicked on OK, there was then a window with options to give feedback about the FixIt, seek online help and something else.&nbsp; I clicked to give feedback, was taken to a short survey which asked had the Fixit solved the
 problem (no!) and a box for comment - where I noted the error code 2755.&nbsp; Then I clicked for online help, and got the IE "cannot display the page... diagnose connection problems" display.</p>
<p>This gets curiouser andmore worrying.&nbsp; Why wouldn't the KB 971058 FixIt work?&nbsp; I'm not familiar with tweaking registry or using command-line prompts and all that, so I fight shy of manual DIY attempts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem with installing Updates is one thing.&nbsp; Why do I also seem to get "page cannot be displayed" from IE8 when trying to navigate to various MS online help pages?&nbsp; Why didn't System Restore work after my KB 958050 attempts at solutions?</p>
<p>And to answer the other questions - both Spybot TeaTimer and Ad-Aware AdWatch are enabled.&nbsp; I've had both programs (and AVG and ZA) running since I first started using the computer.&nbsp; It's been 4 years or so, and the computer (and start-up) is getting slower,
 but I thought that was just because stuff had accumulated on it (60% of the C drive is full - I recently defragged it).&nbsp; Is there a more sinister explanation?</p>
<p>I'm getting increasingly worried.&nbsp; What do I do next?</p>

<p>Hello Sap U G</p>
<p>Just after I had replied to PA Bear about the failure of the FixIt, I thought I'd check out the article you recommended.&nbsp; Something interesting happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I clicked directly on the link in your post.&nbsp; I'm using Firefox right now.&nbsp; And Firefox brought up a warning page saying that the page I was trying to reach "could not be verified" and did I really want to go there?&nbsp; I said "No".</p>
<p>I have since searched and found the KB article 822798 - was able to see it without problems by opening and searching in a new Firefox tab.&nbsp; Haven't done anything that article suggests yet.&nbsp; Some of the steps in there seem similar to the ones in KB 958050
 (resetting Cryptopgraphic Services, renaming Catroot2), while other advice about checking log files etc is way outside my comfort zone and I don't understand it.</p>
<p>But what's this odd business about MS support pages not being verified?&nbsp; Is this another clue as to what is wrong?</p>
<p>I hope others can see more of a pattern in the symptoms.&nbsp; No offence, but I'm rather hoping for detective work and deductions from the evidence rather than stock answers or assumptions about imperfect antivirus programs...</p>

<p>Thanks PA Bear - I'm ready to try this, and have got the Spybot instructions, but right now the link to the lavasupport.com site isn't working. I'm currently using Firefox.&nbsp; All I get is a blank page - even on the main lavasoft forum site.&nbsp; [edit - a day
 later, I can access the site, at least in Firefox].</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another little fragment of evidence.&nbsp; When logged in as Admin and using IE8 (as i do for updates and other Microsoft sites), I have problems connecting to various MS webpages.&nbsp; I tried<a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/howsafe.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/howsafe.htm</a>
 , and also<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.aspx&nbsp;</a> . One could not connect at all.&nbsp; The other page, which offers the Protection Scan download, opened, but would not download
 the scan application - it prompted me to permit IE to allow popups and to allow Active-X controls, which I did, but still would not download the app.</p>
<p>[edit] - further exploration today suggests that IE8 cannot or will not display any secure webpage with an address which starts https:&nbsp; A popup appears advising that I'm about to go to a secure page, but then the screen shows the "cannot display the webpage..."
 message.</p>
<p>I don't know if these problems of IE8 accessing webpages is part of the same problem, or an unrelated glitch with IE8, but I mention them just in case they are significant.&nbsp; I don't normally use IE for browsing as a user, only for downloading MS updates
 when logged on as Admin.</p>
<p>This might be a dumb question, but if all previous Windows updates downloaded OK on to my computer with TeaTimer and Ad-Watch running - and the latest ones have also downloaded and installed on my wife's computer which runs XP Pro with all the same AV and
 security apps including these two - then how would disabling TT and AW on my computer make a difference?&nbsp; In fact I apparently have four Windows updates already downloaded and awaiting installation - so TT and AW allowed them to download.&nbsp; The problem is with
 installing them.</p>

<p>Hmm, OK PA Bear.&nbsp; Deep breath.&nbsp; I've tried the series of steps in your initial reply, and have not been able to complete any of them...</p>
<ul>
<li>KB 971058 FixIT&nbsp; - could not run it - error 2755 </li><li>Microsoft PCSafety support - not available outside the US (I'm in UK) </li><li>Download and run MSRT manually - could not download, so have no log file or report to post to a forum</li><li>Windows Live Safety Centre Protection Scan - could not download, so have no log file or report to post to a forum</li></ul>
<p>I assume I have to conclude from this that (a) as you say, I have a hijackware infection; (b) I can't do anything more on my own, so the next step is to seek expert help and go down the HiJackThis route with one of the listed sites (spyware hammer, or warrior
 etc).&nbsp; The specialist local shop is not an option - where I live, there is no such shop available!</p>
<p>Feels like I've just had diagnosis of a life-threatening affliction. This is not a barrel of fun...but I guess what has to be done, has to be done.</p>
<p>Thanks for the time and thought you've put into responding to my questions.&nbsp; Hope we can manage to sort this out.</p>

<h2>            Reactivating Windows 10 after a hardware change</h2>
                    I recently removed my mother board and processor and installed a new ones. The problem is now my windows 10 is saying it can't activate with my product key. I have used the "troubleshooter" and attempted to reactivate win10, nothing is working and it just
 keeps suggesting that I pay for a new product key. Is there anything that can be done? I am not shelling out 100+ bucks because Microsoft can't figure out people upgrade their computers.

            Hi charlessiegrist
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />1. If Windows was preinstalled i..e OEM version, then you can not use the license on another hardware. OEM license is tied to motherboard and if motherboard is changed, you can not reuse the same license on new motherboard.
<br />
<br />In this case, you need to buy a new license.
<br />
<br />2. But if it was Retail license, then you can follow the below process
<br />
<br />To Reactivate Windows 10 after a hardware change, refer to following Microsoft Help - 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a> 
<br />
<br />3. If above doesn't work, To analyze the cause, I need the screenshot of following output
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click on either Powershell (Admin) or Command Prompt (Admin) 
<br />Copy below and paste into Powershell / Cmd windows and Enter 
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Charles
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new Motherboard or PC, if it is OEM it will not . .. 
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 a Retail licence?

            Hey Charles.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />As long as the underlying license you upgraded or that came with WIndows 10 is retail and not factory preinstalled or builder's OEM, then it can transfer since Upgrade inherits the rights and restrictions.   
<br />
<br />The procedure is here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />It is possible to do yourself if you'd previously signed in with your Microsoft account and it linked to the Digital License as shown in Status at top of the Activation Settings page.  Then when you change motherboard, you'd sign in again and run the Troubleshooter.  We recently learned it will even make exceptions for OEM if all else is proper.  So that's your best bet.  
<br />
<br />Servers are overloaded lately so you may get a Try Back later error message.  So you can wait and try back in a day or two.  
<br />
<br />If not contact Microsoft Support:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Since this is not a Retail version but OEM version, hence you can't use it once you change the motherboard. OEM is tied to the motherboard. Once motherboard dies, license dies with it.

<p><em>"I am not shelling out 100+ bucks because Microsoft can't figure out people upgrade their computers. "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of people seem to think that because MS gave Win10 away the first year that they have become a charitable organisation... Nope!</p>
<p>A Windows license has <em>never</em> been for the life of the User, only for the life of the machine it is activated on.
</p>
<p><em>'Upgrading'</em> the mobo and cpu is effectively&nbsp; building a new machine, and the mobo has always been the bit of hardware</p>
<p>the license is linked to. Win10 just does it differently than previous Windows versions.</p>
<p>- This is also stated in the link given by Vijay &amp; Greg ....</p>
<em>"So, if you make significant changes, such as <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
replacing your motherboard</span>, Windows will no longer find a license that matches your computer."</em>
<p>
</p><p>Win10 licensing is no different. OEM = one machine only. Retail = several machines, but it's still not endless. I haven't verified</p>
<p>the limits for Retail Win10, but prior to Win10 it's been for 5 different machines. Successive or concurrent. Not both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Exception is generally made if your mobo dies and your replace it with <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
the same series mobo</span> using the original, or same model cpu.</p>
<p>You may still be able to sweet talk the supervisor, if you use phone activation rather than automatic activation, and get the new hardware</p>
<p>activated ... ( 'My motherboard went up in smoke and I can't replace it with the same model. Take pity kind sir\madam' ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Apparently they were also more lenient during the 'free' Win10 period. But that was oh so long ago.</p>

<h2>            HP Envy X2 Laptop Critical Process Died in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Have a HP Envy X2 laptop with Windows 10. When I power it on it:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Goes into <strong>Preparing Automatic Repair</strong> state with the HP logo and spinning dots below it.<br />
</li><li>Then goes into the Blue screen of death stating <strong>Critical Process Died</strong>.
</li><li>After about a couple of minutes the HP logo reappears with the spinning dots (but no automatic repair message)
</li><li>Finally the laptop <strong>shuts down</strong>. </li><li>I attempt to power it on again, then it repeats the previous steps.</li></ol>
<p>So I cannot get into Windows 10. I've tried getting into safe mode but was unsuccessful.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the Windows 10 media file on an USB drive. Can someone advise me how do I install a clean copy of Windows during the boot up process? Or at least get into safe mode?</p>

            Hi Tommy.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Tommy, 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            Thanks for reply. I created the Win10 media on a USB drive, but I'm not able to boot from the USB drive. Tried

option 2 </a>since it's the only option I can do but can't even gt to the boot menu. The laptop just repeats the steps over and over. Any other suggestions?

            <p>Hello Faysal, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description, I understand that your two USB Gadmei TV Tuner cards doesn't work on your new Windows 7 desktop. The same card works fine on other Windows 7 computer with the same configuration.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.
</p>
<ol>
<li>What happens when you plug-in the TV Tuner card? Does your computer detect the device? Do you get any error message or code when it fails to connect?</li><li>Have you checked connecting them through a different USB port?</li></ol>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>There can be a possibility that the drivers for Gadmei TV sticks are not properly installed on the computer. Let's try these methods below and check if that helps.
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1:</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First, I would suggest you to run the following Microsoft Fixit to get the problem automatically diagnosed and fixed.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>If the above fixit does not solve the problem, I would suggest you to download the best compatible driver from the device Manufacturer (Gadmei) website or contact Gadmei to get the best driver for
 your computer and install. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>You may also refer the article below for help in updating the device driver.</span></span></p>

<h3> hanzuku  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 retail usb remove write protection</h2>
                    I'm wondering if there's any way to remove the write protection on the retail windows 10 usb, the installed version is out of date and makes ryzen-based systems too unstable to update. I would like to install a more up-to-date version of windows 10, as
 it is otherwise unuseably out-of-date.

            Hi Hanzuku, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br /> 
<br />No that would inviolate the USB drive though you can make a new USB drive and use it to install the newer Windows 10 versions. That would be activated with the Digital Entitlement that was created when it was initially installed on that computer.
<br />

            No, you can't, in fact, any attempts to modify it can actually damage it. Trust me, I've tried. Your best option is to pick up a 16 GB drive which you can always format and update with new releases using the Media Creation Tool.

    <title>Windows 10 Clean Install on blank PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lordfettner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Clean Install on blank PC</h2>
                    I recently built my own gaming pc. I got it all put together and it booted up fine and I was able to get to the BIOS menu for the motherboard. I bought windows 10 on usb from Amazon that included the product key. From what I’ve read all i had to do was
 plug the usb in and it should boot up windows 10. Well i did that and got to the screen where i choose either 64 bit or 32 bit. I chose 64 bit and it started to load but then when to a blue stop code screen with error 0xc000021a. My PC would then restart and
 go through the same cycle over and over. I thought it may be a faulty usb but i plugged it in to a older laptop that was running windows 8 and it was able to read and start the installing process. Is it something i did when i built my pc? Or is it somethung
 with the windows 10 usb? I feel like ive tried everything. At a loss right now.&nbsp;

            Hi  LordFettner
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Try simplifying your configuration by keeping only your mouse and keyboard attached, that means:
<br />
<br />    Disconnecting multiple display monitors.
<br />
<br />    Remove discrete video cards, use the on-board graphics if your motherboard supports it.
<br />
<br />    Swap out memory modules - a RAM module might be corrupt - you can also ensure RAM sticks are installed slots 1 and 3. Your RAM modules might be corrupt, try scanning them for errors. 
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/use-the-memory-diagnostics-tool-to-check-for-errors-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/use-the-memory...</a>
<br />
<br />    If you have more than one hard disk installed, disconnect all except the target disk where Windows 10 will be installed.
<br />
<br />    Reset your BIOS Defaults.
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />    Disconnect all external devices, since connected devices can sometimes confuse setup. 
<br />
<br />If setup is successful after performing these tasks, you can reinstall each removed component.

<p>I checked my RAM, my motherboard specifies to always start in the DIMMA 2 slot first. I only have one ssd connected. I only have my monitor, mouse, and keyboard attached. I reset my BIOS. I plug the windows 10 usb in and choose 64 bit and after a few seconds
 it goes straight to the stop code error again. Don’t know if its just a faulty usb or if theres something wrong with my build...</p>
<p>I cant do any troubleshooting like other solutions specify because there isnt anything on my computer yet. My ssd is completely empty all i have is the BIOS from my motherboard.&nbsp;</p>

            You can format the USB drive, create another bootable copy then try again.
<br />
<br />You should also test the RAM or try the swap out a method to see if that works. 
<br />
<br />If your BIOS supports it, try enabling legacy boot to see if it works. 
<br />
<br />If none of the above works, try installing an older version of Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1709 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1709 
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)

 just not the software.</p>

            <p>its been 3 weeks since I had no sound on my pc, I was using the built in realtech drivers I also bought a second hand d2x to see if it was better than the on-board sound I already considered great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after 1 week Microsoft fixed the realtech issue for me so I was very grateful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>yesterday I installed windows 10 fresh onto a formatted hard drive after the upgrade path allowed me to do this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Taking advice of a forum I downloaded from ASUS site the official windows 8, yes windows 8 (not windows 8.1).</p>
<p>once again I downloaded windows 8 only drivers for my 643 bit system.&nbsp; I then right clicked and ran them in compatibility windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have a fully functioning d2x in a brand new windows 10 build and it works great.&nbsp; UYoull need to chage settings in Kodi or xbmc if you use that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>officially Id like to say that I'm getting defiantly better balanced sound, feels like I'm hearing a lot more sounds.&nbsp; I tried mad max fury road as the opening 10 minutes has&nbsp; become my default choice for sound testing and id say my d2x is about 20% better,
 I'm only using that percentage to give you the idea its not a little timey improvement its bnig enough to make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps some of you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try something similar 2 weeks ago but it didn't work back then so either my formatted hd or new things in windows 10 have solved this for me, either way I'm saying if you tried it before try it again now cause you might be surprised.&nbsp; I was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>none of this changed the fact tha asus needs to up their game in driver compatibility.&nbsp; I was looking as a asus motherboard, this process has changed my mind.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista Recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer to put it back
 to Factory Settings</span></span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Also ask them if it is possible to make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Drive failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their own way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD (not Dell, HP, Acer, etc Recovery Disk/s).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

    <title>WINDOWS Can&#39;t Get the Network Settings from the Router - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nancy3&#42;  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS Can&#39;t Get the Network Settings from the Router</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated both my desktop (HP) and laptop (Toshiba) from WINDOWS 7 to WINDOWS 10.&nbsp; Prior to the upgrades, I had no difficulty sharing my HP Inkjet 5740 series printer via wireless connection.&nbsp; I am now unable&nbsp; to connect the printer to my laptop.&nbsp;
 The wireless router is secure, connected and online.&nbsp; I am able to print from the desktop.&nbsp; However, the printer is "secure" but not connected on the laptop.&nbsp; It is does not connect automatically, and&nbsp;when I attempt to connect it manually (ensuring that I
 have the correct security pin number and/or password for the router), I receive the following message:&nbsp; "WINDOWS can't get the network settings from the router." I am certain that I have the correct security pin and password for the router, having located
 both on the router and on UBEE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched and tried solutions to similar problems found in the forum, hoping that I would "luck up" on something that works, but nothing.&nbsp; The drivers/software for all of the devices are up to date.&nbsp; No need to call Time Warner Cable as there is no
 indication of internet issues, since both the desktop and laptop are online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be most appreciative of any suggestions or solutions which can be provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response to my inquiry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to identify the issue with the set-up of the printer on my computer. &nbsp;Ultimately it was an issue with the Home Group, and I am now able to fully utilize my wireless set-up, including the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with the WINDOWS notification: &nbsp;"WINDOWS can't get the network settings from the router" remains. &nbsp;I called my cable provider to ensure the issue was not with the wireless set-up. &nbsp;It is now. &nbsp;TWC confirmed both the router pin number and security
 number. &nbsp;When I input the router pin number I get the above notification. &nbsp;When I input the security number I get a message that says it is the incorrect number. &nbsp;When I click the wifi icon on my laptop, it shows that my computer is "secured and connected".
 &nbsp;When I click on the HP printer identification, it only says "secured". &nbsp;I have called HP and have been advised that the issue is not with the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, the WINDOWS error messages are not preventing me from printing, but there is clearly a WINDOWS issue that remains....and was a non-issue before installing WINDOWS 10.</p>

<p>That sounds like something that you should bring up on the router vendor's web site...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps there is a firmware update, or something?</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the description, I understand that when you leave your Windows 8.1 idle for five or ten minutes, taskhost.exe starts up and uses 20-30 % of the CPU memory and after
 performing troubleshooting you identified that there is a dll file which is responsible for the high usage of CPU memory but you are unable to locate any such dll file. I will certainly help you with the same. However, we need few more details to understand
 the cause of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Have you recently made any changes on your computer, prior to the issue?</span></li><li><span>Do you get any error message or code when you resume working on your computer after some time?</span></li><li><span>Have you recently installed any security application or Windows Update?</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Is there any Windows Update which has been failed recently?</span></li></ol>
<p><span><br />
<em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note: To know the KB numbers of the failing updates, follow the underlying steps:</span></em><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />

<p><span>As of now I suggest you the following methods:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Boot the computer in a
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean Boot</a> state and check the status. A
<strong>clean boot</strong> helps to verify if any third party application service or startup item is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important</span></strong><span>: Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying
 if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow steps under “<strong>How to
 reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>” in the article to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform Clean Boot please open Command Prompt with administrative rights and perform sfc /scannow. Details are mentioned in Method 2.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would suggest you to perform
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SFC scan</a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> and check if that helps. The

            Hi, I've tried all your recommendations and there doesn't appear to be any dodgy files in Windows. Also it appears that there is no .dll running under the task as when I use the tasklist /m command in cmd taskhost.exe only comes up with NA. Not sure where
 to go from here apart from a fresh install. Cheers

<p><span>... and after performing troubleshooting you identified that there is a dll file which is responsible for the high usage of CPU memory&nbsp;</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>No, he said that he DIDN'T find any .dlls running. And I believe him. I bet he even used Process Monitor under Administrator mode to verify it. Because I have done that as well and sure enough, you can find taskhost.exe running without any other thing attached
 to it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Every other article seems to be copy-pasting what to do when you DO find a dll running. This is the only time I've seen anyone else ask what happens when there is NOT a dll running.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that makes things clearer.</p>

            FYI, I had this problem and figured out that the culprit was "Idle Maintenance". There is a separate thread on how to disable Idle Maintenance, found

<p>Hi Scarface,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. You can switch from party or game chat via the party options. There will be an option to switch to game chat if you are in party chat. There is no channel for this feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
