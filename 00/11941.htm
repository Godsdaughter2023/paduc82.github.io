</p><p>Announcement blog linked above does indicated some known issues and a possible fix:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some apps and games may crash due to a misconfiguration of advertising ID that happened in a prior build. Specifically, this issue affects new user accounts that were created on Build 15031. The misconfiguration can continue to persist after upgrading to
 later builds. The ACL on the registry key incorrectly denies access to the user and you can delete the following registry key to get out of this state:
<em>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AdvertisingInfo</em>.</li></ul>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you perform a soft reset. Press and hold the <strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and
</span><span><strong>Power</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />button until your phone vibrates and restarts. Note that you should
 not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing a soft reset, try to check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a soft reset didn't work, we suggest that you perform a hard reset instead. You can reset your phone under Settings:
<strong>Settings </strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt; about &gt; reset your phone.</strong> Make sure to back up all of your files before
 performing a hard reset. Go to<strong> Settings </strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt; Update and security &gt; Backup &gt;More options &gt; Back
 up now.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>6300 - bug when exiting sms editor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joewilliams---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            6300 - bug when exiting sms editor</h2>
                    I've got a Nokia 6300, firmware v5.00, on Orange UK.<br />
<br />
I've found an annoying bug when replying to text messages. This is what happens:<br />
- press 'reply'<br />
- compose message and press 'send'<br />
- press 'exit'<br />
- rather than exiting, the phone goes to the 'reply as' screen, giving me the choice of replying as a text or an MMS.<br />
- if I can press 'back', then the right soft key is now 'exit' and it works properly.<br />
<br />
Any ideas how to fix this?

            No, but there is a newer version of the 6300 firmware (v.5.5). Perhaps that would help.

            I've seen references to version 5.5, but Nokia Software Updater looks at my phone and swears blind that 5.0 is the latest version. The OTA update doesn't find anything either...

<p>I have got a Lumia 830 running the latest win 8.1. I am trying to upgrade to windows 10, which supposedly it is able to, but I am getting a 'not available for your device' notification from both, the upgrade advisor as well as windows insider. Needless to
 say I am not impressed at all with MS. Has anybody else experienced similar issues and found a workaround?</p>

<h2>            Battery ,Charging and performance issues with 640xl dual sim</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 640xl started to act very weirdly in the past week. First it was just very slow to open apps even the sim apps,alarm,calendar...etc not to mention about games and apps i've downloaded. After a day or two the battery started to run out pretty fast and
 charged very very slow.</p>
<p>To get an idea what slow and fast means in this case. With average everyday usage my battery was able to run my phone for about 2-3 days without charging and i had to charge for 3-4hours and now the battery runs for
<strong>2-4 hours </strong>even if i dont use the phone and have to charge for <strong>
6-8hours.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought the phone last year december and updated to windows 10 on the day it was officially released. Immediatly after the update i made a hard reset and done a soft reset after the problems have occured(couple of day ago).</p>
<p>It is charged with its charger 99% of the times.</p>
<p>The current version of the OS is :10.0.10586.164</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help and ideas are welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If its in the wrong topic feel free to replace.</p>

            You can use ActiveSync internet passthrough option to use your connected computers WIFI connection to get out to the internet, but there's no way to access any other network resources through an ActiveSync connection.<br />
<br />
If your device is wifi enabled, you can view the other connected computer's on your wifi network from the windows mobile device when it is on the network.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am facing problems with Syncing Contacts with iPhone.</p>
<p>All outlook contacts are syncing.</p>
<p>However, contacts linked with Apps like Skype, Google, Yahoo!, Linkedin are not syncing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to reconfigure my account in iPhone - that didn't work as well.</p>
<p>Is this a known issue or anything I am missing in the configuration.</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reconfiguring Outlook on the iPhone ( iPhone - 5 , iOS: 7.1.2 ) is NOT working.</p>
<p>I also disconnected the connected Service ( Skype, Yahoo! and Google ) and reconnected in Outlook.com</p>
<p>and also did the phone configuration again. No luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My contacts marked as "Outlook" are syncing in iPhone but not linked contacts from other services&nbsp;</p>
<p>( Skype, Yahoo! and Google ). These linked contacts are showing in people.live.com</p>

            <p>Hello KG,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for letting us know that reconfiguration to your iPhone doesn't help to sync your contacts. Let me try to help you on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that your contacts from Outlook.com and from other services are separated that's why you can't sync them just like what happen in your Outlook.com contacts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please visit this <strong><a href="https://people.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">People page</a>&nbsp;</strong>and check if you have added other services. If not, you can synchronize all contacts from connected services to your Outlook.com account that you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're done with this, kindly try to sync them again to your iPhone and verify if this will be unsuccessful. Kindly provide us the screenshot from People page where you encounter any error. You can post this in the private message area for security
 reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">: You need to click

</p><p>The question here is whether the Outlook.com (i.e. the web site) "Contacts" sync with the Outlook iPhone App (i.e. "People"). It does not appear so. I see no other place in the iPhone app where you can store contact information. People does sort of, but
 you cannot enter contact info such as phone or address and it does not sync with the contacts you have on the Outlook.com web site. How Microsoft has not thought of making the two compatible kind of boggles my mind. The iPhone app is great but what good is
 it if you cannot manage your contacts.</p>

We are October 26, 2016 **** Still cannot sync my contacts pictures from outlook.com server with my iPhone. Yes, I read a lot of complaints and I agree it's frustrating. I contacted Microsoft and I kind of chatted with an agent and he went in my computer to
 try to resolve the problem but with no success. I am tired of trying to sync those PEOPLE APP to my iPhone and to outlook.com. This problem has been going on for a while and I really do think that Microsoft people should know their product by the fingers.
 I went to Apple store just to see if my iPhone was OK and he did a test and everything is perfect. So, please Microsoft, understand this is a real issue that's been going on for a while and it has to be resolved soon because people are getting frustrated and
 tired. I really liked your product before the big step to WINDOWS 10 and all the updates, very nice work. But when it comes to solve a problem with your product at least be nice enough to solve it. In the meantime I hope you will find a solution, hopefully
 before Christmas 2016, it would be a really big gift for all of us who are having a problem.

                    <p>The mails I have deleted from my inbox (hotmail/outlook mail) keeps reappearing. This is not a computer vs mobile device issue as I check this only on my laptop(s). Keeps happening in the same log-in session and across different sessions. I have tried the
 delete icon, 'move to' and 'sweep' options and clearing deleted items folder. Sometimes the deleted items folder do not show the e-mails I deleted just then from the inbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This started about a month back, around the time Hotmail/outlook mail moved to the new UI.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Entourage is asking for root certificates that don&#39;t exist on my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Entourage is asking for root certificates that don&#39;t exist on my Mac</h2>
                    <p>I've set up two email accounts in Entourage 2004 on my MacMini (system 10.5.8) so that I can use Entourage as my email client for my (1) GMail account and (2) Comcast account.&nbsp; For both accounts I have their IMAP and SMTP settings correctly entered, and
 I can send and receive emails in Entourage to/from both accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, Entourage constantly generates an error message on both accounts:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Unable to establish a secure connection to </p>
<p>[imap.g.comcast.net] [gmail-imap.l.google.com] because the correct root certificate is not installed.&nbsp; If you continue, the information you view and send will not be secure."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select OK, both accounts can send/receive emails, but this message keeps popping up every few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it means that both services require me to specify secure SSL connections for their IMAPs but the required 'root certificates' from both ISPs are not present on my Mac, hence I am being alerted by Entourage that there is a 'security threat'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After considerable reading on various forums, I checked my keychain and discovered that there are NO certificates for GMail or Comcast on my PC.&nbsp; When I asked Comcast tech about this, they said they do not provide root certificates; it is Microsoft (creator
 of Entourage) who has to provide the root certificate(s).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further reading suggested that some root certificates supposedly get updated by system or program updates, but obviously my system, which is fully updated to its latest versions of Snow Leopard and Office 2004, has apparently never received any such updated
 root certificates for either GMail or Comcast IMAP services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this problem?&nbsp; Where do I get the certificates?&nbsp; Do they come from Microsoft, or Apple? If I could get them, I think I have the instructions for loading them into the Keychain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Admittedly, the Snow Leopard system I'm using, and the very old Entourage version, are quite dated, but I am hoping that a solution exists somewhere to this vexing problem short of spending hundreds of dollars updating my system and applications just to
 make an error message go away.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You have been provided with a workaround to do it. BUT, since it is a workaround it does have limits, and as in this case, sometimes one of those limits is to defeat the workaround in specific situations, ie Save As.</p>

<p>When you click a Help link in Word, we want to take you to helpful information. Sometimes we have a clear idea of what people are looking for, like how to

<p>In those cases, please use this discussion to tell us what you’re looking for. What were you working on in Word, and what information did you expect in Help?</p>

<p>Not only is this discussion an opportunity for you to get an answer to your question, it’s also a way for us to learn how to improve Word Help. Thanks for helping!

<p>The Office 2016 applications now have the File menu &gt; Feedback command.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The 2 “smiley face” buttons just submit ideas, with no possibility of feedback.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The third “I Have a Suggestion” button. It connects you to the appropriate “UserVoice” subsite.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There you can make a suggestion. During the start of the process it does a keyword search looking for similar existing suggestions. You can pick an existing suggestion to vote for (and add a comment to or you can submit a new suggestion.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Copy the link to the suggestion and post it back in the Answers forum if you had a question started there.
</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>A better place to submit this type of feedback the “UserVoice” forum. You can submit suggestions for “new feature requests”, “change existing feature requests” or actual “bug reports” to the forum either by “voting” and commenting on a similar existing suggestion
 or by creating a new suggestion for others to vote and comment on.</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>When MS determines there is “enough” interest they will change the status of the post to indicate if they are going to work on it or ignore it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>What is “enough” interest is totally undefined. Some postings have been acted on with only a dozen or 2 votes and comments.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Others (like “bring back Picture Manager” continue to be ignored even though they have several hundred votes and comments.
</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>It is also a good idea to provide cross posted links.<span>&nbsp; </span>Put a link back to this answers.com posting on UserVoice, and add a reply here with a link to your specific posting on UserVoice.

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p>Go to UserVoice, either through specific links I’ve provided below or create your own suggestions there. That is where MS is looking specifically for this type of user feedback to bring them back to reality from what-ever lala-land they are working in when
 they make these “<em>improvements</em>”.&nbsp; Comments (and votes) like these in UserVoice helped to convince MS to roll back the “phat QAT” buttons in 2016 and to at least partially undo the 2016 changes to the way the Pen input works.</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>Please do copy the comments you’ve made here and paste them into comments in UserVoice. Also include a link to this question. If you do make a suggestion,
<strong>copy the link to the UserVoice suggestion and post it back on this question so other people with the same problem can vote for it and comment on it.</strong> (You’ll get faster action that way.) Please get all of your friends and co-workers who use
 Office to vote for your issue!</p>

Since Word 2016 was published, it has very serious performance issues on devices with high resolution displays like the Surface Book and Surface Pro. As soon as a document is longer than about 1000 words, there is a terrible typing lag, i.e. text appears on
 screen much slower than you type. <br />
The typing lag is particularly bad in tables and when markup mode is used. </p>

            <p>JAMESmoney is right on point. The reply does not answer the question(solve the problem). The old msnmoney had the same problem until they allowed the software to recognize Money Market symbols like MLIXX. That change created a "work around" that allowed
 one to reflect cash held in portfolios.</p>

            <p>The 'Block withheld numbers' setting, in call and message filter &gt; Advanced, is causing this behaviour.</p>
<p>Please notice that toggling this to 'Off' will allow both calls and messages from withheld numbers. The filtering of withheld numbers can not be fine-tuned to allow only text messages.</p>

    <title>General Feedback about Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rockmoibebe  say:</h3>
<h2>            General Feedback about Win 10</h2>
                    <p>Ok, I know it's a preview, by all means not the RTM versions... but there are so many things for why Win 10 may very well go into history as another miss from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Since this place is about user feedback, here are some tiny and not so tiny things out of my head :<br />
<br />
A nice little sticky notes app, with no feature to organize them neatly on the desktop.<br />
<br />
A PC settings menu entry that does NOT link to the Control Panel (how useless). Furthermore, it does not even center its content many times.<br />
<br />
Apps that have the behavior of starting full screen all the time, requiring more clicks from the user.<br />
<br />
Store App nearly is nearly unmanageable. It does not look good and the UI is clearly designed for mobile. I have no time to drag though endless panes of useless stuff all the time, especially with a mouse only, in the right bottom corner.<br />
<br />
IExplorer still rates the worse of all browsers. Writing on this forum, I have had to enter my username and password every single time I wrote a message using IE. Firefox lets me log once and do all the work I want without nagging. Plus it looks so much better.
 IExplorer in Win 10 is the ugliest ever. The tabs on top, not separated by any spacing, particularly. Appearance does matter.. ask my girlfriend ;)<br />
<br />
Flat windows that look ugly and whose bottom right corner is very hard to grab for a resize. The way things have always been (for me anyway) : grab the window by the top, move it up and left, then resize from the bottom right corner. Win 10 not doing good in
 that regard.<br />
<br />
(On the topic of this forum, it's a nightmare to browse around. Ever heard of pHp BBS's? They are everywhere. Could you not write something similar if you don't want to use it?)<br />
<br />
Microsoft : will you get rid (as an option of course !), once and for all, of those pesky Favorites, MyDocuments, MyMusic, MyVideos etc entries in the Explorer? Never used them, never will and they have been cluttering the precious left pane space of the explorer
 for more Win releases that I care to remember. As a PC user since 1985, a PC has always started from the C:\ (root), not : "ThisPC". The MyAnything and lately the Librairies stuff has been an annoyance. There are drives, then folders, then files, end of story.
 How about an option : /expertmode on the explorer shortcut command line?. I don't want a Home, I don't want Favorites, nor Frequents nor Recents. And my pet peeve about explorer has always been those large Icons. Can I have an explorer that sticks to the Details
 view? I manage thousands of files, and every time I change folders, back to the big Icons view. Win 10 seems to behave better in that regard, let's keep that trend. But I fear this will end when I access folders with mixed media.
<br />
<br />
Mac users have benefited from a gorgeous looking GUI since : always. With windows, it's been a step backward every time since Vista. Let's face it, Win 10 looks ugly. Flat looking menus, flat windows, flat everything. Now I am not entirely against the flat
 look and the large fonts used for example in the PC settings screen. It is easy to read. But can't a little touch of class be added without going disturbing? Truth be told, every time MS has been issuing something new, it looked more amateurish than the time
 before.<br />
<br />
And now my biggest pet peeve : what's with the obsession with connecting into accounts all the time, enter an account here, a password there and now a reminder question???? I made the mistake of using Windows Feedback to help make the system better, and I was
 forced into transferring my outlook account into a Microsoft account. After a few nag screens, I ended up with a computer that would not boot without logging into MS account. No option to disable that either. NOT&nbsp; ACCEPTABLE. I ended up reformatting and re-installing
 Win 10 for a third time.<br />
<br />
My reality is that a PC should be able to work off-line as a preferred method. That was the worse about Windows 8, bringing me Headlines, stock options and meteo from Scotland. Requires extra user action to switch back and forth Avion mode all the time.<br />
<br />
My opinion is that you (MS) got to listen and deliver, not the old MS line : Well it's gonna be this way from now on!<br />
<br />
Believe me, I am trying to be positive here, but users that get what they want are more satisfied than users being told what they should like. None of the Windows version since Vista have been headed the way that would make me a more satisfied Windows user,
 but I am silll hopeful.</p>

            <p>I agree with <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/929d4d07-3718-4ee2-90dd-760f109ff119" title="rockmoibebe">
rockmoibebe</a> on everything he wrote, but I'd still like to put my two cents in.....<br />
<br />
First, I'd like to cover aesthetics. I do like the look of the application icons, but that's pretty much the only thing I like. The rest of the UI is disgusting. The flat colors and shapes make the OS look like that thing Yahoo tried to get started back in
 the 90's and makes it look cartoon like, which makes it difficult to take you guys seriously. For the love of God, why haven't you guys implemented backwards compatible themes yet? Part of the BIG issue that people are complaining of is that things don't look
 like they used to. Microsoft, if you want to appeal to the majority of the public, I implore you give your users the option of changing the Windows theme to everything from Windows 98 on up to Windows 7 and whatever the Hell else you "Think" is cool and hip.
 That will give you guys a HUGE step up in the right direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, why do you guys insist on forcing the Micro$haft Account on all of your users? Not everyone wishes to have this, nor should everyone be forced to integrate it into their desktop. I don't like the idea of my personal files being transferred to your
 cloud service by default. They're MY files and I want to keep it that way.<br />
<br />
Third, A HUGE problem I have with your OS's since the advent of Windows 8 is this whole UEFI secure boot ****. How the heck am I supposed to repair an infected system when I can't even get into bios without first having to boot into Windows which I can't do
 because the system is so overrun by virus' it doesn't even boot? JUNK IT or FIX IT!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fourth, What's with these friggin' tiles? It's great that you guys are bringing back the start menu, but why the tiles? Please don't let this start menu make the final cut, just bring it back to the way it was, don't fix what ain't broke. If you guys are
 so Hell bent on keeping the tiles, then make a launcher like you did in Windows 8.1 and make it a hot corner at the TOP LEFT or something. What's so hard about keeping things separate?<br />
<br />
Fifth, Borderless windows........Why? I thought Aero looked pretty good, why did you trash that? Heck, the Aero style might be just enough to bring me back to Windows. Window borders are essential to a desktop experience, it helps define the separation between
 adjacent windows. Now your desktop just looks cluttered and unorganized. GARBAGE!!!<br />
<br />
Final Thoughts. Since the dawn of Windows 8, I've looked elsewhere for my OS needs, most notably the Linux Mint Cinnamon series. They have everything I could ever need and want in an operating system. They truly made the PC personal. The greatest thing about
 it is that I can fully customize it to fit my needs WITHOUT needing 3rd applications to hack core system files. Multiple desktops, Hot Corners, Awesome themes, great apps, and excellent performance, and it's FREE!!! Why can't a multi-billion dollar organization
 match that? What's so hard about giving your users OPTIONS? That's why you guys have been tokened "Micro$haft", it's because you stick it right to your users and charge 'em an arm and a leg for it. I'm getting myself angry, I digress. In my eyes, the ONLY
 thing that Windows is good for nowadays is for gaming. It's nothing more than another gaming console, and it looks like that's what you guys are shooting for, so in that sense, GREAT JOB!!!</p>

            <p>I agree to all said above and have two own points about Win10 Preview:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. After one Update my Sidewinder keyboard didn't show any LED about caps lock, numeric on/off etc. Only the macro LEDs still worked.</p>
<p>2. Yesterday the Win10 Preview stopped working. Nothing helps, it's dead. Maybe MS could add a function that really helps starting a functional version of Win. The "refreshing" did about nothing than wasting about one hour of my time. I think it had again
 something to do with an update, because after a total freeze Win told me it would apply updates. Next step was Windows couldn't be started. I tried normal start and then "refreshing" Win, where everything should have been as good as new. That didn't work.
 Now it's restarting about every hour when it thinks all is completely refreshed. Tried for about 3 hours. Now I work with my XP that I had installed on the computer for my old games and programs that won't work on anything newer.</p>
<p>Thumbs up for XP, it works!</p>

            <p>I have been testing each version of windows since project Memphis (Win98) and this is the first time I am seeing a good feedback system and active community involvement instead of an Email address to send input to where there is no reply or collaboration
 from the testers.</p>
<p>I think the First build was more akin of them scrapping windows 8 and going back to a base of 7 and slowly working forward to 8, what it appears they are looking for is the happy medium between the two.&nbsp; If there is enough feedback when the changes go wrong
 and when they go right then it can get closer to what the customers are wanting.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>As of current the One Shoe fits all formula seems to be worst thing about the test, the current build is getting closer to what tablets need and want while it is taking away from what enterprise, programmers and desktop users need and want.&nbsp; BUT this latest
 version is the first time I seen the windows platform being able to attempt to switch between the two.&nbsp; It is in my Honest Opinion that when in desktop mode Microsoft should head toward the windows 7 style interface with niceties of windows 8 added on, but
 when switched to tablet mode it should convert closer to the windows 8 /tablet/phone style.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The problem it appears is by supporting both options it bloats the size of windows 10, so they are trying to find a place somewhere in between that appeals to the Majority of users.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Funniest thing is Microsoft had the perfect windows tablet in around the WindowsXP embedded small foot print, it looked like the desktop it handled like the desktop and it was a truly unified platform, if you could use it on XP you could on the XP embedded
 if you had enough ram and storage space, if you knew how to use XP you knew how to use the tablet.&nbsp; Then the Ipad came out and the Google tablet, and Microsoft decided they needed to look and act like those pieces of junk which both of them looked like they
 were trying to copy the failed AOL layout.&nbsp; The idea of the tablet and windows phones should have stayed "the power of your PC in the Palm of your hand."&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead of duplicating the successful duplicates of a failure.</p>
<p>The best way for us Techs and Developers to get Microsoft back on the right track is forums and feedback and a lot of it.&nbsp; Silence here is the Enemy, getting upset and saying this will not work, honestly will not work we will get stuck with another windows8
 mess.&nbsp; The way the testing seems to look is the updates are forcing us to play with the new U/I get our honest opinions on what is good and what is fail, then shifting things back and forth until they find the cries of fail fall off.&nbsp; If something in this
 test fails Tell them don't suffer in silence or uninstall and walk away.&nbsp; It appears they are trying to listen for once, but it don't help if all they get to listen to is "Boo, fail" and Crickets tell them why it is failing.</p>
<p>Now I will go on the Record and say I do believe that the move away from Isolated non net connected server / client structure may be a bad move, keep the support for that, don't try to shoe horn one solution for all but give choice and don't charge for the
 choice that would be the best way Microsoft can pull out of this mess.&nbsp; For example the Normal everyday bathroom has a Tub a Toilet and a Sink. Each has a Unique function, Yes all three are made out of the same materials same plumbing come from the same source
 and end at the same sewer, but we don't need all three devices to be Identical that will fail every time.&nbsp; The OS is the same, you got three platforms (four if you count the Xbox) they need to work together seamlessly, but they do not all need to be the same.</p>
<p>Now my biggest complaint so far is we need some type of change log file telling us in plain English what Microsoft changes with each update, and what they intended it do. So we can better comment on what works what doesn't and what is just plain out wrong.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Your not being given a choice so much as being shown a path. If you want to use windows, this is where it is going.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 will be "offered" as a free upgrade to win7 and win8 users. Then it will be forced upon us by discontinuing support for those OS's.</p>

<p>Store App nearly is nearly unmanageable. It does not look good and the UI is clearly designed for mobile. I have no time to drag though endless panes of useless stuff all the time, especially with a mouse only, in the right bottom corner.<br />
<br />
IExplorer still rates the worse of all browsers. Writing on this forum, I have had to enter my username and password every single time I wrote a message using IE. Firefox lets me log once and do all the work I want without nagging. Plus it looks so much better.
 IExplorer in Win 10 is the ugliest ever. The tabs on top, not separated by any spacing, particularly. Appearance does matter.. ask my girlfriend ;)<br />
<br />
Microsoft : will you get rid (as an option of course !), once and for all, of those pesky Favorites, MyDocuments, MyMusic, MyVideos etc entries in the Explorer? Never used them, never will and they have been cluttering the precious left pane space of the explorer
 for more Win releases that I care to remember. As a PC user since 1985, a PC has always started from the C:\ (root), not : "ThisPC". The MyAnything and lately the Librairies stuff has been an annoyance. There are drives, then folders, then files, end of story.
 How about an option : /expertmode on the explorer shortcut command line?. I don't want a Home, I don't want Favorites, nor Frequents nor Recents. And my pet peeve about explorer has always been those large Icons. Can I have an explorer that sticks to the Details
 view? I manage thousands of files, and every time I change folders, back to the big Icons view. Win 10 seems to behave better in that regard, let's keep that trend. But I fear this will end when I access folders with mixed media.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Store is very 'visually' impaired and needs better search options. The store should be able to find personalized apps of the user and deliver similar apps. I don't want game apps (unless searched for); I don't want or use Facebook... please stop the forcing
 on Windows users. It is continually changing privacy &amp; security settings and I want NOTHING to do with Facebook at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am breathlessly waiting for Spartan and the end of IE, finally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Agree that Libraries has to be one of the worst concepts ever! I hate the 'Recently Used,' 'Favorites,' and all the rest of the 'My Documents' 'Documents' dilemma. I always want to go to 'This PC' or to a drive where I have files and folders stored. Not
 this Frankensteinish navigation which is deliberately ambiguous and for a 'real' user, completely a waste of time and effort to get where I want. Since 'Explorer' is Windows, please fix this horrible design.</p>

            <p>This is where things get tricky.&nbsp; Microsoft are trying to please so many people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst I don't disagree that you are experiencing issues, to counter that I only use IE on a variety of platforms, for personal and business use and have no issues with it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I like the new UI.&nbsp; It's clean and crisp, once you have chosen a theme to suit you it's good to go.&nbsp; When I jump onto a 7 machine now it looks dated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My pictures etc - Agree, for a tech-savvy user these can be somewhat surplus as you will in all likelihood setup your own folder structure.&nbsp; But bear in mind that a good number of users can barely switch a PC on and open their pictures etc so simple-links
 like these are a godsend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess what I'm getting at is Microsoft are trying to create an O/S that suits the masses.&nbsp; Inevitably this will mean some people will like it, some not.&nbsp; All I would suggest they do is make it as customisable as possible so users with a greater tech knowledge
 and ability can tweak it to their hearts content.</p>

                    <p>&lt;Original title: Internet Explorer Issue&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having an issue with playing the game Bin Weevils on Internet Explorer. I have contacted the game owners and they gave me their top solutions but it has now helped resolve the issue. Here's the issues I am experiencing on the specific game, Bin Weevils:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When logging out and then back into the game, it says "Bin Weevils is open in another tab" but it isn't and Internet Explorer seems to think I am still logged into the game, this doesn't happen on any other browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a typing problem in the game where it doesn't all appear, such as if I type "the cat jumped over the fox" only "the cat jumpd ov the ox" once again, this is only occurring in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have tried reseting Internet Explorer, re-installing Internet Explorer, Running Internet Explorer Trouleshooting FixIt</strong>
<strong>and</strong><strong> none of it worked.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
