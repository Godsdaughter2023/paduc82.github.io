<h2>            Windows SDK 10 is not installing</h2>
                    Hey, I mistakenly deleted the windows 10 sdk folder from my Windows Kits folder, Now when I try to install it again using the official installer it says that SDK is already installed on my computer, I even tried to install it trough visual studio but still
 no luck. I know its not working as well because i cant use c++ on visual studio anymore. (I'm using visual studio 2017 if that matters in any way).

<h2>            Unable to save files in documents folder on windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to windows 10 suddenly I am unable to save files in the documents folder. When I move or paste any file in the documents folder, it asks for permission and thus by clicking continue I'm able to move files. But problems comes when I take any
 voice recording or picture through my webcam as a message appears saying that, "Before you can record, we need access to your documents folder." Problems also comes when I play games like NFS or GTA etc. that saves user data and save files in the documents
 folder as my progress is not being saved even if I try to manually save my progress, it doesn't. I would be thankful if somebody can tell me what to do to get rid of this issue.<br />

<h2>            Are Microsoft planning to release lightweight Windows for old&#47;low-end PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, everyone.</p>
<p>I have a question that Microsoft are planning to release lightweight Windows for old/low-end PC. Microsoft claims that Windows(10) is aimed for universial platform and connectivity. Such efforts already comes out in serveral features. Although this is right
 direction for the future, not all people can be satisfied because of their own environments or needs. At first, Windows 10 was lighter than current OS as I remembered. After RS2 updates, it becomes heavier. My main system is R5 2600X, so this system is not
 necessary lightweight OS. However, when I repaired the low-end or old computers of my neighbours, I felt Windows is too heavy compared to linux system like Fedora which I've used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my suggestion, Microsoft needs to release Windows enlightment version for those who have a cherished computer with the years or just need to core eco-system in Windows. In this way, It can be embraced
<span>obstinated </span>Windows 7 users who hate changes in the view point of the pure visible hardware performnaces and reserved resources.</p>

<p>There will be no 'lite' version of Windows 10. Instead, Windows is moving to the cloud, where it will become a service, like ChromeOS is today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a service, Windows will need less raw processing power like CPU and RAM, and less storage. In short, like a Chromebook is today. However, even a Chromebook needs up to date hardware to work with up to date software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with old hardware, specifically, is that the hardware manufacture doesn't support it on Windows 10. There's nothing Microsoft can do about that.</p>

    <title>Probable scam call from a woman posing as a Microsoft Tech engineer. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Probable scam call from a woman posing as a Microsoft Tech engineer.</h2>
                    I received a call from a woman claiming to be from the technical department at Microsoft, telling me my laptop was full of viruses and about to stop working completely. When she tried to explain to me that my laptop was about to just break and lose all
 of my data I sort of laughed it off knowing its fine and I have fully functioning anti-virus, and she very patronisingly told me off as it is a very serious matter. I think this is a ploy to make you follow through with her plan. She tried to make me go on
 various websites which I knew were remote access, she tried to get me to disable my anti-virus (I'm not that stupid) and she also said if I didn't pay a fee she wouldn't be able to help me and it would be my problem. She tried to convince me that the list
 of warnings/errors in the event viewer were serious viruses corrupting my laptop, but when I checked, none of them were and they went back to 2009. When I tried challenging her on this fact that if it was so serious why not ring 4 years ago, she didn't really
 have an answer. <br />
<br />
She gave me a phone number - 02081441094 so be wary if you see that number, and she called herself Veronica although she was speaking in a very strong Indian accent.<br />
<br />
So be careful, don't let these people worry or guilt you into giving them money, its just a scam!!!

            Same thing just happened to my mom. Lets just say she can be quite gullible and is a prime predatory candidate. This same thing just happened and she went through with it. They took her to a website and joined screens where they took control on the screen
 and pretty much showed her all this stuff and claimed it was her screen. They said they would remove it but she needs a protection plan and asked for credit card information. She refused and asked for an address to send payment to and they have her a New York
 address. My dad then called Microsoft, and they claimed that they could reverse it but it would be $169. This sketched me out so I asked him what number he called and he said he googled Microsoft Support and called that number which was "My Tech Gurus" who
 claim Microsoft hires them to handle tech support issues. This was yet another scam. They pay for Google AdWords for Microsoft Support and they try to do essentially the same thing that the original caller was doing, which was have you join screens and they
 can control your computer. They then said the removed it and wanted payment for $169 and I told my dad to tell the guy in chat no and restarted the computer. ran a security check and there was nothing found.
<div><br />
<div>Long story short this seems to be. Big scam going on because one of my friends received a similar call. Very very sketchy</div>

</span><span>Are you able to boot to the desktop?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;If this issue occurs, it may take about 30 minutes to revert the changes, and then the system will show the Windows logon screen.<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try all the steps which are names as Windows 8 from the following link:<br />

            <p>Thanks for your kind reply.&nbsp;As it turned out, I was on the right track if for the wrong reason.&nbsp; I let&nbsp;the&nbsp;Acer &nbsp;sit, and after about an hour--before it ran out of power, it came back up and had sorted itself out--which was a good thing, because I could
 do absolutely nothing with it short of surgery with a hammer&nbsp;until it did.&nbsp; Shortly after, I found a Q&amp;A thread on the Acer support site dealing with this very issue that verified my experience.&nbsp; On the good side, it's been a whole 48 hours since the latest
 refresh, and I can still open the store.</p>

            No one offered a sensible solution to this problem but simply wait for the system to reconfigure itself. I have a message saying " failure configuring windows updates. Reverting changes. Do not turn off your computer". There's nothing wrong with my lap
 top or acer but it's Microsoft updates that are the problem so how do we fix this you Microsoft ****! Stop sending out updates that **** on our computers.

            <p>Sorry, no expert here.&nbsp; The best I can tell you is to back up anything you want to keep, delete anything you don't, and do around of CC cleaner at least.&nbsp; .&nbsp; Don't forget to go to the Acer&nbsp;site (or manufacturer of your machine) &nbsp;and upgrade the bios and
 anything else that might need it.&nbsp; I believe there are instructions there as well for the 8.1 update.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, there isn't any short cut for the 200 updates.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing--mine came factory-installed with McAfee, and try as I might to get rid of it, every time I did, Microsoft update stopped working.&nbsp; I finally gave up and let it stay, and my computer has stayed stable ever since.&nbsp; There may be a way to do
 it, but I never found it.&nbsp; Just paid the $40 for the next year's subscription. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>The problem here is, there are lots of failures and rollbacks. If you have the SSU installed, reboot&nbsp;and then the other updates, based on my test on few OEM laptops (Traditional HDD), refresh to preinstalled OS without any update, and then update, it takes
 around 1 hour to 2 hours to finish. SSD will be finished within an hour. Of course, it depends on the network speed, consider there are 90+ hotfixes need to be downloaded, and it may takes additional hours to download these hotfixes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The expected process is</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Fresh installed Windows 8</p>
<p>2. Update the Windows update agent, and&nbsp;reboot, take maybe 10 minutes</p>
<p>3. Install the SSU <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2871777/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>4. Download 90+ hotfixes.. Download time depends on the network speed. Install time depends on the computer CPU/Disk, should be less than 3 hours in normal situation.
</p>
<p>5. Reboot and update again, it's now less than 10 hotfixes. Install and reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the total process takes longer than 5 hours, check the Windows update, view update history to see if there any failure. Failure means extra time in the rollback and the retry.

    <title>Windows 10 Mail App -- Cannot delete Outlook&#47;365 Exchange account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacob roseberry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App -- Cannot delete Outlook&#47;365 Exchange account</h2>
                    <p>I updated to Windows 10 the day it came out (the big release version, not developper builds). &nbsp;I set up the mail app first thing, and I haven't had any problems until this week. &nbsp;Starting Monday, I began to change my primary email account from one Gmail
 to another. &nbsp;DIfficult job, but manageable. &nbsp;Now the problem is the Windows 10 Mail App. &nbsp;There's one account I want to delete but can't. &nbsp;The app labels it as an Outlook account (if I go into settings and click on it, it asks about changing the Outlook account
 settings - regardless of what I name it). &nbsp;However, the icon it gives for it is for a 365 Exchange account, which I don't remember ever setting up. &nbsp;Alright, fine. &nbsp;I want to delete the account from the app anyway. &nbsp;However, unlike the other accounts, in which
 you go Settings-&gt;Accounts-&gt;Tap on account you want to edit-&gt;click "Delete this account", there's no option to delete this account for Outlook. &nbsp;There are two options: 1) Change mailbox sync settings, and 2) Change account settings. &nbsp;No delete option. &nbsp;The
 first one speaks for itself, but the second one takes me to my Microsoft Account homepage, with the banner up top and a little message below your picture that says "Hello!". &nbsp;Weird, because that still doesn't tell me if it's trying to take me to settings for
 an Outlook or Exchange account; if it is for the Outlook account, it's for the wrong address - I just changed my Outlook alias on Tues. and deleted the old alias, and in the Mail App, it shows only the old one (still takes me to the correct Microsoft account
 page though).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is: how do I delete this account, Outlook or Exchange or whatever it is? &nbsp;I've looked through the tutorials, no dice. &nbsp;Shows me how to delete my other accounts that I need, but not this one that I don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Side question: Any way to reorder the accounts under "All Accounts" when I click on accounts? &nbsp;I.E. move one to the top of the list and another to the bottom.</p>

                    <p><em>Original Title: Error code 0x80004005 - Windows Media Player</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I run a HP6 Desk Top with windows 8.1.</p>
<p>I recently updated the system.</p>
<p>In the past couple of days all music and video applications have been stuttering and been broken.</p>
<p>Contacted MSN Techs who have been helpful and provided temp solutions such as Touble shoot and turn on /off media settings.</p>
<p>I have also tried the following process to resolkve the issue ;</p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press windows key + x</span><span>2. Click Command prompt (admin)</span><span><span>3. Click Continue or supply Administrator credentials if prompted.<br />
4. In the Command Prompt window type the following, and press Enter:<strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; sfc /scannow</span></strong><br />
5. You should see the following on-screen messages:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginning the system scan. This process will take some time.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginning verification phase of system scan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verification % complete.<br />
6. Once the scan has completed, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved or not - THIS IDENTIFIED CORRUPT FILES BUT UNABLE TO RESOLVE.</span></span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Uninstall third party codec or plug-in.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>In case you have installed any third party codec or plug-in for Windows Media Player, please uninstall them to check if they're causing the problem.- NO ISSUES IDENTIFIED.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span> Register the following files and see if that makes any differences.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>, click

<h2>            Shortcut link fails to launch program. Tells me the file doesnt exist.</h2>
                    I have a mapped drive to a program folder on Windows server 2008R2. I then created a shortcut to the exe file in the program folder ( Im using Win7). Opening the shortcut tells me the file (*.exe) doesnt exist. I know it does exist. Problem is that it
 can "occasionally" work with a reboot. Any ideas? Can I rebuild the .lnk system? Odd that something so simple can be so frustrating.&nbsp;

            Well, I believe I discovered what my issue was on one of my PC's. I thought that we were all experiencing some new issues with the program since we had installed Symantec Endpoint AV Clients. After uninstalling the Symantec, most of the issues disappeared.&nbsp;
 I installed MS Essentials AV. I was still unable to double-click the shortcut and get the exe to launch on my PC. I ran a full scan on my PC to find that I had 10 instances of Exploit:Java/CVE-2010-0840.W. None of the other AVware: Symantec, Sophos, AVG or
 Avast identified the problems including Malwarebytes. After they were removed, I rebooted, rescanned, rebooted and the program launched multiple times. Its been fine ever since. Another small program, autoruns.exe from MS helped me remove some old removed
 program remnants that I was never able to get at. Uninstall usually doesnt uninstall everything. This lesson in frustration lead me to try extremes. Normally I would just reformat and reinstall the OS which is why I never store anything on the C: drive except
 the OS and programs. Sometimes the damage goes too far and reformat is the only option. Only time will tell if the recovery was successful. Thanks everyone for your help.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro - Ver 1511 - OS Build 10586.29</h2>
                    <p>An update for Windows 10 desktop was installed yesterday (12/15/2015).&nbsp; This is the update that finishes with the message "Hi.&nbsp; We've updated your PC.&nbsp; All your files . . .".&nbsp; The update process was not interrupted and completed successful.<br />
The update caused multiple problems:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Apps stopped working.&nbsp; All apps give the message "This app can't open"</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Can't download from MS Store.&nbsp; When I click on "Get the app", it appears that a window attempts to open and then immediately closes.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; Printer stopped working.&nbsp; I had to reinstall the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The desktop is an HP Compaq 6200 Pro MT PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used "settings-&gt;update&amp;security-&gt;recovery" to restore the previous version of Windows 10&nbsp; (see image below for resulting build details).&nbsp; The problems mentioned above still exist.&nbsp; I have only two tiles in the start panel: weather and clock.&nbsp; The weather
 tile seems to be working but the clock is not working.&nbsp; Clicking on either tile gives the message "This app can't open".</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a057dd0-bb9c-418f-bba0-3a9ddbf9c03f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a057dd0-bb9c-418f-bba0-3a9ddbf9c03f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Several apps are under intensified in the start menu : Calculator, Calendar, Clock,&nbsp; Get Office, Get Started, Groove Music, Mail, Maps, . . .</p>
<p>The under intensified apps and some of the other apps do not open - "This app can't open".<br />
</p>
<p>Windows 10 worked well before the update to version 1511.&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I restore Windows 10 to working condition?</p>

<p>
</p><p>As mentioned in my original post, I used "settings-&gt;update&amp;security-&gt;recovery" to restore the previous version of Windows 10.&nbsp; The only restore possible from here is back to Windows 7 Pro.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I am sorry to report that the procedure had no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to understand "$manifest&nbsp; (GetAppxPackage...)".&nbsp; It appears that the command line will try to install some package to a default location.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the "InstallLocation"? </li><li>Should I look to see if a package was correctly installed by the command line?&nbsp;

            These windows 10 updates are really hurting many here @ the Windows 10 forum which is mostly based on users upgrading from Win 7 or 8.1...I don't know why this is going on ...??M$ is of no help...you are amongst the other 80%...but there is no fix for
 the most part...the best solution is to use the 'Media' and re-install the newer version 10586 windows 10....it's all over the forum!!...The Media upgrade and Install tool should work as it was intended too...just follow the instructions...keep on experimenting.*john

<h2>            Forgot HotMail Password - how to reset</h2>
                    
Below are the instructions from the Microsoft support site. But when we do this (I'm helping someone) when you enter the email address and characters from the box it goes to a page that says it sent the new password to the email address you enter to start.
 In other words the email you don't know the answer to. It doesn't go to a screen that asks the question.
<br />


How to Reset a Forgotten Password
To reset your Windows Live Hotmail password, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Start Microsoft Internet Explorer, and then see the following Hotmail Web site:
<div><a href="http://www.hotmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hotmail.com</a>
<span>(http://www.hotmail.com) </span></div>
<span>(http://www.hotmail.com) </span></div>
</li><li>Click <strong>Forgot your password?</strong> . </li><li>Type the e-mail address of the Windows Live ID account for which you want to reset the password.
</li><li>Type the characters that you see in the box in the picture. Or, click the speaker icon, and then type the numbers that you hear.
</li><li>Click <strong>Continue</strong> . </li><li>Click <strong>Use my question to verify my identity</strong> .
</li><li>Enter the appropriate account information, answer your question, and then click
<strong>Continue</strong> . </li><li>Type your new password two times, and then click <strong>Continue</strong> .
</li></ol>

            Sorry, I cannot verify your reply as my problem was resolved as I done a system restore prior to your reply. I could barely remember that moment before encountering this "Error 720" problem I tried to access a wifi hotspot. may be that was a problem but
 i am not sure..
<div><br />
<div>anyway thanks for your reply...</div>

    <title>Family Safety DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ramalynnacademy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Family Safety DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE</h2>
                    <p>Background: I work at a small school with 25 Windows 7 computers running independently (no server). I have used Family Safety to control student users for the last 5 years. &nbsp; I started to update the computers to Windows 10 and soon realized that Family Safety
 is completely different. Not only do I have to set up each student with a Microsoft account, I then have to invite them to join the family and they have to accept. After I was able to invite 2 students to the family and they were able to accept, it stopped
 letting me send invites: (Red error that says "Please try again later. We can't do this right now.") After ELEVEN support help chats and 2 separate phone support with Tier 2 techs (over 3 hours total), I was told that I can only invite one student at a time
 AND they can only be on Microsoft Browser products. I was told by two different techs that I can have as many family members as I want, then yesterday they said I can only have 10 family members. So, I began to invite the students (after setting up the microsoft
 accounts) one at a time. When they opened their email, selected join family and then logged into their microsoft account, (mind you, all on Windows 10 computers using the Edge browser) they received this error: "Sorry, something went wrong. We're not sure
 what happened, but refreshing the page may help, or trying again in a little while." And no, refreshing the page doesn't work, and you can try as many times as you want, but it will NEVER work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the issues with Family Safety gets even worse. &nbsp;When I log into my account, I can see all of the Windows 7 devices that are protected by Family Safety. Everything looks normal, and it says they are being monitored. When I select a device, and then
 go into the web monitoring area, there is a small paragraph that says Family Safety only blocks sites when using a Microsoft Browser. What??? When did this happen??? &nbsp;<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family/faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/family/faq/</a>&nbsp;Since
 IE is notoriously poor and filled with spyware, malware and viruses, the students only use a more stable 3rd party browser. So basically, ALL of my Windows 7 computers have NO PARENTAL CONTROL over the browsers. And, ABSOLUTELY no advance notice was given.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so frustrated with the fact that Support has absolutely no clue how to help with the Windows 10 Family Safety issues. One phone support tech told me to search the error message and click on the first answer. I looked at what he was referring to, and
 it was a thread about Windows 7. At that point, I told him that he needed to transfer me to his supervisor. Which led to the Tier 2 support tech, who tried for an hour to make it work by controlling my computer, and then told me it was an account issue and
 transferred me to billing/accounts, who took 15 minutes to come to the realization that I should be transferred back to technical support. At that point, I told them to email me the answer to the problem, and I have not heard anything back, not even an email
 containing the support number.</p>
<p>If you are going to deploy a new system, shouldn't it actually work before you change old standards that require you to transfer to the new system?</p>

            <p>I agree it is ridiculous. &nbsp; &nbsp;I've been searching/googling around and have yet to find someone that actually uses the family feature successfully, so I can ask them about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The techs on this site obviously don't know anything about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you stated the blocking feature would only work on the Edge browser......but currently the whitelist URL feature isn't even a "whitelist only". &nbsp;Supposedly this will be fixed in the next major patch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure how the Application Blocking would work....as from what I could read/see it seems like you can only block apps that the child has already run at least once? &nbsp;I'm not positive on this....as I can't get it working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think MS screwed up on this and instead of providing a cloud solution that scales to multiple devices...it's given us a product that works on none. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Time to start searching for a 3rd party solution.</p>

            <p>FYI: &nbsp;I switched to "K9 web Protection". &nbsp;It's free, and it works well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main issue with K9 is that it doesn't scale to multiple pc's. &nbsp;In other words you need to configure each pc with K9 installed to have it's own inclusion/exclusion list (if thats what you are doing). &nbsp;You apparently can't export and copy settings from
 one PC to another. &nbsp;Luckily I only had 2 pc's for the kids.</p>
<p>Also it's settings are enforced for every user of the PC...it's not per account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll use this until I hear MS has their act together and revamps their Family Safety (or whatever they call it now) to work as intended.</p>

    <title>KB3000850 and limited disk space - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> driessenbeer  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB3000850 and limited disk space</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week I bought a cheap Windows 8.1 tablet (Surf 7 Tab / Emdoor 18270).</p>
<p>The device has limited disk space (16 GB), but so far this did not create any issues.</p>
<p>For my documents I have added a 64&nbsp;GB SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Around 8 GB&nbsp;is used for the system recovery and the rest is for the active partition.</p>
<p>After installing all updates I have 1.4 gb left.</p>
<p>Now I tried to install kb3000850, but this only leads to filling up my free disk space to the last MB and then stopping the update.</p>
<p>How can I install this update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought about cleaning up the&nbsp;WinSXS folder and remove unused packages. Or another option would be moving the recovery partition to a USB drive. That would free around 6.35 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or are there any other ways to have enough disk space for installing this update? Or is the limited disk space not the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>

            <p>You are on the right track, you can remove that partition as long as you are happy having a USB stick for recovery instead of the built in option,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be able to squeeze enough free space out to carry out the update if you do the following two tasks:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Run disk cleanup, using the option "Clean up system files", and select all the options. This should clear out the files used for recent updates, and any error log files.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. modify your pagefile settings - disable it while you run the update, then re-enable afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>let us know how you get on, or if you want more/different advice :)</p>

<p>You wont have to Activate windows&nbsp; 10 as long as it is just the hard drive you have replaced it will automatically Activate for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had to do any major hardware changes tho ie like&nbsp; the motherboard then you would have to contact Microsoft and talk to them about Activating your windows.</p>

            that is correct as long as your installing the same edition&nbsp; as you had before&nbsp;&nbsp; so if you have windows 10 pro just now&nbsp; install windows 10 pro&nbsp; not home.

<h2>            Product key from windows 7 doesn&#39;t work on Windows 10 restore</h2>
                    My computer was malfunctioning so I went to a computer repair store. They restored my laptop but it's now Windows 10. It was on Windows 7 before, I never upgraded it to 10 before. Now on Windows 10, it tells me that this version isn't activated yet. So
 I went to the Settings to Activate it, but when I clicked to Change product key and put in the product key number on a sticker that came with my laptop when I bought it for Windows 7, it won't recognize the key for Windows 10.&nbsp;<br />

            Hi Virginia
<br />
<br />I am sorry, the free upgrade period for Windows 10 ended at the beginning of 2016, it is no longer possible to activate Windows 10 with a Windows 7 licence key.
<br />
<br />They should not have installed Windows 10 on your system, you should go back y the Repair Shop and have then restore a fully licenced copy of Windows 7

            Hi VirginiaANg
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Yes, Windows 10 won't take Windows 7 key. You will need to go back to Windows 7.
<br />
<br />Go back to Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027936/windows-10-go-back-to-windows-7-or-windows-81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402793...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to continue on Windows 10, you will need to buy a Windows 10 license. Best place to buy Windows 10 license is Microsoft Store. Click below to buy it from Microsoft
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/windows</a>
<br />
<br />You will find that there are many online sites selling very cheap licenses, don't fall for them as majority of the times, keys expire after some time. 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi, I’m Virginia an independent advisor.
<br />Unfortunately the repair shop has probably installed a Windows 10 volume license so wouldn’t be valid anyway.
<br />Your options are to return the pc to the repair shop &amp; ask them to sort it, clean install Windows 7 or purchase a Windows 10 license.

            I tried that but it ended up still being Windows 10 after I clicked to return to a previous Windows, and my computer started up again instead of going back to Windows 7.&nbsp;

            That will work only if they upgraded from Windows 7 to 10. They had done the clean install. Hence click will have no use here.
<br />
<br />You will have to follow the second last paragraph - If you have a product key for your previous version of Windows, use the media creation tool to create installation media for Windows 8.1 or Windows 7, and then perform a clean install of Windows. If you need help finding your key, see Find your Windows product key.
<br />
<br />Best wishes from my side as this is will take half an hour to an hour to accomplish this.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The task bar doesn't seem to be minimised. It appears when I press Ctrl-Esc but then disappears again when I click in internet explorer. The task bar is locked. I've gone into the task manager and closed down explorer.exe and restarted it as a new task.
 I've turned the computer on and off again. I can't think of anything else to do! Please help! Thanks.</p>

            <p>This sounds like the IE window might be opening on top of the Taskbar. Drag the IE window from the side a bit to confirm. If it is opening on top of the Taskbar, see this.</p>
<p><strong>Keep Taskbar always on top in Windows 7&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Problem with Microsoft Habu and SP1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cat megex  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Microsoft Habu and SP1</h2>
                    (Note: I am currently using x86 Home Premium [with Service Pack 1, of course].)<br />
<br />
Prior to installing SP1, I had no problems with my mouse. After doing so, however, I could no longer use the Razer configuration utility to turn off the mouse's built-in lights. Feeling that it might be a driver incompatibility (I was using the v2.10 driver
 and v2.01 firmware), I installed the v2.13 driver and updated the firmware to v2.03, but the problem was not resolved. After some experimentation, I found that I also could not use the utility to change the DPI level for the mouse, though I could still do
 so by using the DPI up and DPI down buttons on the mouse itself.<br />
<br />
In addition, I found that, when I attempted using the profile-change button on the bottom of the mouse, the mouse would not work until I (circularly) iterated through the profiles and reached profile 2. As that is not the profile I normally use, I tried setting
 the profile back to profile 1 (the one I usually use) using the configuration utility and, interestingly, succeeded in doing so.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas?<br />

            Hello Cat Megex,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Sorry you are having a problem with this.&nbsp; One suggestion would be to perform a system restore prior to updates installed.&nbsp; Using the System Restore tool may not necessarily help you determine the issue. The System Restore tool uses restore points to return
 system files and settings to an earlier point in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in which you did not experience the issue. When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates
 that you installed are removed. <br />
<br />
&nbsp;If still no luck I would suggest going to the link below for Microsoft Hardware support.&nbsp; To the left of the link there is a support prompt for this product.&nbsp; Please let us know status.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />
