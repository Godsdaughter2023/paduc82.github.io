<h2>            Adding delays to a project</h2>
                    <p>I have been challenged to learn how to best show the impact of delays on our construction projects. &nbsp;I'm thinking of entering each delay as a separate activity and splitting the tasks affected by the delay but I would appreciate others input on how they
 handle this issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance..</p>

            <p>If you are waiting on work from others, ensure you have built the key decision points into your schedule - I'd use a milestone and link the tasks dependent upon those decisions.&nbsp; Baseline the project plan and get the owner to agree to the schedule.&nbsp; Also
 review the key decision points and show him/her that delays in those key tasks will delay the tasks following.&nbsp; If you need to delay the milestones - add a note to the task, enter the actual finish and watch the rest of the schedule shift.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then view the schedule variance by looking at the variance schedule.&nbsp; If you were on time but the owner caused the delay, it will show zero variance for the tasks leading to the milestone and positive variance for the milestone and tasks after.</p>

<p>For some reason my phone will not complete downloads from the Ovi store. That's a pity because some of the stuff on offer is really attractive!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there no way to simply have the apps downloaded to my PC and then transfer them (as .sis files?) by cable to my phone for installation? I can't find any option on the downloads pages which allows this.</p>

<p>You could send an SMS (link) to your phone which give you a link to d/l. You need to login to your account and ensure you check your phone model.</p>

<h2>            shape protection</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i encountered with problem. i can't ungroup original visio shape consisteing of two coumponents. I found this shape in visio stencils library. One of component is protected. I'm receiving message that "shape protection, container, and/or layer properties
 prevent complete of this command"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed protection to none in developer tab.</p>
<p>I tried "edit master shape"</p>
<p>I saw "drawing explorer" in developer tab</p>
<p>And with layer is all ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But i can't make them independent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>and more one thing: the shape itself has very small icon "sharepoint designer properties" in the corner, but this menu is not active :(&nbsp;<br />

I have a notice that my Office 2016 Subscription has expired. &nbsp;I click on the button to pay $9.99 per month then buy now and NOTHING HAPPENS. &nbsp;How can I get this taken care of? &nbsp;I've been at it for an hour and have completely lost patience with this.

                    How do you do an average on a filtered data range (without including the data in rows hidden following the filtering?). Using the standarad =average seems to include the hidden data in the average. Thank you for your prompt reponse

<h2>            Outlook 2016 not able to download OAB</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded to Windows 10 and Office 2016. Since then i cannot download the OAB and the error is; 0x800401F: The operation failed. An object cannot be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i had Office 2010 i had no issues, I have tried every option you can find even though they applied to earlier versions. There have been no changes to the exchange organization settings. Is there something I am missing in the configuration of Outlook
 2016 when connectiing to Exchange 2010 in cached mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a new profile and this results in the same error. Any ideas would be appreciated.</p>

            I have seen this issue elsewhere And I believe the root cause is Windows 10's inability to access the oab share on the server. There was a security setting someone changed in group policy that supposedly fixed it. Hopefully this gets you on the right track
 if you haven't fixed it already.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've been having the same issues - installed Windows 10, updated Office to Office to 2016 - and now can't send any emails anymore from any of my three hotmail and other similar accounts that i am using in Outlook, getting the same 0x800401F error message.
</p>
<p>I tried updating my profile, not sure though if I did correctly since Windows 10 control /settings panel a bit different from previous versions and I'm just a regular 'home' user, not an IT person. Detailed instructions on how to do this in Office<strong>
 2016</strong> would be awesome.</p>
<p>Also tried deleting and re-adding the account in Outlook as well, didn't help either.</p>
<p>Rather frustrated and regretting at this point updating to Win10 and Office '16, after having had other issues as well.</p>
<p>Any advice and help with resolving this will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Why is Microsoft software getting to be so bad&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is what I get when I am in the office 365 Microsoft word web app when I try to a word document using save as.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yup, a blank window, nothing in it...sort of like the minds of the support staff I get when I call Microsoft lately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could take the time to define every little detail about how I got to the blank screen, computer software, windows version, blah blah blah, but we all know where that ends up. Nowhere. The main hope of tech support is to blame it on the browser, or some
 other non microsoft product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, make this **** work. I pay for this service. You pay for a TV get home and it doesn't work, do you call panasonic, get out your soldering gun and toolbox, and try to help them fix the TV? I think not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting so freaking pissed at microsoft software not functioning even for a task as simple as saving a document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No replies from Microsoft please. I simply won't get involved. People just need to start complaining more instead of bending over and giving up free time to diagnose and fix **** for microsoft.</p>

<p>With all due respect, I am fully aware I have word the word desktop version that I can use, but the post was regarding the web app.

<h2>            Setting up an archive folder - Outlook for Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>From what I've read online, it seems that the Archive folder is defaulted on my computer. However, I do not recall setting it up previously, nor do I see that folder within the folder list on the left.</p>
<p>And emails that I've been testing the archive function on just seem to disappear.</p>
<p>Any tips or help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Alvin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. Based on your description, there aren't archive folder under your mailbox, maybe you chosen an existing folder to archive email after you click the "Archive" folder, so I suggest
 you can try to find archive folder in you Outlook for mac:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Try to send a test email with a special subject to the inbox.</span></li><li><span>Click archive button to archive this email.</span></li><li><span>Then you can search this test email with the special subject in each folder under your mailbox.</span></li><li><span>Once you find this test email in a folder, this folder is the archive folder which emails go to after clicking the archive button.</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If above methods still can't help you to find the archive folder,
</span><span>we have dedicated support channel for Outlook for mac issues. You can contact them Outlook for mac issues and getting better support (</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Go to Help &gt; Contact Support</span><span>).
 And they will be happy </span><span>to work </span><span>with you.</span></p>

<h2>            Powerpoint 2016 for a Mac&#58;  What is the difference between a retail license and any other, after the money ask for is always the same.</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased a license for Powerpoint 2016 for Mac. &nbsp;All I wanted was to change a powerpoint &nbsp;presentation into a video. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will not happen, enough after I was forced to buy Office 365 as well as Powerpoint. The reason, the licence that came with my Big Box store purchase is the wrong type!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am no further ahead despite spending hundreds of dollars, thank you so much I haven't felt this ripped off for years.</p>

            <p>Well, a few points of clarification although I doubt they will do much to make you feel better :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, PPt - for Mac or Windows - never has been offered as a standalone program since Microsoft obtained the original
<em>Presenter</em> program by acquiring a company called <em>Forethought, Inc. </em>
more than a quarter of a century ago. It was incorporated into the Office Suite as PowerPoint &amp; the only way to obtain it [legally] was to license one of the complete packages. It's been that way ever since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, <em>PPt 2016 for Mac </em>does not have the facility to output files in video format. This is the case regardless of what type of license you purchase. Video export currently is available in the Windows version only. If you use criteria such as
<em>export video</em> in the Community's&nbsp; <em><strong>Search</strong></em> feature you'll find numerous conversations which provide suggestions for alternative approaches, such as what John Korchok describes here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_powerpoint-mso_mac/export-to-video-format-mp4-or-mov/2ab175fe-efd6-4169-8d25-f44097914ed9">
export to video format (MP4 or MOV) </a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As for licensing the Office suite, there are 2 options - this is a nutshell explanation of the difference:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Office 2016 Retail License: </strong>You make a <em>one time</em> payment for Office 2016 for Mac or for Windows. It entitles you to use that specific version forever &amp; you will continue to receive periodic
<em>up<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">dates</span></em> as long as the version is supported. However, if you wish to
<em>up</em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>grade</em></span> to a new version when one is released you will have to pay for it. IOW, it's "business as usual".</li><li><strong>Office 365 Subscription:</strong> Software subscription is a relatively new marketing concept. If you go this way, you pay a
<em>monthly</em> or <em>annual</em> fee to license the Office suite. A subscription also may allow for installation on more than 1 computer or device depending on the specific plan. Moreover, you not only receive the updates to Office 2016, but you'll continue
 to be provided with the latest released version as long as you maintain your subscription. Basically, the software is maintained current forever but the payments continue forever as well... What I refer to as the
<em>perpetual payment plan</em>.</li></ul>
<p>Another distinction is that Microsoft has demonstrated that many of the new features &amp; enhancements to Office 2016 will be provided to Office 365 subscribers only. Those with a Retail License will have to invest in a new version that offers those features
 when it becomes available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I would assume that before investing "hundreds of dollars" in a tool to do a specific task that you attempted to confirm that the tool could handle that task. If you were misinformed by the retailer I'd suggest you contact them to obtain a refund
 or adjustment. Microsoft offers a 30-day return policy on Retail packages &amp; Subscriptions can be cancelled at any time.</p>

            <p>Thanks Bob:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your right I am not real happy about your response however thank you very much for it. &nbsp;It seems odd being held by the throat by a dead man (Steve Jobs). &nbsp;It is also an disturbing to know how easily a novice can be caught up between two corporations that
 obviously care more for making a buck every day than being forwright about thier capabilities.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have used Windows PowerPoint for years as a teacher. I am now retired, so using pp seemed normal, except of course I use a Mac At home. There is the problem. Also can one really argue that when against licensing of a product the process should be simple?
 The box store apparently had no idea I would not be able to use PowerPoint to charge a pp into a video. This whole situation is ridiculous.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the info Steve - I stand corrected re the Windows side, but I stand firm on the Mac version :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently this is a new availability for the 2016 release that I have never seen. Looks like it's only available from the MS Store, though - Neither Amazon nor any other sources I've checked have any awareness of it, either... but I guess I shouldn't be
 surprised. Seems like we're always the last to know. Can you spell "NDA"?</p>

            <p>A new availability? This feature is heavily advertised as one of the best ways of converting PP into videos. Thank you for finding out the availabilitcan only be purchased at Microsoft Stores however, perhaps that fact should be given to big stores as well.</p>

            <p>I believe you may have misunderstood... This did not pertain to any specific <em>
feature</em> of PPt, it is in regard to the fact that PPt 2016 for Mac is now available for purchase as a standalone program. The features of the software are no different regardless of whether one purchases the program separately or as a component of the Office
 2016 for Mac suite.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only distinction is that those with an Office 365 subscription are being provided features which are not available to those who purchase a Retail License. AFAICT, PPt alone is available only as a Retail License, you can't subscribe to just that one program.<br />

            Here's a little known secret (obviously completely unknown at Microsoft). I have a retail version of Office 2016 for Mac on one OS X boot disk, and Office 365 on another. On both disks, I've signed up as an Office Insider (the option is visible on the
 Microsoft AutoUpdate dialog). Since I did this, I get Office 365 features showing up in my retail version. If you have 2 startup disks, this could be worth a try: sign up to an
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-us/try" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 30-day trial</a>. Then sign up as an Insider and update your trial. Then reboot to your disk that has the retail version and choose
<strong>Help&gt;Check for Updates</strong>. If you're lucky, you'll download the video export feature. I'm sure this is an MS programming slipup, and it probably won't last long now that I've blabbed about it, but it's worth a try to see if you can snag video
 export.

<p><span>The ability to produce Composite CMYK</span><span> has been removed from Pub 2013, both versions. I am guessing that the stand alone version you are looking at it actually 2010.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks, DavidF<br />
<br />
Tried to follow the suggested thread, but there's too many alternative ideas for me to follow how to get CMYK.<br />
<br />
The screenshots in my question above are from my stand alone Publisher 2010 on my own laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get into work tomorrow I'll check to see if the Workstations with Office 2010 directly installed on them have the "Choose Color Mode option", as they should do - as the 2013 version doesn't.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A problem we have with Publisher is that the Server based Publisher 2013 somehow has different settings to the Stand alone Publisher 2013. That is to say that text which fills a text box on a page in the server version will overflow by a number of lines
 when viewed in the stand alone version. So it is key to convert to CMYK PDF in the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the same applies for the 2010 server based Office (as in CMYK is available) then I guess it's best to take a step back to Office 2010 on the server as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The company used to use Publisher 2007, and use a program called PDF redirect to create the CMYK PDF with crop marks etc. I'm trying to get them out of using third party programs and make the whole process easier - hence the thought of perhaps Office 2010
 on the server.</p>

            <p>To the best of my knowledge MS stripped the ability to create CMYK color from Publisher 2013 regardless of the version. I have the free standing version on a Win 7 machine. There is no workaround that I know of other than the one poster suggesting that if
 you linked a CMYK image rather than embedding it that would be communicate that data to the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The text flow problem you are seeing might be attributed to the Windows version. Pub files produced on Win7 or older do not render the same on Win8 machines, and the opposite is true. It is a documented bug that MS has thus far not fixed. The one fix suggested
 thus far is to load the Win7 fonts on the Win8 machine. I can provide some links if you want to read more, but check to see if the machines have different OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the text rendering issue is not the Win8 font issue then check the line spacing in the paragraph. The default was changed as of Pub 2010 from 1 to 1.19 and 0 spaces before and after to 6. This can create problems when you copy and paste from older publications.</p>

            <p>Let me start by saying that I have minimal experience with servers, and server installed software.<br />
<br />
The workstations are Windows 7 with Office 2013 professional installed on the C drive. These workstations can log in and access the organisation server, which I think is running server 2012 - it has a Windows 8 style to it. The server has Office 2013 professional
 loaded on it, which any workstation can access.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So we can either access Office on the desktop - or log into the server and access a different Office 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The display difference when viewing the same document on the 2 Publishers is not the line spacing, as I've had to change to 1sp when the document is viewed on the desktop so that the text is all displayed. When I change a text box to 1sp and save that -
 when I then view it on the server Publisher, then the text has a number of empty lines at the bottom of the text box.</p>
<p>I've looked at every setting that I can think off to see why it differs, but have failed. I have advanced MS Office training, so you can appreciate that I've looked at all sorts of settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But - if Office 2010 installed on the server will provide "Choose Color Mode" so that we can go with CMYK, then that is the route to go. The process has to be easy and simple due to the knowledge and skills of the staff that create/edit the Newsletters,
 etc.</p>

            <p><span>It appears that text in Publisher text boxes is rendered differently on Windows 8 machines. It has been reported that you will get about 5% more text in each Publisher text box although font size, spacing, etc are all the same as machines with Windows
 7 and older OS. Based on what you are saying it sounds like 'server 2012' has the same problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not heard this before but if you want to read more about the Win8 font issue here are some reference threads:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Poor font rendering in Windows 8 (blurry text): <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-performance/poor-font-rendering-in-windows-8-blurry-text/f52a2002-d748-485c-8b9c-4862806ea94a">

 the text boxes&nbsp;between Win7 and Win8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Publisher 2010 not working with windows 8.1: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-publish/publisher-2010-not-working-with-windows-81/3146f30f-bda1-479a-909d-2ee53fdea713">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-publish/publisher-2010-not-working-with-windows-81/3146f30f-bda1-479a-909d-2ee53fdea713</a> - Says that if you "When I switched to Windows 8, I ran it in windows compatibility mode for windows 7 and
 it worked just fine." - This suggests that you might see if 'server 2012' can be changed to run in Win7 mode though this is probably not a company wide option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the current situation it would be best if you only use the locally installed versions of Publisher to get consistent layouts. Publisher has never played well across a network anyway, and if the 'server 2012' OS is going to ruin your page layout and
 formatting then work only on the workstations with Win7. If the files need to be shared then
<em>open from</em> and <em>save to</em> the local hard drive and then <em>copy</em> the file to the shared network server. And before editing that file, copy back to the local hard drive. Extra steps yes, but at least with this workflow your pub files will
 render the same on all workstations with Win7 installed. Further you are less likely to corrupt the Publisher files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest you ask your printer if they can work with 'commercial grade RBG formatted PDF files' instead of CMYK. As MS suggested in their blog post explaining/spinning why they made this decision to strip CMYK from Pub 2013 they assert that most
 printers can work with RBG...that they may need to add a few steps to their process and workflow but it is possible to get commercial quality from RBG. If your printer can work with RBG then your problem is solved. You can continue to work with Pub 2013. If
 not then you either find a new printer or you maybe revert to Publisher 2010 which has CMYK capability.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally I would prefer to work with Pub 2010 if I had the choice as there are other bugs and changes associated with Pub 2013 that I don't appreciate. One big one is imported images, excel graphs, wordart and more are rendered 'blurry' when converted
 to a PDF with Pub 2013. Test this yourself with your Pub 2010 installed on your own machine. Embed an image or two, and excel chart, a table with numbers into a publisher file and convert it to a pdf using both Pub 2010 and 2013 and compare. I expect you will
 find the inserted objects are 'blurred' in Pub 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish I had a better solution but until MS addresses the font rendering issue with Win8 there is not much else to be done. FWIW it sounds like there are other issues of blurry text with Win8 which may or may not be contributing to the Publisher issue. Here
 are two threads:</p>

            <p>Thanks, DavidF</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as a quick update -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Office 2010 I went into "Choose Color Mode" and changed to CMYK. Used the pack and go and packed it onto a stick. The Office Administrator then walked it round to the printers, who took a look. Printers are happy as the CMYK and quality (DPI, etc)
 is all to what they want.<br />
<br />
So, if we install Office 2010 on the server then we'll be able to pack and go to the Printer's desired standards. And hopefully, any publisher document will display the same when viewed on the server Publisher 2010 and on any desktop Publisher 2010.<br />
<br />
I guess if Server 2012 displays Publisher 2010 like it has been doing with Publisher 2013 - then it might mean a step back to Server 2008 for a few years. - Comments on that?<br />
<br />
I note that support for Server 2003 ends in 2015, so guess that server 2008 will get support to 2020.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Like you I don't know much about server software so I cannot advise on whether to roll back to Server 2008.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me software 'being out of support' is not a reason to quit using it. I have three XP machines that I still use, Office 2003 is what I use for most of my production work, and I even use Works 4.5 for the database module, and I can't remember when it came
 out. I am of the old school of thought that if it ain't broke then don't fix it. But with all that said it seems to me that rolling back your server software would probably not be a good idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be interested in whether you find running Pub 2010 on the Server 2012 OS suffers from the same font size rendering issue.</p>

            What I'm aware of is that the Windows updates, and updates for Office on a Windows pc aren't just to make it run faster or look more pretty. A percentage of those updates are behind the scenes security fixes, So personally I'd be weary of XP or older connected
 to the web - although I'm sure that someone will shoot me down on that.&nbsp;<br />

            Just to clarify, David - I wasn't having a pop at you. I'm sure that down the line when anyone else reads this, someone will want to dispute the updates install security patches.<br />
<br />
Yes, leery is the right word. The only reason that where I work was running xp on a couple of machines is due to time and priorities. All workstations now on Windows 7 - and in the process of uninstalling Office 2013 on everything ;)

</p><p>``I traced this down to "M-Files Office Add-in 2018 (12.0.6400.37)" which is a document management add in for Excel.&nbsp; When I disabled the COM add in, Goal Seek worked again.&nbsp; I would advise anyone reading this to disabled their Add In's one at a time until
 Goal Seek works again.&nbsp; You have to close excel and reopen each time you test to make sure the add ins aren't still loaded.&nbsp; I'm good now, but not so good for the M-Files guys. ``</p>

<p>Hi YasirSiddiq,<br />
</p>
<p>As mentioned, the problem has not solved though the macros removed. I had tested at my end by taking the example from the following article:
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Use-Goal-Seek-to-find-the-result-you-want-by-adjusting-an-input-value-320cb99e-f4a4-417f-b1c3-4f369d6e66c7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Use Goal Seek to find the result</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where my test result ended without replacing to value. Verify the outcome in the below image:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/818487ec-4b92-4357-b89f-976a82041c24?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/818487ec-4b92-4357-b89f-976a82041c24?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Therefore, we would like to know the following:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Can you provide the screenshot of your worksheet as the above image?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Your Office version? (File&gt; Account&gt; Screenshot the version)</span></p>
<p><span>3. If it is possible, can you provide the worksheet for further testing?</span></p>

If you think someone has accessed your Hotmail account, that the Live ID sign-in page looks fraudulent, or you receive an email that tries to confirm a password change you didn’t authorize, change your password immediately by going to: http://account.live.com.
 Next, help ensure your PC has not been infected with a virus or malware by running a free full-PC scan.<br />
<strong><br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Help the Hotmail team identify new scams.</strong><br />
Click on the Junk button in Hotmail and select “Junk” or “Report phishing scam” to report it to the Hotmail team. Whatever you do, do not reply back to the sender.</div>

<h3> gareth2061  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2010 slow to open local files when connected to network</h2>
                    <p>I have a user with a problem, when opening any office document locally the relevant applications takes around a minute to open. This is always the case with Word but Excel is more hit and miss.</p>
<p>This even occurs with files stored on the desktop. The computer in question is connected the our domain, when opening a local Word doc word takes around a minute to open and the start up screen says 'processing'. If I pull out the network cable and try the
 same again it opens up the document instantly. This is very odd as the files are not stored on a network share. If I log onto this PC with different credentials the problem does not occur.</p>
<p>The PC is a core i5 with 4GB of ram running Windows 7 Pro 64bit and the domain profile has been set to local instead of roaming (the same problem occurs if the profile is set to roaming).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance for any help</p>

                    It just makes no sense.&nbsp; MS created pages which are practically endless in all directions but, if you set a paper size, use ruled lines and create a wide margin on the left (for the Cornell note-taking method), it's impossible to create a textbox in the
 margin that you can type in.&nbsp; Trying to fashion a solution with text boxes is very difficult.&nbsp; If you do manage to get something going with text boxes and drawing lines on the page, you're stymied when trying to use a page of a fixed size because it won't
 automatically break and flow to a new page if you get to the bottom of it.&nbsp; If you try to use a table, you can't format the table and its borders to create a representation of a grid suitable for the Cornell Method either...nor can the existing table borders
 be forced to coincide with ruled lines of one's choice.&nbsp; A cursory internet search demonstrates that users have been complaining about the lack of these and similar formatting features for at least a decade.&nbsp; Onenote is great for organization and a few of
 its other features but, quite frankly, MS Word is superior to Onenote for the actual inscription of notes.&nbsp; The .Net framework is listed as a dependency for Office applications so, surely, Onenote has easy access to classes common to other parts of Office
 which would make these things workable with relatively little effort.&nbsp; MS has practically unlimited resources and end users have been complaining about these kinds of formatting deficiencies for many years so I just don't understand why better formatting facilities
 haven't been included by now.&nbsp; The <a href="https://support.office.com/en-ca/article/What-s-new-in-OneNote-2016-for-Windows-46ac4be4-8907-404e-8380-bc00921b264f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What's new in OneNote 2016 for Windows</a> page doesn't list a single improvement to the formatting facilities.&nbsp; If no effort is being made to improve upon the formatting options, why upgrade?&nbsp; Sure, it has a couple of new capabilities but they are minor and,
 realistically, the 2016 version isn't any better than the 2013 version.

            I couldn't agree more. OneNote seems really cool in some ways, but the deal killer for me is the lack of a word processor-like single flow for main text input. As a result, you're constantly clicking all over the place creating random text boxes that are
 out of sync with each other from a layout perspective. It's maddening and makes the product unusable for me.

<p>You cannot download Office 2007 unless you had previously purchased a retail 2007 version and have the Key.</p>
<p>But since Office 2007 went out of support in Oct17, and as such no more updates/fixes, maybe not a good idea.</p>
<p>What exact Office 365 account/version have you purchased, and why cannot you use MS Outlook?</p>
