    <title>How can I get Outlook to sync my Google Contact and Calendar info&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I get Outlook to sync my Google Contact and Calendar info&#63;</h2>
                    According to a few MS support pages, it seems like syncing Calendar and Contacts data via Gmail accounts is in place for all Fast Track users, but I can't see any sign of how to actually see the Contacts or Calendar data in Outlook. I've removed my Gmail
 account and re-added it, but nothing changes. Is support for this feature actually fully rolled out? I'm on V16.9 (171206).

</p><p>Hi James, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enable Outlook syncing Google Contact and Calendar, you may need to add Gmail accounts without first setting up two-factor authentication or app passwords. Then it will let you to allow Outlook to access your Gmail messages, contacts and calendars. For

    <title>OEM Office Product Key Transfer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeremiah roe  say:</h3>
<h2>            OEM Office Product Key Transfer</h2>
                    <b>Background:<br />
<br />
</b>I work in Tech Support for a small company, and we have a few computers with MS Office installed on them. All of the MS Office installations are OEM installations. I understand that technically OEM software is non-transferable meaning once the product key
 is used on a particular machine it cannot be used on another machine. However, the particular computer I am referencing never actually had a "Pre-Installation" of the software on it from the manufacturer. This computer is a refurb, and we had to download the
 software for the OEM card from Microsoft's website. I have also reviewed the Licensing agreement for the particular "type" of OEM software I am referencing, and have possibly found a loop-hole concerning transferability that Microsoft Customer Service can't
 help me with. They keep providing me with information I already know, and telling me I need to speak with the manufacturer concerning this issue. This doesn't make sense to me because the manufacturer never provided the installation files for the software
 to begin with, so I'm trying this outlet. <br />
<br />
<b>The Question:<br />
<br />
</b>The software that I am referencing is "MS Office Basic 2007 with Office Professional 2007 Trial" medialess license kit. Basically it's the OEM Product Key card you get for "pre-installations" of MS Office.
<br />
<br />
While reviewing the License Agreement for this particular software it basically says it's a non-transferable license of MS Office. However, it says nothing about what you can do with the software if you reformat and reinstall the OS on the computer you had
 this software installed on. So my question is... "If you reformat and reinstall the OS on the computer you installed this software on, when the original OS never had the pre-installation files for MS Office on it in the first place, and you added it later,
 can you then use it on a completely different computer without breaking the licensing agreements?"<br />
<br />
I appreciate any help you could offer concerning this matter..<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The key difference between the&nbsp;Microsoft Office 2007&nbsp;OEM license and the MLK license is that the OEM license is an agreement between the manufacturer and the end user, while the MLK license is an agreement between Microsoft and the end user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the&nbsp;Office 2007&nbsp;SLTs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"2. OEM LICENSE TERMS</p>
<p>These license terms are an agreement between you and the device manufacturer that distributes the software with the device, or the software installer that distributes the software with the device."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"3. MEDIA-LESS LICENSE KIT TERMS </p>
<p>These license terms are an agreement between Microsoft Corporation (or based on where you live, one of its affiliates) and you. Please read them. They apply to the software that accompanies these license terms, which includes the media on which you received
 it, if any."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So your point about "...the original OS never had the pre-installation files for MS Office on it in the first place..." is irrelevant, not only because the Operating System is never pertinent to the discussion, but because the MLK terms are not contingent
 upon the software being preinstalled on the device (the computer).</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, you can use your newly created @outlook.com account as an Alias of your Hotmail account. However,
<span>it is too risky for us to take the steps and you may not necessarily get it back in case someone else takes it before you. In short, you bear the risk of losing the alias name and the account name.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>To give you an overview of the steps, please refer to the following:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>1. You would need to <b>delete your @outlook.com</b> and you will <b>wait for 360 days</b> for the
</span><span>account name may be <b>permanently deleted</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>Note, after 360 days the deleted&nbsp;@outlook.com will become available in the system for pick up but you may not necessarily get it back in case someone else takes it before you! In short, you bear the risk of losing the&nbsp;account name.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. </span><span>If the @outlook.com is still <b>available</b> in the system to pick up after 360 days, create it as an alias of your Hotmail account.</span><span><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2.1. Sign in to <b>outlook.com</b><br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2.2. Click on the <b>gear icon</b> beside your Profile name and then choose
<b>More mail settings</b>.<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2.3. Under <i>Managing your account</i>, choose <b>Create a Outlook alias</b>.<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2.4. Enter your <b>Microsoft account credentials</b>.<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2.5. </span><span>If the @outlook.com is still available to pick up, e<b>nter your preferred @outlook.com account name as an alias</b>. Again, you may not necessarily get it back in case someone else takes it before you. In short,
 you bear the risk of losing the alias name. <br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>2.6. Click on <strong>Create an alias</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Once we’re done, we'll send an email to your @outlook.com account telling you that your alias is ready to use.</span></p>
<p><span>4. You may click <b>Done</b> or <b>Skip this step</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Few tips to help you get started:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>To send email messages from&nbsp;the alias, click on your address (above the To line in the message) and select your alias from the list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If you set up a separate inbox folder for your alias, messages sent to that alias will go there. Otherwise, messages sent to your alias will go to your regular inbox.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Remember, you can't sign in to your account with your alias; you'll need to sign in with your regular address.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For easier way, I suggest that you create a different email address @outlook.com for your Hotmail account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

            Thank you for keeping us posted!<br />
<br />
We suggest you to use the Windows Recovery Tool.<br />
<br />
Please see the following steps below:<br />
<br />
Start by downloading and installing Windows Device Recovery Tool (for Windows 10, 8.x and 7) from here:<br />
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525569</a><br />
<br />
<br />
When the installation has finished, start the application and the main screen will appear:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86c2714d-32ed-4f28-bf8e-eab67911d874" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86c2714d-32ed-4f28-bf8e-eab67911d874" /></a><br />
The procedure to restore your phone using Windows Device Recovery Tool is as follows:<br />
<br />
Connect the phone to your PC (using the USB cable that came with the phone).<br />
<br />
After a few seconds the PC should find the phone and you'll see the Phone Selection screen. Click your phone in this screen to select it.<br />
After a few seconds more the latest available firmware version for your device will be shown. Click the 'Install software'/'Reinstall software' button to flash your phone<br />
Windows Device Recovery Tool will then download and install the latest firmware + OS available for your phone.<br />
Note! Your phone will be reset to factory status when using this tool.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if this helps.<br />
<br />
Regards.

<h2>            Should Windows 10 graphical installer allow wimboot configuration&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It seems that many devices are now being sold with Windows 8.1 in wimboot configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is going to be a common scenario going forward then it might make sense to support installing Windows 10 in this fashion through the GUI installer.</p>

            I believe this scenario for low storage devices. I would assume Microsoft will support OEMs doing the same thing for Windows 10.

<p>hi there,</p>
<p>i discovered an oddly-named folder in one of my music folders, and i attempted to delete it both on file manager and on my pc through 'mass storage' connectivity but could not manage to due to its corrupted state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i also suspect that the corrupted folder/file is the reason to the failed transfer of some tracks from ovi player to my device, and sudden disapperance of some tracks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>does anyone know how i may go about removing it in its entirety from my memory card?</p>
<p>any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you in advance</p>

 that anyone that was texting me ...my phone was creating a new text thread for them and abandoning the old one that existed. Does anyone know why this is happening or how to stop it?

Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We're glad to help you! <br />
<br />
I understand that your phone keeps on creating new text threads. Have you tried to perform a soft reset? If not please do so.
<br />
<br />
You can perform the soft reset by having your phone turned on. Then, press and hold the
<strong>v</strong><span><strong>olume down</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f11fad6cb-5258-4ceb-9283-d30f67fb5e74%2fhardware-icon-volumeDWN-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><span>and &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
</span><span><strong>Power</strong>&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2f71780ab3-e8a1-45b0-a0d1-220bfbe6b989%2fhardware-icon-power-button_InvariantCulture_Default.png" />button until your phone vibrates and restarts. Note that you should
 not touch the device screen during this process (not even when the 'slide down to power off' prompt appears). After performing soft reset try to check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>If soft reset didn't work, we suggest that you perform a hard reset instead. You can reset your phone under Settings:
<strong>Settings </strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt; about &gt; reset your phone.</strong> Make sure to back up all of your files before
 performing hard reset: <strong>Settings </strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fassets.windowsphone.com%2fc269e6d8-da28-4470-9f34-2993f8ed4a03%2fstart-icon-settings_InvariantCulture_Default.png" /><strong>&nbsp;&gt; Backup &gt; Apps + settings/More options &gt; Back up now.</strong></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if it works. Thanks! </p>

            Hi, I did do the soft reset. But nothing changed. I am still getting a new thread for every text. I did notice however that as long as one person remains the last texter...they won't get a new thread. But once I receive a text from another person in-between...
 it breaks the chain and the new thread starts. I will try the hard reset..because this is so annoying!!

<h3> marcrem  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Publish with 2007 Publisher for Kindle&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a print-on-demand style book that is marketed through CreateSpace on Amazon. CreateSpace requires the file submitted in PDF. That is done, is functional, even though the PDF conversion in Publisher 2007 yielded poor resolution images.</p>
<p>Now I would like to publish the same book in Kindle. They require HTML. The original file is a pub. file, as the book was written and formatted using Publisher 2007.</p>
<p>How do I convert to a [zipped ?] HTML file from either a PDF file or .pub file.?</p>
<p>My word program is OpenOffice. I have Publisher 2007 only. However I am not married to OpenOffice</p>
<p>I tried converting using Mobi's HTML conversion-zipped,&nbsp; the download to Kindle was better, but still not accurate.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>In general you can convert a print publication to a html formatted web publication in Publisher, but be aware that there are print formats and designs that have no html equivalent, so you may have to tweak the layout, design and formatting when converting.
 Furthermore, there are some things you can do in a web publication that will render correctly in Internet Explorer but will not in other browsers and once again you will need to tweak your publication in order to achieve cross browser compatibility. I am guessing
 that if you test and&nbsp;can get the publication converted to a web publication that works well in both IE and FireFox that it will render correctly in Kindle. If it doesn't then you will need to futher tweak your formatting, design and layout until you get what
 you need.</p>
<p>Then after you get the web publication formatted correctly, you will have to use&nbsp;third party&nbsp;software to zip the web files. When you produce your web files with Publisher unless you change the default setting you will get an index.htm file (your home page)
 and an index_files folder that contains all the other pages and all the supporting grahphics. You would need a third party program to zip those together. Alternatively if you go to Tools &gt; Options &gt; Web tab you can uncheck the option to use the supporting
 folder and then when you produce your web files you won't get the index_files folder. Instead you will get all the page files and images files loose. This may be the best way to produce them as you will not have a subfolder to deal with when you zip the files
 together.</p>
<p>You will also need to produce a navigation system in your publication. I would suggest that you start with the following articles.</p>
<div>Convert a print newsletter for use on the Web (2003):</div>
<div><a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/publisher/HA011030981033.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/publisher/HA011030981033.aspx</a></div>

<p>And then plan on spending some time reading the other material about web design with Publisher:</p>
<p>Designing and creating Web sites:<br />

<p>Good luck and let us know if you are able to convert a Publisher publication to a htm formatted file that will work with a Kindle. You would be the first that I know that has tried it.</p>
<p>By the way, if you do not like the quality of the pdf file that you can get using the Office PDF add-on be sure to note that you can change the quality. When you File &gt; Publish as a PDF or XPS and you get the save file dialog, find the "optimize for:" option
 below the Save as type. When you click&nbsp;the "change" button&nbsp;you can choose between 4 formats and click the advanced button and change the resolution, etc. Play with those options and see if you can find a pdf file that is more to your liking. Just be careful
 and remember that if you choose a high resolution setting that will result in a large file size which will take longer to download. And finally if you don't like any of the options in the Office pdf add-in, try downloading the freebie at<a href="http://www.primopdf.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.primopdf.com</a>
 . It gives you two options...for viewing on-line and for printing. The printing option will be a higher resolution and larger file size.</p>

                    I have done a dozen or more Bing searches and unlike all the other days I have NO new points. I even did a quiz on Bing and got no points.

<p>I'm having the same issue Today myself! I got points for doing the quizzes but only 5 points for searching for a good 3-4 minutes before I noticed my points weren't going up. I restarted my PC and got a total of 5 more before it just refuses to doll out
 any more points! I cleaned my browsers cache also cleaned the PC cleaned disk ,used CCleaner and defragged the PC then restarted again to no avail! Stuck at 4594 points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Off topic but should I turn off SuperFetch in Windows 10 latest edition? It runs for a good 3-4 minutes or more and nothing wants to run or is slow to open because it's using so much of my disk everything else is slow! It acts almost virus like if I open
 the task manager and will magically cease running if I open it to see the file location after 5-10 seconds.Is it needed at start up like this?
</p>
<p>It didn't start doing this until last update!!!I got rid of Avast Free in favor of Bitdefender free.And I can see it hogging up space as it updates but once it stops in @ 30 seconds then,and or superfetch starts and runs for minutes!!!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Microsoft Rewards Dashboard. On the right you will see total points accumulated. Scroll down and verify searchs are accumulating. I've noticed my counter shows 0 on the Bing.com page but Dashboard shows otherwise. After a few searches, the counter
 on bing begins to show total and accumulated points.</p>

</p><p>As an Insider, I believe you know to post questions on Windows should be posted in the Windows Performance Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not advise turning off Superfetch. "SuperFetch simply preloads and makes programs you use more often quick to access. It also enables background programs, defragmenting for example, to run in the background while you do your work."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do suggest going to Control Panel &gt; Uninstall Programs</p>
<p>Click Turn Windows Features On and Off</p>
<p>Uncheck "Remote Differential Compression API Support"</p>
<p>Click Ok</p>
<p>You should see an increase in speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on Drive C &gt; Select Windows Folder</p>
<p>Scroll to PreFetch folder</p>
<p>Do not delete this folder. Do delete the contents of this folder.</p>
<p>Next, go to Temp Folder</p>
<p>Do not delete this folder. Do delete the contents of this folder.</p>
<p>Next, return to Drive C, type *.tmp in search bar</p>
<p>Once contents appear, delete them.</p>
<p>These contents will be removed to the Recycle Bin. If not experiencing issues with Windows, delete recycle bin after two weeks.</p>

<p>I started receiviung Points the next day after contacting Rewards support.I was one of a handful of Folks reporting this issue that day. it was resolved the next day so I don't need to do any of the suggested things you submitted.I did however turn off the
 Windows&nbsp;Remote Differential Compression API Support.</p>
<p>My Laptop speed up enough. And the other items you mentioned are fine as is.If needed I can't delete the items in the folders later.</p>
<p>As to SuperFetch I left it alone it was running okay and only spiked for a few minutes and I couldn't do much of anything even the Task manager was slow to open!If I could it was painfully slow to load then present anything other than a blank white page
 before finally loading after @ a minute. :P</p>
<p>I had to do another reinstall and that has stopped 99% of the problems.it seems one or more of my scanners were conflicting as they both ran Bitdifende.Bitdefender free and IObits' Malware Fighter! They would try to update at the same time and it caused
 my PC to be slow to load anything else it needed to run efficiently.I have ditched both and it runs like a top now. Bitdefender free is low on resources but NOT when it scans or updates!!! this is the first time I ever seen my RAM go over 80% at 4 GB it did
 great until I installed these programs.Now I'm back to nominal again!!! ;)</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            Hi PaulMarc,<br />
<br />
I understand you’d like to share a secondary (personal) calendar with a group in Office 365. However, there are various kinds of groups in Office 365, such as Office 365 groups (modern groups), distribution groups and security groups. So I’d like to confirm
 which kind of group you belong to in this case. <br />
<br />
If that’s a security group, we can share a calendar with the group like mentioned in
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Calendar-in-Outlook-on-the-web-for-business-5219c457-d1fe-4c2f-9032-1a816b88e936#__toc361735991" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>. If that’s an Office 365 group or a distribution group, it’s not feasible share a calendar with the group. Under this circumstance, you may need to turn to your admin and ask him to create a new security group which includes the same users
 like the previous distribution group/ Office 365 group so you can share your calendar with those users. For more information about these three groups, please refer to:<br />

<br />
Let me know if anything is misunderstood.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

    <title>Sender Name As HMRC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samriaz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sender Name As HMRC</h2>
                    Recently, I've had emails that I send showing up to others as HMRC as the sender when it is just myself sending them.<br />
I have not made any recent changes to my account besides updating the security information and trying to change my display name/account name to my name rather than HMRC. I only access my email through my mobile but I am sending this from a laptop but it is
 the same issue on both devices.<br />
<br />
Having sent a test email to myself it states that I have received an email from HMRC UK followed by my email in brackets.
<br />
<br />
Is there a quick fix to this?

<p>Hi Remon,<br />
<br />
I have tried updating my account information to just change my display name as it still states HMRC UK. When trying to change this it changes absolutely fine to whatever name I like but when I go back onto my outlook web app it still states HMRC UK.<br />
<br />
Having tried from a different computer it now seems to be correct and up to date which is quite strange.<br />
<br />
I haven't received any error messages or anything of the sort but I have been receiving spam emails from HMRC which of course are not genuine.<br />
<br />
I have attached a few images for you to take a look at to hopefully isolate the issue.<br />
<br />
One image shows me sending a test email to myself and the name showing as HMRC UK<br />
The other images show that my name is now correct and up to date.<br />
Unfortunately I did not take a screenshot of the time where Outlook was displaying my name as HMRC but I managed to get an image of an email showing that my display name had been changed. This of course has been done without any consent of mine and I personally
 believe this to be a bot of some sort quite possibly through the fake emails I have received.
<br />
<br />
I am now finding that certain emails that I am looking for have also completely vanished and are not in the section stated recover deleted items either.
<br />
<br />
Hopefully you are able to help.<br />
The display name issue has been resolved. But what is there in place to stop this from happening again? I have set up 2 step authentication with my mobile and do not want to have any unauthorised access on my email let alone somehow my display name being changed.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92590d30-9fa4-4095-9050-499808a63d6b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92590d30-9fa4-4095-9050-499808a63d6b" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9ece6fd-0edf-4eb0-b39e-1c2742b2a6c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9ece6fd-0edf-4eb0-b39e-1c2742b2a6c4" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/add35565-a2b2-4b6b-9400-cb1874cbb980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/add35565-a

<h2>            BlackJack II Connects as Guest Cannot Establish Partnership -- Found a Fix&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a new BlackJack II.&nbsp; I have ActiveSync 4.5 installed on my home computer and I can sync with that one just fine.&nbsp; It's Windows XP Home and I have Outlook 2000.&nbsp; ActiveSync 4.5 on my&nbsp;work computer is installed
 and runs fine, when I connect the phone it connects as a Guest.&nbsp; It doesn't give me any other options, and never asks me if I want to establish a partnership.&nbsp; At work, we have Outlook 2003.&nbsp; I can see the files on the phone and transfer files on and off of
 it in both places, but at work I cannot establish the partnership.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE:&nbsp; I found a fix that worked for me:</p>
<p><u><a href="http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/faqs/activesync/guest.htm#Guest Issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/faqs/activesync/guest.htm#Guest%20Issues</a></u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are 9 things to try, and what worked for me was #8 -- copied here for your convenience:</p>
<p>Check and see of the registration key at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\<a href="http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/faqs/activesync/guest.htm#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Windows
</span><span>CE</span></a> Services and see whether a key named GuestOnly has a value of 1.&nbsp; If it does then change the value to 0 to allow you
 to setup a partnership.&nbsp; An alternative is to use a free <a href="http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/faqs/activesync/guest.htm#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>application</span></a>
<span>application</span></a>
 called ActiveSync Keys which is available at <a href="http://www.pocketpcfaq.com/applications/undocumentedactivesync.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Undocumented ActiveSync Keys</a>.&nbsp; <i>NOTE: Microsoft does not support end users editing the registry so there is no support for performing this.</i>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only had to edit the key and it worked, I did not use that free application that was mentioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good Luck and I hope that this can help someone someday.</p>

<p>Greetings wiltap!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows Mobile Owners Circle Forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the basic problem is back with your home computer and PDA.&nbsp; When you initially setup ActiveSync, you would have been offered a choice of sync'ing with just that computer or multiple computers.&nbsp; If you selected "just this one
 desktop", then all subsequent sync sessions with other computers will appear as Guest logins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Glad you found the fix to the problem!</p>

    <title>Vertical Scroll Option - Microsoft Mouse &#38; Keyboard Center - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> veritycotton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vertical Scroll Option - Microsoft Mouse &#38; Keyboard Center - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've been advised to post here by one of your techs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to know if there's any way to disable vertical scrolling of an optical mouse in Windows 10. I'm planning on purchasing a new laptop but won't be able to buy one with Windows 10 pre installed if this feature isn't available.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently use <strong>Windows 8.1</strong> and the only way to disable vertical scrolling of my wired mouse is via the
<strong>Microsoft Mouse &amp; Keyboard Center. </strong>I've never been able to disable it any other way, even via the registry.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tech advised me that currently there isn't an option at the moment in Windows 10 that allows for disabling of an optical mouse. This is a deal-breaker for me and seems a shame as it limits which laptop I'll be able to purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Yes it is Windows 10 Insiders version Pro 64 bit as for the picture that is showing is what mouse is attached to my system, as for those setting they should be on any version just a different picture you should atleast have what is shown in the 2nd picture.
 now I'm not sure how it shows in Windows 8.1 as that is what you have posted as your system, this site is for testing newer builds of Windows 10 before releasing to the public and isn't a general support site for Public builds of Windows 10.

<p>
</p><p>Okay so this wouldn't be the version of 10 Pro that's available to the public at the moment then? That's a shame. Will it eventually be available? And do you have a time frame?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm buying a new laptop and it has 10 pro installed ... it would be a deal-breaker if I can't disable the vertical scrolling on the mouse.

            &nbsp;No it is a newer test build but the Public build has that setting, Being a laptop are you going to install a external mouse? if it has Windows 10 pro installed you will be able to set mouse settings as posted, suggestion when you are buying the new laptop
 ask them about a wireless mouse.

<h2>            Issues with App downloads to Windows 10 Phones Error 0x800073cf9</h2>
                    The above problem has been in existence forever and Microsoft has not addressed it properly. First, the error only occurs when you try and save apps to an SD card. There are other errors as well and they occur with saving music. The whole issue revolves
 around Microsoft not addressing problems with SD cards installed. How long does an issue have to exist before some&nbsp; dummy at Microsoft bothers to see this in the Microsoft community and goes to work on it. This 0x80073cf9 hex code issue is all over the internet.
 Come on Microsoft...get to work

<h2>            Nokia Lumia 925 - driver error</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>For no apparent reason, my Nokia Lumia 925 driver is giving an error.&nbsp; I am unable to view the contents of my phone from my PC.</p>
<p>I followed the instructions to uninstall the driver and reinstall, and rebooted both the PC and phone.&nbsp; It appears to install the latest driver just fine but I gives the following error.</p>
<p>
</p><div>This device is not configured correctly. (Code 1)</div>
<div>A service installation section in this INF is invalid.</div>
<div>
<p>To find a driver for this device, click Update Driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 on the laptop and Windows Phone 8.1 Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></div>
