<h2>            VBA to find and replace every nth character in every nth page</h2>
                    <p>Despite having some knowledge of VBA in Excel, I find both my vocab lacking in Word and not knowing how to create/use the equivalent of a user defined function in Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to find every say third "t" in every other page in the whole document and replace them with a different font. Would be grateful for any suggestion. Thanks very much.</p>

            <p>Unless you're using manual page breaks and/or 'Next Page' Section breaks to set the page boundaries, what you're trying to do&nbsp;may end up being&nbsp;futile, since Word paginates documents differently according to data returned by the active printer driver. Consequently,
 having done the work, simply changing printers (or even just printer drivers) can invalidate it. That said, you could try something based on the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sub Demo()<br />
Application.ScreenUpdating = False<br />
Dim i As Long, j As Long, Rng As Range<br />
With ActiveDocument<br />
&nbsp; For i = 1 To .ComputeStatistics(wdStatisticPages) Step&nbsp;2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Rng = .GoTo(What:=wdGoToPage, Name:=i)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set Rng = Rng.GoTo(What:=wdGoToBookmark, Name:="\page")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Rng.Duplicate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With .Find<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Text = "t"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .ClearFormatting<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Replacement.ClearFormatting<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Forward = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Wrap = wdFindStop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .MatchWildcards = True<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Execute<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; j = 0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do While .Find.Found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; j = j + 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If .InRange(Rng) Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If j Mod 3 = 0 Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Font.ColorIndex = wdRed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Collapse wdCollapseEnd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .Find.Execute<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exit Do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loop<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End With<br />
&nbsp; Next<br />
End With<br />
Application.ScreenUpdating = True<br />
End Sub</p>
<p>
</p><p>As coded, the macro simply sets the font colour for every third 't' on odd-numbered pages to red.</p>

<p>we have hybrid setup &amp; cisco UM for voice Mail. </p>
<p>we have migrated few users as pilot &amp; the VM are not getting for migrated users. But the on-premises users are receiving without any issue.</p>
<p>we even tried by creating a new service account on cloud &amp; given required <strong>
ApplicationImpersonation</strong> to the service account but unable to receive the VOICE MAILS for migrated users.</p>
<p>can you please help on this.</p>
<p>as I said we have created the service account on cloud , is this some issue ?? do we need to have service account on on-premises only as we have hybrid deployment ? please help on this

<p>Hi Asharaf,</p>
<p>It seems the issue is related to the connection between voice gateway and UM. Could you let me know how you migrate UM enabled mailbox? Have you referred to the following article?<br />
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh552484(v=exchsrvcs.149).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh552484(v=exchsrvcs.149).aspx</a>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for responding Johnny!</p>
<p>In our environment UM is not available. We don have a UM exchange server and all the voice mail related things are done by Cisco Unity Connection in place of UM role</p>
<p>The issue we are facing is that any voicemail sent to a user is not being delivered to Migrated Users Mailbox. It works fine with On-Premises user but is failing with Migrated user.</p>
<p>As far as configuration goes, we have created a svc account on cloud with "Application Impersonation" rights. In Cisco, a new Service is created with O365 and is assigned to the migrated users. But, when clicked on Test, we are getting an error message stating
 that "Failed to Access &lt;Mailbox&gt; on Outlook.office365.com"</p>
<p>Kindly assist!!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You will need an SBC (Session border controller) with a SIP trunk from your CUCM to setup the voice mail system in Office 365 Unified messaging. You will also need an E3 license with this.</p>

<p>Hi Asharaf,</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification. As you use Cisco instead of Exchange UM, we have limited resource in our forum. After researching, we may get further assistance on Cisco support.</p>
<p>Also, our community members are also welcome to share any experience here.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>I suspect the Yammer basic network has been upgraded to Yammer Enterprise, tied to your Office365 account, that is the reason why it is being re-directed to a Office365 login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to find this out is go to your Office365 admin portal and raise a support ticket. Supply the full details of the Yammer URL, and let them do the required checking in the back end.</p>

<p>The only reason I can think of why a Yammer Basic network asks for Office365 login, is because the network is now converted to Yammer Enterprise of a Office365 network.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, somehow, your Yammer basic has become part of a Office365 network and is no longer Yammer Basic.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>You may have one office365 tenant with companyA domain.</p>
<p>You have a Yammer network using companyA domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also have a companyB domain with the same Office365 tenant.</p>
<p>You have a Yammer BASIC network using companyB domain</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you find you always get redirected to companyA Yammer which requires a Office365 login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is the case, this is because Yammer only allow one network per tenant.</p>

    <title>Visio - connector behaviour inserting new symbols into Network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oldhasbeen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visio - connector behaviour inserting new symbols into Network diagrams</h2>
                    <p>For me, one of the great features Visio offers is this: if I start with a diagram like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aee7a38d-cc02-4371-96d4-413a05c34d97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aee7a38d-cc02-4371-96d4-413a05c34d97" /></a></p>
<p>and insert a circle between the two squares, breaking the line, it breaks the line in two:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b8ec4c4-67a3-4430-b483-c0432d8fcb15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b8ec4c4-67a3-4430-b483-c0432d8fcb15" /></a></p>
<p>When using a Network diagram template, however, it's not so clever. If I start with a link between two servers:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11bf5ff7-fa66-47e4-8a8d-a89b998318db" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11bf5ff7-fa66-47e4-8a8d-a89b998318db" /></a></p>
<p>And insert a firewall between them, I get:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0303c18-4b35-4205-9221-135785873416" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0303c18-4b35-4205-9221-135785873416" /></a></p>
<p>Which obviously isn't what I wanted, so I have to delete the connecting line then add in two new lines (rather like in PowerPoint) to get:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c371032-72ab-4974-8b91-666817f3c890" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1c371032-72ab-4974-8b91-666817f3c890" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way that Visio, when using the Network Diagram template / stencil, &nbsp;can be made to split the connecting line for me when I drop in the firewall, as it does in the above example of inserting a circle between 2 connected squares?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
Please do both settings below for the Network Diagram in Visio 2013:<br />
<br />
Go to <strong>DESIGN </strong>tab, in the <strong>Page Setup</strong> group, open the Page Setup dialog (or press
<strong>Shift+F5</strong>). Go to <strong>Layout and Routing </strong>tab, make sure the option "<strong>Enable connector splitting</strong>" is checked to enabled.<br />
<br />
Go to<strong> DEVELOPER</strong> tab, in the <strong>Shape Design </strong>group, select
<strong>Behavior</strong>. In the <strong>Behavior</strong> tab, under <strong>Connector splitting</strong>, enable the setting "<strong>Shape can split connectors</strong>".
</p><p>
</p><p>Then drag the this shape on the connector, confirm if the shape can split the connectors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Winni</p>

            It is possible that 16.9 version of Office has this bug as many issues are being reported in this new version. 
<br />
<br />Try to update your Office again so that if any patch is released by Microsoft that would flow in. Sometimes you have to try many times before an update is recognised by your Office.
<br />
<br />Another option is roll back to previous stable version which you had. To rollback -
<br />
<br />1. Uninstall the latest version of Office - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-for-Mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninst...</a>
<br />2. Install the previous stable version - <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update-history-for-Office-2016-for-Mac-700cab62-0d67-4f23-947b-3686cb1a8eb7#bkmk_current" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Update...</a>
<br />
<br />I would suggest that you should post simultaneously to Technet forum also as this will be looked into by MS Product team also. So, your question will be on two forums - This and Technet.

<p>Subs and Functions differ only in that a function can return something whether it be a string or&nbsp; anumber or any other data type. It can also return objects.</p>
<p>When if comes to queries you have to use a function if you want a return value and, as Jeanette said, it has to be Public and in a standard module so the query can see it. A sub cannot return anything whether it is an event procedure of a suer-defined procedure.</p>
<p>50 lines and 6 variables are certainly not too much code. I've never hit a limit on lines of code or the number of variables. I suspect there is no limit.</p>
<p>Your code is compiling and running without declaring your variables because it is missing a an option to force variable declaration. The very top of your code pages should all have these two lines:</p>
<p>Option Compare Database<br />
Option Explicit</p>
<p>Without "Option Explicit", variables do not have to be declared and you are asking for a nightmare when debugging. You might type
<strong>MyBlueVariable</strong> in one place and <strong>MyBluVariable</strong> in another. The code will compile and run, but now you have 2 variables when you though you only had one.</p>

            <p>Using Word - a different work around is to create a table specially for the mail merge.</p>
<p>Use your query with the TestFunction to append the data to&nbsp;the table mentioned above.</p>
<p>That way you get the data needed for the mail merge in an easy-to-use scenario for word,</p>

                    if you have an iphone - in 'mailboxes' just press edit on the top right, then choose folder you want to move and it will ask for where to move it, most like back to outlook so it's not in a subfolder.&nbsp;

<p>- Virtual Switch Manager does not allow to create EXTERNAL virtual switch, the item is greyed and the message is:</p>

    <title>Not possible anymore to sent one SMS text message to multiple contacts - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Not possible anymore to sent one SMS text message to multiple contacts since update 7.10.7720.68 &#40;WP7.5&#41;</h2>
                    Since update 7.10.7720.68 (WP7.5) it is not possible anymore to sent one SMS text message to multiple contacts.
<br />
Before the respective update, this was no issue...<br />
<br />
Is this issue already known? Is it a bug?<br />
<br />
FYI; I have a HTC Trophy.

<p>Tap Settings.</p>
<p>Slide "Group Text" to off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is happening is when you send a text to multiple people, the Group Text feature attempts to keep the messages in one chat thread by using MMS (also called picture messaging).<br />
</p>
<p>Turning Group Text off should solve the issue for you.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This means that either your data connection is off in Settings&gt;cellular or your MMS settings are bad and in the future, if you ever want to send a picture message, it too will fail.<br />

            Hi Frank,<br />
<br />
May I know whether you have tried to check this issue via using EAC or the Exchange Management Shell to add an email alias address for a user mailbox?<br />
<br />
Follow the steps below to using the EAC to add an email address.<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the EAC, navigate to <strong>Recipients &gt; Mailboxes</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the list of user mailboxes, click the mailbox that you want to add an email address to, and then click
<strong>Edit</strong> icon.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On the mailbox properties page, click<strong> Email Address</strong>.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click <strong>Add</strong> icon, and then click <strong>SMTP</strong> to add an SMTP email address to this mailbox.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Type the new SMTP address in the <strong>Email address</strong> box, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click<strong> Save </strong>to save the change.<br />
<br />
Moreover, you can also use the Exchange Management Shell to add an email address. For more detailed information, please refer to the article:

<p>Hi Won,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, prior to Outlook 2016, it is OK to resize the Outlook to-do bar. Please see&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change-the-size-or-contents-of-the-To-Do-Bar-C95EB62E-CB1E-44DA-B528-EE685A49918D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Change-the-size-or-contents-of-the-To-Do-Bar-C95EB62E-CB1E-44DA-B528-EE685A49918D</a>.&nbsp;
 After the Outlook newer version (ie, Outlook 2016), we can only resize the to-do bar in a limited size.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So currently, we have 2 recommendations.</p>
<p>1. Downgrade your Outlook version to the elder one (ie, Outlook 2010). Please note that Outlook 2010 (Office 2010) has been ended for its mainstream support&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search/13615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search/13615</a>
 (<strong>it means we won't provide any support if you are still using Office 2010</strong>). For how downgrading to Office 2010, you can refer to&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_install-mso_other-mso_o365b/downgrade-from-office-2016-to-office-2010/e8122fdc-7fff-4c0a-ad2a-5e1487aebdde">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_install-mso_other-mso_o365b/downgrade-from-office-2016-to-office-2010/e8122fdc-7fff-4c0a-ad2a-5e1487aebdde</a></p>
<p>2. Submit a feedback to our related team about the limited to-do bar resizable size via&nbsp;<a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But actually, I also would like whether you have any special reason to resize the Office 365 (or Office 2016) Outlook to-do bar to any size. If yes, please let me know. And I will try my best to find if there is any workaround for you. Have a nice day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Most of my users has bigger than 27 inch monitors&nbsp;to display more info on the screen, not be able to resize and putting limit on them is wasting space for them.</p>

</p><p>if there is any way to make it so that it can be adjustable like 2010, I would love to know.&nbsp; Thx</p>

    <title>command-F and command-G in Word 2016 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james i. porter  say:</h3>
<h2>            command-F and command-G in Word 2016</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure I understand the way repeating the Find command works in word. It often happens that if I am searching repeatedly in the body of a text, a split window appears below if the query turns up a hit in the footnote area. Either command-F or -G produces
 this when it does happen after an initial command-F. If I search using arrows in the search box it never happens. And I am not sure it always does open up the footnote area in a window (though mostly that happens).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to prevent this from occurring (viz., permitting a repeated search that does not split the document)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I just noticed that the search window I'm speaking of (top right) actually has "replace" in greyed out letters. I'm not using it to replace anything, and I thought that was how you initiate a simple find-search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on my test on version 16.19, when you press command+F, the cursor will jump to the find box upper right. You can type in the words that you want to search in the document, the results be yellow
 highlighted and the first result will be selected. At this moment, if you press command+G, the selected part will jump to the next result. If you want to find another word, just press command+F and type in the new one. During the whole process, the split window
 won't jump out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is anything misunderstood, would you please provide the reproduce video via

<p>It sounds like the "split window" you're referring to is the <strong>Footnotes Pane</strong> &amp; that you are working in either
<strong>Draft</strong> or <strong>Outline</strong> view when it appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, neither footnotes nor endnotes are displayed when working in those views, so if the found content is located in a footnote or endnote the Pane is opened in order to display what has been found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way to avoid the "split" is to use the <em><strong>Search</strong></em> field only while in Print Layout view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, in anything other than the simplest of documents, I prefer to use Advanced Find &amp; Replace. It's far more robust, IMO more reliable, and enables explicit searches of Footnotes, Endnotes, Headers &amp; Footers, as well as the main document body.</p>

            Thanks very much. I work only in Print Layout view, and initiate the search from there, which is part of what puzzles me. The other part is that this is intermittent. I'll try to pay more attention to see what triggers the Footnotes Pane to open and will
 report back if I can narrow it down.

<p>I can reproduce this effect by inserting the cursor in the footnote area (while in Print Layout view), pressing command-F to search for a term, and then, after the first hit, pressing command-F or -G: the second pressing of these keys splits open the screen
 every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just hitting Return keeps me in the Print Layout view, so that is what I must remember to do if a search takes me into the footnotes.</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tested on the Word for Mac version 16.19 (181109), when I press command+F or command+G in footnote, there is no split window. So I'd like to confirm which version of Word are you using. Meanwhile,
 please check the shortcut in System Preferences if you have assigned command+F or command+G to open the Find &amp; Replace window.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help us confirm your situation, would you please provide the screenshot of the split window to us?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tisky</p>

<p>Thanks for this information... I am able to reproduce it using <strong>Command+G</strong> but
<em>not</em> with <strong>Command+F</strong>. I believe that this is by design: The Footnotes Pane opens once the initial footnotes have been searched. It's a more efficient means of displaying all footnotes in order to prevent jumping from page to page in
 the document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case you aren't aware, <strong>Command+Option+S</strong> is a toggle to open/close the split.</p>

<p>Further to this, more oddities:</p>
<p>
</p><p>sometimes when I search for a term that I know also is in the footnote area, the search never takes me there. Instead it highlights all the occurrences in the body, and cycles through those.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I open the sidebar and the search term fills in automatically from the top right window's search term, I see a list of matches, including in the footnotes, but I still cannot get command F or G to enter into the footnotes and find matches from the body
 of the text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is the opposite problem: either I am driven into a footnote window area or I'm not, and in the latter case I am not finding matches if they happen to be there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I place the cursor in the footnote area and repeat the search with command-G, I never exit the footnotes and cannot find the matches in the body.Additionally, command-G will split the footnote area into two footnote areas if I start the search there.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I</strong><strong>t looks like command-F has one job: opens the search in the top right and populates it and the sidebar window with the term that you enter. Then you have either to presss command-G to repeat (in the
<em>same</em> search area, body OR footnotes, never in both, viz., from one to the other) OR press return to cycle through all possible matches in
<em>both</em> areas. Once you use command-F once, that function is "dead" until you initiate a new search. Is that right?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there detailed documentation that lays out the ins and outs of searching? Just trying to make sense of the vagaries of this mechanism!</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks.</p>

<p>Hi James,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To search in the footnote, you need to double click the footnote, let the cursor located in the footnote, then you are able to search in footnote area by pressing command+F.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the description in your fourth paragraph, based on my test, it is the expected behavior when you use command+F or command+G to search in footnote area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just did, thanks. Command-F does nothing after the first match in either the body or the footnote area; command-G repeats the search.</p>

<p>Ok I managed to solve my problem. The issue was with the widths of tables that were generated by code. The widths were hard-coded and since we're using docx4j and its weird measuring unit, it resulted in making the whole document bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I've reduced those widths and the problem is solved. I thought it was a formatting or compatibility problem, which is why I asked the question here.</p>

To remove this infection you need to start the computer in safe mode. <br />
<br />
After that Delete the FBI MoneyPack Virus Files<br />
<br />
<u><b>Windows Vista/ 7</b></u><br />

<b>MORE IMPORTANT THING DON'T FORGOT TO DELETE ALL THE TEMP FILES ON THE COMPUTER.
<br />
</b><br />
<br />
<br />
<p>In order to avoid all this type infections from the internet please remove the temporary files from the computer daily.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>Please use the following method to remove those temporary files. </p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press “<b>Windows</b>” and “<b>R</b>” keys simultaneously on your keyboard.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>In the text box in the <i>Run</i> window, type <b>%Temp%</b> and click <b>
OK</b>. A folder full of files and other folders will appear. </span></li></ol>
<p><span>All of the folders and files you see in this <i>Temp</i> folder are no longer being used by Windows and can safely be deleted.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>To remove individual folders or files, hold down your <b>Ctrl</b> key while left-clicking on each item you want delete. Release the
<b>Ctrl</b> key when you're finished. </span></li></ol>
<p><span>To delete these items, hit your <b>Delete</b> key or choose <b>File</b> and then
<b>Delete</b> from the menu. </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Confirm that you want to delete the files by clicking <b>Yes</b> on the
<i>Confirm Multiple File Delete</i> window that opens. </span></li><li><span>If you'd instead like to remove everything inside the <i>Temp</i> folder, choose
<b>Edit</b> and then <b>Select All</b> from the menu. </span></li></ol>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> If you're prompted that there are hidden files in this folder, just click on
<b>OK</b> to bypass the message. A few hidden files hanging out in the <i>Temp</i> folder probably aren't important enough to worry about.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Now that all of the files and folders are selected, hit your <b>Delete</b> key or choose
<b>File</b> and then <b>Delete</b> from the menu. </span></li><li><span>Confirm that you want to delete the files by clicking <b>Yes</b> on the
<i>Confirm Multiple File Delete</i> window that opens. </span></li><li><span>After all of the files have been deleted you can close the window and empty your Recycle Bin, permanently removing the files from your PC.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Tips:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>You may receive a <i>Error Deleting File or Folder</i> message while the files are being deleted. This just means that one of the files is in use by a program right now. Click
<b>OK</b>, close all open programs, and repeat the steps above. If you still receive the message, try restarting your PC and repeating the process again.</span></li></ol>

            <p>The fundamental problem is probably one of document corruption. Something "not right" has happened to your file.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Saving to TXT definitely should NOT cause a crash. Normally when I save to alternate file formats to fix problems it is to RTF in order to fix minor problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another alternative is to open and the file (still as DOCX) in OfficeLibre. That has been reported enough to fix some file structure problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Your description sounds like a variation of this problem:</p>
<div>
<strong><span>Word only shows first “N” pages in Print Layout but shows all in read mode or Web Layout</span></strong>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-word/86-page-doc-only-shows-first-3-in-print-layout-but/6beb5bc1-d1af-4128-8d67-dafd3a9dcd3f">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2013_release-word/86-page-doc-only-shows-first-3-in-print-layout-but/6beb5bc1-d1af-4128-8d67-dafd3a9dcd3f</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>This is most mysterious. We have to figure out a situation in which text is displayed in Read Mode and Web Layout view but not in Print Layout view. I can tell
 you what the problem is not:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The missing text is not formatted as Hidden. Hidden text is not displayed in Read Mode regardless of your settings, and if you can't see it in Print Layout view (meaning that you don't have nonprinting characters displayed), then you won't
 see it in Web Layout view, either.</li><li>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It hasn't inadvertently been added to endnotes, because they would be displayed in all views except Draft.</li><li>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It can't be excess text in a wrapped table cell that is not allowed to flow to the next page because the "Don't break wrapped tables across pages" Layout Option is not available in Word 2013, and wrapped tables are always allowed to break.</li><li>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It can't be text in a text box with the "Show drawings and text boxes on screen" disabled at
<strong>File | Options | Advanced: Show document content</strong> because in this situation text in a text box is displayed in Read Mode but not in Web Layout view.</li><li>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not the problem where the first of two columns gets set to the entire margin width, leaving nowhere for the text in the second column to go, making it invisible, because Word 2013 has safeguards set up to prevent this (it requires
 the second column to be at least 0.5").</li></ol>
<p><span>If this is a legacy document (displayed in Compatibility Mode), options 3 and 5 above might become relevant.</span></p>

<p><span>******** </span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>I solved my case by going to Option-&gt; Advanced -&gt; Check "show drawings and text boxes on screen"</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>*******</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>I had similar problem, I changed the document orientation (i.e. from portrait to Landscape) and all pages are visible in track changes with markup. My document
 had many tables few of which were bigger than page width, I think that was the reason why problem occured.
</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>******** </span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Saving as Word 97-2003 worked. Then resaved as Word 2013.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>***** </span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>This can often be corrected by opening the
<strong>Columns</strong> dialog (<strong>Page Layout | Page Setup | Columns&nbsp;| More Columns...</strong>) and clicking on the preset picture for
<strong>One</strong>. It's possible that the <strong>One</strong> button in the dropdown would accomplish the same thing, but using the dialog allows you to see what happens. The problem is caused by the "Equal column width" box not being checked. This results
 in a variety of problems that I won't go into, but checking it (which you can't do manually when there's a single column) allows the column width to "float," adjusting to the margin width.

<p><span>Clinton had sent me a document that exhibited the problem and it was a case where a two column layout was selected
 with the width of the first column being set to the width between the margins and the width of the second column being set to 0.&nbsp; Apparently, the problem was actually with the Normal.dotm template as it was affecting all documents that he was creating.

<p><span>*********
</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>In case it'll be useful to someone else, I'll post some notes and a narrative:</span></p>
<p><span>In my particular situation, the document came from an outside contractor. I don't know what version of Word they used to create it originally, and it seems to
 be based on a document they prepared for another customer. They've been using Track Changes and comments as the document has been passed back and forth between them and us.</span></p>
<p><span>When the document is opened in Word 2007, users are able to view it without problems, but when a user in our Office 2013 pilot opened it with Word 2013, she
 wasn't able to go past a certain page in Print Layout. This didn't happen in Read Mode, and on investigation, it worked in Print Layout when Show Comments was off and the document was displaying simple markup. This matches the symptoms that some (but not all)
 people have described in this and the other thread. There's some other strange user-interface behavior, but it's probably a side-effect of the underlying problem.</span></p>
<p><span>I was able to track the cause down to a comment on the first page that wouldn't show. The comment's in between some other comments by the same person that were
 probably made during the same editing session, but this one is dated 2307-00-23 16:48:00 UTC. If I look at it in the reviewing pane, the text of the comment is correct, but if I click on the speech-bubble icon, I get the entire text of the document. If I edit
 text in the Reviewing pane, it changes there but does not affect the Comments pop-up; if I edit it in the Comments pop-up window, the contents of my document change.</span></p>
<p><span>(N.B. I haven't yet been able to see if the comment displays correctly on Word 2007. It's on my list of things to try tomorrow.) The comment does display correctly
 in Word 2007.</span></p>
<p><span>With my test case, I haven't found a way to fix the broken comment except with a procedure that strips other information, but deleting it allows me to see the
 entire document with Show Comments enabled.</span></p>
<p><span>I was able to fix the comment at the cost of author information by following this procedure:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Open the document</li><li>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Run Inspect Document</li><li>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Remove "Document Properties and Personal Information"</li><li>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Save &amp; close the file (this step is important!)</li></ol>
<p><span>When I re-open the file, I can see the entire document, and the comment displays the same comment as I see in the reviewing pane.</span></p>
<p><span>After diffing before and after copies of the file, I'd like to try poking at word/comments.xml tomorrow, but I wanted to get this written down before I left
 for the day.</span></p>
<p><span>….</span></p>
<p><span>After a bit of investigation, I found that the date in the comment has a month of zero. Changing that in comments.xml is enough to unbreak the document. I changed
 this:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &lt;w:comment w:id="0" w:author="Author Name Here" w:date="2307-00-23T16:48:00Z" w:initials="ANH"&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>to this:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &lt;w:comment w:id="0" w:author="Author Name Here" w:date="2307-01-23T16:48:00Z" w:initials="ANH"&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>and it worked. I found that I could create new broken documents at will by editing the month on a comment to zero.</span></p>
<p><span>I still don't know how the bad date was inserted in the first place, but I'm attempting to find out what version of Word the author was using.</span></p>
<p><span>Addendum 2014-07-08: The author used Word 2003.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>I had this same problem today. I was unable to see more than 250 pages on a 263 page document. It was showing all pages in "Read mode" but not in "Print Mode"
 in the view tab.</span></p>
<p><span>Solution:</span></p>
<p><span>Go to review tab and next to Track Changes there is a drop down menu (the first one out of three) select "Original".</span></p>
<p><span>This will show you all pages and you can work like normal.</span></p>
<p><span>This should not be happening in the first place, but it is how it is.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&lt;snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>I went a little further and I found that the problem is with the Word 2007/2010 compatibility pack for Word 2003.</span></p>
<p><span>The pack sometimes garbles the dates of comments. In my document, I had timestamps over 24 hours set in 1987!</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;w:comment w:id="28" w:author="Author name" w:date="1987-10-27T28:06:00Z" w:initials="AN"&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Word 2010 just ignored the error as of Word 2013 doesn't show any pages that contain or follow a badly timestamped comment.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope that Microsoft will fix that soon since we will migrate pretty soon to Office 2013 over a period of a year.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>

            OK, so it appears there is a problem with one (or more) of the drawings or text boxes.<br />
At a guess I would say that there is an XML problem.&nbsp; The simplest fix know of is as I said, to open and save the file in LibreOffice.<br />
The next simplest is edit your original posting and add "XML TAG ERROR" to the subject line. This will bring it to the attention of the few "experts" who are willing to manually edit the underlying XML code to fix documents.<br />
Finally, you can be bold and try to fix the XML code yourself.&nbsp; It is not really hard, just a little tricky to understand.
<br />
This is more information than you really want to see, but here is what I've collected about editing the XML code to fix this sort of problem;<br />

 socrtwo replied The error message “Unspecified Error, word/document.xml, Line:2, Column: 0” is pretty useless. You can edit XML to add lines breaks at each XML tag. Then when you open the file it will provide you with hopefully a more usefull line number to
 start from (as long as it is not the end of the document).<br />
&nbsp; Unspecified Error, word/document.xml, Line:2, Column: 0 – end tag &lt;snip&gt; This last DOCX Unspecified error had to do with the &lt;m:num&gt; XML tag and I’ve had a few of those lately. Often, the &lt;m:num&gt;&lt;/m:num&gt; pair contains absolutely no content and can be removed
 without any damage to the DOCX at all. In this case, it was wrapping the letters BH which were the numerator in a formula. The malformed section looked like this, &lt;m:num&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;m:r&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;w:rpr&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;w:rFonts w:ascii&nbsp; …. “Cambria math”/&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/w:rpr&gt;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;m:t&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BH &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/m:t&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/m:r&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;m:ctrlPr&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;w:rpr&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;w:rFontgs w:ascii*”Cambria math” … “cambria math”/&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;w:1/&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;w:rpr&gt; &nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;m:ctrlPr&gt; &lt;/m:num&gt; Now that XML code sequence passes syntax muster but Word still chokes
 on it. This can be proven by extracting the word\document.xml and opening it in Excel (or some other XML editor). I first tried to delete the lower &lt;m:ctrlPr&gt;&lt;/m:ctrlPr&gt; section as it seemed empty of any actual contribution to the content of the DOCX but that
 still did not allow Word to open the document. Failing that, I noted other surrounding text so I could locate the problem area within the document at a later time (e.g. within Word) and snipped out the entire the &lt;m:num&gt;&lt;/m:num&gt; block. This allowed Word to
 open the DOCX. I searched for the surrounding content I had noted previously and recorded the page number. I zoomed to 10% and took a screenshot of the first four pages and wrote my reply. &lt;/snip&gt; Here is another cause for this error: &lt;snip&gt; here’s what caused
 my problem: Where you found the error, I had a checkbox (legacy form field) inside of a plain text content control field.&nbsp; It didn’t cause any problems when left alone, but when I altered only that field (i.e., checked the box), saved the doc, and reopened
 it, presto, there was the error.&nbsp; I guess Word doesn’t like form fields inside of form fields...which is maybe an obvious thing...&nbsp; I’d done it based on a suggestion I found online, because putting the checkbox inside the plain text content control field allowed
 the user to actually tab to the checkbox -- Word won’t tab to it otherwise (apparently due to the mix of legacy fields and 2007 fields).&nbsp; Oh well, I guess I can live without that :-)&nbsp; I took the checkbox out of the plain text field and now the form works fine.
 &lt;/snip&gt; &nbsp; Split DOCX XML into separate line To Better id specific location of End Tag error Unspecified Error, word/document.xml, Line:2, Column: 0 &lt;/snip&gt; Hi. By "normalizing" line endings, do you mean it puts each tag on a separate line? If Microsoft's XML
 Notepad is doing that, then it is a valuable tool. I'll give it a try. What you did, I think Jeeped is doing too. When you put the document.xml tags on separate lines using NotePad++ and then rezip all the files, Word is still able to read it and now tells
 you exactly which line to go to find the XML error. I think even Word 2013 does this. I was first clued into this technique by Daniel "3ICE" Berezvai posts here: http://bit.ly/1s4TPsT. Below are his steps to put the document.xml XML tage on separate lines
 using NotePad++. Please note in step 3, it is vital that you the radio button in the Replace Window in the "Search Mode" Section in the lower left, from "Normal" to "Extended" or it won't work! In Normal mode Notepad++,the new line (\n) and return (\r) character
 combinations will be added as plain text not as the hidden formatting characters they need to be. You can even see these hidden formatting characters by choosing the Show Symbol submenu on the View menu and click on "Show all characters". : 1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Change
 your file extension from docx to zip * 2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The zip structure of corrupt DOCX files with the Unspecified error type are usually not damaged, but if you can't unzip the file, try repairing the zip file first. For that I think the best is the fixfix (-FF) command
 of the free InfoZip's zip.exe. Once you have a repaired zip, I find 7zip is the best at extracting repaired zip files.] 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Extended mode to make the XML more readable, putting each tag on its own line. (The expression \r\n stands for new line in windows.)
 You can use regexp mode or multi-line replace in other text editors, or copy a newline/hidden paragraph symbol and paste it in the replace box. (Which works even in Word.) [Notepad++ even has a halfway decent multiline replace tool in the ToolBucket plugin
 which can easily be using the Plugin Manager on the Plugin menu.] 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;and rezip if you have unzipped to extract the word/document.xml file. It is imperative to rezip starting for the root of the file, where the [Content_Types].xml hangs out. Don't go up
 one level so that you are zipping one folder which has the _rels,&nbsp; customXml, docProps and word folders plus the [Content_Types].xml (if your file has all those folders otherwise work with what you have), otherwise Word won't recognize it]* 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rename
 it back from zip to docx * 6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attempt to open the document 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that this time the error message will be more useful, for example it will tell you that the error is at: line 13540, as opposed to line 2 column 0. 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the line
 specified (was 13540 for me) and remove it. And the tags around it too, if necessary. Make sure you keep the XML well-formatted! (You can attempt to fix the erroneous line instead of removing it, but usually the indicated line is as useless as the other lines
 around it, so removal will not result in any loss of data. See the note** below for why this is.) 9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Import document.xml and rename zip/docx as usual. * 10.&nbsp; Repeat steps 6-9 until your document is recovered. (Took me 5 repeats, as more errors arose
 at lines 15870, 13595, 13222 and 10835.*** (Not sure why it found errors in reverse order, but it did.) &nbsp; * These steps are unnecessary if you use Total Commander (or other advanced file managers). It can look inside docx files as if they were folders because
 it automatically recognizes them as compressed archives. It also lets you edit files easier, just press F4. And it even detects file changes and asks if it should reimport your edited files into the archive upon closing the editor. &nbsp; ** Note: To me it seems
 that none of the errors were real. While the source code was extremely bloated and wasteful, every indicated error was a line with completely well formed XML. (Around it was good XML too.) For pages and pages, almost every line repeated the same statement:"
 &lt;/snip&gt; &nbsp; ******** &lt;snip&gt; I don't know if this is one of the line: 2 column: 0 threads where I've detailed my own methods (and don't want to go through 39 pages of replies to find out) so I'll supplement here. Rather than use the native ability of Windows
 7 to look into a renamed .ZIP (from .DOCX), I use WinRAR to open the DOCX directly. After the first time a full right-click, Open with..., Browse&nbsp; has been performed on a DOCX, WinRAR will be in the list of right-click, Open with... programs. After associating
 the .XML extension with Notepad++ as the default, simply double-clicking the word/Document.xml file from within WinRAR is sufficient to open it in Notepad++ as a TMP file. The big benefit is that making corrections then saving in Notepad++ produces a message
 box in WinRAR (Do you want to update the archive?). Click Yes and then attempt to open the DOCX in Word immediately. It takes a small bit of effort to get WinRAR into the Open with... list of programs and associate the .XML extension with Notepad++ but that
 only has to be done once. There is no right-click, Open with in WinRAR so it has to be the default. I did that years ago and it is still saving me time for every new corrupt DOCX I work on by not having to rename/re-rename the DOCX to .ZIP and back for every
 attempt at opening the corrected document. The described 'cascade failures' can easily run up to a dozen or more (I start trying Find &amp; Replace All after two or three) and this is the easiest way I know. I am impressed by the description of the Microsoft's
 XML Notepad's ability to adjust an XML file into properly formatted XML syntax layout. I hope it indents parent/child nesting properly. I plan to try it sometime soon but if anyone has any experience with how it handles &gt;10Mb XML files, I would appreciate
 them sharing that here. &lt;/snip&gt; Fix End Tag Mismatch - use SynText’s SernaFree Editor How can I open a document with an end tag/start tag mismatch when the automatic fixit does not work? Thank you for the thorough information. Though hard to read through,
 I did follow one of the links (http://runferalrun.wordpress.com/2012/08/31/the-name-in-the-end-tag-of-the-element-word-2010-error/) and following his instructions - including downloading a free XML editor - I was able to restore my document. The Serna XML
 editor he recommended found 3 tags that Word had opened but not closed. The editor put my cursor exactly where the tag was expected and his instructions were accurate in how I was to fix the error. &nbsp; http://www.brandwares.com/bestpractices/2015/02/xml-hacking-an-introduction/
 Posted on February 20, 2015 - Updated on May 5, 2016 With the introduction of Office 2007, Microsoft changed the basic file format that underlies Word, PowerPoint and Excel. Instead of the proprietary and mostly undocumented format that ruled from Office 97
 to Office 2003, Microsoft made a smart decision and switched to XML. This is tagged text, similar in structure and concept to HTML code with which you may already be familiar.<br />

XML Notepad 2000 https://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=7973 &lt;snip&gt; Free MS XML editor Thanks to your advice I managed to restore my document and it saved me a ton of headache. So I thought I should write some words about the method
 I used to fix xml errors in document.xml. I opened the docx in 7-zip and unzipped document.xml. The problem was that document.xml had ~90k tags so this was far too much to read through manually to find the error. What I also saw is that Word store document.xml
 without Windows line endings, so the whole document was on one line(I saw this when I opened it in Notepad and Visual Studio). &nbsp;I then opened document.xml with Microsoft Xml Notepad and saved it again. Xml Notepad is configured to normalize the line endings
 when saving the xml file. I zipped document.xml back into the docx-file and opened it in Word. This time, instead of getting Line:2,column:0, I got something like Line:75377,column:0. I then jumped to the erroneous line, deleted it and some other suspicious
 tags around it and zipped document.xml back into the docx. Opened the document in word again, got an error on a different line and repeated the procedure. After three attempts I had managed to clean my document of errors and it opened correctly in Word. Word
 2007 will often show the location of the error when Word 2010 or 2013 will not but not everyone has access to multiple Office versions. &lt;/snip&gt; &nbsp; Recover data from a damaged Office file with the help of 7-Zip http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/itdojo/recover-data-from-a-damaged-office-file-with-the-help-of-7-zip/3993

 They have different causes and different fixes. This one can be identified by the “Line: 2, Column: 0” in the error messge. This problem can be fixed by applying the hotfix in KB2817583. The other one lists a LARGE column number “Line: 2, Column: 100001”.
 This type of error requires manual editing to place the missing End Tag into the file. Described below One Person reported being able to fix this sort of problem simply by doing a File / Open and save in Libre Office. &nbsp; Can’t open Word File because of end

 Be patient as it may take a few minutes. If a repair is not possible, you can then post to a public file area and someone here can attempt a manual repair. &nbsp; Preventative suggestions &lt;snip Jeeped&gt; I don’t think that anyone can completely stop editing equations,
 but pre-planning them should avoid unnecessary edits. While I have no concrete, reproducible evidence that editing equations is a cause, I have made these empirical observations: •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I cannot state precisely what many of the DOCX XML tags do, but basic XML
 syntax rules would suggest that code like: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;m:oMath&gt;&lt;m:e&gt;&lt;m:ctrlPr/&gt;&lt;/m:e&gt;&lt;/m:oMath&gt; ... does nothing at all since it closes everything it opens and offers no content. It looks to me that this is a result of deleting one or more characters
 from an equation. •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;While Word 2010 reports these as a problem at: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Line: 2&nbsp; Column: 0 ... Word 2007 will still report the actual position, e.g.: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Line: 2&nbsp; Column: 2726981 I keep a copy of Word 2007 side-by-side Word 2010
 for no other purpose. It’s the only Office 2007 program on my computer. This seems like it is actually a step backwards from a resolution since Word 2010 no longer seems to be able to parse its own error. •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Whether the syntax is truly useless and non-effective
 for any intent or purpose is actually beside the point. The syntax passes conformity tests and the DOCX should launch. Why an 85 page document is ‘broken’ due to a few empty XML formatting tags while retaining legal syntax structure is beyond me. •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I try
 to pass along the area that the problem was in and several times people have remarked that the area I report was the place they were last making modifications/deletions to equations (not additions) when the no-load corruption occurred. •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When no indication
 from the OP is offered on what was worked on last, the Line: 2 Column: 0 corruption often comes within a formula at the very end of the unfinished Word/Document.xml file and it may be inferred that this was the last place being worked upon. •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The corrupt
 DOCX files I’ve worked on are very commonly at the last stages of development with a large complex document. While there couldn’t be a worse time for a corruption to appear, it would seem that small edits to existing content are causing it and not large scale
 new content generation. Not one of these points is a definitive ‘smoking gun’, but put together they seem to indicate formula editing and not formula writing as a cause for the Line: 2 Column: 0 corruption. If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it
 is most often a duck. &lt;/snip&gt; &nbsp; How to Edit Equations without causing the “End Tag” error http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_2010-word/how-do-i-modify-a-simple-equation-in-word-2010/fdd35c4d-45ce-46bc-a9ad-a6f909812159 This discussion &nbsp;

 &lt;mc:Choice Requires=”wps”&gt; &lt;m:oMath&gt; … &lt;/mc:AlternateContent&gt; &lt;/m:oMath&gt; Correct tags: &lt;m:oMath&gt; &lt;mc:AlternateContent&gt; &lt;mc:Choice Requires=”wps”&gt; … &lt;/mc:AlternateContent&gt; &lt;/m:oMath&gt; Note: You will have to use an application such as Notepad to edit the XML.
 &nbsp; Manual Technique &lt;snip&gt;&nbsp; A DOCX document is actually a .ZIP file that contains many internal components. There is an internal folder called word which will always contain a document.xml file. This file is the basis of the document’s layout and content. Assuming
 that the DOCX archive structure has not been corrupted, it can be opened in an archive utility. I use WinRAR for this. Once opened in WinRAR, you can drill down into the word folder and see the document.xml file. I use Notepad++ as a text editing tool and
 have the .xml file extension associated with this program so i can simply double-click document.xml in WinRAR to open an editing session. Notepad++ has cursor positioning in the right-hand side of the status bar and finding the position of the error (supplied
 by a failed open in Word) is pretty straightforward. I look for empty formatting tags first and only remove content if removing empty tags does not allow the document to be opened. I try to note existing content in the area that I make modifications in order
 that I can supply position reference information to the owner of the DOCX. When editing, I assume the philosophy that kess is more. My target is to get the document to open in Word with as little modification as possible and let the original owner of the DOCX
 make any necessary adjustments. I should mention that after making a change to word/document.xml you need to save it in Notepad++ then go to WinRAR and acknowledge that you want to update the file in the DOCX archive. Once the archive is updated, you can attempt
 to open the DOCX in Word to see if your efforts are successful. WinRAR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notepad++&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/snip&gt; &nbsp; Further Fixes The Fix it solution in this article should let you recover your Word document. However, the symptoms
 will reappear when you make any further edits to the document unless the core problem in the structure of the document is resolved. To try to correct the core problem, follow one of these workarounds: Install Office 2010 Service Pack 1 Office 2010 Service
 Pack 1 resolves this issue for new files. It will also prevent the problem from recurring with any files that were recovered with the Fix it solution in this article. To download Office 2010 Service Pack 1, follow the steps provided in this Microsoft knowledge
 base article: 2460049 - Description of Office 2010 SP1 Grouping Objects The steps provided work best under Word 2010: •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After you open the recovered document, turn on the Selection pane. This can be found in the Home tab of the ribbon. The editing group
 of the Home tab has a dropdown button named Select. •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click the Select button, and then click Selection Pane... •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Press the Ctrl button on your keyboard and then click each text box in the selection pane. •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click the Group button under the Format
 tab. This will group all the objects together. •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as you have all objects grouped on each page, save the document under a new name. &nbsp; Save the document in the .RTF file format The steps provided work for both Word 2007 and Word 2010: •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;After you
 open the recovered document, click File and select Save (for Word 2007 click the Office button and select Save As) •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In the Save As dialog box, click “Save as type:” dropdown and select Rich Text format (*.rtf). •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click Save. &nbsp; Click to view this blog

 30day free trial, enough for average person to fix a file) Notepad ++ is a good, free editor for this type of task •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Make a copy of the file •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rename the copy from DOCX to ZIP •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Open … .ZIP/word/document.xml in notepad •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Copy the contents of the
 file to clipboard •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Open Word •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Paste a copy of the copied XML into Word •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(optional) the XML is one long string too hard to read, you can replace some tags, with that tag plus a para mark to break up the text to make it more people readable. •&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;Open an XML validator, ie this site on the internet: http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_validator.asp •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Paste another copy of the XML into the “Syntax Check Your XML” input window •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click on “validate” button •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Copy the missing tag, ie &lt;/mc:Fallback&gt;&nbsp;
 (yours will be different) •&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Return to word Find: mc:Fallback&gt;&nbsp; (without the &lt;/ so you find both open and closing tags).&nbsp; Repeat find until you hit 2 open tags in a row.&nbsp; Then you just have to figure out where to put the closing tag between them.&nbsp; Look for
 other tags before and after a proper closing tag so you can match the problem area to a good area. &nbsp; Bonus tip: Win7 Win8 Math Equation Input Panel / Math input Panel http://www.lytebyte.com/2009/07/24/guide-to-math-input-panel-in-windows-7/ &nbsp; http://www.7tutorials.com/windows-7s-tablet-input-panel-text-entry-and-handwriting-recognition

 This page has the most readable description of Word file structures, DOC and DOCX, I have seen so far<br />
&nbsp; FreeFileViewer – reads 100+ text, Office, audio, video format file types – Can open some XML tag error files http://www.freefileviewer.com/formats.html &nbsp; Can’t open Word file due to undeclared prefix, Location: Part: /word/document.xml, Line:91, Column: 49921
 The most likely cause of your particular problem is that you are missing a schema prefix reference within the opening &lt;document ...&gt; XML tag (usually the second one). Different schema references are required for various types of specialty content. Here is
 a sample opening &lt;document ...&gt; tag with a large number of various schema prefix codes. If I remove one or two of these, i can reproduce your error message. &lt;w:document xmlns:ve=”http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006” xmlns:o=”urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office”
 xmlns:r=”http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships” xmlns:m=”http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/math” xmlns:v=”urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml” xmlns:wp=”http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/wordprocessingDrawing”

 post an unadulterated copy of your document to a public file area (as noted above) and post the location back here, someone may be able to help. If you are going to go this route, send a copy that has not already been subjected to repair attempts. FWIW, while
 it may be hard to determine exactly which schema you may be missing, I do not believe that having extras causes any problems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; BTW, you don’t actually have torename the DOCX file extension ifyou have an archivig program.

            <p><span>Seems to me, the problem is in the file structure level.</span></p>
<p>Certainly there is some error in the application code (MS Word 2013) that is associated with the saving file - there is some connection between the error in the file structure, the application of NUMBERED styles and visualization of the text Page
 Print View. I found that until I used build in styles (Heading 1,2,3 etc.) without numbered list, the file and visualization is without problems. After applying of numbered list the file became corrupted which not appeared until I tryed to scroll down to the
 end of the text. Using the method of saving in RTF or switching to web-preview, or switching to Draft View is still working, i.e. the text is there, but can not be visualized properly in Page View.</p>
<p>Aparently, this is an error of XML file structure and there is no sense to be touched by hand in the file itself, it is a problem of Microsoft and have to wait until they will fix it. I do not know whether the same is repeated in other older versions
 or in that of 2016, if you have it in the latest, so nothing is done.</p>

            <p>Actually this is good for you. Your content is still there! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I know for sure that 2010 (and 2007) had code errors that caused XML corruption. The ones I am aware of are associated with the equation editor.&nbsp; But that there may be others, deeply buried that require very rare specific conditions to trigger is not
 a surprise. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The good part for you is that the "x-file" type allows us to edit the raw XML code and FIX these sorts of problems, if we can figure them out!&nbsp; There are a couple of people on this question who do that sort of work. Maybe they can figure out your problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, the fundamental problem and solution are a simple matter of pattern matching.&nbsp; While some XML codes are single codes, many come in pairs, an opening and closing command. &nbsp; It is very likely that your problem is being caused by a missing or misplaced
 XML code. If you can recognize where a code is missing or misplaced you could fix it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately there are some XML editor programs that help with this problem. They "format" the XML code using indents and colors to make it easier to identify code pairs. It makes identifying where code pairs have gone wrong easier.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not have to wait for MS to figure out the problem. Because it is apparently so rare it is likely to be a low priority. AND anyway, any fix they make to the program code would NOT fix your corrupted file.

<p>
</p><p>Of course, if a document is saved directly to removable media, it is very likely to suffer catastrophic corruption from which recovery may be impossible because the file structure is so badly damaged.</p>

    <title>How can i cancel my skype contract&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dennisommert  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can i cancel my skype contract&#63;</h2>
                    I ended up with 2 Skype accounts and sought to cancel the business version of Skype and keep the personal account.&nbsp; I worked with a Microsoft rep and ended inadvertently cancelling the wrong account.&nbsp; I am now in a situation where I am waiting 3 months
 till I can end the business account - cancelling each component of the Skype contract as it is due for renewal.&nbsp; I would like to be able to end the contract now rather than doing a 3 month process without using Skype and cancelling each component of the contract
 one at a time.&nbsp; Is there a better, more efficient way of ending this commitment?
