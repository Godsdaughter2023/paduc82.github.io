<h2>            Excel 15.32 cant open email attachments for MAC user</h2>
                    I have a user that is currently unable to open Excel email attachments as of yesterday through her Outlook on her Macbook. It asks to "grant access" when clicked on and then it say that file cant be opened because the file format or extension is not valid.
 Verify that the file has not been corrupted and that the file matches the format of the file.

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As 15.32 is not the latest version of Office for Mac, you may firstly let her update Office to the latest released version 15.33. Meanwhile, if she uses some third-party font management apps, turn off them to check the outcome.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know some updates when you have time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

    <title>Rules and Outlook 2007 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skepticva  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rules and Outlook 2007</h2>
                    I have my outlook.com account linked to my office outlook application. None of my rules appear to work unless I set them up on the web version of outlook. Thats fine I can handle that little bit of annoyance, The bigger issue is that my choices are limited.
 For instance I cannot move anything to my deleted folder, my only option is to permanently delete them without review the contents first. The other issue is not being able to set rules up using the office application and moving them to the deleted folder.
 Why the disconnect between the two and why the limited rules options on the web version. Somehow I expected the two to have the same level of functionality.&nbsp;

            Hi,
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Try to completely uninstall OneDrive: 
<br />
<br />1. Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode: Right-click on the Windows icon in the taskbar and select Command Prompt (Admin). 
<br />2. Type in taskkill /f /im OneDrive.exe to terminate any OneDrive processes and hit Enter. 
<br />Then type in either %SystemRoot%\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 32-bit Windows 10 or %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 64-bit Windows 10 and hit Enter. 
<br />
<br />
<br />After that Go to RegEdit on this path: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive 
<br />You can remove all folders that include OneDrive numeric version 
<br />and from the Account, folders directory remove all the folders inside 
<br />
<br />After that restart the pc and install One Drive latest version from this link:

    <title>Cannot Resize Word Art With Office 2013 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scout44  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Resize Word Art With Office 2013</h2>
                    I recently began using Office 2013 Home and Student on Windows&nbsp;7 on a new computer. I cannot resize word art as I could with Office 2003/Windows XP. Dragging a resizing handle changes the size of the box containing the word art but the letters remain the
 same size. Another help&nbsp;tip&nbsp;I found said to use Drawing Tools&gt;Format&gt;Text Effects&gt;Transform but the Transform option does not appear. I loaded a document with word art&nbsp;created with&nbsp;Office Word&nbsp;2003/Windows XP and in 'compatibility mode' the resizing handles&nbsp;do
 resize the word art letters as desired. Any suggestions?

            <p>Yes, that is the "new and improved" way that Wordart works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can change the WordArt font size the same way you change body text size.&nbsp; Select the text and set the new font size in the Home tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Transform is located in Drawing Tools contextual tab &gt;Format contextual tab &gt;WordArt Styles group &gt; Text Effects drop down &gt; Transform command.&nbsp; But this command does not affect font size. It gives you access to alternate shapes for the WordArt box, that
 change how the text is displayed. Similar to what you could easily do in Word 2003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also copy a WordArt from a 2003 format file and paste it into a 2013 format file. When you click on pasted WordArt it will switch Word to Compatibility mode.</p>
<p>You can get an addin (template) that will enable 2003 format WordArt in 2010 and 2013:</p>

 - In Word 2010 .docx formatted documents the legacy WordArt Dropdown gallery is not available and the items must be recreated via text effects or imported from a legacy document. This macro-free Add-In gives the users a custom AutoText gallery on the Quick
 Access Toolbar that allows use of the traditional choices as an addition to the WordArt directly available in Word 2010. 30 AutoText entries are in the Custom 4 gallery. (Dotx template in 52K zip folder, contains gallery and QAT assignment, Version 2013.03)

This is a workspace to check out different text effects. It was prepared in the process of trying to simulate the Word 2003 WordArt gallery using Word 2010 tools. It is rough. I do not know that it is more helpful than the galleries themselves.</p>

    <title>Zune to Groove Ripoff - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> j.d.d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Zune to Groove Ripoff</h2>
                    <p>I am the latest victim of this debacle. I had an annual Zune pass that renewed and was supposed to be good through 8/2016. I got the emails about the transition to Groove, and promises of a partial refund if I were to cancel. I'm not actually sure if I actively
 cancelled the service myself, or if it was automatically cancelled on November 17 when they finished the transition. I was still using Groove up to that point. They tried to make it sound like this is my fault for cancelling at the wrong time or something.
 Anyway, I never got a refund and now they refuse to give me one. And I don't even have access to the service anymore! Below is the transcript of my chat. It's obvious that there is a communication disconnect within Microsoft, and they don't even know what's
 supposed to be going on. I am furious, and would appreciate any info on how to rectify this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">You are now chatting with 'Kendra D'</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;Hello, thank you for contacting Xbox Customer Support. &nbsp;My name is Kendra D. &nbsp;How can I help you today?</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;I had an annual Zune subscription that renewed in August, so it should have gone through Aug 2016. However, Microsoft
 cancelled the subscription and I'm not interested in paying for Groove, so I expect a refund.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;Sorry to hear you're having issues with your Zune subscription.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;When you say Microsoft cancelled the subscription, do you mean an agent cancelled it in error?</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;No, I got an email stating that they were discontinuing the Zune subscriptions and transferring to Groove, but
 it gave me the option to cancel so I did. I haven't received my refund yet.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;After you chose to discontinue, were you charged anyway for a subscription you didn't want?</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;I was charged for 12 months of Groove Music on 9/14/2015, but it expired on 11/17/2015 when I got the email and
 chose to discontinue.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;Okay, let me take a look at the account.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;May I have your gamertag, email, and name please?</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;My name is &lt;redacted&gt;, email is &lt;redacted&gt;, and I don't know if I have a gamertag.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;Okay no worries, let me bring up that account.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;Oh it might be &lt;redacted&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;Okay I'll try that as well.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;We just need to verify the account to continue. To verify, I am sending you a support code that will come as a text
 and email to the phone(s) and email(s) on the account. Once you have the code, please let me know and provide it for me.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;Okay it is &lt;redacted&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;Would you happen to also be an Xbox customer as well?</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;No, I'm not</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;How were you using your Zune? &nbsp;Just on a computer?</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;Yes, I own a Zune device and also used the Zune software on my PC.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;Okay got it, just wanted to make sure my note taking was accurate.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;Okay I see the last charge for the Zune on 8/20/2015 for a 12 month subscription.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;Correct, I must have paid it on 9/14</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;And you're saying that you would like a refund for the entire charge, because it was switched to Groove and you had
 no interest in Groove?</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;Yes, either a full refund or a prorated refund for the 10 months after it was discontinued which would be fair</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;Okay allow me to take a look and make sure of what we can offer you today.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;Give me a moment please.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;Okay thanks</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;Okay Joseph, I'm still making sure of what we can do for you.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;Just give me a little bit more of your time and patience.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;Sure, I'll hold tight</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;I do apologize for the wait.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;However, at this time we will not be able to offer a refund in whole or in part for the change from Zune to Groove.
 &nbsp;I do see however, that the subscription has auto renew turned off and has already been cancelled.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;Yes.... it has been cancelled, and therefore I paid for a service that I am not receiving. I don't think that
 is defensible on Microsoft's part.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;I certainly understand your issue and why you feel the way you do. &nbsp;However, we can only refund subscriptions that are
 3 or 12 months long, during the first 30 days of purchase. &nbsp;Afterwards if the subscription is willingly cancelled by the customer, we can no longer offer refunds for the service.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;That would have been impossible, because I was not notified that Zune was being discontinued within 30 days.
 That is a terrible and deceptive business practice.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;I'm sorry you feel as though we haven't been fair to you, however Groove is different from Zune, but all of the previous
 customers would have still had access to all of their music from Zune even if they switched. &nbsp;Perhaps you may want to give Groove a try at some point?</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;I did give it a try, but it was lacking many of the features that existed in the Zune service, which is why I
 cancelled it. It is no longer worth the price I paid for it. If Microsoft completely changes the service after the 30 days past my purchase date, and then cannot refund the money while not providing me any service whatsoever, I deem that to be fradulent.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;*fraudulent</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;Once again, I definitely understand how you feel, but we are still unable to process a refund for you for this issue.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;Can I cancel my subscription? Of course we hate to see you go, but if you’d like to cancel, you can do so through
 your Microsoft account. Monthly subscriptions will terminate at the end of the current paid period, while 3-month and annual subscribers will have their subscriptions terminated between October 15 and November 15. If there is time left on your subscription,
 you may be eligible for a refund. Am I eligible for a refund? If the migration to Groove terminates your Zune subscription before the end of your annual or 3-month Zune subscription, you may be eligible for a refund. Details about refunds will be emailed to
 you soon. Refunds will be credited to the payment option associated with your Microsoft account. If you don't have a payment option associated with your account, the amount of the refund will be credited to your Microsoft account and available for future purchases
 on the Microsoft Store. Note Monthly subscribers aren’t eligible for a refund.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;This is what it said at the page the email sent me to. It certainly implies that annual subscribers may cancel
 and receive a refund.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3096659" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/</a></span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;I see, let me ask again to see what we can arrange.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;Thank you for that by the way, and the link as well.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;No problem.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;Still talking to a supervisor about a partial refund, thanks so much for your patience.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;Thank you as well</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;Still waiting on an answer for you Joseph.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;You have been more than patient and I thank you for it.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;Thanks.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;Alright, I have gotten some clarification on that. &nbsp;The subscription needed to be still active between October 15 and
 November 15 in order to qualify for a prorated refund. &nbsp;Your subscription is already cancelled by November 17.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;At this time we will be unable to process a refund for you.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;I cannot believe this. It's like the rules are being made up after the fact. That was never conveyed in the communications
 they sent nor on the FAQ page. I'm just disgusted.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;I definitely left no stone unturned, and I do apologize for the inconvenience. &nbsp;The subscription was deemed to have
 been willingly cancelled by you, so in that instance we can no longer offer a refund.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;I don't think I even willingly cancelled it... I just got an email on Nov 17 saying that "We're sending you this
 message to confirm that your Xbox Music Pass - 12 Month subscription ended on Tuesday, November 17, 2015."</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;I think that was when the service transitioned automatically</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;We are unable to process a refund for you at this time Joseph.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;That is extremely frustrating, and I very much feel that I have been ripped off.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;I do apologize for the inconvenience. &nbsp;Is there anything else I can assist you with today?</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;Only if you can connect me to someone I can appeal this to.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Kendra D:</span><span>&nbsp;I can give you the phone support number if you like. &nbsp;You may ask to speak to a supervisor once you're connected.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Joseph:</span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;Okay, I will try that.</span><br />

            <p>To the Microsoft forum operators,</p>
<p>I know you have no decision-making capabilities at Microsoft, but please pass this along to the vice presidents who matter... &nbsp;I have been loyal to MS for 2 decades, and I've been an outspoken advocate for the Zune device and service since its inception.
 &nbsp;I cannot fathom how the company decision makers can decide to "compensate" loyal customers, who've spent a lot of money on your hardware and music service, with 3 free months of service for all of this pain. &nbsp;I stayed with the Zune service/device because
 it was superior. &nbsp;It no longer offers any advantage to anything else, so you force me to look elsewhere for not repaying my loyalty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Kevin S.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I'm sorry but Skype numbers are only able to receive one call at a time. Succeeding calls after the first call received by the Skype number will be routed to call forwarding if you have set it up on your account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Alternatively, you can create a group call and host a conference. You may add&nbsp;participants to that group and then start a call with these added people. Just to add, you will be needing a calling subscription if these participants are using landline
 and mobile during the call.</span></p>

<h2>            unstoppable daily spam from domain dailymailz.net</h2>
                    <p>Greetings everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go straight to the point: I tried several times to block and\or automatically delete spam messages from the domain&nbsp;<strong>dailymailz.net</strong> without any result. In order to avoid unconfortable conflicts, days ago I even deleted all of old my rules
 and made brand new ones (one or two very&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">specific
</span>for that domain) but i'm still getting them every day. Header rules can't stop them as well. I'm pretty sure somebody else has such problem but perhaps they can't manage it properly because they can't look into the message source (this is the only way
 to see the real sender of this junk).</p>
<p>Assumed I'm using my hotmail.com account via WEB, what can we do?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Paolo</p>

<strong>Junk </strong>once you got those spam emails. You need to do this every time you get them in your inbox. Monitor your emails and see if it's still getting through your inbox or it goes to the junk folder. See attach picture below:</p>

</p><p>This company has its business in the spam environment. It should be dropped and not allowed to pass through the MSoft antispam systems... this is my honest opinion. But i see"&nbsp;<em>protection.outlook.com: domain of mail0122.dailymailz.net</em><br />

            I do not think that the inbuilt GPS can be locked. It is a GPS receiver that receives signals from satellites.<br />
<br />
You have to open the Nokia Map application in order to use the GPS receiver.<br />
<br />
Then from menu, open the GPS data -&gt; Position -&gt; Options -&gt; satellite status. You should see the satellites status on the display.

<h3> justsomeuser9  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I list and delete macros in Word 2013</h2>
                    <p>Lately, when I start MS Word with a new document, I get a security warning that "Macros have been disabled". My only options are to enable content (yes, just one). There is no way for me to look at what the macros are and delete them. I have searched the
 web and it shows how to do it if you have VB, but I don't seem to have that. How can I examine and or delete these stray macros which have been put on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that they are not viruses. I have plenty of anti-malware software up-to-date and running (MSSE and Malwarebytes).</p>

            <p>... "when I start Word with a new document."</p>
<p>Do you mean starting Word by opening a document which is new to you, or, do you mean starting Word, creating a new document as a part of the process of starting Word? If the former, there may be macros in the "new" document you are opening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the latter, you may have a problem with either your normal template or an errant Add-In.</p>
<p>You can check on your normal template by renaming it, with Word closed, and re-opening Word.</p>
<p><a href="http://addbalance.com/word/normaltemplate.htm#Find" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Find the Normal Template</a></p>
<p>If the problem goes away, your normal template was the problem. If not rename it back and continue on to Add-Ins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check whether the problem is with an Add-In by using the /a command-line switch as described below:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.addbalance.com/word/addins.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add-Ins in Microsoft Word</a>
</p>
<p>That switch will start Word without any Add-Ins. If the problem goes away with that switch, you need to identify the Add-In causing the problem. This involves switching them all off and then turning them back on, one at a time, until the problem recurs.
 Then you write the author of the Add-In and ask that author to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you asked how you can list macros, but you do not need to list them to fix this and in many instances you will not be able to list them.</p>

The problem is with the Add-Ins. I'm still investigating which one(s). It's strange because I don't recall adding any Add-Ins recently.

            To add to what Jay has said, it appears that the MathPlayer add-in must be in a folder that is not trusted. This may be a flaw in Design Science's install routine, or it could be that your Word Startup folder (which is where I would expect it to be) is
 not a trusted location, which it should be (<strong>File | Options | Trust Center | Trust Center Settings | Trusted Locations</strong>).

<p>If it is a template Add-In you can find it in your Word <a href="http://addbalance.com/word/startup.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Startup Folder</a> . As Suzanne stated, that folder should be a "trusted location. Templates in that folder are automatically loaded as Add-Ins when you start Word. To disable it, move it out of your Startup Folder. You can still load it later if you need it
 by going to the Manage Add-Ins dialog and Adding it.</p>

first of all Outlook is not good at all , its so bad and so sucks and so weak and so poor and missing a lot of things , and i can't deal with it , Sorry but i hate it and Microsoft you can't force us to use something we don't need to use, we are not slaves
 for your technology , So you had option back to Hotmail before , why you disable it now ?? because you found out most of people went back to Hotmail , so this means these people doesn't like this thing called outlook , its not goooooooooooooooood , anyway
 i want a way to go back to hotmail , i swear i can't stand the interface of outlook , find me a wayyyyyyyyyy .. when i try to forward a message and send it , it send with including old emails and data and when i tried to delete the including data before i
 send i can't scroll down and i can't see them or delete them .. its one of the mistakes ,,, stupid outlook options ,,, fix it firstttttttttttttttttttt and then tell us to use itttttttttttttttttttt ....</p>

            Try instead&nbsp; locating the File, make a zip file go to finder &gt; File menu &gt; Compress
<br />
That will create a zip archive of the file. attach to email. Send. <br />
<br />
The person on the other end will save the attachment. Then double-click the zip file. the file will show up on their computer. They can then open it.

<h2>            How can I reactivate my credit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I received an e-mail advising me that my credit had expired. When I sign in to my account (the only Skype account that I have ever owned or used), no "Reactivate Credit" appears. And, by the way, my contacts have disappeared as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps what I really want to ask is, how can I get a refund of my credit, because after a half hour now of frustration I am on the edge of wanting to leave Skype forever.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm glad that you were able to re-activate your credits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only time you get to have multiple accounts in Skype is when you login using your email instead of your Skype Name/Username.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if your Skype account and Microsoft account is linked, you will have to use your specific Skype Name/Username because this are separate accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any subscription, credits, messages and even contacts is only visible to the Skype account and will not appear on the Microsoft account linked to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving forward, make sure to always use your Skype Name/Username instead of your email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have other concerns.</p>

<h2>            Directions In Live Search</h2>
                    I have e problem using Live search on my HTC Pro WM6.1. When i try to search an address from directions tap it goes to directions Start and End with options to change either one of them. The problem appears when I try to change End (New Ending Location)
 it allays goes back as We couldn't find any results for........NEAR HOME.<br />
For some reason it searches only around the place that the GPS sensor is detecting a location, instead of searching the address typed. This is&nbsp;under "directions" tap and It was not like that before- I've been using the application for 3-4 years on my old WM5
 phone and never had problems before. Please help.

            OK, so how are you entering the address for the new location.<br />
<br />
For example, I am currently on Maine right now so Live Search is showing the starting location as Damariscotta, ME<br />
<br />
In the NEW ENDING LOCATION I entered where I grew up (oh so many years ago): 139 Beal Road, Waltham, MA 02453<br />
<br />
It searched and found it.<br />
<br />
Next I tried 12 Pomeroy street, Alston ma 02134 and it could not find the address but if I just used the zip code, it found the area and gave direction to be very close to where I wanted.<br />
<br />
I tried a variety of other address and it worked on all so I guess you need to try a couple to get the hang of it and if it can't be found try just the zip or the city and zip<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck, it is a great program!

            Up, that is how it worked before. Once again, I'm using it since the program started in 2004 or 2005.-I was truck driver and used every day all over the states without problems. Now it is different and for some reason it always searches nearby the starting
 location, not the roads and addresses within the US. I reinstalled and the results are same. Thank you.

            What it does is instead of searching addresses in the whole US, it searches the same as one would search from Categories tab and give you same results in 25 mile radius around the location place of an input. Somehow it is mixed up. When you hit direction
 it give you Start (option to change) and End with option to change. Then you should put a new location- either starting or ending. When you choose new location there are these options: To Speak or Type location and Current GPS, Recent, Point on Map, Contacts,
 list Cities. It does the same thing every time i type ZIP or address- Ends on ....Near your current location that you've put for start the road. I'm able to choose on the map and it calculate the road and works fine,&nbsp;also&nbsp;works with preset addresses and locations
 that are coming with the program, the only problem is when you try to change one of the start/end values. Then again same thing- could not find zip/address/place.......Near start. I did use it earlier this morning and it was working fine and perfect as always.
 And then in the afternoon i was preparing my roads for tomorrow and then it started. Reinstall is not changing it. I'm looking for older versions to see if that will help. Thank You!

<p>When you choose new location there are these options: To Speak or Type location and Current GPS, Recent, Point on Map, Contacts, list Cities. It does the same thing every time i type ZIP or address- Ends on ....Near your current location that you've put
 for start the road. </p>
<br />
<br />
Not sure why that happens ... <br />
<br />
If I can't get the address I want, I try alternates and generally that will work.<br />
<br />
<div><span>MilenG said:</span>
<p>&nbsp;I'm able to choose on the map and it calculate the road and works fine,&nbsp;also&nbsp;works with preset addresses and locations that are coming with the program, the only problem is when you try to change one of the start/end values. Then again same thing- could
 not find zip/address/place.......Near start. I did use it earlier this morning and it was working fine and perfect as always. And then in the afternoon i was preparing my roads for tomorrow and then it started.</p>
<br />
At least you can find it on the map if you had too so it is not totally out to lunch (so to speak).&nbsp; I can appreciate the frustration .. it is definitely not a perfect solution yet but they are always tring to imnprove it.<br />
<br />
<div><span>MilenG said:</span>
<p>Reinstall is not changing it. I'm looking for older versions to see if that will help.
</p>
<br />
<br />
The reinstall is not the solution nor do I think you are making any errors.&nbsp; I think it is a function of the particular search.&nbsp;

<h2>            Compile error error in hidden module&#58; Control_Interface</h2>
                    Hello. I am receiving this error when trying to open a file. It works fine when I run Office for Windows in Bootcamp, but it is one of the few reasons I still need to run Bootcamp. It is a protected worksheet that I received from a vendor of mine to place
 orders. In Windows, when you open the file, a separate window opens where you input certain information. This window does not appear like a standard Excel spreadsheet, but it has drop down options to pick colors, designs, etc., as well as inputting shipping
 information, billing information, etc. After inputting this information, it takes you to a more standard looking spreadsheet, where you enter the products you are ordering. Most cells in this sheet are locked, except for several that allow user input such
 as notes, options, local tax rate, etc. When you try to open this file in OSX (Lion), it gives you the above error and goes directly to the traditional looking spreadsheet. You can still enter information, but pricing will come up

            The problem is that the author has probably used active-x controls which will not work on macintosh, and/or has used windows internal functions that will not work. If you have no control over the contents of the macro and can not get the author to make
 any changes than your only alternatives are to use Bootcamp as you are doing, or one of the other windows supporting packages such as Parallels or VM Ware.<br />

            If your rollback files are deleted, you cannot roll back. Only option is a clean install of Windows 8/8.1. This will delete all your current files though, so make a backup.

<br />
<br />Select the exact cells you want to print, then choose Page Layout - Print Area - Set Print Area
<br />
<br />Then choose File - Print
<br />
<br />Set the paper size to SRA3
<br />
<br />Then on the Print page, click page Setup
<br />
<br />Set Scaling - Adjust to (here you will need to make an initial guess and if you are not happy with the result, change the percentage until you are happy . . .

            <p>Read the requirements and also make sure you have all the updates from Windows Update.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Most of all--do not install over your current windows. The preview is for testing--not for upgrading. You could lose everything and if you don't have recovery disks you can't recover. Make all recovery disks you will need before installing including saving
 copies of all your files on external media. Consider waiting until the final release comes out next year.</p>

<p><span>How does My Phone handle sync conflicts between changes on the phone and the web?</span></p>
<div>
<p>When <span>My Phone</span> encounters a sync conflict between changes made on your phone and changes made on your<span>My Phone</span> account, the information on the phone always takes precedence, and replaces the information that is stored online.</p>

Based on the error message it seems that the Outlook 2016 for Mac versions you are using not supported on macOS.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi, Joan</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Skype, your contacts are stored centrally on our servers. You can access them anywhere, as long as you
<strong>sign in with the same account and password</strong> in Skype. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're not seeing your contacts list when you sign in to&nbsp;the new version of the application, it is most probably because you're logged in to the wrong account. I strongly suggest you sign out of Skype, then sign back in using your correct Skype Name,
 email or phone number. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information why your contacts are not appearing, please visit this support page:
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34814/why-are-my-skype-contacts-or-credit-missing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Why are my Skype contacts missing?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, do not hesitate to post back to this thread.</p>
