    <title>Windows 10 Pro cannot install on new SSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darryljohns  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro cannot install on new SSD</h2>
                    <p><span>After having a hard disk crash on my Thinkpad L430, I decided to purchase a Crucial MX200 1 Tb SSD, Windows 10 Pro, and upgrade the Thinkpad in both hardware and OS.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows 10 Pro was downloaded and a USB install stick was created without issue. The Crucial MX200 was installed in the Thinkpad without issue, and the latest BIOS (v2.64) was applied to the
 Thinkpad..</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, Windows 10 Pro fails to install. I cannot pinpoint the problem to the Microsoft OS, the hard drive, or both.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the install scenario I followed:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Booted the Thinkpad with the Windows 10 Pro USB in a USB2.0 slot</span></li><li><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Screen 1 appears: Asks for language, currency language and keyboard</span></li><li><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Screen 2 appears: has an ‘Install Windows’ button which I clicked</span></li><li><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Screen 3 asks for th Product Code, which I entered</span></li><li><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Screen 4 displays license agreement that I agreed to</span></li><li><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Screen 5 asks which type of installation I wanted, I selected ‘Custom’ since this is a new install</span></li><li><span>Screen 7 displays with depictions of the two disks in the machine. I am asked the question as to where I want Windows installed.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It should be noted that the Thinkpad has a 16Gb SSD internal drive containing a recovery version of
<span>&nbsp;</span>Windows 7. It came with the machine and is not being used. The other drive is the Crucial MX200.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Windows 7. It came with the machine and is not being used. The other drive is the Crucial MX200.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Screen 7 says that the Crucial MX200 drive is unallocated, and gives me an option to format the drive and in doing so the drive now is Partition 0 Drive 1.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I select the MX200 drive and click next, to start the installation, I receive the message:</span></p>
<p><span>“We couldn’t create a new partition or locate an existing one. For more information, see Setup log files.”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I tried this process over a dozen times with a few variations like defining 2 partitions, or a small partition. Regardless of the options, I get the same message. I might feel better if I could
 look at the setup log file but I don’t know where it would reside or how to see it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Supposedly, the Crucial drive is supported on the Thinkpad L430 and Windows 10 is supported on the L430 too.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Does anyone have insight as to how to fix this problem?</span></p>

            <p>I don't see anything in the specs for that PC saying it is UEFI so it shouldn't be necessary to boot the flash stick as an EFI device in Boot menu.&nbsp; If you do have EFI BIOS' then the stick would need to be formatted by Media Creation tool and chosen as a
 EFI device when booting it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would always unplug all other drives.&nbsp; A recovery SSD chip may need disabling in BIOS setup.&nbsp; Are you sure it's not an MSATA caching chip which may also need disabling in BIOS as shown in

<p>
</p><p>Just to be sure, delete all partitions on the drive and click next to let the installer auto-create and -format the needed partitions and begin install.

            <p>Greg,</p>
<p>Many thanks for your timely reply. After calling a friend who has more current experience with Windows 10, I</p>
<p>achieved a successful installation. The solution was counterintuitive to me, but it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out that Screen 7, mentioned above, is misleading. I had deleted the MX200 SSD on that screen making its</p>
<p>status as 'unallocated space'.&nbsp; I then selected the 'new' option on that screen to declare that drive as New which then brought up an option to define its size (in essence this performs the partitioning function). Then I took the option to format that newly
 created partition. Once that was done I then tried to select that partition for where the OS was to be installed. That procedure resulted in the error noted in my original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been installing Windows operating systems since Windows 2.0 (yeah 2.0 not 3.0 or 3.1), so I thought the steps I took were logical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nope. It turns out that the correct procedure was to delete all drives on Screen 7. That made all drives 'unallocated'. At that point I selected the MX200 drive as the place where the OS was to be installed.
<strong>Under the covers</strong> Windows creates a partition and formats the partition.&nbsp;Windows 10 was then installed successfully!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But why do those other options exist on Screen 7 if they don't work? </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>I always advise&nbsp; and have already typed out today a dozen times to delete all partitions at the Drive Selection screen to get it cleanest, then click Next to let the installer auto-create and format the needed partitions to begin install.&nbsp; This avoids consumers
 tripping over the extra partitions Created New which can be hard to interpret to&nbsp; select and Format the actual C.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case you interpreted one partition as a small SSD Recovery drive I'd not heard of before.&nbsp; When you deal with these by the tens of thousands you get to know what's out there but this sounds more like the IRST caching SSD that requires the special
 handling in tutorials I linked earlier, or is something not seen before.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you still sure that's what you have?&nbsp; Did you look over your BIOS settings to see if it has control over that feature which would most likely make it the caching drive many models installed to place the boot and paging files for supposed faster performance
 of a normal hard drive.&nbsp; All reports are that these aren't really a benefit, in fact the only raves we have are for those we helped install the OS on them, not really recommended either because they're normally only 32gb.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you only had a normal hard drive and misinterpreted a Recovery partition as somehow being an SSD chip?&nbsp; What made you think that?&nbsp; Is there any stray partition in Disk Mgmt now?&nbsp; A normal install to UEFI will have only Recovery partition, EFI System,
 a hidden MSR (seen only in Partition Wizard) and C, possibly followed by another Recovery partition holding the Go Back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad you got it installed.&nbsp; How is performance?&nbsp; Did you expedite your Windows Updates, continue Checking for more until none are offered?&nbsp; Are any drivers yet missing in Device Manager?&nbsp;

            <p>Greg,</p>
<p>First of all, I've had a few days to actually use Windows 10 and I'm satisfied overall with the improvements I see. My performance in moving to SSD&nbsp; has been fantastic! My boot up times are under 13 seconds (and the includes my signing on with my password).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must admit to not thoroughly reading your earlier posts concerning the deleting of all drives on the drive selection screen. Had I followed that advice it would have saved me over 30 hours of frustration. And you were correct as to the small (16Gb) internal
 SSD that came with the machine. Even though that drive was named as a recovery drive it actually was used for disk caching, a function that is unnecessary with my new 1 Tb SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This thread seems to match my similar problem with MX300 525Gb. I have one additional glitch: When Windows starts installing, and gets to the first reboot, it reboots to the installer every time. I've tried to manually boot to the SSD from BIOS after the
 install to continue the installation, but that has not helped. Disk scans show no error or fault in the disk. This is the third night I'm fighting this. Sanity shows cracks. Hopefully there's something that can be done?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a crucial mx300 and gigabyte z68xp-ud3p with an i7-2600k currently trying to install a new windows 10 on the ssd as I was unable to migrate or clone my data to the ssd from the western digital blue 1tb hdd due to an error message stating its a problem
 with sector size on the target disk [ssd] it shows as 4096 even though specs say 512 and ive tried everything and now I'm getting this same issue as the original poster with the windows 10 usb stick installation method, I'm at a loss and have tried everything
 I can think of I basically wasted 145$ dollars on this ssd also crucial storage executive shows it as a healthy drive, the crucial acronis tool would not even recognize the ssd so I had to use the wd version just to get access plz help me plz</p>

Clean Install Windows 10</a> following these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.&nbsp; Chances are it will be a much better install,

Clean Install Windows 10</a> which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can happen because the BIOS is set to boot a flash stick first instead of the hard drive, so when it restarts it triggers the flash stick again to restart the installation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead you should not change the BIOS Boot order, but instead use the <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
BIOS Boot Menu Key</a> to trigger the media, choose it as a UEFI device if offered, then proceed to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space and click Next to auto-create and format the necessary partitions, begin install -&nbsp; this makes it foolproof.&nbsp;

<h2>            Error codes 0x80004004 and  0x8020002e</h2>
                    <p>I accidently uninstalled mail, people, messenger from Windows 8. I've tried reinstalling multiple times and I keep getting an error saying that the app was not installed and I receive error code 0x80004004. When I've tried updating other apps as well, I
 receive error code 0x8020002e. I;ve tried multiple times and I even uninstalled my antivirus and disabled the firewall to try to get the downloads to work. All to no avail.

            <p>If you have just made the split, you can undo it with Ctrl+Z.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have made other edits in the meantime, that method won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you can double-click on one of the clips and go to Video Tools | Edit. Then go to the Trim Tool. Drag the rectangle sliders so you are at the full extent of the clip and it will no longer be trimmed/split. Delete the second copy of the clip that
 is still in your storyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you are just trying to make a complete movie, the presence of splits doesn't matter. When Movie Maker renders your final movie, it will just put everything together and you won't notice any split. To save your movie, use File &gt; Save
 movie.</p>

    <title>Why Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t I Browse All Games Anymore In The - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kiska  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t I Browse All Games Anymore In The Store&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Who in their right mind thought it would be a good idea to prevent people from being able to browse the entire games catalog, and only display games that are from the last couple of months?<br />
<br />
For some reason I can no longer browse through the entire catalog of downloadable games.&nbsp; I used to be able to go to new games, and see every game available for Xbox One sorted by release date.&nbsp; It now only displays games released in the last couple of months,
 so if a game is older than that there is no way to discover it unless you are searching for a specific game. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is Xbox really saying that games older than a couple of months aren't worth being able to find without a specific search?? I click on the all games link on the main page in the store, and it brings me to the same place where I can only see the newest games
 for the last couple of months.&nbsp; Why have and All Games tab that doesn't show all games.&nbsp; I tried browsing on my Windows 10 PC instead, and it displays the same exact options.
<br />
<br />
There is no option to browse through all of the games, not even with a simple a-z option.&nbsp; I find this baffling. It is insulting to developers, and is a sure fire way to bring less money into the ecosystem. How can people buy a game if they can't even find
 it?&nbsp; There should always be a way to view the entire catalog by release date.&nbsp; The first game I see should be the newest going all the way back to the first game ever released for the system.&nbsp; Before this last major system update, I used to be able to do just
 that, and its disappointing that now I can't. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please fix this, so that when I click on the all games tab it shows me ALL GAMES.&nbsp; They should be sorted by newest release, not only displaying the newest releases.&nbsp; Any update to the store should make games easier to browse and find, not harder. Developers
 should be outraged, and if they notice sales starting to disappear after a couple of months its because people can no longer see their games at all.&nbsp; Please let this issue be corrected, because as everything else on xbox moves forward, it seems the store keeps
 taking two steps backwards.&nbsp; You would think the place where customers actually spend their money should be the last place things are confusing and aggravating.&nbsp; The store should be the most pleasant and easiest place to be on xbox, considering that is where
 money is made and spent.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> kshitijyadav  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touch Screen not working</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Dell Inspiron 3521 nearly a year ago. Few weeks back, my touch screen stopped responding. I, having some basic knowledge in computers, tried everything that i could to make it work again, but sadly, haven't been able to kill an ant in the matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My&nbsp;<strong>System Specifications</strong>&nbsp;are:</p>
<p>Model No: Dell Inspiron 15 - 3521 - Touch</p>
<p>Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3337U CPU @1.8Ghz</p>
<p>RAM: 4GB</p>
<p>Operating System: Windows 8.1 64-bit</p>
<p>Video Cards:&nbsp;Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000 &amp;&nbsp;AMD Radeon HD 8730M</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Things I've tried</strong>&nbsp;already:</p>
<p>1. Refreshing PC back to Windows 8.</p>
<p>2. Updating all drivers and Windows Updates.</p>
<p>3. Updating to Windows 8.1 again.</p>
<p>4. All windows updates again.</p>
<p>5. Rechecked if any driver update was missing.(No, there is no driver updates for me currently)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Additional Details:</strong></p>
<p>1. There is no Tablet PC settings in Control Panel since i refreshed. (Didn't check if it was before, but it sure would have been there.)</p>
<p>2. There is no Tablet PC Components or any similar thing in add features to windows.</p>
<p>3. There is no Touch Screen compliant device in HID or Mice or other Pointing Device in the &nbsp;device manager.</p>
<p>4. I have the Intel HM77 driver and the latest BIOS running as suggested by the experts on other threads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If anyone has any other ideas, please help.</p>
<p>Thank You!</p>

<h2>            Edge broken by Malwarebytes Premium</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a while now my Edge has been broken.&nbsp; I had tried everything I could find on this and other forums but couldn't fix it.&nbsp; I have just resorted to doing what I didn't want to do and that is to reset my windows installation to default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess what.&nbsp; Edge started working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was in the process of reinstalling all the apps and programs that I now HAVE do to get everything back as it was before the reset and Edge stopped working. ****.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily I had only got to installing my preferred protection software so could finally find the cause.&nbsp; The Exploitation shield of Malwarebytes is what is breaking my Edge.&nbsp; I have disabled it now and all is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you are having issues with Edge and have Malwarebytes Premium installed, even the trial version, disable exploitation shield.&nbsp; I am only guessing at this but could possibly the same with other protection/AV software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please add to this if you find other programs cause this so no-one else has to go through the pain of resetting Windows when they don't have to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

            As soon as I installed malwarebytes and scanned the computer, It deleted a lot of PUP's but then one by one, my open tabs on microsoft edge stopped responding and closed. When I tried to open a new tab, it would pop up for a milisecond and then disappear.
 I closed microsoft edge, but when I reopened it, the program closed itself out before it was even done loading. Ever since It's been doing the same thing, even though I uninstalled Malwarebytes.. How do I fix this? I've tried all fixes on the forums for edge
 opening then immediately closing and none of them did a bit of good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hi Wildheart1065.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I cannot tell you exactly what is causing your issue or provide an exact answer I hope I can give you pointers.</p>
<p>It sounds to me that one or more association was reliant on one or more of the PUPs you removed.&nbsp; E.g your video might have been linked to the PUP instead of the in build video player.&nbsp; Or some form of add-in linking the PUP to something else.&nbsp; The list
 is potentially endless. Now the PUP has been removed when edge opens it can't find the associated app and then closes as a result. There is possibly nothing wrong with Edge itself and that's why your previous fixes do not seem to have worked.&nbsp; Which association
 is causing the issue will be hard to determine but I would advise trying to reset all associations to default and see if that helps.&nbsp; I fear it will be hard to pin down the actual cause.&nbsp; Some of these PUPs will change things even without you knowing it, not
 notifying you, making it hard to identify the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I can't give you better advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>

<h3> shalmendo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade from &#39;Get Genuine Online Kit&#39; Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded from Windows 7 installed from a legitimate 'Get Genuine Online Kit' that was purchased as part of going genuine several years ago. I successfully activated Windows 7 on my current build (the previous build is now non-functional and trashed)
 and used it for several months while waiting for Windows 10 to be released. I never received the option to upgrade to 10, did not get the upgrade tool in my toolbar, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I have finished upgrading to 10, it is failing to activate from the original Get Genuine Online key. I attempted to manually update the product key to reflect the original windows 7 key that I used, and received the following error code: 0xc004f050</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything is as legitimate as possible. The 7 key has only been used by myself and no one else. It has not been shared or posted anywhere online, etc.
<br />
</p>
<p>Is there some procedure I can use to rectify this problem?</p>

            <p>Resolved!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just took some time but Windows 10 eventually self activated successfully. My professional guess is that the Microsoft authentication servers were jam packed with people upgrading on the first day and it took time for them to sort through all the requests,
 process all the keys properly, etc. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just needed to wait and It went through without any further input from me. I kept checking to see if it was activated or not, and to see if I was getting new error codes or anything, but it suddenly showed it was activated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are having this problem, I suggest waiting a few days, maybe up to a week, if you're getting the same error code I was. It's just a wait-and-see issue.</p>

 Enhanced IDE ATA-6, Cache 16MB) with 20 bad sectors.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>I have been advised that I need a larger hard drive to be able to dual boot Windows 7 and Linux (Ubuntu or Mint): at least 80 GB preferably 120 GB. I only work with small files: Word &amp; PDF docs, email, internet browsing, etc. I am not into
 games, photography, CAD/CAM, etc.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>I am not convinced going up to a 7200 RPM drive will make any noticeable difference in performance. Hard drives larger than 40 GB, especially those larger than 60 GB, all seem to have cache (buffer) sizes of 8MB, less than my current hard
 drive's 16MB.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>QUESTION(S): If I buy a larger hard drive (&gt;40GB) with a smaller cache (8MB) will I notice a decrease in speed?</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Does a 7200 RPM drive really offer me any advantages over a 5400 RPM drive?</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>(I know 7200 drive use more power and wear out faster).</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font>Thanks,</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Bob,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The short answer is yes. Your total hard drive latency is the [seek latency] + [rotation latency].
</p>
<p>The 10K RPM drive will have a smaller rotational latency due to its faster spinning and will also be able to read data off of the drive faster. What the higher cache will do is for writes. A cache is similar to a buffer. When it reads data from the disk
 it will store recently accessed data and data within the near vicinity for quicker access. This is called temporal and spatial locality. The higher cache will be useful if your access pattern is such that you read the same file a lot or the data is stored
 near each other.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a decent page on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Page_cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
disk caches</a>.</p>

    <title>Inconsistent Password requests instead of PIN - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amrcowboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inconsistent Password requests instead of PIN</h2>
                    <p>Since the 1809 update, my PCs have an issue where most of the time software installs / modifications require the admin PIN (my preferred approach), and occasionally I am required to enter the admin Password instead, without any option for the PIN.&nbsp; This
 had never happened until the recent 1809 update, and happens across all of my PCs, not just on a single machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assume that this is due to a bug in the update, and hopefully it will be repaired in the next patch Tuesday update . . .</p>

            I would very much like to know how ti uninstall windows 8.1. You want a thorough question? Windows 8.1 takes away and personal connection to the computer and requires that one goes through the microsoft team for all and any changes they wish to make to
 their own computer. For example, I would very much like to see and interact with my RAM and processor which in Windows 8 allowed access to any programs that slowed this down. Windows 8.1 takes this away from the individual and requires a purchase or contact
 with microsoft. Also the pure ignorance and obscurity in the update that requires a &nbsp;person to link their microsoft account, providing they even have one, and use it to sign onto their own computer. I do NOT want to link my account password or pin number with
 the start screen just to sign in. Many people also do not have another device in which they can even verify the email or text required when setting up after the update and can not use their computer since their old password no longer

            <p>I read this on USAToday website and since I had windows 8, it worked for me, radical, in that you reset and lose everything, so make sure..&nbsp;but it got rid of the beta bugger..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A Microsoft <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
frequently-asked-questions page about Win 8.1</a> explains this in conditional language that should give a reader pause: "If your PC came with Windows 8 you might be able to restore it back to Windows 8 by refreshing your PC."</span></p>
<p><span>Should that work, it will allow the most orderly retreat possible. Win 8's
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2012/11/17/start-menu-windows-8/1708953/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
underrated "refresh" optio</a>n will put a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean copy of the operating system </a>in place, leaving your data intact but only reinstalling apps that came bundled on the computer or were obtained through the
<a href="http://www.windowsstore.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Store</a>.
</span></p>
<p>To use this option, tap or click the bottom-right corner of the desktop (or swipe in from the right edge of the Start screen), select the gear-shaped Settings icon, and then select "Change PC settings."</p>
<p>In that screen, click or tap "Update and recovery," choose the Recovery option and proceed with a refresh from there. The computer will use the hard drive's system-recovery partition to put things back as they were when you took the computer out of the box,
 plus your own data.</p>

Control Panel - Power Options - click Change plan settings for each plan - Change<br />
advanced power settings - check the settings there.<br />
<br />
Also check with the System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) and.or<br />
the actual device maker's site for updated WiFI drivers.<br />
<br />
It would also be a good idea to check for updated BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and<br />
the other major on-board and separate device drivers.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;However, I still get disconnected about every half-hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All my devices are up-to-date.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check the Advanced Options for settings that shutoff the network device in use.<br />
<br />
Is it also logging your account&nbsp;off the computer? <br />
<br />
Power Options - on left Require a pasword on Wakeup.<br />
<br />
Right Click the desktop - Personalize - Screen Saver - if you use one&nbsp;uncheck On resume,<br />
display login screen.<br />
<br />
Note see if doing those last two stops disconnect from happening.<br />
<br />
Check with the System Maker's Support - or the actual device maker's support.<br />
<br />
Happy Holidays!<br />
<br />

<h3> john michaelchan  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Speaker not playing sound</h2>
                    <p>i have a "Dragon War USB Speaker" and have been using it for the past 5 years on my laptop(windows 10 pro 64bit) It only have USB as input and was working fine. Now i have bought a DESKTOP (windows 10pro 64bit) and when i plug in the speaker it won't make
 a sound. The system recognize it but no sound. In the device manager it is sometimes HIfler or USB generic speaker---- &nbsp;also if i unplug the speaker, my desktop will go on BSOD (blue screen of death).
</p>
<p>Using troubleshooter dont fix the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Updating the driver on device manager dont fix the problem. (Deiver is updated)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't unplug and plug 'coz of BSOD. </p>
<p>Other speaker with usb powered and 3.5mm jack for audio works. (Borrowed from a friend)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Headset/earpods/headphone works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>so here's my question. How can i make my USB speaker work on my desktop? Or is there a way to use a USB only Speaker to work on desktop? Is there a software i need to install?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>High Pitch Screeching Noise in Xbox App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> swift ambitionz  say:</h3>
<h2>            High Pitch Screeching Noise in Xbox App</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to use my Xbox party chat on my Windows 10 computer I hear this sound:</p>
<p>https://www.dropbox.com/s/ubb3eh02p01i7u3/HighPitchScreech.m4a?dl=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a Hauppauge HDPVR Gaming Edition to record my gameplay. To enable party chat in my videos, I invite my computer live account to the party. I then mute the computer account so there is no echo in the party. This worked very good for about a month. Then
 all of a sudden there is this high pitch screeching noise that happens whenever I talk. I have looked this issue up online and I do not see a similar issue. A buddy of mine is having the same issue and we both are in need of any suggestions to fix this. Any
 help is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

Youtube, generally, is not an installed program - it just uses some players installed on your computer to play videos.<br />

<h3> joshington  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Update and Shutdown&#34; option missing from Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I have the update option set to "download updates but let me choose weather to install them". After I was notified of new updates earlier today, I then went to windows update to check and install them all. Now that they're installed, going to WU let's
 me view the "Restart PC to finish installing" option as usual. What I can't figure out is why I don't have the option anywhere to "Update and Shutdown" at this point. This is an option which is apparently supposed to show up after clicking the power button
 under the Settings charm when there's updates pending completion. I would like to know how to get this option to appear so I can simply finish installing my chosen updates when shutting the PC down at night.

            <p>Windows 10 fixes this. Install and Shut down is an option regardless of your setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8.1, the workaround is to shutdown from the command line. </p>
<p>
</p><p>shutdown /s /t 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>That will cause your computer to shut down in one second, and a shut down from here seems to finish installing updates.</p>

<p>Hi Muhammad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for us to better know your issue, we need to ask some information.</p>

</p><p>1. Is this the first time you'll be downloading this app on your computer?</p>
<p>2. What troubleshooting steps have you done so far to fix the issue?</p>
<p>3. Have you try downloading the app on a different computer with same location and region like your computer and getting same error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>The app I was looking for has already shown up today. I guess it was a temporary drop from the app developer or sort of it...</p>
