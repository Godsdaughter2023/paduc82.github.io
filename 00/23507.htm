<h2>            Call blocking on my Lumia 635</h2>
                    Hello, I am trying to block numbers on my phone, and when I press the call and SMS filter, a tab pops up saying an error occurred, please try later. When I go to my call history, and long press the number I want to block, an option to block that number
 shows up. I press the block option and the same error message appears. Help, please?

<h2>            tick boxes, text box and comb link</h2>
                    <p>I have a combo (named supplierlist) and a text field (named SupplierName).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a new supplier is to be entered the user types the name in the text box (SupplierName). However, if the supplier already exists I want them to select the correct name from the combo and for it to also show in the text box. Currently, if they select a
 supplier the text box shows reference number. How do I get the supplier name to show in the text box and not the number? Both the text box and combo are bound to the SupplierName field in the one table.</p>

            Why are you using two controls rather than a single combo box control in which the bound numerical key column is hidden?&nbsp; With the latter you can put code in the control's NotInList event procedure to insert a new row into the Suppliers table if a new
 name is typed into the combo box.<br />
<br />
You'll find an example as NotInList.zip in my public databases folder at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
When inserting something like a supplier you'd normally need to add other data such as the supplier's address etc, so rather than simply inserting a row into the Suppliers table transparently, a form would normally be opened in dialogue mode and the new supplier
 name passed to it via the OpenArgs mechanism.&nbsp; The City combo box in the frmContact form in my demo illustrates this.<br />
<br />
Using the NotInList event procedure does assume that all supplier names are distinct.&nbsp; This is more likely with commercial names than personal names, but if this cannot be guaranteed the opening form in my demo shows an alternative way of adding a new contact
 via a command button which opens a form in dialogue mode, and then assigns the new contact to the combo box in the calling form when the dialogue form is closed.<br />

            <p>I don't think I explained my form or set up enoughy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only want the option to type a new supplier or select one from the list, not open a new form.</p>
<p>Probably the easiest solution is that if a supplier is chosen from the combo from existing suppliers their name does not show in the text box (name Suppliersname, Control Source SupplierName). The combo box is named supplierlist, Control Source SupplierName.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I do this - at the moment is shows the number, not the supplier name but not having it shown at all for selections from the combo is, as I say, probably easiest.</p>

            <blockquote>I only want the option to type a new supplier or select one from the list, not open a new form.</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>With respect, in a situation like this it's not a question of what you might <em>
want </em>to do, but want you <em>need</em> to do to achieve the objective.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you might have used the 'lookup field' wizard when creating the table to which your form is bound.&nbsp; This feature is deprecated by most experienced developers.&nbsp; For reasons why see:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.mvps.org/access/lookupfields.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mvps.org/access/lookupfields.htm</a><br />
<br />
Even if you did not use this feature your foreign key SupplierName column's data type is almost certainly a long integer number which references an autonumber primary key of a Suppliers table in which a text data type non-key SupplierName column or similar
 stores the name of each supplier.&nbsp; The combo box bound to the SupplierName foreign key column in the form's table should be set up like this:<br />
<br />
RowSource:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SELECT SupplierID, SupplierName FROM Suppliers ORDER BY SupplierName;<br />
<br />
BoundColumn:&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
ColumnCount:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths:&nbsp; 0cm<br />
<br />
If your units of measurement are imperial rather than metric Access will automatically convert the unit of the last one to inches.&nbsp; The important thing is that the dimension is zero to hide the first column.<br />
<br />
If your Suppliers table includes no other non-key columns than SupplierName then you don't have to open a form via code in the combo box's NotInList event procedure to insert a new row into the Suppliers table; you can do so entirely in the code.&nbsp; You'll find
 an example of how to do this in the RegionID combo box in the frmCities form in my NotInList demo.<br />
<br />
It's hard to conceive that no other attributes than the supplier name would be stored for a supplier. What about their address, phone number, email address etc?&nbsp; If there are such other attributes then you really have no option but to open a form in dialogue
 mode to do so when a new name is typed into the combo box as at least some of those columns are likely to be
<em>'Required'</em>, and disallow Nulls.&nbsp; The example of the city combo box in my demo to which I referred you earlier illustrates how to do this with code in the combo box's NotInList event procedure, and the dialogue form's Open event procedure (frmCities
 in my demo).<br />

            <p>I have a form with all the suppliers details including a section for new supplier or existing supplier is chosen. If new supplier, the staff complete all the details, if new depot is chosen they select the supplier from the drop down and add their specific
 location supplier details as the address, website etc would already have been entered.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/571a5532-5b5a-47f6-a971-6a44001bb8e7" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this make more sense? The supplier details are all in one table CompanyInformation. the combo (additional depot) and text box (new supplier) are both bound to the one field SupplierName.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So a new supplier and they simply type in the name but at the moment, if they select from the drop down the correct supplier is shown but&nbsp;the supplier number shows in the new supplier field and not the actual name.</p>

            I'm afraid I don't understand the logical model underlying this form.&nbsp; If the form is bound to a single table of suppliers, CompanyInformation, then the table appears to be badly non-normalized, and in need of decomposition into a set of correctly normalized
 related tables.&nbsp; If on the other hand it is bound to a query which joins related tables, then the form should be broken down into a parent form and one or more subforms.<br />
<br />
My initial impression from your original post was that it related to a form for entering data into a referencing table in which the supplier was represented by a foreign key column to which a combo box was bound.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the context in which I replied.&nbsp;
 However, as far as I can tell it is in fact either for entering data into a single table, or into both a referenced table and at least one referencing table simultaneously.<br />
<br />
Before I can comment further I would need more detailed information on what is being modelled in real life terms, how this model is represented by tables and the relationships between them, and how the form is intended to represent an interface for the model.<br />

 address details for three depots, again master and child fields CompanyInfoID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On main form, one text box bound to SupplierName from CompanyInformation table where a new supplier can be entered and one combo box again bound to Supplier Name listing existing suppliers. If a supplier is selected from the combo of existing suppliers,
 the supplier number currently&nbsp;shows on the left side. All I want is to either show the supplier name or have this remain empty if the combo is used. I have no lookups or code behind these fields, just simply bound to SupplierName in CompanyInformation table.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't follow this at all.&nbsp; If the parent form is bound to the company information table then why would there be any occasion to select an existing company in the form?&nbsp; Surely you either navigate to an existing company record if you need to edit it or
 add/edit data to the referencing addresses table via a subform, or you navigate to an empty new record in the parent form to insert a new company record.<br />
<br />
Forget about the form for a moment and explain what the aim is in real life business terms.&nbsp; To give you sound advice we need to know what you are aiming for in reality, not how you are trying to do it in the interface.&nbsp; The interface is no more than that;
 it's the model which is important, and at present I cannot see any coherent logical model to what you are describing.<br />

            <p>The database is for all staff across four offices. No-one&nbsp;will be&nbsp;allowed to use a supplier or subcontractor unless they have undergone a robust approval process and are listed within the database - purchasing, contracts, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a department requires a new supplier/subcontractor to be added for use they will complete an Addition Request Form (screen capture above). This basic information is then shown in a Suppliers form and more detailed information added as part of the approval
 process i.e. accreditations held, finance details, contact information, insurances held etc. At the end of the approval process the Suppliers form will show ALL information held on each supplier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Suppliers forms are available by accessing a front page list (datasheet) of all suppliers.&nbsp;The status throughout this process i.e. approved, denied, on hold is also shown for quick reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reports will be used to monitor and manage the database i.e. approvals due within 2 months, department suppliers, site suppliers, categories. This will enable us to effectively control the addition of a supplier with similar products/services to one already
 approved and review the need. Otherwise we end up in the position we are now with hundreds of suppliers with no cross-reference or checks on who, what, why they are available to use (currently over 1600 suppliers!). We only have just over 250 staff.&nbsp;An Excel
 spreadsheet is currently used previously with open access and no monitoring or tie in with Accounts Department.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a removal request if a satisfactory service is not received, through a similar process to the addition request but supporting information (internal forms, complaint reports etc.) have to be used as part of the evidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the first step to adding a supplier or a new depot for local site information will be through the Addition Request Form the option has to be there to select a current supplier or add a new one easily and quickly. The reason this is not separated (new
 supplier or additional supplier, say two forms or a subform) is there is also one other database used within the company which almost all staff hate with a passion&nbsp;- it's slow, clunky, really old and is not user friendly and we are finding staff are bucking
 the system and bypassing the database. So, we have to have a user-friendly, very quick, understandable set up to encourage everyone to buy-in to the process - hence it (hopefully) looks nothing like the database we use for contracts currently.</p>

            Having worked in the Purchase and Supply department of a large manufacturing company I can appreciate the approvals process, but I&nbsp; cannot for the life of me understand how your form is supposed to implement this.&nbsp; It's all this
<em>select this or enter that</em> stuff which puzzles me.&nbsp; Surely all you need is a form based on the CompanyInformation table with controls bound to the necessary columns for the basic company and approvals data, along with the relevant subforms for address
 at:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/?cid=44CC60D7FEA42912&amp;id=44CC60D7FEA42912!169</a><br />
<br />
If you have difficulty opening the link copy its text (NB, not the link location) and paste it into your browser's address bar.<br />
<br />
The first option on the opening form, a form to go to a record, is the appropriate one.<br />
<br />
If you wish the form to be restricted to those suppliers who have not yet satisfied the approvals process its RecordSource query can be restricted accordingly.&nbsp; Whether or not the CompanyInformation table is correctly normalized or not I cannot say without
 being able to do an analysis of the functional dependencies, but that's another issue.&nbsp; As regards the subject of this thread my overall impression is that you are attempting to apply an unnecessarily complex solution to what is essentially a simple navigational
 and updating task which can be easily achieved by simple means using standard methodology.<br />

            <p>I do not agree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst the database is more than likely (admittedly) not the best design or structure it is to the best of my ability, being the only staff member with any Access experience.</p>
<p>It is designed specifically NOT to look or feel like a database. The process I believe cannot be simpler. You open the database to view the front page which shows a list of available suppliers and their current status. There are command boxes to open an
 Addition Request, a Removal Request or a Reports page. If you wish to view the details for a particular supplier you simply click on the datasheet presented on the front page. No drop-downs or forms to select. This opens the distinct record for that supplier.
 If the supplier is still undergoing approval or has been denied the top of the form automatically 'screams' a red message informing you not to use. If approved, you can scroll to depot details, website, account details, approval details etc. - a one stop shop
 effectively. This part is only for staff to view, not input data to (QHSE Dept will add the detailed information following questionnaires, accreditation/insurance checks etc.)</p>
<p>If staff wish to add a new supplier, open the Addition Request form on the front page, complete the&nbsp;details and select the Send Request button (emailed to QHSE Dept).</p>
<p>If staff wish to request removal of a supplier, open the Removal Request on the front page, complete the details and select the Send Request button (emailed again to QHSE Dept).</p>
<p>A mentioned previously, there is no control of suppliers, approval or tie in with any departments or indeed Finance Dept within the company at present. After a new management structure, it was decided we can no longer live with the chaos. QHSE Dept have
 been tasked with developing this database and controlling the approval process under our current accreditations.</p>
<p>As a directive from senior management, the database is how they want it, looking how they want it, and doing what they want it to do - simple, easy to understand, quick to access (no multiple clicks or selections to access particular areas), basically hit
 a button and tah dah.</p>
<p>The functionality may well improve in the future along with the structure etc but it is what we have been instructed to do, so no real room for manoeuvre.</p>
<p>Having said all of this, I do agree, as before, it is possibly not the best "database" way.</p>
<p>Giving this a big twist, maybe Access developers will think "out of the database box" and have their database
<em>'looking' </em>more like other familiar packages and less like a database. I live in hope!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at your database example and can't figure out the code and what bits I adapt to mine. I think the easiest solution is for new suppliers a text box where they type in the name bound to SupplierName, and for additional depots a combo box which lists
 the suppliers available but does not show the selected one in the adjacent text box ...? Any further help would be gratefully appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Sway Video Upload</h2>
                    <p>I uploaded a video to Sway, yet when published the initial image on screen is not the beginning of the video, but something seconds in. When I start the video it jumps correctly to the beginning, but it looks very sloppy. When I review the .mov file outside
 of Sway it looks fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>The initial image shown over the video is a frame from the middle of your video.&nbsp; This is a common way to represent a video in order to avoid showing a blank/black screen which many videos start out with.&nbsp; We are considering a future feature to allow users

            Hi Kristine,
<br />Which version and build of Outlook are you using? See File, Office Account for the information.  
<br />
<br />The all day events are listed alphabetically here, so you would need to use the 01 02 method to sort them. 
<br />
<br />You can make a suggestion at uservoice for better user control - <a href="https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-outlook-2016-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://outlook.uservoice.com/forums/322590-out...</a>

<p>Hi Terence,<br />
<br />
We suggest you run an <strong>Online Repair</strong> for your Office applications, since the add-in can’t be disabled in the safe mode. Open
<strong>Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features</strong>, select Office application and click
<strong>Change &gt; Online Repair &gt; Repair</strong>.<br />

    <title>Excel Sort Limit - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Excel Sort Limit</h2>
                    I have a spreadsheet with 100 rows of data.&nbsp; The sort was not working, so after much trial and error, I discovered that I can sort up to 48 rows.&nbsp; When I go to 49 it stops sorting.&nbsp; Because of header rows, I am trying to sort rows 3 to 102.&nbsp; Rows 3 through
 51 will sort.&nbsp; When I add row 52 it will no longer sort.&nbsp; My Excel version before 365 appeared to work fine.

<p>You are quite welcome, glad I could help.</p>
<p>As for the old workbook, I wouldn't bother as long as you have what you need.&nbsp; Files can become corrupt (well, not corrupt in the traditional sense, but odd rules start to apply to older files that don't make sense or apply to new files), and you never know
 what is attached to a workbook that you can't see.&nbsp; The "copy all sheets into new workbook," trick is one I use from time to time just to deal with an excel file that is unusually large or slow compared to how it should be.&nbsp; I don't know exactly what is happening
 in that situation, I just know the fix ;)</p>
<p>If there was some formula that was broken by doing that trick or you lost some data then it might be worth going back, but...</p>

<h3> markpedlingham  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2010 Powerpoint warning of an overwrite when file extensions don&#39;t match</h2>
                    When using the 'save-as' function&nbsp;in powerpoint and starting to type a file name, a list of used file names appears.&nbsp; So far so good.&nbsp; However, it&nbsp;offers, amongst the .pptx file names files with .docx file extension.&nbsp; If selected it warns that these will
 be overwritten, whereas what is actually saves is a file with&nbsp;.docx in the name and with a .pptx file extension.&nbsp; Is this intentional, it's certainly not logical - the warning is just plain wrong....&nbsp; I am on Windows 10, using Office 2010

<h3> allanlundy  say:</h3>
<h2>            spell check list of &#34;misspelled&#34; words</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone!&nbsp; I need to be able to extract a list of the words that Word spell check flags as misspelled.&nbsp; If there is no internal list after a doc is checked, I could perhaps write a macro to jump to the next flagged word and copy it and paste it into a
 list which I can then save.&nbsp; But I can't find a way to jump from flag to flag (or "go to").&nbsp; I will be examining thousands of documents to extract "misspelled" words, so this has to be automated.&nbsp; (I am aware this will catch tens of thousands of proper names,
 etc., and will miss others such as "person s" for "persons," but this will be a start to identify possible misspellings.)&nbsp; I am using Word 2016.&nbsp; Any ideas or references will be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I see that if Smart Lookup is clicked for a particular flagged word, it "sends the word to Bing," so there is apparently some way to extract each word.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 could never be started</h2>
                    <p>I had this issue when Windows 10 kept going to blue screen and asking me to restart or follow advanced issues. No luck at all with any of the attempts. Eventually used command prompt tried. SFC, reste etc but no use, same messages to restart etc. Went back
 to command prompt and did chkdsk on all the disks i.e X, C, D, E etc and chkdsk corrected the errors and corrupt files. All working now except the start menu.
</p>
<p>BTW i did follow all forums but the chkdsk is what worked.</p>

<h2>            2016 Office SLOW&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Word and Excel are extremely slow to respond. When I am trying to scroll or page down a document, it just sits there for a minute and then flies past the spot I was trying to get to. Yes, I did "enter" a couple times which is why it flew down the page
 when it did respond. I cannot deal with this lack of response in Word and Excel. I feel like throwing the laptop out the window! It's also like that on the desktop, which by the way, I can barely use now after installing Windows 10. Why oh why did I upgrade
 to Windows 10? My computers were working fine before this. Better than fine. Now I lose so much productivity waiting for the darn program to respond!! Anyone else having this slow issue? I will always remember from now on, "Free&nbsp;is never really free". I am
 paying dearly for this upgrade now as I'm sure many of you are.

            <p>Try Sushma's fixes first.&nbsp; If they don't work, try some of these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Office 2013 first came it many people had similar slow performance issues. There were actually a few different fixes.
</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<strong>Office 2013 Slow - Turn Off Onedrive Sync</strong>
<p>Perhaps uncheck the “use Office to sync files faster...”&nbsp;setting in Onedrive. </p>
<p>Reference: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_home-office_install/microsoft-office-document-cache-sync-client/6b011698-e0d8-4cc0-b3c2-674ba2565fc3?page=1">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_home-office_install/microsoft-office-document-cache-sync-client/6b011698-e0d8-4cc0-b3c2-674ba2565fc3?page=1</a></p>
<p>I looked at the Settings of the&nbsp;Onedrive desktop application and I saw that the option “Use Office to sync files faster and work on files...” was checked. I unchecked it and everything went normal, my CPU is now under control and there’s no CSISYNCSLIENT.EXE
 process in the background... Somehow, this started when I used OneNote via Outlook 2013 for the first time.</p>
<p>What this process does is build a very large cache of indexed Office files on your local drive. &nbsp;For me, the cache was ~5GB, or about equal to the combined size of my Office files. &nbsp;That would be fine provided
 I had extra space available on my SSD, but I don’t. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I discovered that simply turning off this option does not automatically delete the cache and free the space. &nbsp;To recover the disc space I closed the Onedrive&nbsp;application&nbsp;and then deleted everything in C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\15.0\OfficeFileCache.
 &nbsp; Keeping the “Use Office” option turned off has resulted in a much smaller cache.&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS needs to document the cause/effect of this option so people understand the impact it has on their system.</p>
<div>
<strong>Slow Word 2013</strong>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>Sluggish response in my office 2013 Word document editing was due to using the navigation pane only. I use navigation pane often since I typically work on large documents. Once I turned off the navigation pane, response is as expected. No other settings
 or features caused this poor response in Word 2013 because I tried them all! This “fix” proved to work on all my installs and a colleague’s office 2013 install.
</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>
<p>I experienced a similar issue with slow typing speed in Office 365 Word. I edit a substantial number of Word and Excel documents for work and found the Onedrive storage incredibly beneficial for working remotely.</p>
<p>I realized though that documents which are being edited from Onedrive, not a local copy, experience the slow typing speed issue.</p>
<p>The fix: &nbsp; From word: &nbsp;File, Options. Word Options has an advanced tab on the left labeled ‘advanced’. About 3/4 of the way down, a category for ‘Save’ options exists. The default setting has ‘Allow Background Saves’ checked. I uncheck this option and instead
 check ‘Always create backup copy’ and ‘Copy remotely stored files onto your computer, and update the remote file when saving’.</p>
<p>I assume that if you’re storing the files on Onedrive, or Dropbox, or web, or maybe even some external drive or flash memory this background save could be lagging and result in typing slowness. Either way, I changed the advanced options, and no more problem.
 Maybe it’ll work for you.</p>
<p>Excel didn’t have the option, and I usually save a local copy anyways due to the working file size.</p>
<p>*I run windows 7 with office 365 and windows surface pro with win 8 and office 365. 4gb memory each.</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;</p>

<p>Answer</p>
<p>I have had the same problem on many computers and tried every solution I found on the web and nothing worked(registry changes, office settings(save display and more)).&nbsp; As a test&nbsp;I copied the files from my Onedrive folder to the desktop and everything worked
 well - typing was as fast as office 2010 - the slow typing&nbsp;was a one drive problem. &nbsp;Wanting both the benefits of Onedrive and the ability to type without lag I did the following:</p>
<p>1.Created a folder outside of Onedrive call Onedrive-Local. </p>
<p>2 Downloaded MS SyncToy to sync Onedrive-Local to the Onedrive folder which uploads to the cloud.</p>
<p>Now I only work out of the Onedrive-Local folder and things are fast.&nbsp; The files get synced and I have access to them on the cloud.

<p>I had DisplayFusion installed on my machine. Quitting DisplayFusion immediately resolved my issue.</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>After quite a bit of experimentation, I found that many of the solutions proposed helped (marginal improvements) with the speed of the text entry in Word (I am using Word 2013 - delivered with Office 365 subscription).
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I thought the issue may be with performance or hardware compatibility related to Windows 10 (I am using a &nbsp;a preview version of Windows via Bootcamp dual-boot setup on a new Macbook Pro with Office 365 installed).&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, I found that the main problem was change tracking!...I was editing an excerpt of a larger document which had “Track changes” activated. I can only imagine that the tracking of deletions was causing some sort of efficiency issue in the processing.
</p>
<p>I have about 80% free RAM and a Quad core i7 system (16Gb of memory of which 80% is free, 100MB reserved for Word, so not a memory usage issue - must just be inefficient code)&nbsp;</p>
<p>I confirmed the Track Changes setting was main issue by activating all the animation etc (the other fixes proposed). Those factors did not cause the original issue to re-occur.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when my word locks up with this issue, the performance of the remaining applications is relatively unaffected.</p>
<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<div>
<strong>Hide Track Changes</strong>
<p>I found that if I set the tracking drop down to "No Markup", the lag goes away.</p>
<p />
<p>This way you can continue to track changes, just not see them in real time.</p>

<strong>Slow Excel 2013 - Rubber band effect, delayed Response time when typing – Disable Animation feature</strong>
<p>In Office 2013 MS added a funky new UI feature called “Animation”. It is supposed to “smooth out”, or some such nonsense, cursor movement in the applications. I first noticed it in Excel 2013. I found it so annoying that that “feature” alone was enough to
 completely turn me off from using the whole Office 2013 bundle. Fortunately, or not (?), I found these fixes.</p>
<p>&lt;snip&gt; Hi, I have exactly the same problem, Excel2013.</p>
<p>Just opened a new spread sheet, typed the nr 1 in cell A1 to A22, took me about 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Took excel 55 seconds to display, looks like slow motion.&nbsp; &lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>The article in the first link has a link to another article with a downloadable file that will make the change without you having to edit the registry manually</p>
<p>There’s an easier fix for the “rubber band” animations in Excel - just turn them off

<p>Hello Jacques,</p>
<p>I just saw this, and I can explain it. In 2013 we went to a more secure algorithm across Office - not just in Excel. Excel 2013 uses SHA-512. It makes only milliseconds of difference with one call, but in those cases where code runs, protecting and unprotecting
 many sheets, it all adds up to a terrible performance issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Because it is considered a security risk to modify that, all request for a change have been turned down. The development team will never do anything to make Office less secure. See

</p>
<p>Is Microsoft Excel 2013 running slow on your machine? Tired of the lag when switching cells? You’re not alone. Many people that have recently upgraded from Office 2010 to Office 2013 have noticed that the application performance when using Excel is subpar.
 Don’t worry. There’s a solution that should improve your experience.</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<div>
<strong>Turning Off Unnecessary Animations in Windows 7</strong>
<p><strong>1) Go to the “Start Menu” and select “Control Panel”</strong></p>
<p />
<p><strong>2) In the “Control Panel”, select “Ease of Access”</strong></p>
<p />
<p><strong>3) Select “Use the computer without a display”</strong></p>
<p />
<p><strong>4) In the “Adjust time limits and and flashing visuals” section, check the “Turn off all unncessary animations&nbsp; (when possible)” checkbox.</strong></p>
<p />
<p>The next time you launch Excel 2013, you should notice that there is no longer a delay when switching cells while using the arrow keys or using your mouse. I hope this eliminates some of your frustration.</p>

<p><span>Turn off Hardware Acceleration</span></p>
<p>Visio 2013 x86 was super slow on a Dell Vostro machine running Windows 7 Professional x64. After a series of troubleshooting, I traced the problem to the accelerated graphics. Just disable the it. Here’s how:
</p>
<ol>
<li>File menu, </li><li>Options command </li><li>Advanced option </li><li>Scroll down to the Display section of the dialog, </li><li>toggle the check the box for “Disable hardware graphics acceleration</li></ol>
<p>This issue is most noticeably on machine with dual video chip set.</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>******</p>
<p>I have found slowness with Visio 2013, and found that turning off Snap to Shape intersections fixed the issue. ( View \ Visual Aids \ Snap &amp; Glue \
<strong>Shape Intersections )</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>********</strong></p>
<p>UPDATE: I have gained a slight performance boost by disabling the “Animate Controls and Elements inside Windows” option in System Properties &gt; Advanced System Settings &gt; Performance Settings. &nbsp;Still not quite on par with Visio 2010, but we’re getting there.</p>

<p>Anyway, this might not apply to everyone, but I saw a few other comments from people who also have Optimus-enabled laptops.</p>
<p>Basically, I’m forcing Visio to be rendered by my Quadro, instead of allowing it to be rendered by the Intel.</p>
<p>Go to the Nvidia Control Panel and open check the “Manage 3D Settings”</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>

<p>Add a reference to Visio if needed</p>

            Dear Microsoft - it is truly pathetic that in 2016 you have tons of users who are having issues with
<em>typing </em>in your freaking word processor. Is it too much to ask to expect software in which we can type things without having to waste hours going through a convoluted troubleshooting process? Come on, this is ridiculous.

<h2>            Nokia 6120 Classic microSD card problem</h2>
                    Just bought this phone and put the memory card in as described by instruction manual however nothing is happening. Why is this? Is it a faulty memory card?<br />
Can anyone help?<br />
Thanks in advance.

            I think it need to be formatted<br />
Go to the memory<br />
menu =&gt; tools =&gt; memory ( this in my N80 )<br />
Then, press settings then Format<br />
<br />
I don't know. It might work ^^

            There seems to be some problem here, you come across it elsewhere on the net, same thing, I solved my problem, I sold my Nokia 6120 and got a Motorola V9, everything works fine.<br />
<br />
Bye bye Nokia, it was a very forgettable 6 hours that I have known you.

<p>
</p><p>There is nothing native available.&nbsp;&nbsp;A long time ago&nbsp;a third-party tool would be mentioned when this question was asked.&nbsp; I don't know what the state of it is now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(BING search for</p>

<p>

<h2>            Automatically installed languages on windows phone</h2>
                    Hello, I have a Lumia 930, I use two keyboards on it English and Georgian, however it also installs Russian and Kazakh keyboards that I do not need, it's annoying since that means I have to go through 2 more languages when I wish to swap through Georgian
 and English which I have to do all the time since I work at a place where I have to be connected with both local (Georgian)&nbsp;and international costumers.
<br />
<br />
I can remove the two keyboards by going into the keyboards menu, but whenever I restart the phone, Russian and Kazakh ones are automatically added again.<br />
<br />
Is there any way to permanently remove them?

    <title>Page numbers in Table of Contents are wrong - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> datorum  say:</h3>
<h2>            Page numbers in Table of Contents are wrong</h2>
                    <p>I'm writing my thesis in Word. It has 6 chapters that are in separate files. The chapters have numbered headers and page numbers that are sequential across the whole thing (i.e. Chapter 1 starts on page 1 and ends on page 7, Chapter 2 starts on page 8).
 I'm creating another file with table of contents for the whole thesis using the RD field. It gets all the headers correct, but they all have the same page number (i.e. all of Chapter 1's headers are listed as on page 1, all of Chapter 2's headers are listed
 as on page 8). How do I get it to correctly give the page numbers for the headers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fields:</p>
<p>{ <span>TOC \o "1-3" \h \z \u}</span></p>
<p><span>{RD "path/ch1.docx"}</span></p>
<p><span>{RD "path/ch2.docx"}</span></p>
<p><span>{RD "path/ch3.docx"}</span></p>
<p><span>{RD "path/ch4.docx"}</span></p>
<p><span>{RD "path/ch5.docx"}</span></p>
<p><span>{RD "path/ch6.docx"}</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>I figured out the answer. All the files have to be open when you press F9 to update the table.</p>

 another.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried merging the separate files into a single one? In the past limits in hardware forced us to split large documents into smaller sub documents. But current hardware can handle files much larger than you are used to.</p>

            <p>That's not the problem I'm having. The page numbers are correct in the 6 chapter documents. It's only in the combined table of contents using the RD field that it is wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What it should be (and what I do get if I create a ToC for the chapters individually):</p>
<p>Chapter 1.......1</p>
<p>1.1..................1</p>
<p>1.2..................2</p>
<p>1.3..................5</p>
<p>1.4..................7</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chapter 2.......8</p>
<p>2.1..................8</p>
<p>2.2..................9</p>
<p>2.3..................12</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What I get:</p>
<p>Chapter 1.......1</p>
<p>1.1..................1</p>
<p>1.2..................1</p>
<p>1.3..................1</p>
<p>1.4..................1</p>

<p>2.1..................8</p>
<p>2.2..................8</p>
<p>2.3..................8</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Combining the documents is not an option. I could copy/paste the ToC from each chapter document, but I'm still editing, so I wanted something that would autoupdate.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Create the TOC in the individual documents. In the source document, Select, and copy EACH TOC. Then paste
<strong>with link</strong>, into the "master" document. You can update the content copied into the master document, but you will have to update each TOC in the source document individually to get changes to the page numbers or heading entries.

            <p>Trying to paste with link didn't work, but it did help me solve my original problem. Apparently what I had to do was create a ToC in each of the chapter documents. Then the "master" ToC was able to update. I then hid the ToC in each document (Font &gt; Effects
 &gt; Hidden). On the "master," each chapter has to be updated individually, but F9 will do it.</p>

<h2>            Lumia 820 no option to add APN</h2>
                    
<p>I recently received a Nokia 820 factory unlocked from a competition, as you may have guessed I was pretty happy to get a brand new phone for no £££ but upon transferring my current sim into it I can only use WiFi and have no options to add APN to resolve
 i'm with VodafoneUK and they have been absolutely no help and Nokia haven't been able to help me either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my phone before this one was an iPhone 4s&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i've added all the updates from the post regarding network updates etc. but still nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>add to that the volume for my alarm seems to be VERY quiet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any help would be very appreciated as it stands I have a very expensive nokia 3310...</p>

<p>My guess is your phone has not received the Access Point update. Yse the link below to download and install the Access Point update. You should then get the option to add an access point which allows you to customise all your apn settings.</p>

<p>There is absolutely no issues with Vodafone (UK)and you shouldn't need to input any APN as reads from SIM. As you have been using microSIM in iPhone 4S, there is no issue of badly trimmed miniSIM:</p>

<p>Hi Fernando,</p>
<p>It’s not supported to downgrade Outlook for Mac to previous version directly. We need to uninstall the currently installed Outlook for Mac 15.20, then reinstall Outlook for Mac 15.19.1.</p>
<p>To uninstall Outlook 15.20 completely, please refer to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Uninstall-Office-2016-for-Mac-eefa1199-5b58-43af-8a3d-b73dc1a8cae3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Note: Please back up the folders mentioned in the <b>WARNING</b> section.</p>

<p>Step 1: Open the picture in MS paint.</p>
<p>Step 2: To crop your image, Click on the Select tool on the toolbar. It looks like a dotted-line box.</p>
<p>Step 3: Click and hold on a corner of selected area</p>

<p>(Note: Select only what you want to keep. If the cursor wasn't set right, click once to take away the box, and move and click to start over).</p>

            <p>Hi Spring,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, yes that is correct.&nbsp; Part of how MSE works is that it doesn't download every single definition for everything that is sometimes needed several times a day or more like some of the competition.&nbsp; That's why its database is smaller than that of competitors
 and one of the reasons it is more efficient than most.&nbsp; It uses things like heuristic algorithms, detection by familiarity with malware families rather than always including definitions for each variant and, of course, SpyNet.&nbsp; SpyNet allows it to check with
 the massive Microsoft Database during a scan to catch anything the local database&nbsp;might not have specifically included (because they are rare or otherwise covered or because they are almost ready for release but haven't yet been published or have been published
 but not yet downloaded or installed by the user but are still available through SpyNet).&nbsp; Basic does this to a basic degree - advanced does this to a greater degree.&nbsp; This link to SpyNet also protects you between updates - therefore updates need not be as
 frequent without placing your system at risk.&nbsp; In addition, SpyNet uses the information it gathers to improve the definitions and detection algorithms so that MSE improves not only by information from normal sources of such data but using information gathered
 constantly from its own users.&nbsp; It is perfectly safe for you to use and it does improve how MSE operates and the protection it provides.&nbsp;&nbsp;I strongly recommend Advanced Membership to everyone and have had it set that way (or at the highest level) ever since
 I started using it when it was first released.&nbsp; Although written for Defender in Vista, this article applies to MSE in general as well:

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Join-the-Microsoft-SpyNet-community</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as Event Viewer goes, this is the best description available.&nbsp; To get all aspects, you need to follow the links to the other articles that go into more detail about individuals aspects as well as how to use them.&nbsp;

<h2>            No Visual Voicemail&#58; T-Mobile and Blu WinHD &#40;Sold by Microsoft&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Let me start by saying there is another question thread on this that's marked as answered and it's clearly not resolved. The Microsoft person in that thread said that dual-sim WP 8.1 phones will not work with visual voicemail. However, there is a page on
 Microsoft's&nbsp;<strong>own site</strong>: "Microsoft Lumia 535 Dual SIM - Use Visual Voicemail." All other Microsoft responses were canned, "tap the phone tile and swipe...." etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought the Blu Win HD phone directly from the Microsoft store. This phone is advertised as working with T-Mobile and AT&amp;T (GSM). I cannot seem to get a straight answer on if visual voicemail works on this phone or not, at least with T-Mobile, which Microsoft
 shows as compatible. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This phone is going right back to the Microsoft Store if it does not indeed work with visual voicemail. My Lumia 521's VVM worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any actual knowledge on this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I searched a little and found references that say VVM is not supported by the phone. The phone not supporting VVM is not related to the dual sim feature.&nbsp;As you see other dual sim phones have the VVM feature.&nbsp; This particular phone does not support VVM</p>
<p>A phone listed as&nbsp;compatible with a carrier is different than the supported features&nbsp;on a phone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2010 though Graphics Acceleration<em> </em>is enabled by default. If PowerPoint doesn't like your video driver it MIGHT cause this.</p>
<p>Try Going to FILE &gt;Options&gt;Advanced &gt;Display and disable<em>.</em> If it helps look for a later driver.<em><br />

<h3> hannoverfist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2010 Send&#47;Receive button doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I have <strong>Outlook 2010</strong> with <strong>Windows 7</strong> (though it doesn't work in other versions of Windows&nbsp;either).&nbsp; The
<strong>Send/Receive All Folders</strong>&nbsp;button doesn't seem to do anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I press the <strong>Send/Receive All Folders</strong>&nbsp;button (now <strong>
GIANT</strong> sized for stupid people to easily find), nothing happens.&nbsp; Outlook's
<strong>Send/Receive Progress</strong> window should open with several tasks but it doesn't.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I&nbsp;<strong>Send/Receive Groups</strong> for my <strong>Inbox</strong>, the <strong>
Send/Receive Progress</strong> window opens normally and I see the progress bar move.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a fix for this?&nbsp; Or is the button just for looks (to trick the aforementioned stupid people into thinking that they can do something)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From what I can tell with the hundreds of posts without resolution&nbsp;about this flaw, this issue&nbsp;has been around for over 5 years yet Microsoft seems to have done nothing due to their crappy/non-existent customer service.&nbsp;I used to like MS but my opinion of
 them&nbsp;seems to decline daily.</p>

            <p>Nothing at all happens when I hit F9 or press the Send/Receive button.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have figured out what the issue is though (on accident).</p>

<p>The new feature of <strong>Send/Receive Groups</strong> lets users select what is updated when you press
<strong>Send/Receive All</strong>.&nbsp; By default, All Accounts are included in the <strong>
Send/Receive </strong>group.&nbsp; Unfortunately, if you <strong>Edit</strong> the Group I see that there is a check box (include the selected account)&nbsp;to determine if it actually is included but it is not checked by default (WTF?!? Why would I select a group to
 be updated but then have it disabled by default?).&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just re-installed Windows and Office 2010 so I know I didn't change it myself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to re-cap,&nbsp;the new feature of account&nbsp;<strong>Send/Receive</strong> <strong>
Groups</strong> has <strong>All Acounts</strong> by default, yet <strong>All Accounts</strong> are disabled by default.&nbsp;Seems kind of lame to me but what do I know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps the hundreds/thousands of others who have the same issue.&nbsp; I've already helped a couple people in our office who have the same issue but thought the button wasn't supposed to do anything anymore.</p>

            <p>My issue was that my account was not select to be included in the Send/Receive.</p>
<p>Here's what worked for me:</p>
<p>On the <strong>Send/Receive</strong> tab, click <strong>Send/Receive Groups</strong> and select
<strong>Define</strong> <strong>Send/Receive Groups</strong>. </p>
<p>Select the <strong>All Acounts</strong> group (or whatever group you made that you want to Send/Receive) and make sure that the
<strong>Include this group in send/receive</strong> is checked. </p>
<p>It was defaulted to unchecked when I had Office 2010 installed.</p>
