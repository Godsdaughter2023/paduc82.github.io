<h2>            In the 365 one drive as admin  how can i upload folders</h2>
                    <p>I am tasked with moving users network drive to their one drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have accomplished accessing the users one drive as admin and can upload and move files but the system will not upload or move folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have tried drag and drop from explorer as well as cut and paste and upload. &nbsp;nothing will copie the user folders to the one drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know this can be done desk side with the user performing the tasks but we want to do this on the admin side and have everthing inplace when we introduce the user to using one drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can folders be uploaded or moved ?</p>

<p><span>Hi Gultch,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Glad to hear that you have upload the folders successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regarding the modified by issue, actually it’s an expect behavior. Since you are the one who upload files to the end users’ OneDrive for Business libraries, that’s saying in the OneDrive for Business libraries, the file
 is modified by you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

                    <p>I've recently had a problem with e-mail addresses that are based on a website. I keep on getting "bounce" messages - even though their e-mail accounts are neither full nor blocking me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at information on my Outlook address under the HELP section - and this is the first I've ever heard that my e-mail volume or content might be blocked as a sender.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I'm talking about my own e-mails - I'm the only sender. What I mean is, I keep on getting bounce messages back from the website based e-mail addresses. They have no problem contacting me. It has become one-way communication, except for the seemingly random
 times I get through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get 5.5.0 error messages - my e-mails are being treated as "junk mail". I have a Hotmail account. I am aware that they have been hijacked by malicious hackers, to send out spam, etc. If I'm being blocked somehow, possibly because of that, should I contact
 the webmaster of that site, to get unblocked? I have learned via Private Messaging on that website that my e-mails have NOT been getting through. I need my e-mail address functioning with them again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will settle for "very soon". I am somewhere between annoyed and infuriated. Previously, the only reasons for bounce messages that I was aware of, were for the other account being full or specifically blocking me. I had to look on these forums for three
 hours, before I found out how to get the source info - there is nothing specific in my Hotmail/Outlook account telling me about this - that needs to change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also became aware, from these forums, that this problem is not uncommon - after I initially didn't find anything when I typed in my question. I spent several hours researching this last night - getting to bed at 3 am - going through technical jargon which
 is largely complete gobbledegook to me, to find out what the picture behind this is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the most under-reported e-mail/internet/computer problem I have come across in some time. This information, and how to resolve it, should be bannered everywhere. It is all part of communication getting WORSE from phone calls - I get through with
 those 99.999999% of the time. E-mail isn't like that, not by a long shot.</p>

<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community!<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you were prompted an error when trying to send emails.<span>&nbsp; Let me assist you with your concern.&nbsp;
</span>There are several reasons why you are receiving Delivery Status Failure or bounce message, here are some examples:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Mailbox Not Found, Invalid mailbox, User unknown</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Mailbox unavailable
</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Mailbox full or Quote Exceeded</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Host unknown, Domain Lookup Failed</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Message too large</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span></li></ul>
<p><span>As what </span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/083c9ada-567f-4b1e-ba21-8a0585616bee" title="ZigZag3143 (MS - MVP)">ZigZag3143 (MS - MVP)</a> mentioned above, w<span>e
 would like to ask a copy of delivery status notification you've received for us to investigate your concern. To do this, please follow these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open the e-mail message.
</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right click on the message</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.
</span></strong></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Choose the View message source option on the dropdown menu. You will be seeing a new window containing the e-mail message headers and its content.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>After doing so, kindly post the message source with all the components of the bounce message such as:</span><span>
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Final-Recipient</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

            <p>Having done some research, I have come to realize that this kind of problem begins with being somewhat complex. I would be interested in hearing just exactly what's going on here. I also appreciate that this issue has been escalated twice already, the first
 time immediately. This problem has continued to persist, except for me getting through briefly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to mention again, that the IP addresses, associated with my e-mail address, have changed. Whether this is normal or not, I would state that each time they change, they are still being bounced. It appears that I may be a victim of DNSBL blacklisting,
 to begin with. Is there any way for me to get whitelisted, so that I can stay off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I would like to publicly comment that the instructions on displaying delivery status notification were very helpful - explicit and easy to follow. Thanks for that and all the other help. I am checking daily on this matter. I am not having any difficulty
 e-mailing to any other addresses outside the website I'm having a problem with.<br />

            <p>I e-mailed to one of the "problem" addresses last night, and not only did it not "bounce" by today, I was able to get through and get a reply. Wow! (Finally.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I am wondering more specifically what the cause of this intractable problem was. I am grateful for all the intensive help, from Microsoft, in overcoming this persistent situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to point out (again), that I am neither a website owner nor a webmaster, with affected e-mail addresses, that other people couldn't get through to. Rather, my problem was the opposite - a sender, not an intended recipient.</p>

<h2>            Nokia Player User is from another territory</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to able to download free music from the Singapore OVI store. Not sure is it because I flash my motherboard or the nokia ovi store change their interface. I'm not able to login to Singapore OVI store, I always get an error "User is from another territory".
 If I login to Malaysia OVI Store, I have no problem but my Nokie comes with music is tied to Singapore account. By the way, I'm currently in Malaysia. Please help!</p>

<p>Hello patricklwj,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There have been other reports recently on this forum regarding this message regarding the user being from another territory. &nbsp;My first instinct tells me that this may be connected to the recent migration, although the circumstances you describe are slightly
 different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am going to ask the team to look at this in more detail. &nbsp;I'll keep you posted when I have some further information. &nbsp;I would also contact Nokia Care and inform them. &nbsp;The telephone number is 0845 0455555.</p>

<p>Hi Patricklwj</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds to me that during the migration, your account was one of the few that was not migrated properly. What you need to do is contact Nokia Care, and tell them your old username adn explain the situation. If you are having issues with this, please PM
 me.</p>

sorry, but I've been trying to get my account fixed for weeks now. Support is pathetic &amp; they haven't been able to fix it for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've phoned Nokia numerous times. I've talked to numerous support workers. I've explained my issue numerous times. I've waited at the phone numerous times while an expert "calls me back". But they didn't. I've tried &amp; tried.<br />
<br />
And I've got no-where.<br />
<br />
it'spathetic. the service is useless. The software is usless. everything is a joke.<br />
<br />
if you can help me, fair enough - i'll give you the benefit of the doubt. but i'm not holding my breath.

            My "Music store location" in the Options was showing "Australia", but clearly I wasn't connected to Australia. I connected to Canada (but it still appeared to remain India), then I changed it back to Australia, and it is back to what it once was. Seems
 like there is a glitch in the migration settings!

            Hi.
<br />
<br />In Excel there is no RESTAR function. Use the SUM function and convert the numbers you want to subtract from their negative values. For example, SUM (100, -32,15, -6) returns 77.
<br />
<br />You can also check this link:

            You could sum the amounts to be subtracted and subtract that total from the first cell.
<br />For example
<br />=A1-SUM(B1:F1)

<p>Designing web forms, I'm frustrated that I can't resize the master form.&nbsp; There is no ability to grab an edge and drag to a larger size.&nbsp; I have a main form, with child forms on a tab control, and cannot get the main form any larger than about 2.5" tall.&nbsp;
 There is property for width, but not for height.&nbsp; What's the deal?&nbsp; Is there any way I can program this into the form?&nbsp; I don't see a macro setting for size at all.</p>
<p>I'm very frustrated.</p>

<p>Hi GalinKalamazoo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The behavior you are seeing is by design when creating web forms.<span>&nbsp;</span>If you want to adjust the size of the form, you need to adjust the size of the controls on the form or you can add or adjust the size of the
 empty cell controls on the form. To add these empty cell controls, you would open your form in layout view and then on the Arrange tab of the ribbon, you will see a place to insert Rows and Columns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There most likely isn’t an option to just resize the web form itself because the web form is created in a state to be web friendly.<span>&nbsp;</span>When you open your web application, these forms are going to resize themselves
 automatically based upon the size of the IE window and screen resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to see the form in a maximized state, you could either use tabbed windows within your client application or you could create client forms in addition to your web forms.<span>&nbsp;</span>If you create client forms,
 this will give you the ability to size them however you want and will also give you the ability to make your client side application look a bit different then your Web app.<span>&nbsp;</span>In addition to this, within your Access Options for the database,
 you can choose which form should be your startup form on the web and which form should be your startup form when running the database from a client machine.<span>&nbsp;</span>The article below should provide some additional information on how to help you
 design your application for the web.</p>

<h2>            Hiding certain series in an excel data table &#40;but displaying those series in the chart&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,&nbsp; I have a chart which is a "clustered column" graph which has three different data series, and a "line with markers" graph with two data series (the column and line graph are combined&nbsp;on one chart).&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to hide the series information from the
 column graph on the data table.&nbsp; Is it possible to hide only certain series from a&nbsp;data table while keeping the others?&nbsp; Thank you in advance!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <span>Create the chart with all 3 series (i.e. the three series and the total) as a stacked chart. Then right-click on the 'Total' series, select Chart Type and change it to a line
 chart. Lastly, double-click the line and format it to have no line or markers. It should then be included in the data table, but not be visible in the chart.</span>

    <title>N95 file sharing capabilities on WiFi connected Microsoft LANs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> g6cid  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95 file sharing capabilities on WiFi connected Microsoft LANs</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
1. I know the N95 supports WiFi but does it provide "File and Print sharing" services for Microsoft LANS? - ie can I see a folder on the phone containing my photos/files and access it as I would a fileshare on any other network connected device?<br />
<br />
# alternatively:<br />
<br />
2. Does the phone support being connected to a PC via USB lead and appearing on the PC as a USB disk drive?<br />
<br />
Any comments, or URL's to FAQs would be much appreciated!<br />

I am surprised though that, after going to the trouble of bulding in WLAN access hardware, they then miss out the obvious SMB drivers!<br />
<br />
I currently carry around a cheap digicam (and USB lead) with my laptop and use the camera to survey customer's sites etc. The cam on the N95 looks very nice, and the WiFi connectivity would be handy for quickly dumping off the pics taken on to the company's
 server, for sales to then quote etc...<br />
<br />
One more Q pls: if the phone is running the GSM/3G transmissions, plus bluetooth for headset in car, AND also the WiFi (because I forgot to turn it off one day!), what's the battery life like when running in standby with all 3 tramsission systems live - any
 thoughts?<br />

            I am assuming you haven't actually purchased the N95 yet? The battery life is a big talking point amoung users, and many say that they are happy with it. I think that most people who use the phone will agree, however, that the battery life is not as good
 as most other phones. The statistics prove this.<br />
<br />
Basically - you should consider switching off functions when not using them, as any additional activity (lights on, bluetooth on, GPS on, etc.) will add drain to the battery.<br />
<br />
I would recommend avoiding using WLAN for photo transfer, but simply attach the USB cable, and use the mass storage option for speed of connectivity. This is quick enough, and will allow fast transfer of photos to your PC and/or network server.<br />
<br />
Battery life is certainly a concern, so be cautious about how you use it - keep a car charger in the car, and buy spare mains chargers and or battery if you rely on the phone heavily.

            Hi, and thanks for your feedback "i_nic" ...<br />
<br />
But why would you recommend against the WiFi connectivity pls?<br />
<br />
I know the N95 doesn't have the SMB drivers as standard (or so I was told), but the problem with USB connectivity is that the USB lead gets lost, the hosting PC won't recognise the uSB 2.0 device, the PC is Non-Admin status, etc etc .. ie the WiFi option just
 seems easier to me!<br />
<br />
I use this approach every time I switch on my own WiFi Laptop back at the office and just "get connected". WiFi works fine ..... but does the N95 work with it?<br />
<br />
Are there WiFi issues with the N95 then pls?<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt; The statistics prove this (Ed: that batt runs down quickly)<br />
<br />
As far as the battery issue goes: are there any real facts &amp; figures posted anywhere which give actual times when the N95 is in multi-connectivity mode - ie when it is in "GSM +Bluetooth +WiFi" triple connectivity mode ???<br />
<br />
Also: can the various radio types be programmmed to switch off after "X mins of inactivity" perhaps? Comments anyone?<br />
<br />

            OK.. WiFi... I recommended against this as for me personally, I feel it would be easier to connect on a USB cable. If you find it easier to use WiFi, then I guess there's no reason why you shouldn't. It was really just my preference, as I prefer not to
 worry about switching the WLAN on and off for this purpose. The other disadvantage of using WiFi is that if you're going to buy an SMB tool, then there's a cost, and a potential issue by using a 3rd party application. Assuming you're happy to buy the tool,
 and it works well, then great! It sounds like it's the solution for you. :)<br />
<br />
However... (just thought)... Some people have reported issues with WiFi connectivity. I don't think this will cause you a problem, but if it does - there are plenty of posts on here which give some excellent advice for how to solve the issues. The only real
 issue I've seen reported is that some people have had to adjust their "advanced settings" to remove power saving options due to persistent drop-outs of connectivity. If you do experience this kind of issue, then just search for WLAN/WiFi connectivity issues,
 and I'm sure you'll find some answers - or let me know and I'll see what I can do to help! :)<br />
<br />
With regards to battery life - I am not aware of any stats about the impact of the various connectivity features on the battery. What I can tell you is that the standard battery life figures (standby and talktime) are the poorest I've seen for a mobile phone.
 These are the Nokia published figures, which you can find in this site.<br />
<br />
Any radio device will use a vast amount more power when transmitting than receiving, (hence the standby and talktime figures being so different for every phone). Therefore, it stands to reason that the battery will be drained more quickly (don't know how much
 more quickly), when using any radio frequency transmission feature - i.e. bluetooth, WLAN, 3G, GPRS, GSM etc.<br />
<br />
When the phone is "idle", it will still transmit to the cellular network occasionally, but for the most part it is simply in receive mode and therefore using less power. Bluetooth is more-or-less the same (or it should be) when not actually running an active
 connection, and WLAN/WiFi will also be similar (although I believe it will "pole" more frequently - not 100% certain of this).<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong - I love the phone... but for the very first time, I am planning to buy a spare battery for emergencies. I rarely run out of power on my phones, but I have done it twice already on this one, and I've only had it since April 2nd!<br />
<br />
As for time-outs on any or all of the radio functions - I don't believe there is such a feature - but I think it's a great idea, certainly for bluetooth (infrared does this), and I know that some Motorola models have this option. I'm surprised I've never seen
 it on a Nokia.<br />
<br />
I think that covered all your questions... and I hope my answers make sense.<br />
<br />
PS - "Nic" would work... the "i_nic" is a rather lame attempt at a pun on "iPod"!! Lousy, I know.. but there you go!

            I agree!<br />
Wi-Fi is much more convenient. and USB is not that much faster as it's a marketing trick to say the n95 is USB 2.0 but in reality it's just 1.1. (about 850KB max.)

            Interesting points from both abirvalg and bustacap. I feel I have been told! (in a good way).<br />
<br />
I see your points, and if you're getting reliable and simple connections on WiFi, then that's fantastic.<br />
<br />
Personally, I do not usually have a need to connect to anyone else's machines, and so I can simply connect to my work machine or my home machine with ease via USB - I don't need to install the whole PC suite, as I can just use the memory card like any other
 storage device, and with XP on both machines I find it straightforward.<br />
<br />
My other concern with WiFi connections is security. Both from the perspective of data protection (e.g. passwords and e-mail access) and also from the point of view of viruses.<br />
<br />
clearly virus problems can be addressed with anti-virus software (but this will have an impact on the phone's performance), but unless every WiFi connection you make is encrypted, there is still the risk of any passwords you enter being captured, or any data
 you transfer being subject to someone spying on you. I realise this is a little paranoid, but part of my job is to be just that!!<br />
<br />
So.... WiFi for those who can... (and clearly find it very convenient) and USB for those who are paranoid... (like me) is my opinion! :)

<h3> logancastrucci  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Office on Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1&#63;</h2>
                    I just bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 this morning at Best Buy. &nbsp;I told the employee helping me that I was going away to college and wanted a tablet that would work well and that I could install office on. &nbsp;He said that the Note would work perfectly
 fine for both college and Microsoft Office. &nbsp;So, he sold me Office 365 University for about $80. &nbsp;I came home and I'm trying out the tablet and setting it up, and the download will not work. &nbsp;I tried googling a solution to my issue, but could not find a definitive
 answer. &nbsp;What do I need to do to download Office on my tablet? Or can I not download it and should I take the copy of office back to Best Buy and demand a refund?

                    is there a software upgrade for the N70 standard model, so it can be paired to the Mercedes SAP 2 bluetooth Module, AND be able to DOWNLOAD the Phone book from the SIM card?<br />
as, apparently it doesnt have 'Sim Access Profile'<br />
<br />
I have heard a rumour that the N70 music edition software will allow this?<br />

also does anyone know if the N95 has sim access profile?

The N95 has a SIM access capability for Bluetooth, the N70 sadly does not.

<h2>            Shortcut Key for Bullets in Word 2013</h2>
                    <p>Friends,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently came to know how to assign Short Cuts to Word 2013. Also, I've assigned Shift + F10 for Bullets.. But this is not effective as it was in Word 2010. In Word 2013, I can only apply bullet using the Short Cut F10, not able choose the Bullet
 Style.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if there is any alternate way to assign bullets &amp; Select the bullet style of our own wish without using Mouse.</p>

            By default, Ctrl+Shift+L applies the List Bullet style in Word. No matter which shortcut you make use of, you can apply the style via the Apply Styles pane (Ctrl+Shift+S).

                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a notebook in a shared location. When I try to open it with OneNote 2016, the program crashes. I can open the file in OneNote (for Windows 10) and OneNote online. I would like to use the 2016 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have unsuccesfully tried:</p>
<p>- Deleting the cache</p>
<p>- Deleting the settings</p>
<p>- Repairing OneNote 2016</p>
<p>- Reinstalling OneNote 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what to try next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalling Update Office 2016 KB4462238 did the trick for me.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a98176c-583e-442b-a1ba-373e274e354f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a98176c-583e-442b-a1ba-373e274e354f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>This update causes OneNote 2016 to crash when you start the application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It then gives you the same error as YusufMangera.</p>

<h2>            Office 365 for University set up</h2>
                    I just bought office 365 university with my new laptop and took it home to set it up. I can't get past the "enter your product key" screen because every time I enter the key I get a notification saying that my product key is not valid or that it has been
 used before. Has anyone else had this problem before? The Microsoft FAQ isn't very helpful either.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To install Office 365 University follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You will have to first redeem/register Office 365 University with your University Account. Redeem Office 365 University from the following link:
</span><a href="https://academic.getmicrosoftkey.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://academic.getmicrosoftkey.com/</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps as per the above link and let us know if you were able to redeem Office 365 University.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In case you are experiencing issues in signing in to your My Account page after successfully completing the redemption process, then you may sign-out of all Microsoft Services

<h2>            Can&#39;t find a PPT a user has previewed, edited and then saved on outlook 2016.</h2>
                    Dear all,<br />
<br />
One of the users has opened an email , so the email popped as usual in a new windows, the email had a power point attachment and the user had to edit the attachment in the email , the user has done some modifications and while doing so the outlook email popup
 closed, but the user was not aware, so he continued to do his job in which he needed to edit the power point attachment . And when he finished he saved it and was not able to open it back and whenever he opens the email again , the unedited attachment shows.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me whether it is possible to find or retrieve the attachments or not ?<br />
if it is not possible, can you kindly explain ( if you have the knowledge ) what is exactly happening in the scenario of opening a file in outlook, editing it and then saving it ?<br />
<br />
Thanks And Regards

<p>I have found the solution, basically the files are being stored in a TEMP folder and you access it doing the following :-&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1: Locate the folder</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
The folder location is stored in the registry in the following key;</p>
<table>
