<p>I don't remember how I got my White Sox one that I got now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, I went here:</p>
<p><a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Games/ThemesAndGamerPic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Games/ThemesAndGamerPic</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And all I see there is themes. &nbsp;No gamerpics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would someone care to enlighten me?</p>

<br />
<em>As a last resort, the TDR subsystem sends the video driver a "please restart yourself now!" command and waits a few seconds.<br />
If there's no response, the OS concludes that the video driver/hardware combo has truly collapsed in a heap, and it fires off that stop 0x116 BSOD.</em><br />
<br />
<em>If playing with video driver versions hasn't helped, make sure the box is not overheating.<br />
&nbsp;Try removing a side panel and aiming a big mains fan straight at the motherboard and GPU.<br />
&nbsp;Run it like that for a few hours or days - long enough to ascertain whether cooler temperatures make a difference.</em><br />

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, make sure you are using the latest version of Skype. Check that you have a strong Internet connection, if Skype detects a weak connection it will reduce the quality of the call. As a workaround, you may try updating your audio driver. Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the Windows logo/Start button, type Device Manager, and select it from the list of results.</li><li>Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select Update Driver.</li><li>Select Search automatically for updated driver software.</li></ul>
<p>If these steps don't work, try reinstalling the driver:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Device Manager, right-click (or tap and hold) the name of the device, and select Uninstall.<br />
</li><li>Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>After that, kindly try to do a test call.</p>
<ol>
<li>Search for the <strong>Echo / Sound Test Service</strong> contact.</li><li>Call Echo and follow her instructions.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you heard Echo’s voice <strong>and </strong>heard your recorded message, then your sound and microphone are working just fine and you are good to go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not hesitate to reply to this post if the issue still persists. Thank you!</p>

<h3> tdaveny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Desktop Connection to Windows 10 Home - Unable to make</h2>
                    <p>I purchased several Intel NUC Computers with Windows 10 Home - Was assured by Intel &amp; Microsoft that as Remote Desktop is part of Windows 10 Home and I&nbsp; will have a full blown remote capability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed and double checked all posted configuration settings for Windows 10 to allow to connect to it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting&nbsp;to connect to Windows10 Home using several &nbsp;Windows 7 Pro systems , I am unable to make that connection</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Support&nbsp;claims that it is possible&nbsp;using&nbsp;Remote Desktop Connection on a Windows 7 Pro computer to connect to Windows 10 Home&nbsp; - I cannot manage to do that
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some Microsoft documentation suggests that one cannot connect to Win 10 Home using Remote Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>So which is it ? Is it Possible or Not ?</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows® 10 Home has Remote Desktop for connecting to other computers, but you can't remote desktop to Windows 10 Home itself.<br />

            <p>Hi Brendan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I suggest that refer to the methods outlined below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 1: Install the latest updates </strong></p>
<p>Installing the latest updates for your device and Windows can help fix many common connection issues. For Windows devices, here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <strong>Start</strong>, and select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Update</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Select <strong>Check for updates</strong>. If updates are available, they will install automatically. You may need to restart your device after the updates have installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If installing updates doesn’t help, try Solution 2.</p>
<p>
<strong>Solution 2: Check your HDMI and USB connections </strong>
</p><p>Make sure both the HDMI end and USB end of the adapter are connected correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure the HDMI end of the adapter is connected to the HDMI port on your HDTV, monitor, or projector. Use the included HDMI extension cable if needed.</li><li>Make sure the USB end of the adapter is plugged into a USB power source.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Notes</strong><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>If the HDTV, monitor, or projector you’re connecting to doesn’t have a USB charging port, you can use the USB charging port on a device power supply or any other USB charger.</li><li>Use a USB extension cord if you need more length for your USB connector.</li><li>Make sure the electrical outlet you’re using for USB power is working properly. Test it by plugging in something else.</li></ul>
<p>If you’re still having trouble after checking your connections, try Solution 3.</p>
<p>
<strong>Solution 3: Update the adapter’s firmware</strong>
</p><p>If you can connect your device to the adapter but what you can see on your device isn’t visible on your second screen, the adapter’s firmware may be out of date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your adapter’s firmware is up to date and you still have a problem, try Solution 4.</p>
<p>
<strong>Solution 4: Restart the adapter</strong>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Remove the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter from the TV or Monitor.<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Restart your device.<br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Re-insert the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter into your TV or Monitor.<br />
<strong>Step 4:</strong> Attempt to display one more time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong></p>
It is recommended to check for updates on both your device, and Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter after completing Solution 4.
<p>
</p><p>If you still have a problem, try Solution 5.</p>
<p>
<strong>Solution 5: Reset the adapter</strong>
</p><p>Try resetting the adapter. This is also helpful if you’ve forgotten your password. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> On the adapter next to the wired connection, press and hold the reset button for 10 seconds. The LED light on the adapter will blink.<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> When the message “Ready to connect” appears on your second screen, swipe in from the right edge of your device screen or select
<strong>Action Center</strong> in the taskbar.<br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Select <strong>Connect</strong>, and in the list of displays, select the name of the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If resetting the adapter doesn’t solve the problem, try Solution 6.</p>
<p>
<strong>Solution 6: Remove the adapter and reconnect</strong>
</p><p>There might be a problem with the connection between your device and the adapter. To fix the issue, try disconnecting the adapter from your device and reconnecting it. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to <strong>Start</strong>, and select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Devices</strong> &gt; <strong>Connected devices</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Under <strong>Projectors</strong>, select the name of the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter and select
<strong>Remove device</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Select <strong>Add a device</strong> to connect your device and the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If disconnecting and reconnecting the adapter doesn’t help, try Solution 7.</p>
<p>
<strong>Solution 7: Allow the adapter to communicate through Windows Firewall</strong>
</p><p>Windows Firewall might be preventing the adapter from connecting to your device. To allow the adapter to communicate through the firewall:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select the search box in the taskbar, enter <strong>allow firewall</strong>, and in the search results, select
<strong>Allow an app through Windows Firewall</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Under <strong>Name</strong>, find <strong>Wireless Display</strong> and make sure
<strong>Private</strong> and <strong>Public</strong> are selected. Then, select <strong>
OK</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you can’t select anything in the <strong>Allowed apps and features</strong> box, you are not logged in as an administrator. Select
<strong>Change Settings</strong>, enter your administrator password, and select <strong>
Yes</strong>. Your administrator password should be the same as the password you used to set up your device. Then, make sure
<strong>Private</strong> and <strong>Public</strong> are selected and select <strong>
OK</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>If your firewall is set to allow the adapter to communicate but you still can’t connect, try Solution 8.</p>
<p>
<strong>Solution 9: Reinstall the Intel HD Graphics driver</strong>
</p><p>An issue with the Intel HD Graphics driver on your device might be preventing your device from communicating with the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter. Try uninstalling and reinstalling the driver. Here’s how:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select the search box in the taskbar, enter <strong>Device manager</strong>, and in the search results, select
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the arrow to the left of <strong>Display adapters</strong> and press and hold (or right-click) the Intel HD Graphics driver.<br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Select <strong>Uninstall.</strong><br />
<strong>Step 4:</strong> Go to <strong>Start</strong>, and select <strong>Power</strong> &gt;
<strong>Restart</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 5:</strong> After your device restarts, go to <strong>Start</strong>, and select
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Devices</strong> &gt; <strong>Connected devices</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 6:</strong> Select <strong>Add a device</strong> to connect your device and the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If you still can’t connect your device to your Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter continue to solution 9.</p>
<p>
<strong>Solution 9: Uninstall and Reinstall the Device Wi-Fi Driver</strong>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select the search box in the taskbar, enter <strong>Device manager</strong>, and in the search results, select
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Select the arrow to the left of <strong>Network adapters</strong> and press and hold (or right-click) your device’s network adapter.<br />
<strong>Step 3:</strong> Select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 4:</strong> Go to <strong>Start</strong>, and select <strong>Power</strong> &gt;
<strong>Restart</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 5:</strong> After your device restarts, go to <strong>Start</strong>, and select
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Devices</strong> &gt; <strong>Connected devices</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 6:</strong> Select <strong>Add a device</strong> to connect your device and the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>Regards&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hello everyone, ive had this issue for couple days now. when i try to update my windows 10, it says "There were some problems installing updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for information,
 this may help: (0x80096004)"</p>
<p>and i noticed i cant download any apps from the store also. im running on a build 10240 idk if that helps. Any help would be appreciated. i searched everywhere on the web but most ppl have the issue with sevice pack. I dont even know if i have that issue

<h2>            Activity Reporting on Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>So when I get online to look at my microsoft account (I’m the parent) to look at the bar graph for my kid’s gaming activity (or time that he’s been signed in, since it doesn’t distinguish), they don’t add up. My kid’s not sneaking time in, either. I just
 like checking the tool because I thunk its a great visual monitor for how much time he plays, but its no good if it doesnt work. He inly has one microsoft device so he’s not signing in on differnt devices either. The time the acrivity bar graph says he’s played
 just never matches what he’s sctually played. &nbsp;Can Msft fix this? Because it wiuld be a great tool! &nbsp;Thanks!!</p>

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you're having issues with your child accounts screen time reports. What exactly is the issue though is it showing that he has played more than he has or showing that he has
 played less than he has? Please let us know with a reply to best assist you. If it is that he has played more time that is being registered it may be because an adult account is signed into the console while he is also signed in so it would count it as approved
 time playing together and not register it in the report. Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Same question, ehen you add up how long has been spent in each game (or tv app) then in my case it totals 9.5 hours for the week which is far lower than the graph of 33hours 18mins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On one day, the graph is showing 17hr 15m which seems very high and certainly a lot higher than all the games added together would suggest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any ideas as at the moment the feature is pretty useless.</p>

            Hi I would say it is looking like there is an error.&nbsp; I've seen so many people saying the same thing and it is causing arguments in families.&nbsp; Where parents are accusing there children of sneaking extra time.&nbsp; If this is the case it does need looking into,
 due to the very nature of its purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a very similar issue: my report for my two kids is showing way less time used in the graph bars than what I know gets used. Interestingly, the limits set are still working (so when the kids reach their max amount I always get an email from them asking
 to add time), so it's just the way the reporting is done, at fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for the attention.</p>

<h2>            Mail and Calendar not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello, Microsoft Engineers and Community members!<br />
<br />
I have a frustrating problem which I cannot solve for the past three weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My<strong> Mail &amp; Calendar</strong> Applications do NOT want to add my account. All I get is "<strong>0x80c8043e</strong>" or "<strong>0x80040154</strong>" errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My <strong>People</strong> Apps doesn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked around the Web, of course but all solutions (<em>Uninstalling </em>
the apps using the PowerShell and then<em> re-installing</em> them from the Store and

</p>
<p>
</p><p>This lack of adequate help and guidance and even attention on Microsoft's part is really
<em>surprising </em>for me. Windows 10 is maybe the most praised piece of software in the history of computing but the support is ridiculously poor!</p>
<p>

            <p>I did not see an error message but Calendar and Mail would not start after the upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; The issue was some type of corruption in my user account.&nbsp; I am using a MSN (@outlook.com) account to login and I was on the Window 8.1, prior to the upgrade</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried on another user account and the applications worked fine so I concluded that something was wrong with my administrator account.&nbsp; I have 4 accounts on the machine and only mine is administrator.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thread suggested that I create a local account and then recreate my administrator account.&nbsp;&nbsp; This did not work because the local account I created (when I was logged in as myself) did not remove the corrupted account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to fix for me:</p>
<ol>
<li>Backup data in my account C:\Users\Jeff</li><li>Change account type of another account to 'administrator'.</li><li>Log off my account and login to the other account with new administrator priviledge.</li><li>Remove my account.&nbsp; NOTE:&nbsp; This will erase everything in that account.</li><li>Restart (probably unnecessary but it's windows so you never know...)</li><li>Log in to account with new administrator priviledge</li><li>Create my account</li><li>Login to my account and confirm that apps worked</li></ol>
<p>I have a feeling (no way to diagnose) that the issue happens only to the administrator account during the Windows 10&nbsp;upgrade.&nbsp; The other 3 accounts on this machine did not have problems starting Mail and Calendar.</p>
<p>

<p>Administrator accounts in Family Safety can no longer be monitored on Family Safety. This is to ensure that the child cannot change settings to programs, specially Family Safety, that may cause it to not report/function as intended by the parent account.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Seagate not working properly after Windows 10 Creators Update</h2>
                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/windows-10-anniversary-update-and-seagate-goflex/a74439a8-83af-43ee-8617-43946a5d9f68" title="Split from this thread">
this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I switched from a Windows 7 laptop to a Windows 10 laptop back in December. I also have the Seagate GoFlex that came bundled with Memeo Instant Back-Up. I couldn't reinstall from my CD since that version wasn't compatible with Windows 10. Via internet research,
 I found out that I could download the "Windows 8 compatible" Seagate Bundled software from their website (http://www.seagate.com/support/external-hard-drives/desktop-hard-drives/goflex-desk/) and that it would work with Windows 10. &nbsp;I tried it and it did indeed
 work. &nbsp;Until last week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Saturday, the Windows 10 Creator update was installed on my laptop. &nbsp;Upon final reboot, I couldn't connect to my Seagate X, Y or Z drives. &nbsp;Nothing would work. &nbsp;I uninstalled the Seagate software and reinstalled it from the link I posted above (in case
 it was a newer version from the one I had downloaded in December). &nbsp;It seemed to work fine, I could access the drives and Memeo Instant Back-Up seemed to work again. &nbsp;I don't turn off my laptop at night. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I had a problem with the laptop and I had to reboot it. &nbsp;Upon reboot, I once again couldn't access my Seagate GoFlex drive and the Memeo software wouldn't even launch. &nbsp;I uninstalled the Seagate bundled software and reinstalled it from the file I
 downloaded on Saturday. Once again, it worked. &nbsp;I had to reboot the laptop again for another issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time, (but not the previous times that were less than an hour prior?!), I got a message stating "Memeo AutoSync Launcher cannot be run under this version of Windows" as soon as my desktop was displayed. &nbsp;And, you guessed, it, I can't access my Seagate
 GoFlex drive again! &nbsp;It seems that reinstalling the software works but as soon as I turn off my laptop, whatever processes need to happen upon reboot get hung up and causes the Seagate/Memeo software to fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've emailed Memeo to let them know and ask if they were aware that this latest version of Windows 10 isn't, in fact, compatible with their software (their website claims that Memeo Instant Back-Up is indeed Windows 10 compatible). I kind of doubt that they'll
 respond. &nbsp;Seagate can't be reached, it seems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has a fix for this problem occurring after the Windows 10 Creator update (short of reinstalling the software each time I restart my laptop), please let me know. &nbsp;I'm troubled that, right at the same time as we're told we should back up our files
 because of the global ransomware problem, our file back-up program stops working because of a Windows update!</p>

    <title>System Image for RAID 10 array - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rmgarrett  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Image for RAID 10 array</h2>
                    My OS &amp; data are all installed on a RAID 10 array consisting of 4 1TB hard drives, which give me an effective C: drive of about 2TB.&nbsp; Can I use the "create system image" to image the entire C drive on a single internal or external hard drive?&nbsp; How large
 a hard drive do I need for that?&nbsp; If I can't image that way, what's the best alternative so that I can keep a effective, bootable OS for that hardware?&nbsp; If I were starting from scratch, I would probably install the OS on a separate smaller drive and the data
 on the RAID array, but I don't want to have to re-install the OS and the many programs after that at this point to get to that configuration.<br />

<h2>            DVD&#92;CD drive is Missing Windows 7</h2>
                    Original Thread: hardware device<br />
<br />
my dvd/rw storage device seems to have disappeared from view and I can't get it to appear in my computer. It also doesn't read anything if I put a cd in it. I don't know how long it has been gone since I don't use it very often or if any windows update could
 have caused this.

<p>I had a similar issue and I found it to be due to the high volume of messages and game clips I had. &nbsp;If you download smart glass on your phone you can easily delete your messages. &nbsp;I think the OS for the console shares space with the messaging and upload
 saves and so when you get a lot of them it causes the whole console to run poorly. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>money 2005 backup password asks for password that does not exist as no - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pjkeys  say:</h3>
<h2>            money 2005 backup password asks for password that does not exist as no pw was ever created for back up.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hard drive crashed on a 1 year old computer and I got it repaired and recovered all data except Microsoft Money 2005 which may have been Money Plus 2005. I re installed the program but it asks to restore a back up file to restore the information and then
 asks for a password to open the back up file. However no password was ever created or asked to be created for any of the back ups. I would like to retrieve years of personal and business finance data and realize I need to migrate to a newer program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also realize there is forum dedicated to this issue but am seeking a more current solution than the ones posted, especially for Windows 10 64 bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any information related to resolving this issue that a layman could understand would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help with this issue. The steps were to download and install the Money plus sunset version and then open the program with the program password from the original 2005 software. Then, once inside the program, go to "Restore Backup" on the
 file menu, choose the back up which will ask for the program password and not a&nbsp; non existent password. It will then restore the files from the date of the back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Paul</p>

            <p style="text-align: center"><strong><span><span>Windows System Backups</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></strong><span>There are a number of things that cause a computer to become unusable so it’s a very good idea to make full system backups.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Some of the things that can cause this to happen are:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Your hard drive can fail.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Your system becomes infected by a virus.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>You accidently install a faulty program.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Your computer gets powered off without going through a normal shutdown.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>There are numerous others, but you get the idea.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Depending on how much of your C: drive is being used and what kind of device your C: drive resides on, the time this takes can vary greatly.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To give you an idea, here are some actual timings:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>50 GB SSD desktop to USB 3 hard drive took
<strong>8 minutes</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>88 GB laptop (5400 rpm) to USB 3 hard drive took
<strong>21 min., 11 seconds</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>205 GB desktop (7200 rpm) to USB 3 took
<strong>77 minutes</strong>.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>As you can see, there’s a wide degree of variation depending on what kind of C: drive you have and how many GB of data you’re backing up.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So what do you need to have for accomplishing this?<span>&nbsp;
</span>First you need a good backup/restore program.<span>&nbsp; </span>There are many free ones, but the two recommended here are:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Macrium Reflect (download from http://www.macrium.com/reflectfree.aspx)</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Easeus Todo Backup (download from http://www.easeus.com/download/tbf-download.html).</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>Both of the above are free for non-commercial use and can be easily downloaded and installed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They both can create a recovery CD or flash drive you can boot from to restore your C: drive in case your computer becomes inoperative.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Both of these programs can be set up to do everything automatically at a time when you’re not using the computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>The other thing you need is an external hard drive to put the backups on.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can buy 1 TB USB 3 external drives for around $50 to $60.<span>&nbsp; </span>
These should be fine for most people.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you have more than 250 GB of used space on your C: drive, you should consider a larger capacity drive, but the great majority of people can get by with the 1 TB models.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Doing this can save you a lot of grief and expense when the inevitable problems occur.</span></span></p>

                    So with the latest patch my DLC gobblegums are locked on my 2nd account, I just don't understand why they would let me waste my hundreds of liquid diviniums getting DLC gobblegums then take them away. What about all the time I spent getting those gobblegums?
 They need to fix this ASAP! I could understand if it was like this from the beginning but to just take them away with an update after I've obtained multiple of each one is a REALLY SCUMMY move! Waste of my *** time

    <title>Audio Lag, Some sounds from games being late &#47; appearing 5-10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Audio Lag, Some sounds from games being late &#47; appearing 5-10 seconds late</h2>
                    <p>Hello, i am experiencing audio lag for some sounds in games Dota 2 and CS:GO. Some sounds appear in real-time and some are processed after. It is really annoying to watch a soundless game then all sounds appear after 5-6 seconds in same time. Other sounds
 ( youtube, movies, music, other games etc ) seem to work fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried:<br />
Restarting computer, restarting steam...</p>
<p>Changing audio settings in game itself</p>
<p>Updating Realtek driver</p>
<p>Unplugging and pluging back speakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Changing settings in exclusive mode in speaker settings</p>
<p>Google searching for answer, contacting steam support&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and had no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any clue how can i pinpoint a source of this problem?</p>

<p>I fixed my own problem. It was something with HD or motherboard.</p>
<p>
