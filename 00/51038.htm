<h3> garryfreemyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t verify my account on this computer because I changed my security info and my phone is smashed.</h2>
                    <p>I get a message to verify my account on my computer but when I try I am sent to a site with&nbsp;a blurb telling me that I cannot access this site right now because I changed my security info which was old and now I am in a month long waiting period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says I can log in unless I can use my current security info but I cannot get to the screen to tell it to send me a security code in email and there is NO button to even try logging in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously if my cell&nbsp;phone is smashed I can't use that number so now I'm stuck waiting for a month?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this Microsoft or Nazi Germany II? Come on Microsoft you are not apple.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix&nbsp;this. I keep getting nagged to verify my account on my computer and I cannot do that because of the disgusting maze Microsoft has put up. What's the point of a month wait?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked all my email and my junk folders for a verification email and no dice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for any grammar errors. I can barely see the screen.</p>

    <title>Where is the product key&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arh_621207  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where is the product key&#63;</h2>
                    <blockquote><span>
<p>With Windows 8, Microsoft has changed from stickers that have the product key that the user has to type in when installing the operating system to new BIOS embedded product keys. The idea is that by eliminating the sticker, you eliminate one of the easier
 ways for nefarious users to get a legitimate product key. Eliminating the product key sticker also removes any worry that the sticker might get damaged while at the same time eliminating the long and irritating process of typing in various letters and numbers
 when installing the operating system.</p>
<p>If the user has to reinstall the operating system on a machine that came with Windows 8, the installation process automatically grabs the software product key from the motherboard BIOS with no input from the user. This means that those familiar Windows product
 key stickers will no longer appear on the Windows 8 computers.</p>
</span></blockquote>
Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A longer question, with documentation that might be of help to others.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My spanking new (2013) HP Pavilion 23-b010ez has MS Windows 8 version 6.2.9200 pre-installed.</div>
<div>Comments on this page to the effect you "don't need the old fashioned, full 25-digit, product key" are not correct.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What does installed "Windows Help and Support" for my computer say on the product key?</div>
<div>I quote:</div>
<div>- "its a 25-digit number used to activate Windows"</div>
<div>- "the product key should be in the box that came with the Windows DVD came in - or"</div>
<div>- "[the product key] should be in an email that shows that you've bought Windows."</div>
<div>- "It's a good idea to save a copy of your product key for your records in case you ever need to reinstall Windows."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had no Windows System (Recovery) DVD on purchase. It came pre-installed.</div>
<div>I had no email with a product code. I had a confirmation of my Windows Account I was forced to sign into on first starting my computer, and a confirmation of authorization email with a verification code for my Microsoft Account.</div>
<div>But no product code by email (they wouldn't send them by email anyway -defeats the security).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And I fully agree to keep an external copy of the product key. Apparently (according to the "Windows Help and Support information" supplied on my new computer I DO NEED the product code for Windows reinstallation.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I found I also am asked to type it in, if I try to buy Windows for another computer, or &nbsp;Want to add features to my edition of Windows from here: control panel\system and security\activation center\windows activation using those built-in features. In both
 these places, I am asked to enter the full 25-digit product code. No alternative. Can't tell it to go search the BIOS, instead!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, to date, what have I found, and where?</div>
<div>I have tried finding the product key, without success. In "Windows Activation" of control panel\system and security\activation center\windows activation I found the last 5-digits (or are they the first?) and my date of activation. In "System Information"
 of control panel\system and security\system, under listed under "Windows activation" title, I find my windows is activated, and a 20-digit "Product-ID code. Is this the rest of the full product key that is now BIOS embedded, as mentioned above? Would be nice
 to know.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Why do I need to enter the product key?</div>
<div>Well because of reinstallin Windows, adding extra features (whatever those are), and buying another copy Windows for another machine.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So where is the product key - or how do I come by it?</div>
<div>I do not trust not having it now, and having the hassle to obtain it under pressure once I am forced to make a reinstallation of Windows on my new computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks.</div>
<div>ARH</div>

            Hi,
<div>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.<br />
<div>As you told windows 8 was preinstalled on your computer.We would like to tell you that the product key will not need to be entered as it will use the manufacturer's product key
<strong>which is encrypted in BIOS.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>How to find product key?<br />
</strong></div>
<div>1. Open the original packaging of the OEM software; the product key should be printed on a sticker located somewhere on the case. Some software has the sticker on the back side; others will have it on the inside of the case.<br />
<br />
2. Examine your computer's case for an OEM product sticker; this is common for computers produced by major retailers running Windows.<br />
<br />
3. Open the manual that came with the software; OEM keys are printed on the inside front cover, or inside the back cover. Occasionally the key will be printed on a loose piece of paper tucked into the manual.<br />
<br />
4. Contact the computer retailer that provided you with the software; retailers often keep records of product keys belonging to their customers in the event the keys become lost.<br />
<br />
Hope this answers your query. You can write back to us for further queries/issues related to windows and we will be glad to assist you.</div>

<h2>            Why does my mic come on every time get a notification on windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I have upgraded to Windows 10. During the install, and now when the PC makes any noises at all, the Microphone picks up feedback, and I can hear it through the speakers. I find it annoying, why does it do this?

<h2>            Error Code 8015D002&#58; unable to log into Xbox Live after changing my Microsoft Account Password</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I'm having a huge problem at the moment and I have not been able to resolve this in any way whatsoever from anything that I found online. Here's the problem:</p>
<p>I changed the password on my Windows 8.1 computer for the Microsoft Account that I was logged in with. This is the same Microsoft Account that is associated with my gamertag, MustardScroll7, on Xbox Live. I tried signing into my Xbox 360 afterwards, but
 I was presented with a prompt asking me to confirm my email and password. My email is correct within every single letter. I re-entered the password using the new one that I had created and pressed Done, but I received the error code 8015D002. I tried following
 the instructions online for deleting my Xbox Profile (profile only), clearing System cache 3 times in order, and then restarting my Xbox to try and re-download my profile. It still doesn't recognize the password!!!!</p>

<p>So now, not only am I locked out of my account, but I can't even download my Xbox account back...</p>

<p>I need help with this ASAP, please. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Recent update to 1803 messed up my desktop access and internet functionality</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This past week I isntalled the 1803 update using the update option while shutting down the computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the install, I tried to turn it on and I found that I had to select my keyboard language again and thatI was not connected to the internet. Now, after trying to login, I received the following error :</p>
<p>
</p><p>Location is not available</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\Desktop is unavailable.</span> If the location is on this PC, make sure the device or drive is connected or the disc is inserted, and then try again. If the location
 is on a network, make sure you're connected to the network or internet, and then try again. If the location still can't be found, it might have been moved or deleted. Ok.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicked OK and then nothing else than a black background, the task bar and only a recicle bin icon appeared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing works. The star button, any icon in the task bar, nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried using the Default Reset on My User Desktop folder (I accessed it by opening the task manager and starting a new processes using browse, because it doesn't even start explorer.exe)&nbsp; However, I'm now getting the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the login screen comes up, I get the error "sihost.exe System Warning - Unknown Hard Error". Clicked OK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After login in, I now get</p>
<p>&nbsp;"<span>C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\Desktop is not accessible. Access is Denied"&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>I've been stuck with this, even though it was working perfectly fine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any help is appreciated as I need it to work. I have not donde a backup of my files (dumb, I know). So, if there is any possible solution that doesn't involve deleting all my files, it would be great.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Information:</p>
<p>MS Win version: 1803&nbsp;</p>
<p>OS Build: 17134.48</p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />Once you are able to boot into safe mode, check the integrity of the system
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build
<br />
<br />E. Otherwise, you can resort to below

            Hi Kevin, this is not a good sign . ..
<br />
<br />1803 has not been installed correctly on your system, you can try rolling back to 1709, but honestly your best and probably only option is to reset Windows 10, while keeping your files and apps . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, 
<br />Then start the Reset

<h2>            Clean Windows 10 AE but keep losing internet connection.</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys<br />
<br />
I would appreciate a MVP reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After running W10 happily for almost a year, I updated with W10Anniversary and had glitches, so I made a clean install of Windows 10 Anniversary edition using ISOs produced by the media creation tool.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those glitches are still present and take the form&nbsp; of 'losing' my network connection at irregular intervals, which is resolved only by rebooting my 2013 PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>....and yes, I do have SSD C drive and a second drive (HDD)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions, apart from going back to a pre W10AE backup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
I have carried out your suggestions but the internet problem continues.<br />
To try and be helpful,&nbsp; I would like to describe more carefully the symptoms, in case my description is not very good...</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>INFORMATION YOU REQUESTED</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Computer:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Dell XPS 8700<br />
<strong>Connection:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;By ethernet first to the family's access point, which then is connected by ethernet to the Plusnet ADSL router.<br />
<strong>Wifi:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Not really used. The Wifi entry in Network and Sharing Center has NOT been disabled, but I have also tried disabling ethernet and just using wifi, but the result is the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>RESULTS OF</strong> </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><strong>netsh winsock reset catalog</strong></em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><strong>netsh int ip reset reset.log hit</strong></em><br />
<br />
Everything returned 'OK' <strong><em>except </em></strong>the Resetting entry after 'Resetting Path, OK!'...&nbsp;&nbsp; I get a 'Resetting &lt;space&gt;, failed.'&nbsp;&nbsp; Followed by an 'Access is denied.' message.<br />
<br />
I then rebooted the PC, but issue continues.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>EXAMPLES/OBSERVATIONS OF PROBLEM (WHEN I AM ONLY THE USER ON THE INTERNET)</strong><br />
<br />
If this information helps, I have observed that problems seem to occur usually after a few minutes of internet use, or even a few minutes after a start up, but is most noticeable when I am already doing a task involving traffic to or from the internet. For
 example - I cannot access the BBC website when I am already downloading using iTunes.&nbsp; Often if I pause or exit from iTunes, I still cannot access sites e.g. BBC, and the PC needs rebooting.<br />
<br />
In the observations, I used iTunes as an easy way to test downloading large 4Gb files, plus giving time to allow me to see if there were disconnecting. issues.&nbsp; I use a simple utility called NetMeter&nbsp; where I am able to see a graph in realtime of the traffic
 from my PC, and therefore any slowing of traffic to my PC. <br />
I&nbsp; also meant to add that also have done an antivirus check.<br />
<br />
Just expanding on the above example,&nbsp; I can see my iTunes is downloading Films or Music at our ADSL maximum download speed of 4-5Mb/s, but if I try to use Edge or Firefox at the same time I cannot access anything.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Or, alternatively, Firefox just displays a <em>'connecting'
</em>message, whilst MS Edge does not display anything on it until is displays the messsage :
<em>"Hmm, we can’t reach this page.&nbsp; Try this - Make sure that you’ve got the right web address: https://www.bing.com, - Refresh the page&nbsp; - Search for what you want"</em><br />
<br />
Incidentally, i noted that if I am downloading on iTunes, it correctly starts downloading the first music song but often has problems when it tries to download the next track on the list with the result they often timeout.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>FURTHER EXAMPLES OF NOT BEING ABLE TO CONNECT:</strong><br />
<br />
I have had 'connecting' difficulties in Firefox (my preferred browser) even by sometimes opening a second or third tab in the browser.<br />
<br />
In the evening when the family use the internet, it seems it is often 'whoever gets online first' becomes the the person having&nbsp; 90-95% of the internet connection for the evening. The rest get a small bandwidth of often less than 0.2 to 1Mb/sec.<br />
<br />
My guess/thoughts are that on the face of it, it seems like maybe the router not sharing out the available bandwidth correctly, but I am not sure it is the real reason because it happens when I am the only user on the network.<br />
<br />
As you can probably tell, I do not have the technical knowledge to see if the router is doing a correct job in distribution of bandwidth - so I do not know if it is OK -&nbsp; but I can
<strong><em>definately</em></strong> say that Plusnet have been monitoring the line for nearly two weeks and have just emailed to say they have concluded their tests and different line configurations,&nbsp; and have left the line in 'an optimum fast and stable state.'<br />
<br />
Perhaps I can check something else?<br />

<p>
</p><p>I<em> thought</em> I had just located and hopefully removed the problem, perhaps caused by a Windows Update problem.
</p>
<p>But that was only part of the way to resolution...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that in the update history that kb3176495 had failed to install.&nbsp;&nbsp; See:&nbsp; http://www.easeus.com/computer-instruction/fix-kb3176495-kb3176493-fail-to-install.html&nbsp; and in particular, the instructions
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Go to <strong>C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download</strong> folder and delete everything in that folder.<br />
2. Launch Command Prompt Admin &gt; run the command <strong>wuauclt.exe /updatenow</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>HOWEVER</strong></p>
<p>3. That was not the cure.&nbsp; <em>The thing that worked was to run the Network Reset which needs you to reboot the comoputer.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>MAIN INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Go to <strong>All Settings</strong>, choose<strong> Network &amp; Internet</strong> and finally click on
<strong>Network Reset</strong>. </p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Read the info, then click on <strong>Reset now</strong>. </p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Note: <em><strong>Do not click on Close </strong>because the computer needs to carry out a sequence before it automatically reboots in a couple of minutes.</em></p>
<p>7.&nbsp; After rebooting, you will need to enter any relevent passwords etc to reestablish Wifi or Ethernet.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;<em> Also just double check whether the connections have been correctly set to
<strong>PRIVATE or PUBLIC</strong>.</em></p>
<p>9.&nbsp; If in doubt, just do <strong>one more reboot </strong>after all the setup has been done</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I hope that might help someone.&nbsp; Please post here if it does.</em></p>

    <title>Windows 7 won&#39;t share root of drives installed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fourprincesses  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t share root of drives installed</h2>
                    I have just added a new PC with Win 7 to my home network.&nbsp; Now running 1 win2000 PC, 2 with XP Pro, 1&nbsp;PC&nbsp;with Vista Business and 3 laptops with XP Pro.&nbsp; All of the previous machines can see each other and also map to the root of drives installed in the
 PC's.&nbsp; Since adding the Windows 7 PC, all the other machines can see the new PC but I can't map to the root of the 2 drives in this unit.&nbsp; This unit can see and map to all of the other PC's with no problem.&nbsp; I tried to open up the sharing permissions and I
 looked to see if I could disable simple network sharing (as required in XP).&nbsp; I had a similar issue with Vista but managed to find a solution but I can't figure this Win 7 out.<br />
<br />
Any help or suggestions would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.

            Hi fourprincesses,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Windows forum.<br />
<br />
Try the following steps and check.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1 :</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>Enable network discovery</strong> and check.<br />
<br />
Network discovery is a network setting that affects whether your computer can see (find) other computers and devices on the network and whether other computers on the network can see your computer. By default,
<span>Windows</span> Firewall blocks network discovery, but you can enable it.<br />
<br />
See this link to <strong>enable network discovery</strong> : <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Enable-or-disable-network-discovery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Enable-or-disable-network-discovery</a>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2 :</strong> <br />
<br />
Enable<strong> file and printer sharing</strong> and check if it helps.<br />

            Hello Azeez,&nbsp;<br />
Network discovery is turned on.&nbsp; The rest of the PC's in the network can see the win &amp; pc, they can't share&nbsp; or map tho the win 7 PC.&nbsp; The win 7 PC can share the printers on the network and can access files and map root drives from the rest of the devices on
 the network.&nbsp; The rest of the network can SEE the win 7 PC but can't map to the root of the drives on the win 7 PC.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks.

 coming up with assigned numbers, like 079, 080, 081 etc. but not on a list where I can highlight them.&nbsp; I also want to do the same with several short videos I have.&nbsp; Incidentally, I transferred all this media from my iphone and ipad and everything came over

==========================================<br />
You can multiple select by holding your Ctrl key while left <br />
clicking thumbs or filenames.<br />
<br />
Also you can select groups of photos by Selecting one...<br />
while holding your Shift key and then select another further <br />
down the list. All photos between the two selected will be <br />
selected also.<br />
<br />
To move photos from one folder to another...<br />
<br />
With the thumbnails selected...type...Ctrl+X...this is the<br />
keyboard shortcut for "Cut". The selected thumbnails should <br />
fade and appear gray.<br />
<br />
Open the folder you wish to move the photos to and type...<br />
Ctrl+V...this is the keyboard shortcut for Paste.<br />

<h2>            After shutting down Windows Live Mail, the screen will not refresh to desktop.  Must start new program to get out of Windows Live Mail screen</h2>
                    <p>When I open Windows Live Mail and try to close it by clicking on the X at the top right side of the screen, it appears that the program shuts down, but the screen will not refresh and the Windows Live Mail screen still is open.&nbsp; When I run my curser across
 the screen the desktop begins to show.&nbsp; The only way for me to close the screen is to click on the blue box next to the clock or by starting another program.&nbsp; This problem does not occur all the time, but is random.</p>
<p>I have taken the following action to correct the shut down problem:</p>
<p>I Went to Program &amp; Features, Windws Live Essentials 2011 and clicked on the Repari All Windows Live Essentials and removed and reinstalled Windows Live Essentials and Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; The actions did not correct the shut down problem.</p>

            <p>I had two issues on a new HP laptop with Windows 7, 64 bit.</p>
<p><br />
1. Files saved on desktop did not show up until I right clicked desktop and hit refresh.<br />
2. Closing Windows Live Mail sometimes did not refresh desktop and did not disappear until I manually refreshed desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both of these issues were fixed after I renewed the file IconCache.db found in the following path:<br />
(Set Windows folders to show hidden files)</p>
<p><br />
local disk(C)\User\AppData\Local\IconCache.db</p>
<p>Rename the file IconCache.db IconCache.db.old<br />
Restart the computer.</p>
<p>Then the problems were fixed at least for me.</p>

            <p>That is usually a symptom of being short on memory. Does it help to end any particularly memory-heavy processes that may be running at the same time?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem&nbsp;could be exacerbated by having out-of-date display drivers. Check with your computer manufacturer and/or display adapter manufacturer for new drivers.

            <p><span>Hi Nickolas,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From the issue description, I understand that you are having issues playing Diablo-2 game. I will definitely help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What are the troubleshooting steps have you performed to resolve this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you get an error message when you play the game?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> I would suggest you to try installing the Diablo-2 game in Windows XP compatibility mode and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a></span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> If the issue persists, </span><span>I would suggest you to place the computer in clean boot mode and check if the issue persists.
<br />
A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.<br />
You may refer the following KB article to set the computer in clean boot: <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</b></a><br />
<b>Note:</b> After the trouble shooting steps, refer to <b>Step 3 </b>from the clean boot link to place the computer back to normal start up mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Try the above steps and get back to us for further assistance with requested details. We will be happy to help you.</span></p>

    <title>Integrated webcam not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sm105  say:</h3>
<h2>            Integrated webcam not working</h2>
                    I bought a Samsung&nbsp;notebook 5 (model #:&nbsp;NP530E5M-X02US) a couple months ago and didn't find a reason to use the webcam until&nbsp;now. Whenever I try using the camera application, it says that the webcam can't be found and displays this error code:&nbsp;<span>0xA00F4244.
 I've tried looking for the driver under imaging devices in device manager (even with 'view hidden drivers' on), but I can't find it. What can I do to fix it?</span>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>0xA00F4244 </strong>error code may be caused by an antivirus software that's blocking the camera or it could be an outdated webcam driver. Follow the troubleshooting steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Disable antivirus.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>In your antivirus app, look for settings related to blocking access or permission to use your webcam. For help, visit your antivirus software company’s website.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span> Check for an outdated webcam driver.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Start </strong>button, type <strong>Device Manager</strong>, and then select
<strong>Device Manager</strong> from the search results.</li><li>Find your webcam under <strong>Imaging devices</strong> or <strong>Sound, video and game controllers</strong>.</li><li>Press and hold (or right-click) the name of your webcam, and then select <strong>
Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Driver </strong>tab, select the <strong>Driver Details</strong> button, and look for a file name that includes
<strong>stream.sys</strong>. If it’s there, your webcam was designed before Windows 7 and you'll have to replace it with a newer webcam.</li><li>If you don't find a file name that includes <strong>stream.sys</strong>, try rolling back your webcam driver.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 3:</strong> Roll back your webcam driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In <strong>Device Manager</strong>, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>Driver </strong>tab, select <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong>, and then choose
<strong>Yes</strong>. (Note that some drivers don’t provide a rollback option.)</li><li>After the rollback is complete, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.</li><li>If rolling back didn’t work or isn’t available, uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Uninstall your webcam driver and scan for hardware changes.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In <strong>Device Manager</strong>, press and hold (or right-click) your webcam, and then select
<strong>Properties</strong>. </li><li>Select the <strong>Driver </strong>tab, select <strong>Uninstall </strong>&gt; <strong>
Delete the driver software for this device</strong>, and then select <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>In <strong>Device Manager</strong>, on the <strong>Action </strong>menu, select
<strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong>. Wait for it to scan and reinstall updated drivers, restart your PC, and then try opening the Camera app again.
</li><li>If your webcam still doesn’t work, try looking for help on the webcam manufacturer’s website.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result of the troubleshooting steps.</p>

            I've already disabled my antivirus but nothing happened. Also, I can't try method 2 or 3 because the&nbsp;driver simply isn't there. I've checked under both imaging devices and sound, video, and game controllers with 'hidden drivers' on, but there isn't a driver
 that seems to be related to webcams.&nbsp;

<p>We appreciate you getting back to us. Check if your computer has a dedicated key to enable/disable the camera (You may contact the device manufacturer's technical support team for assistance or refer to the user manual).</p>
<p>

    <title>Mouse Problems After Troubleshooting Ethernet Connection - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mouse Problems After Troubleshooting Ethernet Connection</h2>
                    Hey, I am using the logitech m705 and I have noticed that right after troubleshooting for my ethernet connection, which often went off and on at times, disconnecting from ethernet and connecting to wifi, going back and forth... So I opened my browser while
 my ethernet wasn't working and it gave me the option to troubleshoot or fix the problems, and I did that. Again, I immediately noticed that my horizontal sensitivity was off.. vertical seems fine to me... is there a way to revert the changes windows made?
 I'm using a diff mouse but my other one was much better. Any help would be appreciated. Have had this problem before and fixed it by swapping usb ports but this time it didn't work. Tried everything, including SFC.
