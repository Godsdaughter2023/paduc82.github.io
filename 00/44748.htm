<h2>            Free games with gold</h2>
                    Hey Microsoft. My name is cavviblast but you can just call me anbu :). But anyhow I made this post cause I thought I would give you guys some great games I considered being top fan favorites. First on the list is def jam: fight for ny. Hmm u guys brought
 back sc2 and that was/is an awesome game, but I think Def jam will sell alot better. 2nd on my list is final fight 3. Omg I remember playing that game everyday getting out of school. And just imagine what it will be like on Xbox live (hahahaha outstanding)
 :). And last but not least on my list is Xbox all stars. Yes I said it. It should be like playstation all stars but better. I think that game was a poopie rip off of smash brothers but u guys haven't made a game like that yet. So this would be the time to
 boo boo all over playstation all stars. Plus give these games some thought. Hopefully we will see it in the near future :). Thanks for listening and for all the wonderful free games you give us. Your biggest player, Anbu :)

    <title>New User Profile will NOT disable the Go Back functionality. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New User Profile will NOT disable the Go Back functionality.</h2>
                    <p>original title: Want to Go Back to Windows 7 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really like Windows 10. Installed and using on two other PCs. However, on one PC, it's been a nightmare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to return to Windows 7 Pro from which I upgraded only a few days ago. However, when I attempt to do this by going into Windows 10 Settings/Recovery/Go back to Windows 7, I get THE error message as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Remove new accounts</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Before you can go back to a previous version of Windows, you'll need to remove any user accounts you added after your most recent upgrade. The accounts need to be completely removed, including their profiles.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>You created one account (Administrator)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Go to Settings&gt;Accounts&gt;Other users to remove these accounts, and then try again."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I go to Settings&gt;Accounts, it says I have only one user:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"My Name</em></p>
<p><em>Local Account</em></p>
<p><em>Administrator"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not created another account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm really having a terrible experience with Windows 10 on this PC, having to force shut many different applications over and over, such that I can get nothing done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. I understand the problem you are facing, however please follow the steps below to get the issues fixed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You will need to delete the account or accounts (if more than one was created) that are specified in this screen before you can go back.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>IMPORTANT: Before deleting the user account please make sure that you have backed up any data that is associated with that user profile (Documents, Music, Videos etc.) as deleting the account will also delete the data associated with that user
 profile</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If during the course of troubleshooting you enabled the built-in hidden Admin Account (which cannot be “deleted”) and it is listed as the account that needs to be removed you can remove the profile by doing the following.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Disable Hidden Admin account<br />
2. Press (Windows Key + R) and type </span><strong><em><span>sysdm.cpl</span></em></strong><em><span>–
</span></em><span>this will bring up System Properties<br />
3. Click on </span><em><span>Advanced</span></em><span> tab<br />
4. Click on </span><em><span>Settings</span></em><span>&nbsp;under the User Profiles section<br />
5. On the User Profiles dialog select the &lt;COMPUTER NAME&gt;\Administrator account and click&nbsp; on Delete – confirm the delete<br />
<br />
</span><strong><span>IMPORTANT: The above steps will also delete all data associated with the built-in Administrator account – please ensure data associated with the built-in Admin is backed up prior to performing the steps.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Please keep in mind the following actions will disable Go Back:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Refresh</span></strong><span> </span></li><li><strong><span>Reset</span></strong><span> </span></li><li><strong><span>Disk Cleanup (if it touched Windows.old or $windows.~bt)</span></strong><span>
</span></li><li><strong><span>Manually deleting files within Windows.old or $windows.~bt</span></strong><span>
</span></li><li><strong><span>Running on battery (must be plugged in)</span></strong><span> </span>
</li></ul>
<p><strong><span><span>If external device was used during upgrade to store Go Back data – then you must have it to perform a Go Back.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><div>I hope the above information was helpful. Get back to us with the updated status and we will be happy to assist you further.</div>

            Have this issue, there has been no new user accounts created, only the upgraded one exists and that is the one it wants me to remove.<br />
It has the same folder name as the original W7 account in the win.old folder (NB it has spaces and a &amp; sign in username and folder name, but on both the same, if thats an issue)<br />
I tried this restore function from the troubleshooting boot mode aswell with similar result (error but no deets).<br />
How can I delete this account when it is the only account on the pc, and without losing files and settings??<br />
Better if I can just resolve this issue rather than deleting the account though.<br />

    <title>What is System Volume Information&#63; How do I get rid of it&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gian jay aberin  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is System Volume Information&#63; How do I get rid of it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So, I probably&nbsp;have the same question as all of you guys. "What is System Volume Information?" "Why is it sitting in my stick?" "Why is its attributes hidden?" Well, here's my possible theory of it. System Volume Information contains a file called IndexerVolumeGuid.
 If you look at the type, the type is JoniCOuupoon. If you didn't know what is it, here is what it is (Text taken from
<em>&lt;URL of Spyhunter-pushing site removed&gt;)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>J</strong><strong>oniCoupon</strong> is an adware program responsible for ads and coupons displayed in web browsers Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. It is often deceptively installed and offers features that can attract people. However, adware
 run activities that compromise your security and privacy. JoniCoupon tracks your web browsing and collects information about your computer system, location, websites that you visit and so on. This information is often shared among promoters and is eventually
 accessed by third parties that can use it with malicious purpose. As a result, your identity might be stolen and used for illegal activities. JoniCoupon is often installed in a tricky but legitimate way. It comes bundled with free programs that you download
 and is set for automatic installation unless you disable this option. Your anti-virus software is not designed to block legitimate and non-malicious adware programs. These programs cannot hurt your computer system like viruses, but they present a threat to
 your security and privacy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now you know what it is, but how do you get rid of it? Well, that's the problem I have as well. I can't get rid of the file myself. But the files it drops in your stick? Just go into the properties of your stick and scan it. System Volume Information
 will stay undetected, though. Even I'm not sure of how to remove that file. Please leave your suggestions of how to remove the file in the comment section, and maybe even a few tips to avoid downloading it. Help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Word and Excel 2019 automatically opens upon startup</h2>
                    <p>I have installed ms office 2019 two days ago. Now, I see that an empty word file is open when I startup my computer. Then it closes itself?</p>
<p>Is this a virus?</p>

            Hi 
<br />
<br />Doesn't sound like a virus. 
<br />
<br />Try these options...
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesnâ€:tm:t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that youâ€:tm:ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.
<br />
<br />Still not working?
<br />
<br />Try this work around.
<br />
<br />	Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; sign-in options
<br />	Scroll down to Privacy 
<br />
<br />	Toggle off
<br />
<br />	Use my sign-in info to automatically finish setting up my device after an update or restart. 
<br />
<br />Still not working?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: shell:startup
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Look if Word and Excel shortcuts are in that folder, select them then click Delete.       
        </p>

<p>Thanks very much for this solution. I have already tried the offline and online repair options but it didn't fix the issue. However, the following has apparently solved the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall MS Office =&gt; Restart =&gt; Install MS Office =&gt; Restart</p>

</p><p>He's tried pressing f5 as I suggested, but he cannot access safe mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to go and have a look at the computer tomorrow, and am wondering if anyone knows of any fixes for this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have level 2 IT knowledge, so comprehend fairly complex proceedings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>He wants to save all his data, could you please suggest what can be done?</p>

            Hi pwindsor
<br />
<br />Start your father's PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<h2>            Windows Update Stuck at 0&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I've been looking for an answer as to why Windows Update has decided to freeze up a 0% for the past month, and I've heavily researched and tried all of the following procedures over the past week to alleviate Windows Update of this bug:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I. Run the Microsoft Fix It for Windows Update</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">Result: <strong><em>Service registration is missing or corrupt</em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">Nothing changed, started to research "Service registration is missing or corrupt"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">II. Executing the following commands in an Administrator Command Prompt:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>net stop bits</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>net stop cryptSvc</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>net stop msiserver</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">...deleting the the files from C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution...</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>net start wuauserv</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>net start bits</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>net start cryptSvc</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>net start msiserver</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">Nothing changed</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">III. Following the same procedure as above but instead of deleting the files in SoftwareDistribution renaming a couple folders:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">Nothing changed</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">IV. Running: <strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 90px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 60px">So I decided to take a look at the log: <strong>findstr /c:"[SR]" %windir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log &amp;gt;"%userprofile%\Desktop\sfcdetails.txt"</strong></p>

            Thank you Thofikh for your timely response. I have tried disabling my default AV software in the past, which is Windows Defender, but to no avail. I just tried your advice and I cannot set the startup type to automatic. Instead I was able to follow your
 note and hit start on the Windows Installer service, but Windows Update still hasn't budged. Any other suggestions?

            <p>Update: I tried using a USB Windows 10 media disc to "upgrade" in order to repair the system files but keep my files and apps. This time when I ran
<em><strong>sfc /scannow </strong></em>I got&nbsp;<em><strong>Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>A step in the right direction I suppose.</p>

            <p>Sorry for not clarifying. After reinstalling Windows 10 - more specifically the kind of reinstall that does
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOT</span></em> affect files or apps - the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command doesn't find any corrupted files or "<strong>integrity violations</strong>" any longer, and the
<strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong>&nbsp;command also returns with no errors, but the Microsoft Fix It app for Windows Update still outputs&nbsp;<strong><em>Service registration is missing or corrupt.</em></strong><br />
</p>
<p>I got some help from an online chat and a remote connection with Microsoft Answer Tech last night, and at first they ran a batch file, which just ended up being a compilation of things I had already tried in an elevated command prompt. You can take a look
 at the batch file here: <a href="http://pastebin.com/JCkiNfvz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="WindowsUpdate.bat">
<strong>http://pastebin.com/JCkiNfvz</strong></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The batch file didn't help at all, and then restarting some windows services didn't help at all, and eventually the Answer Tech just got on Internet Explorer and downloaded the packages from Microsoft Update Catalog. He installed
 the updates manually. Once the computer restarted, the updates that used to be in the Windows Update download queue were gone. But this morning I woke up, checked for Windows Updates, and now there is another update (just a common Windows Defender definition
 update), and it still won't install through Windows Update just like the rest of them.
</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I don't want to install every single update manually from here on out, so I'm still seeking help on my buggy Windows Update.</p>

            Right&nbsp; click the Big Windows partition and select Shrink. <br />
<br />
Shrink it to 100 gb. <br />
<br />
You then have a bit under 400gb Unallocated space.<br />
<br />
Rightt click the Unallocated space and create a New simple volume - select the entire amount and quick format as NTFS. The drive letter it offers by default should be fine.<br />
<br />
If you already had 3 partitions on the drive ( you might as there may be a couple put on there by the OEM, you will actually be creating an Extended partition( It will have a Green border ).
<br />
<br />
Windows always makes the 4th partition an Extended.<br />
<br />
You can make further sub divisions inside that - called Logical drives - in exactly the same way.<br />
<br />
Rt click the new approx 300gb partition/ Logical drive you just created and select shrink - select 100gb<br />
<br />
You will then have about 200gb Free space. Rt click that and create a new Simple Volume of 100gb - Quick Format to ntfs and accept the drive letter.<br />
<br />
Then create another Logical drive from the remaining 100gb.

                    <span>
<p><strong>Hello my name is Ricardo and I'm having some issues with the XFX nVidia GeForce 6200 256MB graphics card while running Windows 7 in it. The computer seems to crash after a while or when trying to play a video file. There's no error message, it just
 crashes. The first symptom is a low performance in the mouse response, cursor moves too slow across the screen. Then the screen flashes a couple of times and then remains with stripes and dots all over it. Finally the screen turns black. Sometimes, if the
 crash is no too severe, my desktop refreshes and a pop-up message says: Driver nVidia Geforce 197.... has stopped working.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I checked, microsoft website and it says the nVidia Geforce 6200 256MB is fully compatible with Windows 7. I also tryed different drivers, clean driver installation and even the manufacturer of the card couldn't give me a solution to my problem.</strong></p>
<p><strong>My specs are:</strong></p>
<p><strong>AMD Sempron 2600+ mhZ</strong></p>
<p><strong>1GB RAM DDR400</strong></p>
<p><strong>SATA Hard Drive 180GB</strong></p>
<p><strong>nVidia Geforce 6200 256MB</strong></p>
<p><strong>PC-CHIPS A31G V1.0 motherboard</strong></p>
<p><strong>(I've updated the system bios, all other devices' drivers are updated as well)</strong></p>

<p>HI Ricar2009,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p><span>"when I use the Microsoft WDDM drivers that are the default one, the aero experience is much better, practically freezes-free"</span></p>
<p><span>When the Compatibility Center said it was OK, it also stated no other software was needed. This&nbsp;means&nbsp;it's Plug and Play.</span></p>
<p><span>Using the custom driver from nVidia seems to be causing some issues, as they may be conflicting with another program.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest performing a clean boot to see if a startup program may be causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>What size power supply are you using?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>The single Gig of RAM can&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;cause that issue when using resource intensive&nbsp;applications.</span></p>
<p><span>The&nbsp;</span><span>RAM</span><span>&nbsp;has
 to write back and forth to the hard drive, causing enough delay to stress the video card driver as it tries to buffer videos, games, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>This would also&nbsp;explain&nbsp;the slowing of the&nbsp;mouse, as the computer is&nbsp;stumbling&nbsp;to keep up.</span></p>
<p><span>Startup programs run in the background, and can eat up immense amounts of resources.</span></p>
<p><span>Programs can sometimes have memory leaks that will cause this as well.</span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest upgrading your RAM, if possible, if the clean boot doesn't help.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />

            <p>If the issue persists you could try to capture a user mode dump of the crash and see if any further useful information can be obtained on the crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can configure Windows to create user-mode dumps. Create a System Restore Point first.<br />
<br />
If you copy and paste the following in Notepad and save as a .reg file (save with the .reg extension and give it any name such as iedump.reg), then right-click the .reg file and select "Merge" to add to the registry, a .dmp file&nbsp;at the time iexplore.exe crashes&nbsp;should
 be created in the C:\CrashDumps folder:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\iexplore.exe]<br />
"DumpFolder"=hex(2):43,00,3a,00,5c,00,43,00,72,00,61,00,73,00,68,00,44,00,75,\<br />
00,6d,00,70,00,73,00,00,00<br />
</strong></em><br />
<br />
After Internet Explorer (iexplore.exe) crashes, can you then make the .dmp file&nbsp;available (provide link)&nbsp;via a public folder on&nbsp;OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link on using OneDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>More info on collecting user-mode dumps:</p>

<p>
</p><p>To stop the creation of the user mode dump files run the following registry file:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>[-HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps\iexplore.exe]</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can delete the C:\CrashDumps folder anytime.</p>

            I may have found the answer! I chatted with Microsoft support. Try this:<br />
<br />
When you try the knowledgebase article, you have to run the command prompt as the administrator.<br />
I assumed my computer would do this since there is only one user account and that is me, running as the administrator.<br />
That doesn't work with the command prompt.<br />
So...<br />
When going to Start-&gt;accessories, right click on the command prompt and 'run as administrator'<br />
Now follow the rest of the knowledge base article and it should remove the token.<br />
Reinstall and voila!<br />
<br />
Good luck!

    <title>Issues with Local Users and Domain - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Issues with Local Users and Domain</h2>
                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>New to all of this so apologies if I get some terminology wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently in the process of trying to change the settings for the primary user account for a Windows 10 PC, but it would appear that the PC was a part of a domain which has restricted access to a lot of these settings. I do not have access to the domain
 itself or its controller ( I believe it has been decommissioned) so I would like to create a new local user account to get around this, and copy the original profile to this new one, as I am lead to believe that if I disconnect the original user from the domain
 I will lose access to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a new local user, but upon trying to login to it I am receiving the error "we cant sign you in with this credential because your domain isn't available". I am unsure where to go from here, as I would have thought that a newly created local
 account would not be a part of any domain. Any help is appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            Alright, try booting into Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />1. Start your Windows 10 machine, and quickly shut it down before it reaches or if it is at boot screen. Do this two times repeatedly.
<br />
<br />2. On the third time, Windows 10 will automatically display 'Your PC couldn't start properly' message. Now press Esc key for recovery options.
<br />
<br />3. Then under Choose an option screen, click Troubleshoot option and now click Advanced options option.
<br />
<br />4. Under Advanced options screen, click Startup Settings.
<br />
<br />5. In Startup Settings screen, you need to click Restart.
<br />
<br />6. After restart, press F4 or 4 to boot into Safe Mode.
<br />

            Hi Assistant 
<br />
<br />From your description, that PC is not new and was originally part of a company domain?
<br />
<br />If that is the case, your best option is to clean install Windows 10 on that PC to remove all the domain related settings on that PC . .. 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>
</p><p>Since the release of w8 I have read many posts comparing w7 and w8 via the task manager's cpu usage display, concluding that w8, and now w8.1, have lower performance that w7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read an article last year that indicated w8 includes more process stuff in the cpu usage calculation. And therefore this comparison was not useful.</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Microsoft seemed to hit full stride with Windows 7, developing a fast and efficient operating system. And with Windows 8 it continues to build on that pattern as we found it to be on par with and occasionally faster than 7.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The improvements that have been made to startup and shutdown times are self-evident, and no doubt a major focus on the new OS' development as this will particularly benefit laptop and tablet users. Another notable improvement was
 in multimedia performance. Most of the tests saw little to no difference between the two operating systems. This was especially true for the gaming benchmarks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Both AMD and Nvidia seem to be on top of the drivers for Windows 8, as we were able to achieve the same level of performance in Windows 8 as we did in Windows 7 using the GeForce GTX 670 and the Radeon HD 6570.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">From a performance standpoint Windows 8 appears to offer a solid foundation from the get-go. Although there are only a few select areas where it is faster than Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Looking beyond benchmarks, Windows 8 appears more polished than Windows 7, Windows 8 is faster than Windows 7 in some aspects such as startup time, shut down time, wake up from sleep, multimedia performance, web browsers performance,
 transferring large file and Microsoft excel performance but it is slower in 3D graphic performance and high resolution gaming performance. The metro style apps needs to consume more space and memory. Battery life in Windows 8 has improved enough to be noticeable.
 Moreover Windows 8 is significantly more secure than Windows 7 and it is basically designed to take advantage of touch screens while Windows 7 is only for desktops. For Windows 8/8.1, we need better configurations such as RAM, Hard disk space, processor speed,
 etc. If you are using Windows 7 on an older computer, then you have to upgrade your hardware to run windows 8.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 64 bit no longer recognizes seagate external drive</h2>
                    
<p>I have a seagate external drive which is about 6 months old, worked beautifully on all 3 laptops until yesterday. &nbsp;used it in the afternoon but in the evening, when i went to retrieve something, nothing, nil, nada, gone. &nbsp;it asks me to format because it's
 not partitioned and i said no becuase i did not want to lose 4 years worth of photos etc, try it on laptop no2, same thing and with laptop no3. &nbsp;panic sets in so i do a system restore to previous morning. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>drive shows up and i start copying everything onto disk, i manage to get 1/4 of 800gb copied before it disappears again. &nbsp;i have tried every solution i can find on the internet and nothing. &nbsp;the drive itself is fine, it still lights up, vibrates etc but
 the laptops just will not recognize it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i do not have the money to pay for ridiculously high priced data retrieval software and every document, form, photo and video from the last 4 years is on that drive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i need to get that data off the drive and onto my laptop/dvds/cds</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check the external drive for any errors and see if the issue gets fixed.</span></p>

I do NOT see the steps you have tried already. This is a user forum and patience is much appreciated. Also prior to saying "tried everything" it makes sense to list out some steps which you've ACTUALLY tried which makes others to answer your question easily.</p>
<p>Note that none of us can *SEE* what the actual problem is with your computer, etc without you giving away the required information.</p>
<p>My 2 cents!</p>
<p>Your best bet would be use a data recovery tool (Acronis works fine for me) as suggested by Dena, backup the contents, format the disk and start using it.</p>

            There is the possibility that the Windows 7 has a "malware" that is causing this problem.&nbsp; The first thing to do is to try the drive on a different system, preferably not a Windows 7.&nbsp; If you see the drive, complete your file "copy" and then scan the drive
 for "infections."&nbsp; Also, you should then immediately install the Seagate diagnostics and check the drive.<br />

            <p>I too am having the same issue except I've never even had a chance to store anything on the drive. I received my drive brand new for christmas, and windows is not detecting it at all. I have plugged it into 3 machines, 2 were windows xp, and 1 was windows
 7. About 30 seconds after I plug the drive in the lights turn on but nothing happens afterward. This has been the same as all 3 computers. I don't see how I can run diagnostics on, check for errors, relabel, or manually launch an installer on a drive that
 cannot be seen or accessed. This is just unacceptable from a reputable brand name like seagate and the formal tech support has been just atrocious. It seems that support doesn't understand what "drive is not recognized" really means. It means: AutoPlay does
 not execute, it does not try to auto install it's drivers. It means that it does not display in device manager as a mass storage device and it is not viewable in (My) Computer with a labelled drive letter. The lights&nbsp;on the drive merely light up, and nothing
 more.&nbsp;I hope this helps you understand the situation from a consumer perspective.

Did you ever find a solution to the problem? I have been having the same problem with a replacement drive GoFlex 2tb after the original was doing as you describe. So two GoFlex drives, hours with tech support, re-installation of drivers, re-installation of
 Win 7 Pro 64, removal of all usb devices and drivers in safe-mode and re-populating the driver cache ALL TO NO AVAIL. So on to the third GoFlex Drive and another replacement warranty cost of twenty bucks for sending the unit back with expediated shipping...In
 addition all backup is GONE. Anything work for you?

 is connected fine and I get a white light connection. &nbsp;But the Seagate drives says "Source not available" for backups (or the inavailability to do them) and the Seagate GoFlex 2TB is not visible in My Computer. &nbsp;I can see the GoFlex under my Network but only
 the media player is visible (none of my backup files), as I thought maybe I could connect in that way. &nbsp;I have Malwarebytes, Threatfire, Avira, and Advanced System Care installed on my Windows 7 OS. &nbsp;I update my Win Update automatically and every time I boot,
 I run CCleaner. &nbsp;Weekly, I update and run Malwarebytes and the other scans. &nbsp;So, I don't think it is any problems with invasion. &nbsp;But, how can I run any diagnostics on the drive that I can

            This Seagate access problem seems to be a Seagate issue. &nbsp;Most other users that own a Seagate driver have not experienced this problem regularly. The Seagate forums will provide a more complete solution "path" for these type of problems.

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>After a couple of weeks of following tons of advice and doing everything I knew to do as I listed above I resolved the goflex not found or accessible issue by
</p>
<p>Noting the "GENERIC VOLUMNES" listed in device manager that had exclaimation points. There were several. I double clicked and went to driver device details to find out: what these drivers were and who built them</p>
<p>Each of them listed under description of the driver a DRIVER FILE Something like NCVol. sys which I traced back to NERO BACKUP drivers on my machine. I deleted all of these drivers in device manager</p>
<p>Next&nbsp;I went back to the windows system32 folder/drivers and gained administrative control and deleted the Nero backup drivers that were noted under descriptions in driver details.</p>
<p>WHAT I BELIEVE HAPPENED IN MY CASE IS THAT THE PROPER DRIVERS COULD NOT BE LOADED AS CONTROL OVER THE DRIVES WAS BY THE IMPROPERLY LOADED NERO DRIVERS. WHEN I DELETED THEM THE DRIVERS WERE ABLE TO LOAD.</p>
<p>Instantly when I again refreshed the device manager my lost usb drives showed up and ran perfect EXCEPT:</p>
<p>AND THIS IS THE REALLY BIG EXCEPT AND CAUTION:</p>
<p>I left to pick up my daughter and when I returned my machine had shut itself down presumably because of&nbsp; BSOD and could not restart. BIOS would load&nbsp; and hand off to WINDOWS 7 to the point of loading the device drivers and then it would blue screen and no
 matter what I did I could not get that to change.</p>
<p>So while I fixed one problem I created a bigger one. Eventually I again formated and did a clean new re-install of Windows 7 and spent the manditory day and one-half reloading everything and talking to support trying to get resolution of re-installs of software
 I own when the licenses allow only one install and then they want you to buy it again.</p>
<p>So if there is a software engineer out there that can explain how to get rid of drivers that are corrupt or preventing the proper drivers from loading without toasting the operating system it would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Anyhow the Seagate tech support was wonderful although I was able to figure out the problem just before engaging them to help. They read my forums, contacted me and offered to help. They RMAed two drives and refunded my costs of doing that. I have solved
 my problem and am signing off with this post. Thanks to all....</p>

    <title>Console freezes while loading dashboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sugaredquill368  say:</h3>
<h2>            Console freezes while loading dashboard</h2>
                    
<p>For the past couple of weeks my console freezes when I turn it on whil e it is trying to load the dashboard. It gets past the XBox splashscreen, but freezes while the spinning double circle is on the screen (prior to the actual dashboard menu actually coming
 up). I have a XBox 360 S, with just the 4GB of memory (no hard drive). Even after it freezes, the controller still communicates with the console and the Kinect sensor starts up. Also, if I eject the tray while the console is off and close it before it freezes,
 it will load the game and I can play the game fine (no freezing during the game). So it seems to only be a problem with the loading of the dashboard. Also, I do not get the RROD, the lights on the console stay green.&nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response. I wish I could clear the cache as that seems like a good solution. Unfortunately, I can not get to the dashboard to get to System Settings to clear the cache. Anyone know of another way to do that.</p>
<p>The screen freezing solution suggested I move my console so that it is clear around it, however it already is clear around it. Then it suggested I clear my cache, which I wish I could do.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>Hey mate, I know you can't log into the dashboard from the get-go, so for the following question, let's operate with the understanding that you're accessing the dashboard through the method described above. So, when you try and access the dashboard, are
 you signed in to a profile via the option in the guide menu? Also, have you tried signing into a different profile to access the dashboard with?</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion. I used the guide menu and signed out of my account. I then was able to access the dashboard. I cleared the cache and signed back into my user account and it froze again without loading the dashboard.</p>
<p>I tried signing out again and got to the dashboard. I then signed in under my wife's profile which is not connected with an XBox Live account and was able to access the dashboard still. However, as soon as I sign into my profile or restart the console the
 dashboard freezes.</p>

<p>Okay, from the dashboard, you'll want to access 'Memory,' and then delete the account which is freezing the system (delete the PROFILE ONLY). Then try recovering the account, and let us know if that works!</p>

<p>Deleted profile and recovered account and now it doesn't exactly freeze, but it still doesn't load the dashboard. It sits on the screen with the two white circles spinning in the center (where it previously froze), but they just keep spinning. It pops up
 and says that I am signed into xbox live and I can use the remote to bring up the guide while the circles are spinning, but it doesn't ever load the dashboard for my account. I left it sit for about 5 minutes with no change.</p>

<p>This is certainly odd. Okay, can you try taking any and all remaining data tied to the profile (such as game saves) and back them up on a USB thumbdrive configured for use with Xbox 360? After that, try deleting the profile entirely, recover it, and try
 again.</p>

<p>That's close but I want really want to make it available offline. I do not have that option on the file I want. Is it possible to extend local help with TechNet or MSDN help&nbsp;articles? I want to make the command line reference available locally. Type command
 reference into the search bar in local help to see what I am talking about. Is it possible to find extended content that contains MSDN content&nbsp;to install to local help?</p>

<p>I have used that option before. It seems&nbsp;I would need to use the windows AIK to change anything in help topics and would make this more a TechNet forum discussion instead. Unless their is a way to extend local help with html files?</p>

<h2>            Currys &#124; Getting Scared&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Right, I pre ordered (Online) my <strong>Xbox One</strong> day one edition with free Fifa from
<strong>Currys</strong> on the <strong>7th September</strong>, paid in full and got confirmation of my order with an order number (not a tracking number). I still haven't received and email saying its going to be dispatched and its
<em>7 hours from launch</em>. I did call them on Tuesday and the lady said that they will message me when they dispatch it..<br />
<br />
Is anyone else in the same place with <strong>Currys</strong>? I want it!!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think we are all panicking a bit, I have been all month, first it was will the cash come out, second was why hasn't it shipped yet, then why haven't they updated the shipping info all day and tomorrow I'll panic I've missed the delivery every time I go
 to the loo or something. It's a lot of money and a big thing to order and wait for, I think you'll be ok it might be curry's aren't gonna update anything until the morning, try and relax, I'm sure it'll show up.

<p>Everyone is excited, even me, but what bugs me is these threads.</p>
<p>People panic that it ain't gonna arrive, your firstly relying on the company to ship, your then relying on the courier to complete delivery. &nbsp;For most I'd be more worried about the courier completing the delivery - things do get lost sometimes.</p>
<p>If you really wanted it that bad and are that hyped about it, you would have pre-ordered in a store which was doing midnight launch.</p>

<p>[/quote]That's because they are usually the same trolls using different tags. That "what do you like to eat while gaming" thread made the most recent troll, has been done at least 10 times over the years. Every time by some troll using a throw away account.
 Obviously, he needs some new material.</p>
