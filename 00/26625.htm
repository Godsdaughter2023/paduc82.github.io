<h2>            Moving groups created in Entourage&#58;mac &#40;Office 2004&#41; to Apple Mail &#40;OS Lion&#41;</h2>
                    I was running Entourage from Office 2004 on my (2007) iMac.&nbsp; I have just bought a new Macbook Pro, with Office 2011.&nbsp; The computer store was able to move all of my individual contacts from the old machine to my new machine's address book, but they could
 not move the groups.&nbsp; They moved all of the groups to a single rtf file, which I can only get at through TextEdit.&nbsp; I can't figure how to take that content and turn it into groups in my address book.&nbsp; I have a lot of groups.&nbsp; What I can do?&nbsp; Do I have to buy
 Office 2008 and install on my old machine?

            Office 2011 will import from and Entourage 2004 Identity.&nbsp; If you put your Identity on the new computer, Outlook should import your groups. I would do this in a new Identity so you don't bring over duplicate info. You can then export the data you want
 and import into your Outlook Main Identity.

            Outlook will import from&nbsp;Entourage 2004 even H&amp;S. Have you tried it in a new Identity?&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>It sounds like you are thinking of exporting groups from 04. That can be done but requires you have&nbsp;Entourage 2004 installed. If you don't know anyone with&nbsp;Entourage 2004, you can contact me. I offer services to export&nbsp;Entourage 2004 data for users that
 moved to Lion.

<p>Hi BackieManiphone,</p>
<p>Firstly, could you let us know if you have installed other Office suite such as Office 2010 on your computer? If so, we need to install the Office desktop in advance, you can have a look at this article:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Set-up-Office-2010-desktop-programs-to-work-with-Office-365-for-business-3324b8b8-dceb-45e2-ac24-c642720108f7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set up Office 2010 desktop programs to work with Office 365 for business</a></p>
<p>Although we can set up Office 2010 desktop programs to work with Office 365 business, side-by-side installations of MSI and Click-to-Run versions of Office 2013 are not supported and recommended. Here is an article for your reference:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2753630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2753630</a></p>
<p>If not, for this issue, could you try the following steps and check the outcome?<br />
Enable automatic setting detection in Internet Explorer (IE)<br />
1. Open IE, click <strong>Tools</strong> (or gear icon on the top of IE), and then click<strong> Internet options.</strong><br />
2. In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Connections</strong> tab, and then click
<strong>LAN settings.</strong><br />
3. In the <strong>Local Area Network (LAN)</strong> Settings dialog box, select the
<strong>Automatically detect settings</strong> check box, and then click<strong> OK.</strong><br />
If the issue persists, you may need to update the proxy server address. To do this, in the
<strong>Local Area Network (LAN</strong>) Settings dialog box, under <strong>Proxy server</strong>, select Use a<strong> proxy server for your LAN</strong>, and then input a valid proxy server address (you can get this from the administrator).</p>
<p>Check to untick the option "Warn if changing between secure and not secure mode" from your Internet Explorer (IE)
<br />
1. Open IE, click <strong>Tools</strong> (or gear icon on the top of IE), and then click
<strong>Internet options.</strong><br />
2. In the <strong>Internet Options</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.<br />
3. In the <strong>Settings</strong> dialog box, select the <strong>Security</strong> section, and then untick
<strong>Warn if changing between secure and not secure mode</strong>.</p>
<p>If the issue isn’t solved after performing the methods above, please let me know the following information for further research:<br />
1. Does the issue happen to the other users in your company?<br />
2. What if you change to another network environment and computer?<br />
3. Have you tried other browsers to see if this issue occur?</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Kerwin</p>

            This will not be fixed by an online repair of Office because the problem is not with Office. That the same thing is happening in Notepad tells me that the problem is either with Windows, with your printer, or the connection.
<br />
<br />When you say you can print PDF docs, do you mean you can print to pdf or that you can print (on your printer) current pdf files?

            I agree to Charles K.   and in addition check also the printer itself. It can be possible that the black ink is empty but the printer mix black using all colors if you print coloured.<br /><br />Andreas.

<h2>            MSN incoming emails recently inconsistent &#40;never arrive&#47;not visible&#47;very late&#41;</h2>
                    I've had an msn.com email account for at least 10-15 years, in the last couple of months I have noticed that incoming emails are spotty and untrustworthy. If I log in on a desktop, it claims I only have about 200 emails, but according to my iPhone I have
 thousands, which is more accurate (yes, I have fallen behind in cleaning out the spam). This is particularly troublesome when I have asked for a password reset, verification code, or other critical info to be sent to my email - it rarely shows up (no it's
 not in Junk) or is extremely late (days or weeks). Have I been hacked or has Microsoft changed some setting or function that has recently made my email almost useless?

            <div><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you for getting back to me so quickly! And I apologize in advance for the nebulous observations, if I could pinpoint something, it would be so much easier to fix. The heart of this problem, in itself, is the erratic behavior.<br />
</span></div>
<ul>
<li>What was your last activity when this issue happened?
<ul>
<li>I could not tell you. It's inconsistent. It wasn't like a switch that called attention to itself, I didn't even realize it was happening. It only became obvious when someone had asked me about an email I neglected to respond to, when confirmation
 emails didn't immediately appear after purchases, and when requests for password hints and resets never showed up.&nbsp;</li></ul>
</li><li>Any changes that took place in your computer before this issue occurred?
<ul>
<li>No. And not limited to one computer. Both my work and home computers (desktops) state I have a mere fraction of emails than what my iPhone suggests. And while I know the numbers of stored emails on my phone are more accurate, no new emails are
 appearing there either.&nbsp;</li></ul>
</li><li>Which browser are you using to access your MSN emails? Have you tried other browsers?
<ul>
<li>I typically use Chrome, although I have checked and I get the same results on IE and Edge</li></ul>
</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?
<ul>
<li>Not much. Don't even know where to begin. I did look at other threads regarding Outlook/email trouble and checked my settings. I certainly haven't changed anything. And it doesn't appear that any of the option settings should result in the problems
 I am seeing. </li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>One interesting note, on one particular email I was waiting for (and initially assumed was never sent) did appear approximately two weeks later (honestly, I can't give you specifics because I stopped checking every day after the first several days) but had
 the original email date and time on it as if it had been there all along.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Let's work together to resolve your case Reema. Please follow the steps below to further isolate the issue:
<br />
<br />
1. Clear the cache, and cookies of your browsers. <br />
2. Enable javascript in your web browser. <br />
3. Disable pop-up blocking. <br />
4. Many security programs includes "ad-blocking" protection. Go through your security programs currently running and check &amp; disable any ad-blocking feature, web blocking, etc. feature.
<br />
<br />
After that, perform a <span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>clean boot</strong></a></span></span><strong>.
</strong>It will start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and start up programs. Also, it helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program, or an update, or when you run a program in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, please check if you will receive all your emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. <br />

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>very randomly users get the above error while trying to print from Word, Outlook and even Excel. when it happens i get them to close all office applications and open them back up. Without fail it prints fine and they are good again for a long time.</p>
<p>All users are have Windows 7 Ent 64bit and Office 2007 pro SP2 the printer models are HP2320 and HP4015 using the 'HP Universal Printing PCL 6' Driver. The printers are hosted on Windows Server 2008 Std SP2 and the error happens randomly to anyone using
 those printers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have googled this error and have yet to find a solution to this problem and the only thing i could do it to set the printer up with the printer specific driver but i would rather fix the issue than to work around it.</p>

<p>HP has a web site where it offers beta drivers to address paricular issues. Whether there is one for your setup I don't know - but take a look at<a href="http://www.hp.com/pond/ljbeta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hp.com/pond/ljbeta/</a></p>

<p>Thanks Graham, this would be a good option but they don't have a beta driver for windows 7 64 or Server 2008. did a quick search for beta win 7 drivers for HP printers but nothing.</p>
<p>another interesting fact is when this error occurs you can go to the printer under properties and still print a test page.... to me that would indicate an issue with Word 2007 rather than the printer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my guess is that when you open Word, outllook(using word), it loads the printer settings for your list of printers then for some reason its loosening connection to the printer and so loosing the setting so that when you print next time it gives your this
 error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The test i did was, the user with the error clicked OK and then minimized Word. I then got them to print a test page from the printer properties that printed fine. I then got them to remove the printer and add it again and then maximized word and tried to
 print, this time there was no errors but the job was never set to the printer... after closing word and opening it back up it printed fine.</p>
<p>Dose this make sense to anyone?</p>

            Nope, not an HP problem.&nbsp; It just happened to my wife with our Brother printer.&nbsp; Furthermore, when it occurs, it happens with *any* printer you choose.&nbsp; Thus, she is currently experiencing it with an Epson and even with Adobe's PDF maker.<br />
<br />
The problem is most definitely Microsoft's.<br />
<br />
Thanks for trying, though.<br />

            Having the same exact problem. Any quick fix on this? I tried reinstalling the printer driver but I keep on running in the same error everytime I try to print a document on MS Word 2007. Weird thing is that test page works fine. I also reinstalled Office,
 it didn't help. Printer brand is Xerox. I was thinking it has to do with Windows Update, I'm yet to find out I just updated my computer to SVC pack 1 and installed all the necessary Office updates. I'm running Windows 7 on a 64-bit machine. Help is much appreciated.

                    <p>Original title : Internet Explorer 10 on Windows 8 totally dead. Opens, but everything blank.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't remember at what point this problem started happening, because I usually use Chrome or Firefox, but one day recently I discovered Internet Explorer 10 on my Windows 8 machine was not working, even though it has been on the laptop since I bought it
 last December and I have had no problems till now.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have followed every idea and procedure I can find to fix this problem, but nothing works. Whether I open IE from the Windows 8 page or the taskbar on the desktop it makes no difference.<span>&nbsp;
</span>No web pages open, the home page doesn't open, nothing shows on the address bars, and on the tools menu everything is greyed out except File and Safety.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can open Tools by right-clicking the iExplore icon in Program Files, and I have checked all the usual suspects - Active-X, plug-ins, extensions, etc, and everything seems normal. I have downloaded Windows Updates and re-started the computer. Nothing
 works! What do I need to try next?</p>

Something is blocking IE, maybe even some Policies.&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens if you boot in&nbsp;safe mode?&nbsp; Also, compare what happens with a different account, especially the Administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FWIW even when I start IE this way, which is designed to cause some of the symptoms that you are reporting, it is not as severe as you describe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Run... (e.g. press Win-R and enter:)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>iexplore.exe&nbsp; -nohome&nbsp; -extoff</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, I think it would be interesting to know whether you are getting the second task even started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could check with Task Manager Processes tab or use this command pipeline in Powershell</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get-WmiObject Win32_Process | where-object&nbsp; {$_.CommandLine&nbsp; -match "iexplore" } | ft ProcessId, CommandLine&nbsp; -AutoSize</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FWIW even with the above constrained way of starting IE I see 2 tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good point Bob.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also having Err 0xE00001BB syncing issues, and I used one of the suggested workarounds to salvage my work; but it was only one section I had to re-create and copy, not an entire notebook, and I've only really been using OneNote seriously for a few months.
 If I had to copy &amp; recreate an entire notebook, I think I'd just give up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Too often, many of the so-called solutions offered here are trite and ill-informed. They may work, but as you say, it's a sledgehammer approach when what we need is a bit more technical insight &amp; precision. Isn't it time Microsoft stopped relying on 'communities'
 of well-intentioned amateurs and started providing its subscribers with a proper technical support system?

    <title>PST &#38; OLM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tumberry  say:</h3>
<h2>            PST &#38; OLM</h2>
                    <p>I have tried adding PST and an OLM on separate occasions, to check if it could be used like in Windows, wherein the pst gets updated automatically, so when you want to transfer or make a backup, you just locate the .pst file and transfer/backup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But i found out that in Outlook for mac 2011, this does not happen. I even quit Outlook and moved/deleted the original file, but when i opened Outlook it opened successfully, and i could still see the archive files. In windows the same would result in an
 error message saying file cannot be found, please provide path.</p>
<p>The reason i am trying to make this work is because the export feature for OLM in outlook for mac , does not allow to set a specific date, so it takes everything from day one till date and exports it. So now if add an existing archive mails for one year,
 and start archiving my current mails to my existing archive to top it up, then when i export, it exports everything which includes my exchange mails and my archive mails all in one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any one knows the path in which the original added archive file stays, so i can just copy that file as a backup, instead of doing export everytime i want a backup. ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Old Geek,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Support.&nbsp; I understand you're having some issues with playlists importing from iTunes to Xbox Music.&nbsp; In order to get a better idea of what's going on, I want to go over a few things and see what needs to be done next.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you say it's importing the wrong playlist, can you clarify on what you mean by the wrong playlist?&nbsp; Is it still importing a playlist that's already been deleted?</li><li>Try the following.&nbsp; First, uninstall the Xbox Music App.&nbsp; Open the Run Window and type in %temp% and hit Enter to open up the Windows Temp folder.&nbsp; Highlight and delete everything in the Windows Temp folder.&nbsp; Some files won't delete because they are in
 use; those you can skip.&nbsp; After clear this temp folder reinstall the Xbox Music App.</li></ul>
<p>Feel free to get back to us when you can and we'll go from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Chanh S.</p>

            <p>Tried your suggestion with the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The imported playlist I get are mostly old iTunes Genius playlist but a few were manually created. The playlist that are imported cannot find most of the music files in the playlists. When I received my new Surface Pro 3 I Restored my files from my old Windows
 8.1 PC backup. I installed iTunes and had it load and save the .m4a files in my Music folder. The iTunes on the new PC currently has no playlist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned in earlier post, I've search for all my .wpl and .itl playlist on the new PC and can only find the one in that iTunes created when it was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thought is that it is importing from an old Window Media playlist. However, I thought was a .wpl file.</p>

            <p>Hi Old Geek,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the playlists are coming from iTunes, I'd like to see what happens if you uninstall iTunes completely and remove any iTunes library folders, as well and deleting the iTunes program folder.&nbsp; Additionally, do you have another Windows 8.1 PC you can try
 duplicating this issue on?&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Red underline vanishes when checking spelling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamescollins.26  say:</h3>
<h2>            Red underline vanishes when checking spelling</h2>
                    <p>I've written a piece in Word (Windows 10, 64 bit, 365 subscription, all up to date) and want to check the spelling. This is on auto and so I have words underlined in red (I'm not a good typist). Usually this is fine: right click, autocorrect drop-down appears
 etc. But today I notice that when I right click over a word underlines in red, the red disappears and the AutoCorrect options do not appear. Sometimes it works fine, other times not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: Chekc the spellking is underlined as the words are wrong. I right click on 'chekc' and have the options and use them to correct to check. Fine. I then move onto 'spellking' and as soon as I right click over the word, the red line goes, the options
 don't show up and Word thinks my incorrect word is correct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why dos this happen? I am using the same Logitech keyboard as I always do, it's a fairly new one and has no problems that I can see, and Word and my subscription is up to date. I have turned Word off and on again and the problem persists at random.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas of a fix?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I do have Grammarly installed and integrated with Word, and it's a fairly new addition, so I wondered if that might causing this problem?</p>

            <p>Hi Ron</p>
<p>I did as you suggested and ran the repair, but the problem persists. I click over some (not all) red-underlined words and the red immediately vanishes and the spell check options do not appear. If I type a space after the word the red line and options sometimes
 (but not always) return. Other times, I check a couple more and the red underline comes back on it own, but again, not always.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also note that if I run Grammarly before checking the spelling via word, all the red lines go and don't return when I turn Grammarly off - this is why I wonder if it is Grammarly causing the error. I am reluctant to uninstall that programme as a) I've
 paid for it and b) it's otherwise very useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas? This problem is a bit frustrating as it's so hit and miss. But I usualy find it happens at least three or more times in a 1,000 word document.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>James</p>

</p><p>It sounds like it is a 'Grammarly' problem.&nbsp; I assume that the misspelled word are in fact correctly&nbsp; spelled? If not see:

            <p>Thanks. The misspelt words are misspelt when underlined in red, so I right click to bring up the options and the red line vanishes before I can change anything. the misspelt words then appear as if they are correct, i.e., with no underline, and Word leaves
 them as correct when they are not. The red line sometimes returns if I add a space after the word and then delete that (extra) space, someteims they stay non-underlined even though they are correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've contacted Grammarly about the problem as well and wait to hear what they have to say. I understand how to add and remove words from dictionaries and the auto-correct list, but that's not the problem.</p>

<p>Hi again, sorry it’s taken a while to get back on this one. I uninstalled and reinstalled everything and the problem is still there. At first I thought it was because I was using straight quotes instead of smart quotes. I was also finding that sometimes
 the autocorrect of capitalizing the first word of sentences wasn't always working. I went back to smart quotes, and thought that had fixed it all, but then it started happening again and now it’s just the same, so it wasn't that. In fact, now, when I sometimes
 right click on a red underlined word, not only does that underline vanish but so do the following two or three. The red underline comes back if I return to the misspelled word and type in a space after it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, have tried a repair, have tried uninstalling Grammarly so it’s not there and it still happens, and have tried uninstalling Word and putting it back again, still the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you think I should uninstall all of Office 365 and start again? I share my subscription onto a second laptop in the house and that one seems to be working fine.

                    Please could someone help me,&nbsp;I have been struggling for months to rectify this problem.&nbsp; I have installed Office 2010 Professsional on my computer running Vista Basic and every time I open Word or Powerpoint they crash instantly.&nbsp; I have followed the
 processes on this site to repair the Registry, re-name the Normal Template file, disable Add-ins&nbsp;etc, etc but nothing rectifies the problem.&nbsp; I have now identified that if I have a working internet connection when I open the programs that they then crash (if&nbsp;I
 disable the internet connection and open the program it works fine, even if I then enable the connection when the program is open).&nbsp; If someone has encountered this problem before or can offer a solution it would be greatly appreciated.

</p>
<p>Although I am now happy that I can use both Word and Powerpoint, it is still very annoying that one of the built-in program features has created so many problems and wasted time trying to get to state where I can use the programs.&nbsp; If anyone knows of a solution

    <title>My as-it-stands-now &#40;start of 2016&#41; review of Microsoft&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregmalone1  say:</h3>
<h2>            My as-it-stands-now &#40;start of 2016&#41; review of Microsoft&#39;s Windows 10</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">I've just joined the Windows Insider program with the wish to help improve the OS by sharing my findings and observations.
 &nbsp;I'll start my collaboration with a general review of Win10.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">This is my as-it-stands-now review of Microsoft's Windows 10, which was released about 6 months ago. For background,
 I'm a veteran tech person, IT Director, game developer, and educator. I actively use Mac OSX, Android, iOS, and now Windows 10 as my primary work environment. I've also been a Linux systems administrator in previous incarnations. My mobile devices are currently
 Android (Note 4 and Note Pro), after many years of iOS.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">I've decided to come back to Windows -- really, to Microsoft -- which has re-earned my respect after many years away. I
 am still a Mac user (grrrr, even though Apple has become a greedy, heartless, socially irresponsible evil empire -- another topic for another time). Never thought I'd see the day I would come back to Microsoft willingly! Satya Nadella is the best hope for
 Microsoft, since he embraces progressive thinking and is willing to make radical changes at Microsoft, quite unlike his predecessor(s).&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">Anyway with that said, I've been running WIndows 10 on my Mac (via VMWare) for a handful of months, and have recently gotten
 a Surface Pro 4 so I can have native performance in Win 10 for a new game project. In the course of setting up, tweaking and using the SP4/Win10 for the last few weeks, I've gotten a pretty good feel for where things stand with both the OS and the SP4 device.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">What have I learned?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">Overall impression of Win 10 is good and positive -- it's on the right track. I like the gestalt of it all, it's very responsive
 and well thought out, at least by design intention. In reality, at this date at the very start of 2016, Win10 is still a bit "soft and chewy in the middle", i.e. not fully baked, but looks good on the surface and does have depth. It's not "partially baked"
 everywhere, and not substantially, but one definitely bites into raw dough (to continue the metaphor) every dozen bites or so.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">The pros of Win10 are many, which I won't enumerate here, but I do feel that Win10 is suitable and stable enough for production
 use.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">Among the greatest Win10 'cons' is the lack of well developed new-generation applications, i.e. applications built for Win10.
 Microsoft's core apps that come with Win10, e.g. Mail, Calendar, etc, are beautifully conceived, but probably about 70% complete in terms of conventionally expected features. Example, you can't search in the Calendar app. Huh?! Clearly, Microsoft is not a
 search-centric company, yet, despite vast improvements in its Bing domain. What's the use of data if you can't search it -- backwards, forwards, partial terms, full terms, wildcards, yadda, yadda?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">Other 'cons' include the ocassional crashing app, or system and app settings mysteriously being reset, the inability to
 continue playing music while the device's display is off, and a variety of wrinkles that clearly state that this OS is Gen1, a work in progress. Using the Surface Pro 4, even in 'tablet mode' still feels like using a desktop computer rather than a tablet-optimized
 device. But it ain't all that bad, folks, and quite a pleasure to use.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">Let's mention the Windows Store. The Windows Store is no Apple App Store or Google Play Store... not even close. Though
 on light perusal it might appear that the app store has lots of offerings, it doesn't take long to realize that the content is largely light-weight and often amateur or geeky in quality. This issue, I believe, is Microsoft's greatest challenge -- how to get
 good software developers to create exciting content for Windows 10... including in-house developers.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">Yet, Win10, and the lovely Surface Pro 4, are up to snuff enough for serious use by professionals and casual users alike.
 A promising thing one discovers when using Win10 is that Microsoft provides opportunities for user feedback practically everywhere, and one gets the sense that someone behind the curtain is collating all the comments, suggestions and complaints. I wish Microsoft
 would learn from the bad examples of Apple and Google to be more out-front with what they're hearing from users and post some form of development road map, while still protecting their "new stuff" secrets. That alone would truly differentiate Microsoft from
 all the others.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">In the end, I like the trajectory Microsoft has taken with Windows 10, despite the glaring and often subtle issues that
 one discovers almost daily. Curiously, whenever I pick up my Galaxy Note Pro tablet I am immediately struck by how much better Android is than any of the OS's out there, including WIn10. Seriously. The main problem for Android though is that it's parents,
 Google, have made awful strategic errors from the start with Android that will haunt the OS for years to come. Read about it.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">In light of the state of the marketplace, and the predictable slow decline of Apple -- a company that has lost its core
 values and lacks social responsibility despite its vast wealth -- Microsoft is a serious contender to be the latest come-back company. Google, though always showing promise, and with whom I've had much professional experience spanning a couple decades, remains
 generally vague in their intent and less focused on meeting the public's needs, preferring to invest their formidable wealth in their moonshots and ad revenue generation rather than user experience.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">For all of these companies, protection of individual user privacy and user data has yet to be fully demonstrated. I still
 wonder if we'll see a major 'hackopalypse' event some day which makes us all wish we'd paid more attention to these fundamental issues.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">In conclusion, if I was to put my money on who will rise to the top as the leading software, OS and online services provider
 over the next decade, at this point in time, I'd go with Microsoft -- a statement that I'd never expected myself to ever make, but am happy that I now can.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update 1709 breaks Access 2016 mscomctl.ocx</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>it seems that&nbsp;Windows 10 Update 1709 breaks Access 2016 mscomctl.ocx, at least when using greek language.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8eff6843-6b23-43a3-b70b-ae143fe3d9f6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8eff6843-6b23-43a3-b70b-ae143fe3d9f6" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see, even in the simplest form, greek characters are not rendered properly in listview/treeview (design and form view). The same form was working perfectly a couple of hours ago (before applying update).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access 2016 - version 1709 (same with previous version).</p>
<p>mscomctl.ocx - versions 6.1.9839 and 6.1.9846</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can you share your Office build number (File/Account/About Access, it should be something like 16.0.8431.2046)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, can you share the path to your copy of mscomctl.ocx (where it is located on your machine)?</p>

<p>Hi Shane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version 1709 (Build 8528.2139 Click-to-Run)&nbsp; &nbsp;- 16.0.8528.2139<br />
Monthly Channel</p>
<p>
</p><p>c:\Windows\SysWOW64\MSCOMCTL.OCX&nbsp; 6.1.98.46</p>
<p>
</p><p>A strange thing has happened without a good explanation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I applied the windows major update, I was very anxious and the first thing I checked was the particular Access file. Then I noticed that greek characters were mangled in listviews and treeviews.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At that time I was using last month's edition of Office and version&nbsp;<span>6.1.9839.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I made a copy and started to check things (regsvr32 etc). I ended with the configuration stated above.</span></p>
<p><span>This morning I checked again the original edition and found out that it was working fine! The copy still is not working.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So I have two versions of my file, the one works fine, the other has still mangled characters.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If it is of any help I could send you the two copies.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please note that I was affected from August 2017 Windows Update bug with mscomctl.ocx , and I spent a lot time to&nbsp; repair it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks anyhow.</span></p>

    <title>How to print showing the balloons in Track Changes&#47;Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pam55htx  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to print showing the balloons in Track Changes&#47;Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>I hope someone call help me!&nbsp; I am using Word 2010 and I have my Track Changes set to show the revisions in balloons.&nbsp; However, when I go to print, the printed document DOES NOT show the balloons!&nbsp; I have done a lot of searching on the internet and found
 somewhere where someone else was having that same problem and the forum they posted on (I don't remember where it was, but it wasn't here) didn't have an answer.&nbsp; The very strange thing is if you change the size of the document to "legal" (instead of what
 it should be, which is "letter"), then it DOES show the revisions in the balloons off to the side.&nbsp; Also, while playing around with it yesterday, I finally DID get it to print correctly showing the balloons, but now it is back to NOT showing the balloons.&nbsp;
 Can someone please help me????&nbsp; This is very very strange and I'm thinking it may be a glitch in Word 2010.</p>

            <p>How are you printing the document? If you use Quick Print (FilePrintDefault) from a view showing the balloons, or from Print Preview when balloons are displayed, they should print. But if you're using File | Print (or Ctrl+P) to open the Print tab, then
 you have to&nbsp;make sure that "Print Markup"&nbsp;is checked under "Print All Pages."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually, it appears that "Print Markup" is automatically checked in the Print window if you are viewing markup in the document (and is shown in Print Preview), not if you are not.</p>

            <p>I was beginning to think no one would answer (probably because no one has an answer!).&nbsp; Anyway, yes, I just checked and the option "Print Markup" IS checked under "Print All Pages".&nbsp; It still doesn't show the balloons.&nbsp; I still think there is some kind of

            One other thing I should have mentioned initially - One thing I also tried just to get the printed document to show the balloons is to convert the Word document into a PDF document, and guess what?&nbsp; The balloons STILL did not show.&nbsp; Strange, isn't it?&nbsp;
 You would think that a PDF would be created showing what is on the screen.

            Nope doesn't work via Print Preview. Prints with a gutter, but no balloons.<br />
<br />
MS please fix this!<br />
<br />
Works OK via Quick Print.

    <title>Combination of sumif and sumproduct&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> al_kl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Combination of sumif and sumproduct&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>In 3 rows of a spreadsheet I have:</p>
<ol>
<li>row 6: the position of an employee, eg lead, senior, junior, designer, etc etc. (say 20 different positions, repeated over&nbsp;250 columns)</li><li>row 12: the $ cost of that position </li><li>rows 25-200: qty of hours against the position for each task represented by rows 25-200.</li></ol>
<p>In column IX, I wish to create a total sum of all the sumproducts of row12 x row 25, say, if row6 = "designer." Then incolumn IY, the total sum will be of all sumproducts of row12 x row 25, if row6 = "senior." This will continue in subsequent columns with
 all the positions that I have.</p>
<p>Hopefully this is clear, and even more hopefully someone will have the solution!?</p>

<p>I've probably got this wrong but you might have something like this:</p>
<p>Designer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>$25/hr</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>11.2</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>And you want to sum the hours under designer and then calculate the total cost?&nbsp; If the above data is in column B then</p>
<p>=SUM(B25:B200)*B12</p>
<p>does it and you just copy this to the right</p>
<p>Might look better to have a row 12 called Hourly Cost and then have the above formula on the next row as Total Cost.</p>

<p>In the above, if the position is "lead Engineer", then the far right hand column adds 100 x 10, plus 125 x 50, to establish the total of 7250 against the row GN-001. I need to replicate this calc for every position I have..senior engineer, engineer, graduate,
 etc etc, plus many others that I have not shown above. I also need to replicate this for all other rows, GN-002, -003, etc.</p>

<p>The first row of data GN-001 was in&nbsp; row 4 and this formula gives the total of 7250 for 'Lead Engineer" drag right and you get "Senior Engineer" etc and repeat the formula in other rows for GN-002 etc</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT(($C$2:$Q$2*$C$4:$Q$4)*($C$1:$Q$1=C1))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT-----</p>
<p>Correct formula for your rows</p>
<p>=SUMPRODUCT(($C$12:$Q$12*$C$25:$Q$25)*($C$6:$Q$6=C6))</p>

<p>It would and and it will but&nbsp;without resorting to VBA I think cracking what; looks like, poor spreadsheet design with a formula is going to be challenging.</p>
<p>In any case I'm still not sure I've understood the question. For example you note senior engineer will appear twice using my method and that's correct but in the sample data we have a Senior Engineer @ $110 an hour and another Senior Engineer @ $75 an hour,
 are they the same function? We don't know and the same is true for other functions with different $/hr rates.</p>

<p>Not at all, Your formula would work perfectly well using the same scenario as I proposed, which is &nbsp;listing the positions in 20 columns at the end of the data and using those 20 items as the reference in the formula.</p>

            <p>Here are some additional tips.</p>
<p>1. Answer the form using a computer or device where you normally access the affected account.
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Answer the form using the most updated information</p>
<p>3. If you can fill all the boxes with answers the better.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;Ask a friend or relative whom you think you've recently emailed.</p>
<p>5. You don't need to fill up the Credit card details if you did not associate your card in the first place, but if did purchase Microsoft products such OFFICE 365, XBOX subscription, please put the LAST 4 digits only and the actual name of the card holder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*** If you&nbsp;think you provided false information during the time you created the account, it's highly unlikely you'll pass the validation.&nbsp;Your ability to pass depends&nbsp;to the quality and accuracy of the information you can provide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, it's your account, your responsibility.&nbsp; </p>

<br />
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>While you are answering the account recovery form, please take note of the following tips:</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">1. The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer that has successfully signed into that account previously.
<br />
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><br />
2. Also, much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred.<br />
<br />
3. Even if your original information has changed, be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally.<br />
<br />
4. You don't need to fill out the whole form; just the fields that you know apply to your account.<br />
<br />
5. If you use Outlook.com or Hotmail.com to send emails, you can fill out the email section of the form.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The form relies on several details about your account usage and we understand that it can be difficult to remember those info however, this process is our final path to sort this problem after all other attempts to regain access
 to your account have failed.</p>

            You can easily list the query names as a value list as the RowSource property of a combo box, but even better would be to include the actual query names in a hidden first column and more meaningful descriptions in the visible second column.&nbsp; To do this
 set up the combo box's properties as follows:<br />
<br />
RowSourceType: &nbsp;&nbsp; Value List<br />
RowSource: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; qryABC;First query description;qryDEF;Second query description;qryGHI;Third query description<br />
ColumnCount: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2<br />
ColumnWidths: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 0<br />
<br />
This will give you the following drop down list:<br />
<br />
First query description<br />
Second query description<br />
Third query description<br />
<br />
but the actual value of the selected row will be the query name in the hidden first column, i.e qyeryABC, qry DEF or qry GHI, so you can open the query in the combo box's AfterUpdate event procedure with:<br />
<br />
With Me.ActiveControl<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If Not IsNull(.Value)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Docmd.OpenQuery .Value<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
End With<br />

            <p>What kind of queries are these? Action queries (Append, Delete, Update etc.) or just a basic Select query? What real-life task are you intending to accomplish?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Action queries can be "run" (executed, changing data in the database); but it's generally not a good idea to open a query Datasheet for users to view or edit data. Much better is to create a Form based on the query and open THAT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said... if you want to select multiple rows, don't use a Combo ("drop") box; instead use a Multiselect Listbox. It should have two columns with a rowsource as Ken suggests; you can put some VBA code in its AfterUpdate event to loop through the listbox's
 ItemsSelected collection to execute all of the selected action queries.</p>

    <title>Windows Insider Build ISO Download Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Insider Build ISO Download Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every couple of fast ring insider build updates I need to perform a clean-in-place upgrade/install in order to fix a few bugs and problems I get with venturing into the beta builds (I accept this and even though it is not ideal it is manageable). However,
 in the past few months there have been numerous of these beta builds but when going to try and download them from the official windows insider advanced (https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewadvanced) the list hasn't been updated
 at all and is still showing builds 17127 and 17115 when I currently have 17692. Please update the list so that I and others can safely download the latest iso and fix our&nbsp;problems. Also before anyone asks I don't want to do a fresh install as I have too much
 to reinstall and deal with multiple times.&nbsp;</p>
