            Hi Ali.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            If it was happening on a single isolated app, then yes you could reset it in Settings&gt;Apps and features under the Advanced options.<br /><br />But you said it was happening on more than one program, correct? This means that there is serious corruption in your install and it needs to be gone over to find it. <br /><br />The most important thing in Windows 10 is the quality of the install. That's why no Enthusiast   run a factory or upgrade install in the first place.

            You can then uninstall the app and reinstall it, try that.
<br />
<br />How many apps exactly is this happening with?  What are they?  
<br />
<br />Have you advanced to Version 1803 yet?  You can check at Settings &gt; System &gt; About.  
<br />
<br />If not What I'd do at this point is install Media Creation Tool from this link, choosing the button to Install Tool Now and then open the installed app and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If these do not help then report back any verbatim error message or behavior.  
<br />
<br />If you want to temporarily block the update then try running the Hide Updates tool downloaded and installed from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />If it wont' find and hide the Update then you can set a Metered Connection to turn off Windows Updates for awhile until the version matures and you can try again using the method I suggest which always works best:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
You can never uninstall (in the sense that you mean) any version of <br />
Windows, nor can you format the drive it's installed on from within <br />
it.<br />
<br />
To get rid of any version of Windows, you format the drive it's on. <br />
Again, you can't do that from within Windows, but have to boot from <br />
external media (diskette, CD, DVD, etc.) and do the format from there. <br />
Normally if you want to get rid of some version Windows *and* also <br />
install some other version, you simply boot from the disk of the <br />
version you want to install it, and tell it to do a clean <br />
installation. As the first step of the clean installation, it formats <br />
the drive.<br />
<br />
But in my view, you are almost certainly making a very bad mistake. I <br />
think Windows 7 is much better than Windows XP, and has *fewer* <br />
problems. Your view that there are "to many problems with windows7" is <br />
almost certainly a result of your not giving yourself enough time to <br />
learn what the differences are and get accustomed to what is new. But <br />
it's certainly your choice, not mine.<br />
<br />
And be aware that formatting the drive removes everything there. So if <br />
there are files on it that you need, be sure to copy them to external <br />
media before beginning.<br />

<h2>            Help with windows 10 store error can&#39;t download 0x803F7003 hexadecimal.....anddd a virus&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've gone over every solution I could find on forums and google searches. I have not been able to download any new apps from the store for what I beleive has been since I downloaded minecraft... I suppose its possible that minecraft was actually downloaded
 from a separate server/location than regular windows store apps, I don't know anything about windows store communication and at bare minimum the download link was located on another page, and wasn't found through store interface . So it is possible that I
 haven't been able to use the store for even longer than a month ago when I downloaded &nbsp;minecraft (I use 99% desktop apps). I've tried resetting the store, mashing the re-download button on this page, and even re-enabling "useless" services I disabled, unfortunately
 I'm a ding dong and didn't keep track of which services they were..three I believe, tablet input, some service rumored to allow microsoft to snag more info from my PC (sorry microsoft), andd something I can't remember, definitely did research and thought before
 shutting it off though....however much that means. My laptop is a MSI GS60 ghost pro, skylake 6700HQ, 16GB DDR4, Windows 10 home build 10586<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ef2adad-4c77-4039-a9ef-bd5559585095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ef2adad-4c77-4039-a9ef-bd5559585095" /></a></p>

 which if I search the directory and the top dll I get a webpage windowfin.com that avast labels as this:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/521f92b1-7fe6-41b5-a779-a75f8c8e3068" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/521f92b1-7fe6-41b5-a779-a75f8c8e3068" /></a></p>

<p>Sorry if I broke any forum rules and sorry for two issues, we can just tackle the possible virus if I'm wanted to make a second post.. my first post. I do keep regular backups so if I have to go back a month I will be able to live with myself if it makes
 me more secure</p>

    <title>Time Zone issue in Skype for Android - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Time Zone issue in Skype for Android</h2>
                    My Skype app is showing a time for chats exactly 5 hours ahead of me (I'm in Eastern Time Zone).&nbsp; The actual phone has the right time and is in the right time zone, so that's not the problem - just this app.&nbsp; And my Skype on Windows 10 desktop has the
 right time - so the same messages on the computer that show as 1:40 PM are showing as 6:40 PM on my app.&nbsp; &nbsp;

            It could be that when you downloaded Skype, one of your devices had this time zone on it. Try making sure that all of the time zones are correct and then reinstalling Skype. It is best to double check all the settings are correct in the Windows Settings:-
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key + i 
<br />2. Select 'Time &amp; Language'
<br />3. Check that 'Set the time automatically' is checked.

            Thanks.&nbsp; The computer Skype has the correct time - it is the Android app that has the wrong time.&nbsp; I uninstalled, made sure time was right on the phone (it is - it is set to automatically set time, and is accurate) and then reinstalled the Skype app.&nbsp;
 Still 5 hours ahead!

            That's strange. Perhaps you are connected to a network that is associated with that time? I can suggest that you speak to one of our live agents who may have a better idea of why this is happenning:-

    <title>No boot issue after canceled repair in progress, unable to repair - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bluesora  say:</h3>
<h2>            No boot issue after canceled repair in progress, unable to repair Windows</h2>
                    <p><em>Original Title: I think I broke my computer.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently my computer's fans have started to make grinding noises. A few months ago one made the noise while I was sleeping and I angrily shut off my computer by holding the power button (which was my first mistake). I re installed windows from the installation
 disk after my computer just didn't want to work properly. I saved a system image that day in case i ever needed it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well this morning my computer made the grinding noise and I once again turned it off using the power button causing my computer to not function properly (I.e. Black screen with no icons on desktop saying cannot find hard drive, or being extremely slow when
 trying to do anything.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Agitated with myself I decided I'd have to do another factory reset since this time I was smart and saved everything to my external hard drive. I selected the image and upon seeing it starting to recover I hit cancel thinking that just re installing from
 the disk would be faster. Now when I boot up my computer it gives me a black screen saying "windows failed to start. A recent change hardware or software change might be the cause. To fix the problem:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. insert windows installation disc and restart computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. choose your language settings and click next.</p>
<p>3. click "repair your computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>status: 0xc000000F</p>
<p>
</p><p>Info: The boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have booted the computer using the dvd/cd drive and have the windows 7 disc in the cd drive. i have tried the repair computer. system image recovery, system restore, and none of those have worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried the command prompt guides I've found online to make my petition 2 active and bootrec.exe repairs, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm starting to believe I truly damaged my computer and even booting from external hard drive does not work. I get the same error message. Any help would be great</p>

    <title>FPS problem in League of Legends&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            FPS problem in League of Legends&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My laptop model is Asus N551ZU. I had this problem since using Windows 10, now downgraded to Windows 8.1. I use to run the game in Medium-High settings around 110 FPS, but usually had it capped at 80. Every since the problem comes, during scene of more skills
 been use in the game, the FPS drops straight to 30 and causes the game to stopped like .5 second - 1 sec. Not long after that, the situation just gets worse, now I can barely even reach 50 FPS. It fluctuates around 30-50 FPS.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Even in the lowest in game graphics settings and the highest settings, there is no difference in the FPS.<br />
I had tried uninstalling graphic drivers and download back to the latest version, nothing changed, set everything high priority for performance for the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Update:<br />
I had tried searching up and found a guide&nbsp;<a href="https://redacted.tv/2017/12/20/win10guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://redacted.tv/2017/12/20/win10guide/</a>. By following some of its content, I now had gotten increase of around 20fps. One
 thing is that by using highest settings and lowest settings, I am still getting same FPS range. Some software even doesn't shows or detect my dedicated GPU.</p>

<br />Try running SFC/DISM - <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93?auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

<p>Okay I ran SFC/DISM no corruption found.<br />

<p>After I go through the guide I manage to get increase of 20 average FPS. The thing that has no difference is that the fps throughout different video quality settings.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Recovering lost data from Windows installation USB</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a bootable windows 10 installation USB on 1 TB external drive and I lost important files in the process. The external disk drive was NTFS before being formatted to FAT32, and most of the space is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a tool that re-allocated the lost space and recovers the lost files from the external disk drive?</p>
<p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The external drive may have encountered a corruption that caused missing files. In all honesty, file recovery is a difficult task to perform especially on external drives and may sometimes cause space shrinkage and missing files. We do not want to leave
 you hanging out there without getting any assistance from us. Having said that, there are external drive manufacturer's that offer help on file recovery depending on your hard drive brand. We recommend that you reach out with them. There is also another way
 to recover the missing files, we suggest that you check this <a href="https://www.easeus.com/data-recovery/deleted-recovery-software/recover-deleted-files-external-flash-drive.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and follow the steps given.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>Wow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, recovery may be a lost cause as there has been not only a format operation, but a change in file system and files written to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might look at <a href="https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TestDisk</a>, it may be able to assist you in getting information back.</p>

            The avira didn't like something in the autorun, perhaps an elevated install request in the setup.exe itself, referenced by the autorun. I'd say this was the avira doing it's job by blocking possible unwanted activity on the user's behalf. Use notepad to
 open the autorun inf file, by right clicking the filename, and selecting open with, and cjhoosing notepad. NOTE: BE SURE TO UNMARK THE DEFAULT SELECTION BOX FOR ALWAYS OPENING THIS FILE WITH NOTEPAD, OR YOU MAY RECEIVE ERRORS AND OTHER PROBLEMS. i AM SURE
 THE AUTORUN INF WILL ONLY REFERENCE THE ICON FILE, AND THE SETUP EXECUTABLE, THOUGH. Then, visit this site to obtain a free detection and removal utility to be sure your avira is doing it's job correctly.<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a>.

<p>Dear NTauthority T.Welch,</p>
<p>Thanks for your assistance. Since I'm&nbsp;a novice, it will take me a bit to digest your instructions.</p>
<p>I do use malwarebytes and ran it last night after my first post and there was no detection.</p>
<p>I was instructed by an Avira&nbsp;forum support person that the reason that the warning appeared was (to paraphrase as best I can as a novice) that there have been some malware invasions using autoplay. I don't think that I have any malware; at least Malwarebytes
 and Avira aren't finding anything so far.</p>
<p>Must I still follow the instructions to open autorun.inf with notepad? I'm such a novice that I wouldn't know where to find autorun.inf?&nbsp;Would it be too much to ask to beinstructed on how to find autorun.inf, please. I'm ignorant basically. The purpose of
 opening autorun.inf is to see what is does, is that it?</p>

<p>Hi will,</p>
<p>The autorun file might be in the Avira directory, though usually only located on the disc used to install the program.</p>

<p>Dear Chris,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. The original problem was a pop-up window in my notification area that said: "Access to the file 'L:autorun.inf' was blocked for your security.</p>
<p>Avira instructed me to uncheck an option in configuration: "block autostart function." That stopped the pop-up window from warning me.</p>
<p>The hard drive manufacturer, Seagate, sent a message via their tech support:</p>
<p>"autorun.inf is the primary instruction file associated with the Autorun function. Autorun.inf itself is a simple text based configuration file that tells the OS which executable to start, which icon to use, and which additional menu commands to&nbsp;make available.
 In other words, autorun.inf tells Windows how to deal open the presentation and treat the contents of the drive. The external drive itself should not be affected by deleting the Autorun.inf file or blocking it. Sometimes we ask our customers to delete the
 Autorun.inf name to avoid getting prompted to install the software/register drive when attempting to access the drive. Have you noticed any changes since you made the changes?"</p>
<p>I was confused by their message so I contacted them via chat. As I now understand them, the only action caused by the blocking of the autorun.inf was the window that popped up to announce the warning which was telling me that autoplay was being blocked.
 The hard drive operatin was not interfered with. When I attach my flash drive to the front of my PC with my USB port, then I get a autoplay window. But with the autorun.inf blocked, I get no autoplay window. Apparently, the warning was warning about a prompt
 to install the software drive when I accessed the drive. But otherwise the hard drive was permitted to operate. That's what I now understand to be the situation.</p>
<p>Does this sound right to you?</p>
<p>Avira showed me how to unblock the autostart function and that stopped the pop-up warnings announcing that autorun.inf was blocked. Avira said that when the autorun.inf was blocked, the hard drive wasn't working but that must be wrong because there were
 backups being made. Seagate said that the hard drive operation wasn't interfered with by blocking 'autorun.inf'</p>
<p>Does this sound right to you? I now some backups were made but I'm still not sure that the hard drive is operating correctly. I'm new to PCs and don't always know what to look for.</p>
<p>Avira did tell me that the autorun.inf file was in the hard drive but I believe Seagate told me it was in Windows.</p>
<p>Bye, rnfstwill</p>

<p>Hi rntfstwill,</p>
<p>Autoplay is a program that Windows uses to handle requests like the "Autorun.inf" file.</p>
<p>The anti-virus must have been blocking Autoplay too, by blocking the autorun file.</p>
<p>I'm sure the hard drive was working, especially if you were able to move data to/from it.</p>

<p>Dear Chris,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. I ask odd questions, I guess, because I don't now much about PCs and I try to understand better. Learn a little as I go.</p>
<p>As I now understand, autorun.inf is a file actually a part of the Seagate hard drive software. It starts up the autoplay window which is part of Windows. The popup window was blocked as well as any functions accessible via that window.</p>
<p>I still think that my hard drive wasn't working right since I was getting backup log files that would disappear and would not correspond to my backup records. But I'm not sure why? I've wiped the hard drive clean and formatted to begin over and am controlling
 the backup manually to closely observe what is backedup and recorded.</p>
<p>Some data was being moved to the hard drive but records seemed confusing.</p>
<p>In the above reply from T.Welch could you explain what he meant by "...an elevated install request in the setup.exe itself, referenced by the autorun."? (Monday, January 10th 2011, 2:53 am) No criticism meant, that's just too technical language for a newbie
 like me. Sounds like he means that the request originated in one device, the hard drive by autorun.inf to set up autoplay?? Would that be a fair newbie translation?</p>
<p>I further (when I get over this influenza) look more at the hard drive to see how it is backing up.</p>
<p>One more question if you don't mind or I can go to Seagate: When I access the hard drive manager and view backed up files, I get a list of three entries:</p>
<p>C: (which is a file folder and appears to be a backup copy of my user's file on my C: drive)</p>
<p>History (which is another file folder and appears to possible be log of the backups made?)</p>
<p>uuid (which is a text document of some kind)</p>
<p>Am I on target about what each of these does? But what is "uuid"? Any ideas? I'll go to Seagate if you'd rather.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>rnfstwill</p>

<p>Hi rnfstwill,</p>
<p>Learn what you can when you can.</p>
<p>You pretty much hit the nail on the head for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autorun" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
autorun.ini</a> function.</p>
<p>It's not used solely by Seagate, but it is specific to storage media (hard drives, CDs, DVDs, jump drives).</p>
<p>It is an optional settings file that specifies how the storage media should be handled.</p>
<p>It can specify what icon to display in Computer, as well as launching a specific file when the storage device is inserted into the computer and several other options.</p>
<p>Windows uses it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AutoPlay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Autoplay</a> program to display the option to the user, and allow the user to specify how (and if) the settings are executed.</p>
<p>It's biggest use, in the old days, was to launch the setup file for installing programs.</p>
<p>For instance, if you wanted to install a game from CD, you could just put the CD in the drive and close the tray and the installation window would open automatically.</p>
<p>This was changed as virus and malware programs took advantage of the function to auto install their payload.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An elevate install request references something needed to be installed as an administrator.</p>
<p>The technical term is an Elevated Credential, which just means that the administrator (which has full control of the computer) is needed to bypass things like anti-virus programs and<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc709691%28WS.10%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 UAC</a> , which protect system files by denying non-admin account from installing potentially harmful software.</p>
<p>So someone that's not suppose to be using the computer can't just walk up and install key-logging software for example.</p>
<p><em>"look more at the hard drive to see how it is backing up."</em></p>
<p>That's a great way to learn about the computer, just paying attention to how thing are done.</p>
<p>I don't know exactly if that's the use of the entries in the Seagate manager, but it makes logical sense.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
UUID</a> is just a system of uniquely identifying different things used by many different systems.</p>
<p>In this case Seagate is using the UUID system to identify the different backup files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Your favorite search engine" is your friend.</p>
<p>Many of the answers I give on this site, that I don't have personal experience with, are found by researching the issue on the Internet.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to ask them here. It is definitely why this site exists.</p>
<p>Hope you feel better soon.</p>

    <title>Trouble Recovering XBL Gamertag - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ijogurt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble Recovering XBL Gamertag</h2>
                    
<p>I recently had troubles downloading the update that allowed paypal as a method of payment. I ended up having to burn the update to a CD and extract it onto my xbox. This worked and everything was fine until I went to my other house (which has it's own xbox
 &amp; hard drive there) and recovered my gamertag. I played there for about 3 days but then returned to my other house.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried to recover my gamertag back, I got the "downloading updates. please wait" message, so I waited. Eventually, it stopped and said "there was a problem downloading the update please try again later". This has happened about five times now. I've
 tried to troubleshoot by deleting my profile off of both hard drive, and restarting my router.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess the solution I'm looking for is a way to get the recover gamertag update onto a disk and extract that onto my xbox, but any other input would be helpful.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance and I hope I can get this problem solved.</p>

    <title>Your Xbox Rewards Monthly Stats - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> galactic geek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Your Xbox Rewards Monthly Stats</h2>
                    
<p>A couple of weeks ago, someone posted about how you could track many things through the
<a href="http://www.trueachievements.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TrueAchievements</a> website. When I tried it however, I found it to be woefully inaccurate in a lot of areas. Well, just today, I received an email from the Xbox Live Rewards program and it gave me some interesting
 stats, specifically: (1) my most played game of last month, (2) my most used app of last month, and (3) the amount of gamerscore that I also earned that month as well.</p>
<p>Since these stats come from Xbox Live itself, they should be 100% accurate unlike the TrueAchievements website. Now, the reason for this thread is NOT because I want to compare the two websites and which is better between the two, but rather for you to share
 your information from the 3 categories listed above for each upcoming month so we can get a better idea of what games and apps people play throughout the year and to see who can get the highest gamerscore each month.</p>
<p>If you don't know how to look up these stats on the official site, simply go to
<a href="http://rewards.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">xbox.com/myrewards</a>, sign in using your Microsoft account, and then you can find it on the bottom left in the "MyStats" section. ;)</p>
<p>Since I started this thread, I'll go first...</p>

<p>Ive noticed that Xbox Rewards "month" is not actually the 1st-30th. They send those rewards email around the 10th of the month so they go from the 10th of one month to the 10th of the next.</p>
<p>What is so woefully inaccurate about Trueachievements.com? You can earn an achievement on xbox then go straight to the computer and scan your achievement on the site. Xbox.com doesn't even show that you earn it that fast.</p>

    <title>Surface RT Office 2013 licence - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> massifheed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface RT Office 2013 licence</h2>
                    <p>A quick Surface RT/Office 2013 question...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm thinking of selling my Surface RT, and was wondering what the licence situation is with Office 2013 that&nbsp;comes pre-installed. If I reset the device to it's factory settings and sell it, can the new owner set it up and use Office too, or is the licence
 restricted to the first registered user of the device? I've heard that MS have changed the licence agreements with Office 2013, and wondered if this also applied to the version of 2013 that comes with the RT.</p>

            Greetings Massifheed,
<div><br />
<div>That is a great question! Office RT's license is tied to the Surface RT device. Office RT is part of the Operating System, so you can reset/refresh the OS and Office RT will still be tied to the device.</div>

    <title>How do you activate WCF&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jsc_iv  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you activate WCF&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am new to SCCM 2012 and I am trying to install Configuration Manager so that we can test if this is the right product for our environment.&nbsp; We need to push 3rd party application updates to all our networked workstations and WSUS will not allow anything
 other than Microsoft updates to be pushed.&nbsp; I did see where there are freeware add-on components to allow WSUS to push 3rd party updates, but it sounded like you needed to be an ORCA experienced programmer to get some of the updates to push if they were not
 already in MSI format.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I seem to have everything installed correctly for SCCM2012, however the Application Catalog Web Service Point system role is has a status of Critical and is not running.&nbsp; I am getting an error related to the WFC componenent not being activated.&nbsp; I can't
 seem to figure out how to get this componenet activated.&nbsp; The two error log messages are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Error#2:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Site Component Manager failed to install this component on this site system.</p>
<p>Solution: Review the previous status messages to determine the exact reason for the failure. Site Component Manager will automatically retry the installation in 60 minutes. To force Site Component Manager to immediately retry the installation, stop and restart
 Site Component Manager using the Configuration Manager Service Manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Error#1:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Site Component Manager failed to install component SMS_AWEBSVC_CONTROL_MANAGER on server.</p>
<p>The WCF is not activated.<br />
Solution: Make sure WCF is activated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone guide me in how to activate the WCF?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            HP-DV7 - Screen issues on wake from sleep&#47;hibernate</h2>
                    <p>I have tried numerous "Fixes" on this forum, but NONE have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP Dv7t Quad laptop w/ ATI Radeon HD 7400M.</p>
<p>With Windows 7, the laptop would wake from sleep within a second or two-- screen would come on quickly and system would load back to login screen quickly.</p>
<p>With Windows 10, powering back on from sleep (opening lid or pushing button), the screen is blank for 30-60 seconds.&nbsp; This is extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>Any additional suggestions on how to fix this issue? Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 Controller Driver Issues - Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p><p><br /></p><p>I have been having quite a bit of trouble getting my Xbox 360 controllers to work with my PC. This may be a bit long but I feel like you're going to need details if I'm going to get this resolved. The problem started when I replaced an Xbox 360 controller that broke. I plugged in a new one and it was immediately detected and the driver applied but it wouldn't register in Joy.cpl or any of my games. I tried uninstalling the driver and reinstalling it. The problem was that the driver wouldn't uninstall and that has been preventing me from reinstalling/updating it.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I then attempted to remove it manually. I cleared it from my System32&nbsp; folder&nbsp;(which forced me to take ownership of each entry of course) and attempted to remove the registry entries. I ran into a catch though; no matter how many times I add or remove permissions from a single Xusb22 entry I cannot get the correct permissions to remove it. The entry is named xusb22.inf

<h2>            Multiplayer </h2>
                    
<p>Is there anyone beside me that doesnt use a glitch/modd to cheat and never die?</p>
<p>Secondly, why is it that when I am on the mic when I am near or behind people, "Hey I am not going to shoot you I just want to get in the next area.</p>
<p>Respawns in gang matches ect. suck I spawn, they spawn directly behind me and shoot&nbsp;me in the back of the head.</p>
<p>Most times I cant even get out of a city like Armadillo because a posse a d-bags decide they are going to shoot everyone from twin rocks to Coot's Chapel on horses using auto target and the I never die glith/modd.</p>
<p>There are 4 reasons to change multiplayer should I make a 5th?</p>

<p>The funny thing is in the open free play, shooting other players is a major distraction and a waste of time, if you want to do that then go play shootout. In the Free Roam, do the hideouts and other things for XP ... the only player that most would want
 to gun down is the Most Wanted, since there is XP to gain for getting a Most Wanted Player.</p>
<p>Rockstar should fix their glitches and the cheating that goes on in the game.</p>

<p>I dont like the mp in this game very much either....but I bought it for the single player, and the SP alone was more than worth the cost.</p>

<p>When I just want to XP level up and do hideouts without distractions, I play on Friendly that is the whole purpose of it.</p>
<p>I haven't experienced any glitches, none that I have noticed anyway, there was one gang match I played on, one person on the other team stayed in one place where you spawn and just killed us over and over.</p>

<p>This game has a high number of griefers in Friendly Freeroam. It seems theres always a group of people on their first legendary rank camping in Armadillo or MacFarlane's Ranch shooting players mounts and trying to knock people on foot over by punching them.
 I always wonder what makes them so angry at the world. If you fight back they give you bad rep lol sad sad people in this game.</p>

<p>I came across my first glitcher/modder last night. No amount of head shots would down this one player and even unloading a full semi auto shotgun at point blank range had no effect.</p>
<p>If you want to avoid these low life pond scum griefers then you'll have to play Friendly Free Roam. You still get some, but not as many.</p>
<p>Of course, if it's just XP you're after, just grind your favourite hideouts in a Private session. Not as much fun playing on your own, but you're guaranteed not to run into any troublesome teens.</p>

<p>There isn't a level 51. If you get to level 50 you can either stay there or "Pass into Legend" and start afresh from level 1</p>
