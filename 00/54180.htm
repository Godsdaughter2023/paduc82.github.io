            <p>Dear Shalini,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions. &nbsp;I do get automatic updates, checked the driver and it is OK, tried the Fixit option, will see if that changes anything, but have also used that before. &nbsp;I also checked power settings, it is set as you suggested. &nbsp;So problem
 must be elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also having a frequent problem with the system freezing up, usually for a short time, and with Outlook freezing and requiring restart or reboot. &nbsp;The messages are&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Cannot display the folder. Microsoft Outlook cannot access the specified folder location. You don't have appropriate permission to perform this operation."</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>and after I close Outlook and reopen:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"File is in use and cannot be accessed."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>These problems have been going on for quite awhile, keyboard freeze is fairly recent. &nbsp;Something is definitely not right, don't know if there is any connection between these issues.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I've run repair on Office, done scanpst on Outlook files, reduced the file of .pst files to below 2GB, run a disk check, checked for strange add-ins. &nbsp;I do use the search option extensively
 in Outlook. &nbsp;I also use Carbonite for backup, but I understand it doesn't run if the file is open, which it was in this case. &nbsp;Also, I've used Carbonite for years without having this problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks very much for your advice!</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>No, not Outlook specific, keyboard doesn't work on any applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re: my previous message about Outlook files unavailable, I have since learned that Carbonite does save open files, including Outlook files that may be in use. &nbsp;I suspect that they may be causing my problem, am testing this by using "do not back this file
 up" option during the day. &nbsp;This is a recent problem with Outlook and Carbonite (if this is the cause), so I wonder if you have any information about what may have changed to cause it -- and how to address other than limiting backups to overnight?</p>
<p>

            <p>I've discovered that Carbonite does save open files, and I think this is likely what interferes with Outlook if VSS is not enabled (Volume Shadow Copy). &nbsp;It was not enabled in my system, apparently Carbonite doesn't automatically turn it on, nor do they
 tell you to turn it on. &nbsp;(I don' t think their customer service people understand all this very well.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been turning off file backup on the Outlook files having problems and haven't had the problem since, will see if VSS allows them to backup and still not cause problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other interesting thing is that the keyboard freeze problem also hasn't occurred since I stopped the Outlook problem. &nbsp;I don' t know if they are related, but thought it might be useful to report this. &nbsp;I imagine there are plenty of Outlook/Carbonite
 users who have this experience, and if it has been answered anywhere, I didn't find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will report back if either of these problems continue.</p>

            <p>Thanks, however those instructions seem to be for the Epson stylus and not the 545 all in one, installed as a wireless printer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The problem did resolve after I used the Print spooler wizard that is available at Cnet.&nbsp; The final resolution after using it was the following;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Press "Win+R" enter "services.msc" and press Enter on your keyboard. Find service Print Spooler, and double click it left button mouse. Go to the tab Log On, and uncheck "Allow service to interact with desktop". Click Ok and reboot your PC. Try install
 your printer or to print test page, if your printer installed.</em><br />

<h2>            How do I get the middle mouse button to work&#63; Comfort Mouse 4500</h2>
                    <p>Hey.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">I have 2 of the least important issues, ever. in win 10 history. I ask for the communities assistance in my tiny endevor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same mouse for years, and got several of em. The Microsoft Comfort. </p>
<p>Never had an issue. (Wired-old fashion 2 button and a mouse wheel button) I didnt even need to use the "Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center".</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">My mouse and keyboard has always worked without any problem what so ever.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A few weeks ago,</strong> </p>
<p>I had a broken Insider build, that I had to restore to and old windows.</p>
<p>All good, but my windows "catalogs and logs....are a mess". But the system works.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>But,</strong></p>
<p>I now have got 2 rather annoying problems, that I can not solve. </p>
<p><em>I KNOW</em>, I am asking for help about something thats is Last on the list of things to fix!</p>
<p>It's annoying me!</p>
<p>Maybe one of you out there got any tip for me or have been in my situtation?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">My tiny issue 1:</span></p>
<p>My mouse works, </p>
<p>HOWEVER, the mosue wheel <em>button</em> does not! Its like its "disabled", but when I run Mouse and Keyboard center. The mouse wheel button is active there.....but does NOTHING. Even if I change the "middle click" to other mouse buttons or even set keys</p>
<p>It has been working for years!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mouse HW works. I have tried 2 of the same brand, which works fine on another computer.</p>
<p>The mouse wheel works! The drivers reports no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOW, do I ENABLE the Middle mouse button? There are TONS of tips how to disable it......HOW DO I TURN IT ON!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Tiny issue 2</span></p>
<p>At the same time, my keyboard input "button" moved itself from the taskbar. You need press "Ctrl-atl-Del", to find it.<br />
Its the button that says "ENG", and Where you can change input keyboard. I have an english and Swedish Keyboard, as input. Both QWERTY. And English as windows main output lanuage. (I only have access to Swedish mumbo jumbo letters (ÅÄÖ)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My keyboard layout and settings has always worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now,</p>
<p>First...I had to "Tinker" with windows in order to get the Language back back in the taskbar. The Task Bar settings, did NOT do THIS! (??)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>My Tiny issue with the keyboard:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">One key, and ONLY that key</span>, I have&nbsp;&nbsp;hold down for 2 seconds for it to activate. Its the Swedish (Ö). And when I hold it....it types lots of ÖÖÖÖÖÖÖÖ.</p>
<p>I have never seen this "Problem" before. The keyboard key, is 100% functional. When using the english keyboard layout. The key respons normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone seen this before? Any suggestions?</p>
<p>I have run Image repairs and scans all week. I have logs of CBS and DISM for those who are interested.&nbsp;<br />
I have Restored and validated the image packages both from online, and a ISO downloaded, mounthed image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC works! So an Repair upgrade or Format/install is my last resort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice? Do I win an award for being honest and asking for help, because this annoyed me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish you all a magical Midsummer!</p>

<p>I have tested the mouse and one other on my other PC. Win 7. Mouse wheel button works there.</p>
<p>It always worked on my Win 10. It was since the last update it stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both my keyboard and mouse works 100% in games, windows, everything.</p>
<p>Its only these 2 MINOR things, heh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled both the mouse drive and the keyboard driver. Rebooted and got a new.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled "Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center", and reinstalled it.</p>
<p>It find the mouse and shows no errors. It lets me change the wheel and button to what I want.</p>
<p>But still, the middle button does nothing. (It does on another PC).<br />
<br />
Btw, there are several drivers for both the keyboard and mouse. Should I remove them all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried to uninstall the USB root-hub.</p>
<p>QUESTION: If I do that, wount all my USB devices stop working? As in keyboard and mouse?<br />
How do I reboot? I GUESS Windows will install the USB drivers when I log in again.<br />
Will the mouse/keyboard WORK when I log in?<br />
<br />
I say again. These issues only started after I had to use system restore. EVERYTHING ELSE works 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Windows could not complete the installation. To install Windows on this computer, restart the installation error" occurs when there is a corruption in the installation file. We've checked the link that you've included in your post and found out that
 the solution was for Windows 7, that's why it did not work on your Windows 10 PC. To help resolve your issue, we suggest following the troubleshooting steps provided by Andre Da Costa in this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-could-not-complete-the-installation-to/ef6119bb-5c9a-46c7-84a6-891fe2f69ba3">thread</a></strong> that was found helpful in
 resolving similar concern. </p>

</p><p>We just finished a new computer.&nbsp; Fall Creators Update 1709 rolled out and completely ruined the installation, giving us the exact same error as listed above, although a slightly different build.&nbsp; It did not create a system restore point.&nbsp; It did not leave
 the previous installation on the disk so that we could roll back to the previous build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MicroShaft shafted us out of several hours troubleshooting, and we resetup windows again, only to see the same thing happen AGAIN.&nbsp; In the end we disabled windows update service to keep this install from going through.&nbsp; We made a backup restore disk since
 it won't do a restore point or roll back to the previous build, and we will be waiting to turn on windows update until the next major update.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All data on the disk is still there but even a windows repair won't repair windows.&nbsp; Only reinstalling windows completely, and reinstalling all applications gets us back to where we were before windows killed the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running an Asus Prime B350M-E motherboard, with AMD Athlon X4 950 processor, AMD Radeon HD 3600 graphics, and 8 GB DDR4 RAM, if any of that helps.</p>

            The solution of andre costa asks to download a win10 image. The download says i need a valid license. Is there a way to recover my license from my "not upgrading" computer. Or will the new install recognize there&nbsp; was a license on the old system (this
 was a dell computer with a win8 license that has been upgraded)?<br />

                    I have a dell inspiron 1100 that has window xp home on it. The problem is I had downloaded a fix it program to fix registery errors and now I can't get window xp home to start up normally or in safe mode because I get message "the automatic startup has
 failed because normaliz.dll cannot be found". How do I reinstall normaliz.dll file when I cannot even get the icons&nbsp;to&nbsp;come up, all I get is the background and nothing else. Not even the start up menu. Please help me as I am getting ready to sell it&nbsp; and I
 don't want my personal stuff on the computer.&nbsp; thank You.&nbsp;

            You need to replace the file and there is no copy of it on the XP installation CD and since it is not one of the 3498 files that Windows File Protection looks after, there is also no backup copy on the system - but you can still replace it.<br />
<br />
Is that really what the error message says?<br />
<br />
I guess 10crackers decide to delete his reply, but my reply to him was:<br />
<br />
A repair install will not fix a missing normaliz.dll problem but you can sure try it.&nbsp; The normaliz.dll gets installed with Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
And... you will not be doing any Repair Install if you do not have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed SP (most people don't have any genuine XP media) so before suggesting it, it is prudent to ask if the OP
 has a genuine bootable XP installation CD that matches their installed SP (probably not) and not waste a message cycle.<br />
<br />
Windows Explorer will not start if normaliz.dll is missing and you will see stuff like this:<br />
<br />
Explorer.EXE - Unable To Locate Component : This application has failed to start<br />
because Normaliz.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
This will be in the Event Log:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Application Popup<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 26<br />
Description:<br />
Application popup: Explorer.EXE - Unable To Locate Component : This application has failed to start<br />
because Normaliz.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, even the new MS Answers forums implementation does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know absolutely nothing about the afflicted system.<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues but that is the way they choose to run things here.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers owners, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible - if we had more information like I recommended you put into your latest MS Answers forums updates, we would be done with this
 problem (and many like it) with a single reply.<br />
<br />
For this problem, there is a copy of normaliz.dll on my SkyDrive to download (having fixed this a few dozen times).&nbsp; From a working system, download the file and copy it to a USB thumb drive or floppy and
<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">sneakernet </a>
</i>it to the afflicted system.&nbsp; Or, you can copy the file from a working system to a USB thumb drive or floppy drive.<br />
<br />
On the afflicted system, you can still get into Task Manager with Ctrl-Alt-Del and then click File, New Task..., Browse and navigate to the USB thumb drive or floppy, find the normalize.dll you downloaded, copy it and then Browse again to the c:\windows\system32
 folder of the afflicted system (assuming XP is installed on the C drive) and paste the file into c:\windows\system32.<br />
<br />
The annoying error will keep popping up, but you can just acknowledge them and eventually you will be able to get the file copied/pasted and hopefully that is the only problem.<br />
<br />
I uploaded a copy of the XP Pro SP3 file you need to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in these folders (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.<br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, your browser may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.) so you will have to manually add the proper extension
 to the file when you download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called
<b>normaliz </b>when the file name really needs to be called <b>normaliz.dll</b> (if the downloaded file has no extension you will have to change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />
<br />
You then need to copy/paste the downloaded file in the correct folder(s) on your system.<br />
<br />
What policy is it that you think will be violated by sending somebody an XP file via SkyDrive?&nbsp; If you look at my SkyDrive, you will see dozens and dozens and dozens of MS files and I am not violating any policy.<br />
<br />
If you want to see the error for yourself and learn how to fix it, rename your normaliz.dll file to something you can remember:<br />
<br />
rename&nbsp; normaliz.dll&nbsp;&nbsp; normaliz.xxx<br />
<br />
Then reboot and you will see the error, then you try your repair install idea if you want, see if it works and let us know what happens, but all you really need to do is replace the file and hope that is the only thing wrong.&nbsp; If you get stuck you can always
 rename it back either from Task Manager or the Recovery Console or some other bootable CD/USB device.<br />
<br />
Sometimes this problem also comes up after a botched upgrade to IE8.<br />

            I was going to reply similarly after finding it in the IE8 installer but didn't get to her fast enough. I realized my mistake and that's why I deleted my post<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I want to do what say to do, but I have one question to ask. The only other computer I have access to has windows vista if I go and download the file using a computer with vista can I use the same usb flash drive to copy/paste the file into the affected
 computer that has window xp home?</p>

            That should be fine - I don't have Vista and don't know if it uses a normaliz.dll file so when you download the file, be sure you don't overwrite/replace the one that might be in Vista.<br />
<br />
For example, you might <i>not </i>want to do this part since this only applies only to XP:<br />
<i><br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in these folders (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32</i><br />
<br />
Depending on how you download it, just let it end up in some other folder than one of the Vista system folders.&nbsp; You could put it in My Documents (if Vista has such a thing) or someplace you can find it then when you are done, you can delete the file from your
 Vista system so you don't wonder what it is sometime in he future.<br />

            <p>I downloaded it using vista&nbsp;then &nbsp;I&nbsp;could not&nbsp;install&nbsp;the file&nbsp;in the affected computer because&nbsp; I got this message
<u>"Newdev.dll the specfic moudle could not be found"</u> It won't reconize the USB Flash drive that has the file on&nbsp;it&nbsp;.&nbsp; Also I did check the system32 in task master and it does show that&nbsp;&nbsp;the normalize.dll&nbsp;completely missing from the affected computer.</p>

            I have no idea where 'newdev.dll' is originating and there is nothing to install.&nbsp; All you need to do is copy the file from the USB flash drive to the c:\windows\system32 folder of the afflicted system.<br />
<br />
Maybe somebody else will be able to help us out with that (I have never seen it).<br />
<br />
After downloading the normaliz.dll file to your Vista system, copy it to the flash drive.<br />
<br />
Using Vista, make sure you can see the normaliz.dll file on the flash drive and then (if you are sure it is there), carry the flash drive to the afflicted system and plug it in.<br />
<br />
Using Task Manager, you should be able to Browse the flash drive and see the normaliz.dll file, right click it, choose Copy, still using Task Manager, Browse to the c:\windows\system32 folder on the afflicted system, click in an empty area of the system32 folder,
 right click and choose Paste.<br />
<br />
Since you confirmed the file is really missing (that is good that you confirmed it) now you should see it.<br />
<br />
You said before that you had used a registry cleaner on your system prior to this incident, so depending on what happened with that, there could be many other things wrong besides the missing normaliz.dll file.<br />
<br />
My instructions are what I send to people if the problem is simply that the normaliz.dll file has somehow come up missing and that usually goes pretty smoothly or I would not have created those instructions which I have used successfully many times before,
 but you may be having some other problems along with that.<br />
<br />
If you are getting ready to sell your system and don't want your personal stuff on it, what you should
<i>really </i>do is nuke your current installation completely, do a total complete format and if it is your intent to include your XP license in your sale, reinstall XP from scratch.&nbsp; If you don't do that, there is always going to be a possibility that some
 parts of your personal information are going to still be on the system or retrievable using other third party software packages.&nbsp; That is going to be the only way to be sure your personal stuff is gone.<br />
<br />
You could also just tell whoever you wiped out the drive completely and they are selling it to that they are going to have to come up with their own Windows software - or whatever operating system they are planning to use.<br />

            I have never had a need to do it, but I have seen folks recommend DBAN which you can get here:<br />

Here is why simply formatting the drive may just not do it for you as there exists software that can recover files even from a formatted HDD:<br />

If you Google something like 'nuke hard drive' you can see other links and videos about how it works.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 0xc000021a Error</h2>
                    <p>So yesterday I ran into this horrible error and believe me I tried every single freaking thing but to no avail that includes all the DISM codes too but nothing so later that day I reinstalled and had to waste my entire day downloading and setting the OS
 as it was before that....also the System Repair every single option dint do a damn thing to me</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I wanna be cautious as I cant bloody trust this Microsoft Windows anymore....was thinking of buying a Mac atleast it wouldn't give me this hard time</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is amazing but God it takes forever to solve that error</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I wanna create the custom system image which happen with recimg command from cmd</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I type it the cmd responds no such command internal or external something like and it wouldn't proceed</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how to create custom system image as I don't wanna go through all those drama again and I know for sure someday in the future its gonna happen again as it usually does cuz of some incomplete updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember I'm asking custom image not that the regular we create via the control panel then file history</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying but I doubt are you some sorta and kinda bot cuz you totally got it wrong</p>
<p>
</p><p>Listen I sat down yesterday for 5 hours searching and scratching every forum available on the net from phone to see any cure but nop even the cmd codes dint work out for me so I know for sure it will happen again sometime that's why I'm scared to restart
 my computer as I type this.....also do know that it happens cuz of some faulty updates from your part or when the updates aint installed completely so I know the cause but when I use the RevertPendingactions in cmd it said no such commands btw do know I just
 typed the exact replica from what I saw here so don't now say hey mayb some spaces were left behind.....behind me I tried everything in the book but God damn that error is stupidly insane so finally I had make a clean install</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now forget about the error cuz I know for sure it will not be fixed as its Microsoft feature to give us some faulty updates now and then so we keep reinstalling the windows now and then</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heres my question and forget about the error resolving thing I don't wanna even go there</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to make the Custom System Image so if that happens again I will have this to back me up</p>
<p>Now I know how to make System Image but it replicates the entire drive....but I want just the replica or image of the system which is not more then 8-10 GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>So let me know and to answer your questions</p>
<p>1)NO</p>
<p>2)I got the issue after installing an update and when it asked for reboot and it never booted back</p>

            <p>Plz Microsoft fire this junk **** who calls himself as some sorta Support Engg in fact hes some punk **** trying to convey the world how much he knows but in reality he doesn't know nothing</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that's the case you know I can also be a Support Engg as its so simple to be one atleast that's what he makes out to be.....just give the customer some stupid repeated answer and infact this stupid Sagnik dint even mention the CMD commands as mostly that
 problem is solved by RevertPendingActions command in CMD cuz the updates prevents the windows to start up so literally no restore or anything works in that case and the very last option you have is the CMD commands and even if that fails then you can either
 back your computer via the System Image or Reinstall the computer.....also the reset windows doesn't work in that case</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if anyone is reading this and have the similar problem plz google how to use the DISM codes for 0xc000012a and plz don't listen to this stupid support engineer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whats funny is that how come Microsoft hires so low life employee when in other forums all the members know much and way better then these stupid professionals also TomsHardware and other forums groups are more better then this Microsoft forum.....as&nbsp;this
 is&nbsp;full of some stupid low life employee who just are there to make money by typing some ridiculous answer where on the other hands in other forums those people are enthusiastic and know what they are doing</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also this Sagnik is gone in hiding as I asked him another question about how to make the custom system image and nothing cuz for sure hes gonna type some ridiculous joke like answer and pretend hes got</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plz do yourself a favour and get a life and don't make a living by trying to make things more complicated then it has to be</p>

    <title>How do I know what Windows 7 I have&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> knit159  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I know what Windows 7 I have&#63;</h2>
                    I see there are several Windows 7 label names, how do I know what my new computer came with. Clicking on properties, doesn't show anything and the owners manual only talks about the mouse pad on the lap top, installing the battery and how to put the power
 cords together in a picture. Other than that you are to assume that the consumer, you, knows all about computers in 11 different languages. The book tells you nothing. I sent you an e-mail because I had 11 updates go into the new system today and 3 of them
 failed. I just wanted to know more about them, I used the same login. Thanks, Clara D'Angelo

<h2>            system resore and command prompt will not work</h2>
                    
<p>For the last two weeks I have be having a nightmare. I turned system restore off and when I turned it on again every thing had stoped working (microsoft word and works procedssor), user account micxrosoft help and support).</p>
<p>I have tried using commmand prompt but this does not work properly. When I typed in list shadow it brought up the copy right, my name and worryingly no shadow copies present in this system.&nbsp; When I go into system restore I just get ablank white screen. If
 I go into system from control panel says my C drive is monitoring.</p>
<p>I don't know what else to do as windowsXP came with the perchase of my Tiny computer. I am not very computer savvy so please make all instructions fool proof.&nbsp;Please HELP, as all I want for Christmas is saystem restore. Many thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<div>
Please provide additional information about your system:</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
<div>
What is your system make and model?</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation: &nbsp;McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive?</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
<div>
It sounds like your system has or has had a malicious software infection. &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
What is the issue you are having that you think System Restore will remedy (or are you just&nbsp;practicing)? &nbsp;System Restore is not a time machine...</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
You should be able to get your System Restore&nbsp;calendar&nbsp;working again easily enough, but that alone will not relieve your system of the malicious software.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Be sure to fix the problem and not just fix the symptom of the problem.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
If you turned off System Restore and turned it back on, that will delete all the existing restore points (that is the way it is supposed to work).</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
I would run a couple malicious software scans as indicated below, then work on any remaining issues.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Sometimes malicious software will afflict your System Restore to prevent you from finding and removing the malicious software. &nbsp;It would much rather fool you into thinking that you have to repair or reinstall your XP when that is not necessary. &nbsp;Sometimes System
 Restore is so afflicted, that you will need to reinstall System Restore (you don't have to reinstall XP - just reinstall System Restore).</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
No matter what you are using for malware protection, I would do this and only then begin to troubleshoot any remaining issues:</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs then resolve any remaining issues:</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></div>
<div>
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a></div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
These can be uninstalled later if desired.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Reboot your system and troubleshoot remaining issues.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
<span><span>If your System Restore calendar is still just showing just a blank white screen, do this</span></span><span><span>:</span></span></div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
<div>
When the scans run clean it may also be necessary to reregister some DLLs (or you can&nbsp;do this part first, but you still need to do the scans). &nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Reregistering the DLLs is okay even if they do not need reregistering. &nbsp;You can also reregister &nbsp;the DLLs before the scans which may fix the issue, but the scans are still recommended.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Click Start, Run and in the box enter the following commands one at a time. &nbsp;Click the&nbsp;OK button to execute each command one at a time:</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
regsvr32 &nbsp;jscript&nbsp;</div>
<div>
regsvr32 &nbsp;vbscript&nbsp;</div>
<div>
regsvr32 &nbsp;/i &nbsp;mshtml</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
The last command for mshtml will load the DLL but may also contain a harmless warning&nbsp;message depending on your environment.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Check your System Restore calendar now.</div>
<hr />
<p>Do, or do not. There is no try.</p>
<p>Somebody please tell me how to prepare figgy pudding as these children keep saying they won't go until they get some.</p>
<p>I decided to save up points for a new puppy instead of a pony!</p>

<h2>            critical updates will not download&#47;install</h2>
                    <p>I have gone to the Critical Updates page and the the green bar keeps going from left to right and after a few minutes an "error" messages comes up saying there was a problem and mentions the error X08000042D. I have WinXP IE8. My other WinXP IE8 installs
 the critical updates with no problem. Why&nbsp;can't I download/install the critical updates for this Acer netbook?</p>
<p><br />
Funny thing is, when I last turned on the Acer, I saw the little icon at bottom right of screen reminding me I had updates, I clicked on that and the Critical Updates downloaded/installed!<br />
<br />
Then why can't I get them to download/install when I go to the Critical Update page?<br />
<br />
(I Googled the X0800042D error number, but couldn't find anything.)</p>

<p>2. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>3. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>

<strong>Name</strong> option in the <strong>Sort by</strong> box on the right. Now scroll down &amp; tell me if ALL of the following updates are listed?</p>

<p>Most will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows XP</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>If IE8 is installed,&nbsp;one will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 8</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>5. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>6. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; CCleaner)?</p>

            <p>Well, it would appear that Automatic Updates is working at least.</p>
<p>ACTIONS:</p>
<p>1. If you have backups of ANY of the changes CCleaner Registry Cleaner has made to your computer, restore ALL of them now
<em>then reboot</em>. cf. <a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/faq/using/how-do-i-restore-registry-backups" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/faq/using/how-do-i-restore-registry-backups</a>&nbsp;[1]</p>
<p>2. Open Internet Explorer (only!) to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a> &amp; run the Fix It.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note=&gt; For optimal results, check the <strong>Delete personal settings </strong>
option.</p>
<p>3a. Open Internet Explorer (only!) to&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910336</a>&nbsp;[ignore the title &amp; Symptoms].</p>
<p>3b. <em><strong>Dismiss/close the 'automated troubleshooter' pop-up!</strong></em>&nbsp; - then...</p>
<p>3c. Run Fix It 50202 in DEFAULT <em>and then AGGRESSIVE modes</em>.&nbsp;[2]</p>
<p>4. Reboot once more.</p>
<p>5. Test by open Internet Explorer (only!) to <a href="http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com</a> | Select CUSTOM and scan | See if you can install all security updates offered, if any.</p>
<p>=&gt; If a <strong>Root Certificates</strong> update is listed in the <strong>Optional Software</strong> updates category on the left-hand side of the scan results window, install it to take full advantage of IE8's enhanced security.
</p>
<p>Tip: Do NOT install any <em>other</em> <strong>Optional Software</strong> updates or
<em>any</em> <strong>Optional Hardware</strong> updates.</p>
<p>6. Reply to this post with a status report.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>================================================================<br />
[1] TIP: If you ever again think your Registry needs to be cleaned, repaired, boosted, tuned-up, cured, tweaked, fixed, or optimised (it doesn't), read
<a href="http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?t=28099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?t=28099</a> and draw your own conclusions. Also see

Downloads page</a> shows that you can have the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center installed.&nbsp; Then I would try pressing the * Function key (or otherwise get into the MMKC) to try to get more familiar with the keyboard's keys.&nbsp; E.g. I would imagine that you
 would have a modifier button on the bottom which would correspond to the Blue mode.&nbsp; As a guess I would try the Alt-Gr one.&nbsp; In addition the MMKC will have a utility called mskey that you can use to find out what pressing a key will generate.</p>

<p>I found the solution. The keyboard has no combination that will give you the green and blue symbols; you have to change the language on the taskbar. When I change from Swedish to Norwegian here:&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.learn-norwegian.net%2fimages%2fchangekeyboard2.gif" />&nbsp;the
 symbols change from ö to ø.</p>

<p>I think I've talked about this a lot but, my account is totally messed, I can't fix it, no matter how much or how hard I try, it just doesn't work. All I want is my Xbox LIVE region to be fixed, and my billing info as well. Gears of Wars (GoW) is now out
 on Games with Gold, and I just can't get a smell of the gameplay... Is there any possible way that a someone can access my account, and fix it...? I'm still a noob to this new console by the way...</p>

<h2>            How to get rid of my profile on multiple consoles&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>Hey fellow Xbox'ers, I come with a question that I kind of need help with soon.</p>
<p>My friend who is not really my friend anymore (we've had issues) is starting to use my account... for the worse, and I am deeply afraid he may get my account suspended, or banned. You see, I went over to his house one day and I downloaded my Xbox profile
 onto his console. I didn't think anything bad would happen since this was a long time ago and we were still good buddies. Anyways, I never set a password on the sign-in page for my profile, so anyone who used that console could get right into my account. Unfortunately,
 that's what has happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My old friend is now trying to find ways to sabotage me, and he has by using my Xbox account. I have told him to delete it from the console, but he refuses. So I am wondering, is there a way I can set a password to my Xbox profile on that console from my
 console, or am I going to have to march into his house (which he is refusing me to do) and fight my way to delete my account myself? I just really need to get my profile off of that console, because I don't want to get in trouble for something that I did not
 do. If you know the answer, you're amazing, and I give you the greatest gratitude. Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To add on to what TripplE said , Once you change the password , it should make him only able to play your account offline , which has no repercussions. Hope you get this sorted out , man.</p>

<h2>            Is it okay to delete &#36;SysReset&#63;</h2>
                    I got this when my laptop was refreshed. Before it was Windows 8.1 and when I refreshed it, it got back to Windows 8. When I look at my Local Disk (c:), before it was 100gb now it's only 50gb. The folder&nbsp;$SysReset consumes almost 40+gb. So is it okay to
 delete it?

            <p>Hello Elli Mac,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for putting this question on the forum.</p>
<p>
This folder create once you perform a System Refresh and the<span> <strong>SysReset
</strong>folder contains information about, ranging from log files to migration xml documents, all of which provide useful information to a forensic investigator.</span>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)"><br />
Failed Reset/Refresh will created a folder called $Sysreset at the root of C: consisting of another folder called logs which contained an .etl file. It also created an etl of a different name (sysreset_exe_BootUX.etl) inside C:\recovery\Logs. Which will help
 us to find/collect the report and error.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)"><br />
If you think you don't need all these information then you may go ahead and delete the folder but just for a precaution it is recommended to create a restore point before performing the task. This will work as backup if any goes wrong we can restore the computer
 to this state easily.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>All latest versions of Microsoft operating systems (which also includes Windows 8/Windows 8.1) automatically create a restore point every time any major configuration or modification takes place in the operating system.</p>
<p>
Below is the process with the help of which you can create a restore point in Windows 8/Windows 8.1 manually:<br />
</p><ol>
<li>Log on to Windows 8/Windows 8.1 computer with the administrator account.</li><li>On the <span>Start</span> screen, click the <span>
Desktop</span> tile.</li><li>Once on the desktop window, click the <span>File Explorer</span> icon from the taskbar.</li><li>On the opened <span>This PC</span> window, right-click <span>
This PC</span> from the navigation pane in the left.</li><li>From the displayed context menu, click <span>Properties</span>.</li><li>On the opened <span>System</span> window, click the <span>
System protection</span> option from the left pane.</li><li>On the <span>System Properties</span> box, make sure that you are on the
<span>System Protection</span> tab.</li><li>Make sure that the <span>Local Disk (C Drive&nbsp;(System)</span> ) volume is selected in the
<span>Protection Settings</span> list. (C: is the default drive where Windows operating systems are installed in case the default options are selected during the installation. The system drive letter may vary if the operating system is installed
 on any other volume of the hard disk drive. Regardless of the drive letter, make sure you select the volume that is marked as ‘System’ in the list.)</li><li>Click <span>Create</span> from the bottom of the box.</li><li>On the opened <span>System Protection</span> box, in the available field, type an informative and descriptive name for the new restore point that you are about to create.</li><li>Once done, click the <span>Create</span> button to start the restore point creation process.</li><li>Once the process is complete, click the <span>Close</span> button on the displayed message box.</li><li>Finally close all the opened box in windows, and start using the Windows 8/Windows 8.1 computer normally.</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope it helps. </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you have any other questions or you need any other information about Windows, feel free to post your questions and we will be glad to help.</span></p>

    <title>Disk stays fragmented - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sachit rathi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk stays fragmented</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I've been trying to defragment my main disk for quite some time using the Disk Optimization app which is provided by Windows itself. I've tried doing it for almost 3 times but my disk always stays fragmented. As we're speaking right now, I'm trying to defragment
 it. I've done it while my windows were not updating while updating, and after it was updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There seems to be an issue with either my disk or Windows itself. It's a 1TB internal mechanical disk.</p>

            Hi  Sachit
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Have you tried checking the hard disk for errors first?
<br />
<br />Click Start
<br />Type: CMD, from the results, right click Command prompt
<br />Click 'Run as Administrator'
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f
<br />Hit Enter
<br />When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.
<br />
<br />I would also check the health of the hard disk.

            Hi Sachit. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If it's an SSD it should not be defragmented.
<br />
<br />It can also have large files like ISO's that will not defragment and this is proper.  
<br />
<br />Essentially if Windows disk optimization doesn't defrag it is not going to ba a problem.  
<br />
<br />You can of course try a 3rd party defrag like the deeper boot time defrag by  Defraggler or another here:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-defrag-software-tools-2619172" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-defrag-software-t...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Surface pro 3 keyboard keeps acting up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zitenglim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface pro 3 keyboard keeps acting up</h2>
                    <p>I bought my&nbsp;surface pro 3 about 1.5 years ago. Ever since then, I have reset the pc 3 times, and factory reset once. all because the surface keyboard keeps refusing to work. I could be halfway through typing, and bam, suddenly it refuses to work. I've tried
 everything, restarting, force restarting, taking the keyboard off and then restarting, wiping the connectors down with all manner of solutions from advice given in the forums. Nothing fixes it but pure miracle. Nowadays when I turn on my laptop, I am expecting
 between 10-20 minutes of banging the keyboard and restarting the computer several times before the keyboard decides to start working. Before anybody asks, yes I have been checking for updates, nothing. I have never checked for updates so religiously in my
 life. If I turn off my laptop 3 times a day, I am checking for updates 3 times a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What on earth is the issue here? If the keyboard is faulty, why does it work sometimes and not others? Resetting my computer has always fixed the issue, albeit for a short amount of time (I am always waiting for the axe to fall), so does this mean it is
 an issue with the laptop's brains, so as to speak? I have never downloaded anything weird off the internet, in fact my computer now is almost devoid&nbsp;of personal stuff since at any moment I might have to reset it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, I am never purchasing a surface again. Please help. I am desperate.</p>

<p>Hi zitenglim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you are experiencing could either be a software or a hardware issue. I see that you have performed all troubleshooting you could possibly try, but we would need to check the Type Cover further to understand the problem and come up with a resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, let's try the Type Cover in the Surface UEFI. Switch off your Surface and wait until the device is completely shut down. Press and hold the Vol + button and press and release the power button. Try getting around the UEFI options using the touchpad
 or the arrow keys on the Type Cover, and check if the LED light of the Caps or Fn key will come up when pressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you encounter the problem while in the UEFI, it means that the problem is the Type Cover itself. It will be best to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact Microsoft Support</a></strong> or take your Surface to a
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Store</a></strong> for assistance regarding hardware issues. If the problem is nonexistent in the UEFI, then we would have to continue
 troubleshooting the software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot the software issue further, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Device Manager</strong> by right-clicking on Start &gt; Device Manager (Windows key + X &gt; Device Manager).</li><li>Expand <strong>Keyboards</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on&nbsp;<strong>Surface Type Cover Filter Device</strong> and choose <strong>
Uninstall device</strong>.</li><li>When asked if you would like to delete the driver software for the device, leave the box unticked.</li><li>Select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>Download and run the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong>. It will ensure that you
 have the recommended driver and firmware updates on your Surface.</li><li>After running the tool, perform a forced shutdown by pressing the power button for a full 10 seconds.</li><li>When you restart the Surface, the updates will be applied. Use the Type Cover and see if the issue has been resolved.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the steps above are unsuccessful in resolving the issue, we may need to reset the device using a recovery image. You mentioned that you have been resetting the Surface to get the Type Cover to function. Instead of the regular Windows reset, please try
 to download a recovery image specifically for your Surface Pro 3 and use it to reset the device. For the complete instructions, you can refer to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023512/surface-creating-and-using-a-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this page</a></strong>. To proceed with the download, go
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly update the post with the results of the troubleshooting. I'll be notified when you reply and I'll get back to you the soonest I can in case you need more help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>I frankly have tried all the above methods before. Contacted microsoft support about 6 months ago and they did the recovery image thing for me. As with all methods, the stupid keyboard pretends all is well for a while and then reverts back to its annoying
 problems soon after. I tried the first 2 methods yesterday, and the keyboard was the most well-behaved child. Then today it went back to not responding again. Tried the UEFI thing, didn't work today, although it worked perfectly fine yesterday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what is the issue here? Hardware? Software? I really do not want to do a recovery image (AGAIN) since I'm in the middle of school&nbsp;year now, and downloading back all my applications necessary for school is time consuming and troublesome, plus the last
 time I did it, it didn't solve anything in the long run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I bought this surface when I was in Singapore, and now I'm in UK. Can I bring this surface to a repair shop here? Is there even one in UK? All this repeated restarting and banging can't be good for it, although if it spoils I'm not sure if I will laugh
 or cry.</p>

<p>Thank you for the information. Based on the results of your troubleshooting, the issue seems to be related to hardware. Since the product was purchased in Singapore, you should
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact Microsoft Singapore</a></strong> to get service for the device. This will require you to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">register your Surface and check if it is still under warranty</a></strong>, and ship it to the service center. If you know anyone who will be traveling to Singapore
 from the United Kingdom, you can also have that person initiate the service for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that this is not the most convenient resolution for you. If there's anything else you would need, I'll be here to assist you further.</p>

            the warranty for this device has expired long ago. Does this mean that since I have to pay for any repairs, I can bring it to any repair shop in UK? Is there any in Glasgow?
