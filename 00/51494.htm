            Hi Deanna, 
<br />
<br />Let’s try these steps: 
<br />
<br />Turn off your laptop. Unplug the power source, and dislodge the battery. Push and hold the power button down for 15 seconds. This will drain any remaining juice on the motherboard that could be causing an issue. 
<br />
<br />Put the battery back in, and plug back in the charger. Once the pc is on, click start, and type “device manager” - once open, expand batteries. Right click on ONLY “Microsoft ACPI Compliant Control Method Battery” and uninstall. 
<br />
<br />Reboot. Upon reboot, go back into device manager. It should have reinstalled, but if not, click action and scan for new hardware changes and it should install. 
<br />
<br />See if your battery is now detected!
<br />- C

            Since you said you are using a non-removable battery, try the following:
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isn’t fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. It’s possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you don’t have any. If you don’t have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=outlet+tester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=s...</a>). Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system won’t be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. Slack’s Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.
<br />
<br />10. Replace Charger or Battery Module
<br />
<br />Ultimately, if you don’t see any improvements after trying all the above, then it’s maybe best that you replace either the charger or battery itself. This will require contacting your laptop manufacturer and placing an order. Batteries and the chargers are not necessarily cheap, especially if its an older system. But, if you have no choice, its something you will just have to do to get your system back in working order.

            If you have a lot of large files (music, video, movies, etc) move them to the other drive with 221GB free - after the upgrade you can move them back if you want. You can also try the two methods below.<br />
<br />
<br />
Free Up Hard Drive Space<br />
<br />
The following procedure cleans up files associated with your user account. You can also use Disk Cleanup to clean up all the files on your computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.Open Disk Cleanup by clicking the Start button. In the search box, type Disk Cleanup, and then, in the list of results, click Disk Cleanup .<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.In the Drives list, click the hard disk drive that you want to clean up, and then click OK .<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3.In the Disk Cleanup dialog box, on the Disk Cleanup tab, select the check boxes for the file types that you want to delete, and then click OK .<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.In the message that appears, click Delete files.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Reduce the amount of space allocated for System Restore.<br />
<br />
1. Start--&gt;Control Panel--&gt;System and Security--&gt;System<br />
2. Next click on the 'System protection' link located in the upper left.<br />
3. In the 'System Properties’ window click on the 'System Protection' tab.<br />
4. Locate the 'Protection Settings' box and select/click on the drive letter (usually C:)<br />
5. Now click on the 'Configure' button to change the 'Disk Space Usage' Restore Settings.<br />
6. Move the slider to the left to reduce the amount of disk space System Protection can use.<br />
7. Click the 'Apply' and then the 'OK' button after you have adjusted the disk space.<br />

            I did both of those things and I got a little farther on the installation before it stopped me again. Now I have deleted every file (music,videos,pictures etc) that I have on my computer and I got 141GB free out of 221 on my C:
<div>Is there any way I can tell windows to use my other empty drive for the installation? or what else can I do?..</div>

<p>i wouldn't suggest doing that whatsoever. taking part in these illegally modified game lobbies can result in a permanent suspension of your gamertag and/or console.</p>

<p>I agree with Ninja, might as well get in a lobby just to rank yourself back up so you can play online. Once you've got to tenth just dashboard it so you don't also have infections on. Start the game up and go in a normal game, although, that's hard to find
 these days.</p>

            <p>OP, please don't do what some people have suggested. &nbsp;Desynch has got it right. &nbsp;If you enter a 10th lobby you run the risk of being permanently banned on your account. &nbsp;Contrary to what others say, the PET members have been policing the online CoD games quite a bit lately and if they find you taking part in one of these lobbies you will be banned.</p>

In all the times I've played on Live which is 10 years now I've only ever received 1 message from a butt-hurt person and that was in MK9. I blocked, didn't respond&nbsp;and went about my gaming session and never seen or heard from that gamertag again.</p>

            Hi Casey, my name is Max and I'm an independent advisor.
<br />
<br />Please, provide me with further information so that I could help you better. I’d like to know your operating system version and build.
<br />To find out, type ‘winver’ into the Windows search box.
<br />Then, please, inform me if you were able to access the network drive before. The last question is that if you changed anything before encountered this problem.
<br />Meanwhile, I recommend that you refer to the following support article: Changes to file sharing over a network in Windows 10. I hope it will help.

<h2>            msagent characters are not transparent</h2>
                    <p>All applications that utilize msagent characters now show with a colored rectangle background (the transparent part of the BMP I suppose).&nbsp; This just started happening...all was fine a month ago.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; I am running an application
 which I purchased and if you are going to tell me msagent is deprecated don't waste your time.&nbsp; This is a bug in windows 10.</p>

<p>Hi Charlie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We understand that you're having issues with Microsoft Agent on Windows 10. As stated on this
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms695784(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>, this product support is only up to Windows 7 and may be unavailable in subsequent versions of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further queries, feel free to post back.</p>

<p>First of all "<em>Post moved by the moderator to the appropriate forum category." what does that mean?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly...any BMP with transparancy shows a colored background.&nbsp; It is not MSAgent.&nbsp; As I stated before, this is NOT AN MSAGENT Problem.&nbsp; IT STARTED WITH THE LAST UPDATE OF WINDOWS 10.&nbsp; We have a computer that is not on the internet and therefore hasn't
 been updated and that computer runs windows 10 and there are no problems with bmps.&nbsp; If you google bmps no transparency you find pages of people having this problem.&nbsp; The problem occurs with MSPaint as well as a host of third party vendors.&nbsp; What can I do
 about this problem.&nbsp; This is a windows 10 problem not a MSAGent problem.&nbsp; This is a BMP problem not a MSagent problem<em>

<p>
</p><p>Regarding your original query, we'd like to ask for a screenshot of what you are reporting so we can have a better understanding of this issue. Also, for isolation purposes, we'd like to ask if the other Windows 10 machine, which you mentioned is working
 fine, also uses Microsoft Agent. A screenshot on the said computer can also be helpful so we can compare it with the computer which is having an issue.</p>

<p>Hey, wanted some advice on how Single player vs. multiplayer works.&nbsp; Are they two unique games, can I play the single-player and go back and forth between multiplayer?&nbsp; Or should I complete the single player game first, then do MP?&nbsp; Any advice would be appreciated,
 thanks!</p>

<p>You can play single player and multiplayer whenever you want. It's probably good to do some of the single player first though if you're new to AC so that you can be good at free running and all that for escaping in the MP but other than that you can do whatever
 you like; single player then multiplayer, start with multiplayer then do single player... Variety is the spice of life.</p>

<p>The idea is basically the same. In single player you basically own everyone, stealth or no stealth. Multiplayer you apply many of the techniques you use in single player (stealth, free run, assassination) except with more of a challenge than in single player.</p>

    <title>PC will not boot, given blue screen, now given black screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c.01  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC will not boot, given blue screen, now given black screen</h2>
                    <p>Ok so this problem first started about 3 days ago. Later tonight will mark 72 hours. Let me try to track back and see what had happened and what I've already done to try and resolve these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, so my computer was getting very slow and would barely load anything. Like if I tried to search, like the start menu search it'd take ages to type. But everything I did on my browser (chrome) was fine, and without delay. So I did a check disk, and it
 proved helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, by the way the laptop is the Avatar Mercury 14'' Ultrabook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The specs are as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Version of Windows: 10.0.10240</p>
<p>Processor:&nbsp;Intel Core i5-3317U 1.7GHz</p>
<p>Video card:&nbsp;Intel HD Graphics 4000</p>
<p>Memory:&nbsp;LAP - 8GB DDR3 SO-DIMM slot x 1, Support up to 8GB DDR3 (1333MHz)</p>
<p>Hard Drive:&nbsp;500GB SATA 5400RPM + 32GB Sold State Drive</p>
<p>OS: At the time of purchase it was windows 8, but has been updated to windows 10 as of about 4 months ago. No issues has occurred such as this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chip set:&nbsp;Intel HM77 (not 100% sure if this is relevant, but it listed in the specs and I guess it may be important)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, so back to the story!! After completing the check disk it booted up perfect. I still noticed a bit of some performance issues because the PC was still a bit sluggish but not as slow as prior to checking the disk. Also note I keep the laptop on my lap
 most of my time, atop a cooling station with 2 fans so it rarely overheats. It's never hot to the touch, and is only warm at times when it is hot in the house (but it has been very cold recently). Not sure if that may be relevant, but just putting it out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I proceeded to do a system restore. It was doing this for quite some time, maybe around 1.5 hours but not quite 2 hours. It said it encountered an error and nothing was changed, but on startup the PC went into automatic repair, then then went to diagnose
 the PC. It was not able to find any issues, and was restarted. It loaded and loaded at the screen with the blue windows logos (with the four blue boxes) and the white dots going in a circle with a white background. It then proceeded to show me the blue screen
 with the "Your PC couldn't start properly." "The operating system couldn't be loaded because a critical system driver is missing or contains errors."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it listed me the suspect file and error code:</p>
<p>File: /windows/System32/drivers/tcpip.sys</p>
<p>Error code: 0xc0000098</p>
<p>
</p><p>An additional error I was given, not during the same repair, but either my second or third time doing the automatic repair a new error appeared and gave me a log file.<br />
"Log file: C:/WINDOWS/System32/Logfiles/Srt/SrtTrail.txt"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then says "You'll need to use recovery tools." Which I did. I tried everything, reset keep files, reset but remove files, another system restore, startup tools.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Oh, and I was also unable to boot into safe mode, and still can't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a bootable USB with windows 10 and was able to get the computer to run the drive by using the advanced startup options from the blue screen. I tried to the repair options, resetting both keeping my files and removing my files, and each time it failed
 (although when I ran them from the flash drive I was given the failure message much sooner than when I did it from my PC alone).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I booted into command prompt, and did the following commands which I read can sometimes fix the booting and unable to reset issues (I also performed another chkdsk :c /r /f which did not find any errors as well. This was done from command prompt as I was
 unable to get into my computer, even from safe mode).</p>
<p>bootrec /scanos</p>
<p>bootrec /fixmbr</p>
<p>bootrec /fixboot</p>
<p>bootrec /rebuildbcd</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also performed the sfc /scannow command without no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this is I feel the situation became much worse. I regret not just installing another Windows from my bootable USB on top of this version of Windows 10 which is having issues. Anyways! After performing the sfc /scannow and the bootrec commands, I restarted.
 The PC pulls up the loading type screen, says F2 for startup options or F10 for boot menu, displays the Intel Rapid Storage Information a long with the hard disk and the solid state drive info/compacities, but after this screen nothing happens. It is just
 the black screen with no cursor. The blach screen of death, if you will (I've come to believe).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been unable to enter the BIOS/boot menu to change the boot order to make the PC boot from the USB drive first. I hit the F10 and nothing happens. Even when I hit F2, you can see "Please wait..." at the bottom, but nothing happens. If I hit Ctrl+I
 at the screen directly after this, it does open the configuration settings. If I hit ctrl+alt+del, it goes back and shows me the first screen when you restart which shows you how to enter the boot menu by pressing F10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like there is nothing I can do and really do regret installing the version of windows from the flash drive on top of this corrupted version, although I have no hope at this point that it would have even worked. There were no hardware changes to this
 PC at all, I haven't upgraded it or had to change anything. I've tried to connect to an external monitor, but the same thing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and also I almost forgot, the screen will stay black for about 5-7 minutes, then it just does a restart on it's own and then returns right to the black screen. I've tried connecting a USB keyboard to try and hit the F10, thinking that that may work.
 I've also hit F10 repeatedly. I've also held the fn key and hit F10. I've hit fn, let go, and hit F10. Nothing works to try to get into the BIOS so I'm thinking the only thing I can do is just to take it to the PC repair shop to get it fixed. If that is the
 case I will probably just try to buy a new Mac OS if Windows really killed my laptop like this. I've been in love with Windows since Vista, and liked both 8 and 8.1 which is why I didn't update to 10 for the longest time, but have enjoyed it as well. Just
 from doing my research and learning more about the OS I feel I should have kept it as 8. Or even 8.1. If there is anything anyone has that can help solve my issue besides taking it to get serviced by Geeksquad or some other PC shop, your help will be 1000%
 appreciated! I feel there is another trick or two I can do to be able to use this laptop again. I don't care about my files, everything important I have backed up and there wasn't much information on this PC as well besides music, but that is all backed up
 as well. All my important documents are backed up on the google cloud. So keep this files on this PC is not of utmost importance to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again thanks for all the help in advance I hope there is something that can be done from here! I'm not very tech-savy but if it involes like removing the hard drive myself and trying to reboot it on a different machine, I am very capable of doing that. I
 also follow directions very closely and if there is something I don't understand I will ask questions to clarify rather than going into the fix blindly, causing more issues! Thank you! Also sorry for any typos or grammatical errors in this... I have been doing
 anything and everything to prevent myself from pulling my hair out and I'm surprised I haven't throw it out the window yet, but I am still hopeful I can use this PC again soon!</p>

<p>Still not successful. I am not able to enter the BIOS at all to try a clean install from a bootable USB device. Even if I let the computer try all night, I still wake up to it just in a restart loop. It is quite frustrating.</p>

<p>Also note I only started getting the black screen after I had tried to fix the bcd from command prompt.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Also, with my black screen there is no cursor. If I use the function keys to turn off the display I can tell it does work, because there is absolutely no light. When I hit it again it returns to the normal black screen I have after rebooting. Also,
 there is no loading going on, I mean the little circles that rotate in a circle. It's just pure black screen.</p>

<p>Yeah it tells me to hit F2 to enter System Utilities or F10 to enter Boot Menu. When F2 is hit it says "Please wait..." but nothing happens after the screen with the Hard Drive info and such. If I hit F10 nothing happens as well. I think I will be taking
 it to the shop tomorrow to see what the issue is. It will only cost be about $80 so that is much cheaper than having to buy an entire new laptop. Regardless if they're able to save my files or not I just hope it is able to get be resolved and I am able to
 boot up my precious ultrabook. Thanks for all the excellent help and advice, Mr. Carmack! I will definitely keep you updated if there are any changes and what the repair shop has to do to fix it, if I am unable to fix it myself before then (which I doubt).
 My thinking is they will just remove the hard drive and wipe it on another system. Like I said saving the files on the hard drive isn't of utmost importance to me as I have most my important documents backed up on cloud or google drive and have been able to
 access that on my other PC. Cheers!</p>

<p>When you can't enter BIOS/UEFI Setup or trigger the boot menu, you can unplug the hard drive to try it to compare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that fails you can clear the CMOS to see if that resets it:&nbsp; http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/tp/clearcmos.htm</p>

<h2>            Thunderbird Mail - All accounts deleted in recent W10 update</h2>
                    <p>The recent update of W10 total wiped out the 3 email accounts that I have been using in Thunderbird.</p>
<p>When the program was started after the update Thunderbird is a total blank like I installed it for the 1st time. I had numerous emails filed in various files for each of the accounts as well as important information in the "local files".</p>
<p>Can anyone help me get this information back? I have looked in the windows.old file and there is nothing there related to Thunderbird accounts, not even the address book.</p>

            <p><strong>Problems Solved </strong>I found a link somewhere that indicated that after an update computer may be signed on with a temporary ID. That would be why all previous settings were missing. This can be confirmed by going the Accounts
 -Sync your settings where it will indicate that you cannot sync because you are using a temporary signon.</p>
<p>Simply restart your computer and signon with your Microsoft ID.</p>
Thanks everyone.

<h2>            Lag spikes&#47;disconnection for 5-10 seconds every 30 minutes &#40;exactly&#41; while playing games - Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p><p><br /></p>



<p>I couldn't find the appropriate place to post this, so i just tried here, i apologise if this isn't the correct place.</p>



<p>For the past few months, I've been getting strange lag spikes that occur every 30 minutes exactly. I use a wireless connection and when i try to use a wired connection, it's even worse - it doesn't just lag every 30 minutes, it also disconnects me from any game that i'm playing right after the lag.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>This impacts my game&nbsp;play drastically. Especially when i play games like Call of Duty, during the lag spike, there's nothing i can do until it passes. And this is causing me to be unable to enjoy the games that i play. I've tried all sorts of troubleshooting methods, resetting my router to factory settings, resetting my console to factory settings. I've even tried altering some of the settings on my router such as, changing my wireless channel and changing the Advertisement Period on my UPnP settings. This was a temporary fix for about 2 weeks, but it started happening again about a week ago.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>I suppose the reason why i'm posting this is to ask you guys, do you have any suggestion or even solutions&nbsp;as to what might be causing this to happen?&nbsp;My last resort is to purchase a new Xbox, but i don't want to do this unless it's a problem with the Xbox One&nbsp;itself.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>Thanks in advance,</p><p><br /></p>



<p>P.S. The warranty on my Xbox One has expired.</p>

            <p>From the sounds of it you may have problems with your line, every few years the phone line that leaves my house gets hit branches from trees, this rubs the protective shielding off and then causes earthing problems.</p><p><br /></p><p>Something you can do is pick your phone up and dial 1, this will give you a window of ten seconds or so where you should hear nothing, if you hear crackling then its definitely your phone line that is at fault and you'll have to call your provider to come out and fix it.</p>

<h3> netv&#246;ktunehf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 having problems on boot from shutdown. But everything is ok on restart.</h2>
                    <p>So,</p>
<p>This is strange.</p>
<p>Im almost up to the point to buy new hard drive and start from scratch. But there must be a simple solution im just not seeing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>The problem:</strong></span></p>
<p>When ever I "<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">shutdown</span></strong>" computer and start computer up again I get a winload.efi error code 0xc00000e9 "An unexpected I/O error has occurred"</p>
<p>This does not happen if I restart the computer.</p>
<p>So if I get the error , all I have to do is hit CTRL+ALT+DEL and the computer will start into windows normally.</p>
<p>But if I do shutdown computer then it comes up with this strange problem.... Or if I do hard-shutdown(hold down power button few seconds) I get this error.........</p>
<p>Or if the computer runs out of battery, then I get the problem :-)</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Solutions tried:</strong></span></p>
<p>I have deleted windows.old to start with.</p>
<p>I have disabled Secure boot.</p>
<p>chkdsk /f c: (no issues)</p>
<p>sfc /scannow&nbsp;(no issues)</p>
<p>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth (finished with success..)</p>
<p>windows update to most recent</p>
<p>ran DELL support for all kinds of tests and updates</p>
<p>I have booted into recovery env. and issued the following commands (<em>see image for results</em>)</p>
<ul>
<li>bootrec /scanos</li><li>bootrec /rebuildbcd</li><li>bootrec /fixmbr</li><li>bootrec /fixboot</li></ul>

<p>its strange that it does not find any windows installations, because I can c: into the drive and browse all the windows files....</p>
<p>When I do fixboot, it gives me Access Denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a company computer and the user does not use it for anything else than work related so I don't think this is a virus.. Its a brand new Dell 5580 with M.2 disk if that is relevant.</p>
<p>The computer only has one disk and there are No usb devices attached...</p>
<p>There are no see'able errors when using the computer on a day to day basis....</p>
<p>But the user has had this happen to him few times and i wasnt able to help him over the phone .. this is the second&nbsp; time he brings in the computer. First time I thought I had fixed everything , but now I really need to fix this permanently :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So.... im running out of ideas.... Has anyone any kind of solutions.... ?</p>
<p>I can boot into windows and fetch any kind of logs if required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance :-))</p>

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>We are experiencing a similar possibly related issue where surface pro threes that are moved onto a Microsoft Surface Pro docking station don't connect to the wired internet properly and transition.&nbsp; Sometimes when this happens it combines with the above
 problem and they get no connectivity, other times the connectivity appears to stay wifi connected, and that is - obviously - slower than their wired connection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer above questions these are new surface pro 3's in a Microsoft windows domain environment. They have all the windows updates applied.&nbsp; This is happening on more than one SP3 in our environment.&nbsp; We are using the MS Docking station - not a third party
 one.</p>

            <p>Clare,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The end user has engaged a Microsoft support rep and&nbsp;2 docking stations are being shipped out. I am skeptical this will solve the problem, but that's where we are right now.&nbsp; If it were just one station that would be one thing, but there are two stations
 exhibiting the same behavior.&nbsp; We have:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;* Confirmed that the tablet charges when docked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;* Swapped out patch cables</p>
<p>&nbsp;* Double checked that all required and optional patches are installed via windows update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;* Confirmed that the device for the network card is simply not there when the problem occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;* Other peripherals (additional monitors, keyboard, etc) work properly when docked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe you have a firmware problem with Surface Pro's that make them unreliable.&nbsp; If the replacement docking stations don't fix the problem the end user is going to ask to return the units for full credit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>We had the same problem on SP2 docks.</p>

            <p>I believe so but I can ask our tech. Even if this work around works tt shouldn't be necessary. People shouldn't be losing connection in the middle of the day or under normal use.&nbsp; The whole point of the dockings station is you leave it always plugged in
 and just connect/disconnect the surface.</p>

            <p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10 and now the Surface Ethernet Adapter is missing from the list of Network Connections (Network and Sharing Center). The adapter is listed in the Device Manager with the following Hardware ID:&nbsp;USB\VID_045E&amp;PID_07C6. &nbsp; I also
 have a docking station with Hardware ID:&nbsp;USB\VID_045E&amp;PID_07C6&amp;REV_3000<br />
</p>
<p>I can't understand why it isn't listed in the Network and Sharing Center and how to get it back. I'm able to connect to Wifi no problem. However, while at work, I want to connect to the Network using the Ethernet cable and I'm not able to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider myself to be pretty tech savvy, but please provide solutions that are easy to understand. Some of the technical mumbo jumbo I read on this site is way above my skill set.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t progress beyond &#34;Starting Windows&#34; screen</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron N5110, which used to have Windows 7 Home Basic. Since the Windows 10 upgrade came, I updated the BIOS and installed Windows 10. It didn't seem to work too well with my System, so I decided to revert to Windows 7 and tried installing
 it. The installation seemed to be successful, but when I restarted my laptop it won't progress beyond Starting windows screen. I tried opening it Safe mode, but I get an error message saying "Windows cannot complete installation in Safe mode". This problem
 has rendered my laptop completely unusable for quite sometime now. Any help regarding this will be appreciated

<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Ahmad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What kind of reset did you perform (Hard reset or a Soft reset)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that the issue still persists, please try to do a Hard reset if you had already done a soft reset and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The hard reset will bring your phone back to factory settings, the same state as when the device was first turned on. All apps, messages, media, personal settings, etc. will
 be removed from the phone. If backup is turned on under Settings, you can restore your apps and settings after performing a hard reset (as long as you initialize the phone with the same Microsoft Account). Please perform a hard reset by following the below
 link:</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Please note that resetting your device will not remove any OS or firmware updates. You will remain on the same version of Windows Phone after the reset.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>
A hard reset will delete all your data and programs in your device. Please back up all your data to prevent data loss and ensure that you have all the necessary permissions needed to reinstall your programs and applications.</span></p>

<h2>            Samsung ATIV 9 NP940X5J touchpad doesn&#39;t work after Windows 10 clear install</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I was on W10TP&nbsp;as update to W8.1&nbsp;for a long time and touchpad works as expected. With RTM&nbsp;ISO available&nbsp;I decided to make clear installation of W10RTM. Starting from the first seconds of installation and till now (I do install all updates)&nbsp;touchpad
 is unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went to OEM site and install "Samsung Update" SW (I didn't want to install any third party, but there was no choice) and try to install Touchpad Driver (v. 10.43.56.83). It fails with next error: "mxtbootbridge requires an x64 processor error".&nbsp;Yes,
 I do have x64 processor and OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this? Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW It's one of the best Windows touchpad on the market and it's strange not to support it "out of installation".</p>
