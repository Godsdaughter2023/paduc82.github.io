<h2>            Username and password is incorrect</h2>
                    My Outlook email account has been disabled for several days.&nbsp; Suddenly when I would sign in it would tell me my password or username was incorrect.&nbsp; They are not incorrect.&nbsp; I have had the same username and password for several years and had no problems
 with Hotmail.&nbsp; Now it is Outlook and I cannot find a way to solve this.<br />
<br />
I have tried to ask for a reset from Outlook by requesting sending a code to my phone or calling my phone, however I never receive a code or a call.&nbsp; I have filled out the form twice and received a response the first time.&nbsp; They asked for more information.&nbsp;
 I sent it.&nbsp; I have not received a response back (its way past the 24 hours suggested time for a response).&nbsp; I tried submitting the form for the third time and it wouldn't submit.&nbsp; I have had it!!!!<br />
<br />
I am using a friend's email account to type this and they are sending it for me.&nbsp; I am ready to just delete my account and start with another email system, however I will lose all contacts and everything I've collected over several years.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Dave<br />

<h2>            Auto-updating Linked data between excel and powerpoint</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am able to link an excel graph to powerpoint&nbsp;using copy and paste+special. When I do this, the graph I copied automatically updates to corresponding changes made in excel. However, when I save both files and exit them, the link breaks? After re-opening
 both files, the update feature doesn't work properly. I have to manually update the link by right clicking the graph (in the powerpoint slide)&nbsp;and selecting update link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to automatically update the linked data between excel and powerpoint without having to do it manually?</p>
<p>Will the update work when powerpoint is in presentation mode?</p>
                </div>

            <p>Hello Dan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your response, as it did help. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am curious to see if it is possible to have the presentation run on a&nbsp;loop and have the graphs update when the excel data changes. The powerpoint would be open on one computer while the excel file is on another. The two files will be in a shared folder
 between the computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can&nbsp;the update occur when the slide is in presentation? Can it be automatic with changing information on the excel file?</p>

            You are right, so far PC Suite has no idea that BlueSoleil exists in your PC, it is only aware that there is Microsoft Bluetooth (but that most likely does not work with your dongle, the hardware).<br />
<br />
Make sure you have at least 1.6.x versio of BlueSoleil, earlier version are not compatible with Pc Suite.<br />
<br />
Then you can try to manually uninstall PC Suite, boot PC and reinstall PC Suite, that may help PC Suite to discover that BlueSoleil is present.<br />
If it does not help, try:<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.bluesoleil.com/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=13&amp;PN=1#<br />
They have a forum at it seems there are users who experience same, so maybe you find answer there.<br />
<br />
Try also google: "Windows Xp SP2 Bluesoleil problem" you get links<br />
<br />
You will get it working I am sure, but the main problem is the conflict between Microsoft Bluetooth and the Bluesoleil.

            Manta, Ive had a look on the websites that you have advised and Im still struggling to find how to sort it out. People seem to have the same or similiar problems but there don't seem to be any proper solution to the problem. I have asked others and no
 one seems to really know. So far your my only hope.

            Thanks to Seraphim, I should read more carefully, the BlueSoleil IVT version should be more up to date, so Kimbo can you try to find out if you can have your BlueSoleil driver updated ?<br />
<br />
(To be honest, if you like to use Bluetooh, I would buy a dongle that is compatible with Microsoft Bluetooth, it would be easier)<br />
<br />
This is difficult, because I don't use BlueSoleil myself. It seems that there is even a version of 2.x in here:<br />
http://www.bluesoleil.com/download/index.asp?topic=bluesoleil_edr<br />
<br />
It seems that there are many links were users suggest where to get 1.6.1 version, but they don't work, so maybe the 2.x version is an update (and hopefully thus even better than 1.6)<br />
<br />
So Kimbo, can you try and update to that version ?<br />
<br />
(uninstall PC Suite first), update your Bluetooth to 2.x and then reinstall PC Suite (version 6.7)<br />
<br />
<br />
Then I found this text in Forum Nokia discussion board:<br />
(http://discussion.forum.nokia.com/forum/showthread.php?t=69685)<br />
I have been trying for the last few days to get my son's 6230i to connect to the PC. I too have a Bluesoleil bluetooth adaptor which recognises the phone but the NOKIA PC suite didn't. After reading around the web I have found the problem and then the solution
 - it all has to do with the bluetooth stack included with Windows XP SP2 which is not overwritten when you install the Bluesoleil drivers. You have to rename the original file and then it will get overwritten. To do this:<br />
<br />
1. Click Start, click Run, type %windir%\inf in the Open box, and then click OK.<br />
2. Right-click Bth.inf, and then click Rename.<br />
3. Rename Bth.inf to Bth.bak, and then press ENTER.<br />
4. Install the Bluesoleil driver.<br />
<br />
I downloaded the up-to-date driver from Bluesoleil's website (not sure if I had to, but I did). This is the "BlueSoleil_1.6.1.4_release_050606.zip" on the support/downloads section of the website. When I ran and installed it, I noticed that for the first time
 the Nokia suite had an animated graphic showing radio waves and then it found my phone!!<br />
<br />
Transfering files to the applications/collection folder is now possible

<h2>            Connect hotmail accounts lost</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope you are able to help me out.</p>
<p>I used to have 2 hotmail accounts. And I used to switch easy from the one hotmail account to the next by clicking on the right hand site on the profile button. Then I could choose the account I wanted to visit and came in the inbox from that account.
</p>
<p>(so slightly different from alias)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I can't see the other account under my profile setting anymore. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any one knows how to connect them again?<br />
I don't want to use alias because one account is used for my private mail and the other one for amongst others the sports club.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>hope to hear from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Renate</p>

            Why then is Outlook/Hotmail.com still try to facilitate the linking of hotmail accounts if the function has been disabled?
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">" It looks like you're trying

 make switching between them fast and easy.&nbsp;"</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>This leads to a 404.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Similarly, why can I click on the option to set up forwarding, then pay to have MS send me a code in order to verify my account, then still not have the supposed additional options available? I've now verified both of my accounts twice.&nbsp;</div>

<div>I rarely use these addresses, but I would very much like to connect or merge them somehow. &nbsp;One is associated with my more-heavily used Skydrive. &nbsp;The other was created during the few weeks I struggled to make Windows 8 work (and after failing, had to

<p>I understand the challenge you are having with your account. For now, that is the only workaround we have, in continuing to protect customer's account after the linked account feature was deleted which have been provided by our MVP and previous moderator,
 since you have mentioned that&nbsp;alias is not an option for you.</p>

<br />
<div>Andro, a workaround is not the issue.</div>
<div>The problem is that I'm being presented with options and I'm performing operations which are apparently related to Outlook.com options that are no longer available.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would be perfectly satisfied if I was able to click on the "Try linking your Outlook accounts together" link and it took me to a page where I was able to actually link my Outlook accounts together. And I would be very happy if I verified my account with
 a texted code number and subsequently found that my account was in fact verified, instead of being told again and again that I [still] need to verify my account in order to use additional options.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It would also seem reasonable to me if these options- to follow a link to connect my Outlook accounts, to have verification code texted to my phone- were simply not manifest in Outlook.com at all, unless they are related to real, current functionality.&nbsp;</div>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot add my own image rendition to my publishing feature enabled site. I am site collection admin and sharepoint admin with maximum permissions in SP. I get access denied(Sorry but you dont have access to this site) when trying to add my custom image
 rendition and also when i try to edit one of the existing image renditions. I've tried to give my owner all the diffrent kinds of permission levels, nothing works. Is image renditions some kind of hidden list? How do i fix this?</p>

            <p>Hi LuluAB,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try the following suggestions to help us narrow down the issue:</p>

<h2>            About updated e mail account.</h2>
                    My skype account opened with an windowslive account. After a while I have updated my skype account with new e mail account and I have closed the old e mail account. Today microsoft has closed the&nbsp; e mail account and my skype account has been closed automatically.
 So I need support for that because I have lost all contact list. What can I do about this issue?

            Hi Wendy,<br />
<br />
No matter if the meeting is a Skype for Business meeting or not, we need to use Outlook to create it.&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>When you’re a delegate of your boss, you can add his calendar in your Outlook client or OWA. Next time you create a meeting, you can choose to save the meeting in your boss’s calendar. Then a meeting request shows you’re delegate your boss will be sent.
</p>
<p>You can refer to this article: <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Calendar-delegation-in-Outlook-on-the-web-for-business-532e6410-ee80-42b5-9b1b-a09345ccef1b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p>
<br />
<br />
I notice that you’d like to share with us the error message but the information isn’t listed in the post. Please share with us the complete message.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Share with us the detailed steps about how you make yourself as the delegate.&nbsp;<br />
Also share with us the detailed steps about how you tried to create a meeting on behalf of your boss. With these two point, we’d like to perform a test in our lab.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In addition, did it work well before? What if there's another person who are also the delegate as your boss? We'd like to konw if the issue is account related. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Brook&nbsp;

            If signing in to your MSA does not help, be aware that the Community was broken by a software update yesterday.&nbsp; All kinds of problems have been persistent for some users and intermittent for others.&nbsp; The moderators have been in a conversation for two
 days about it.&nbsp; We all wait to see when it is fixed.&nbsp; There is a discussion of this elsewhere in this forum and in the Community Participation Center forum where reports of problems with the site are reported.

            I tried to give Julia an extra hint because she uses W7 so maybe it will help you too.&nbsp; I will guess that you have SysInternalsSuite installed?&nbsp; Then in ProcExp do a Ctrl-F for mscommunity&nbsp; or&nbsp;in a command window where SysInternalsSuite is enter&nbsp; handle.exe&nbsp;
 mscommunity&nbsp;&nbsp; Do this when you have a Reply frame open (i.e, when you would be expecting to see the Answers Editor's toolbar buttons.

    <title>Excel 2016 &#34;Save As&#34; is terrible&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vr tc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2016 &#34;Save As&#34; is terrible&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Excel 2016 updated a couple of weeks ago and I've been fighting the "save as" screen ever since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, it tried to default all save actions to the Cloud. &nbsp;It took a while but I figured out how to disable that. &nbsp;Now, however, when I click "Save As" after creating a new sheet, the location options bear no relationship to my recent activity and they are
 static. &nbsp;The folder locations listed below the "save" entry boxes are program or template folders. &nbsp;The "more options" button has the same function as "browse" - why repeat the same action on the same screen a few inches apart? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried "Add a Place", thinking maybe I could get my "favorites" or "quick access" or even "recent places" to be quickly available, but that is not an option, apparently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE tell me how to get ALL the Office 2016 applications to return to their previous "save as" behavior, which was generally to bring up my most recently used folders. I hate wasting time re-navigating to my save locations every time I copy a file or create
 a new one! &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Really, if it were that easy I would have done that weeks ago. &nbsp;The default file location will not accept the Quick Access or Recent Files locations. &nbsp;It wants a static directory location. Unfortunately, those of us who use Office 60 hours a week between
 work, grad school, and personal needs use a more robust organization system than that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just saying - it would be nice to have the option to click Quick Access or Recent from the Save As backstage. &nbsp;A couple of clicks may seem like a little thing, but when you have to use the same ones, over and over day after day... &nbsp;The thing that finally
 won me over to the ribbon was realizing how many clicks were saved by the ribbon format - so let's not go backward!</p>

            Microsoft has an atrocious history for taking out features that end-users find useful and replacing them with features they think the end-users would find more useful or are part of a new technological trend (in this case, cloud computing.) &nbsp;Often, though,
 the changes have more to do with Microsoft's overall marketing strategy to gain market share in a new or growing market segment, and nothing at all to do with what makes a product more useful for the end-users or allows end-users to work more efficiently.
 Don't expect this to change anytime soon. They are a market focused company, not a customer focused company -- that is, whatever will drive up their market share comes first, customer needs and wants? Second. The only reason they have such dominance with Office
 is due to its near monopolistic stranglehold on that particular market as well as its ability to litigate to death any upstart which might try to enter the market with anything remotely similar or competitive.

<p>I had this problem fixed in September 2017.</p>
<p>There was a recent upgrade, and now "Save As" does not work.</p>
<p>All older files are now "Read Only"; when I try to Save As with a new name,</p>
<p>Excel reports that file is saved, BUT it cannot open.</p>
<p>When I locate and try to open, the message is ... changed or deleted&nbsp; ...</p>
<p>and there is no help to find the new file.</p>

            Add Save As to the Quick Access Toolbar.&nbsp; With one click, it opens directly to the file structure you see when you click File &gt; Save As &gt; More options... (or Browse).

<h3> zohayer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lumia 925 Discussions</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Realizing the lack of information out there, I have started this thread to cater to the needs of all the Lumia 925 owners out there, including me.</p>
<p>So let's talk, eat &amp; love Lumia 925 here and bring all issues, suggestions, observations, updates, tricks, ideas &amp; everything appropos to Lumia 925 over here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as of yet the main idea that prompted me to head out is the infamous&nbsp;<strong>POWER KEY</strong> issue with most Lumias, especially the Lumia 925.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know if this is a Software issue or a hardware one.</p>
<p>I think it had been occuring before I updated to WP 8.1 plus the fact that the power key does feel pressed-in sort of, indicates that it is more of a hardware issue.</p>
<p>I have also once reset the phone (without using the computer tool), and the problem persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unlike the Lumia 520, Lumia 925 can't be opened at home, so there isn't much I can do at home.</p>
<p>Therefore, my question to Nokia folks reading this post is,&nbsp;<strong>What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>There is one more thing, I bought my device about 6 months ago from a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
country different than my residential country</span>. Is my warranty covered in this scenario?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I bought this phone, I had several other Android options. But I chose what I chose because of Nokia. I trust this brand for its hardware durability and software sensefulness. I don't care if its Symbian, Android or Windows Phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I have to admit I am&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>DISAPPOINTED</strong></span>. Because apart from this issue that is hindering the daily usage. There are a couple other hardware problems. But they only make sounds &amp;&nbsp;clicks and don't
 interfere with the phone by rendering it unable to be turned-on or off, let's not discuss them yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply as soon as possible and defend yourself to your consumers. Otherwise you have already lost your battle to Microsoft at least save your legacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hmmm. Well you are lucky. I am not saying there's a issue with every device out there. It's just that there are lots of them. Plus, other models have the issue as well. They (Nokia) should improve their TQM process, if they have one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the solution, I can't return to the country of purchase right away just for this. So apparently I have to bear this for another 4-5 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's just hopeless. The phone if powered off (automatically due to battery depletion) turns itself on when plugged in for charging. Even if there was a way to turn that feature off, I can't risk it because that might leave me with a useless piece of aluminum
 &amp; plastic.</p>
<p>However, if someone knows a way to turn this feature off&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>AND</strong></span> turn the phone on using the data cable &amp; computer suite, then please share it.</p>
<p>This will help clear the doubts about software vs hardware issue.</p>

            It is intended for phone to power up when connected to a charger. He is no workaround for this. Some people activate and deactivate flight mode to go some way towards not being fully on when charging.

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been able to summarize 2 things</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Right now, as of yet, it's not clear who is our (Nokia Owners) real manufacturer/provider/culprit :cursing: The hardware was manufactured by Nokia, software by Windows Phone (who are quite well known for their customer support &amp; solutions
 to software glitches), and none of them bothers to cater to the customers &amp; avoid their responsibility by launching useless discussion forms like this very one.</p>
<p>These days, however, even they themselves apparently don't know <strong>who owns what &amp; whom</strong>.</p>
<p>I contacted a Windows Phone support &amp; tried to put me in a loop hole by suggesting a ...... yup you guessed it, ........... the solution to all software bugs, ...................... the PANADOL to all diseases, ................ the infamous FACTORY RESET.
 But realizing that I had already tried it, he bounced me away to a Microsoft help line link while promising that I would find a chat option there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Now this is where we get to realize our second fact,&nbsp;when it comes to phone market, these days, we&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>CONSUMERS</strong></span> are pretty much&nbsp;<strong>fcukde up</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I don't expect I need to explain the Nokia or now the <strong>Nokia-less Microsoft Windows Phone 8.1 Lumia</strong>&nbsp;:confused::blink: product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second option is pretty much every other brand that is going crazy over the Annnndrooooid&nbsp;:whistling::smileysurprised::w00t::thumbup: . The &nbsp;main reason I wanted to try something different, something better. The curse that has destroyed innovation, or the
 element of surprise by taking over all the phones out there and making them look alike. What's the point now if a Lenovo looks or feels exactly the way a Samsung does.&nbsp;We need variety.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thirdly, we don't have enough cash for the iPhone neither are we hippies for Steve. So there goes that option as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, Blackberry, well what the ..........</p>

<h2>            How do I stop IE from restarting itself&#63; Every time I close the IE window, it reopens by itself.</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 10. For a while now, every time I close the Internet Explorer, it restarts by itself, many time, closing other programs that I just opened. It's really annoying! I do not get any error messages or anything like that. It's just that little
 window that says something like "Internet Explorer is restarting". If I close it, I want it close. I have to close it several times, before it stops restarting itself.
</p>
<p>I didn't find anyone else with the same problem in the Microsoft discussions.</p>
<p>Thank you to whomever can help me with this.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to determine the possible cause of the issue, may we know if there were any changes made on your PC prior to this? Does it only occur with Internet Explorer? Meanwhile, we might need to check or change some settings in Internet Explorer to help resolve
 your concern. Let's try the following methods:</p>
<p>

<h2>            Splitting different contacts from an email thread.</h2>
                    I have an email from one client that showed up in the middle of an email chain of another client. I am trying to split up the conversations so that I have 2 different emails. Right now they all show up in one line on my inbox and I can click a small arrow
 to drop down all the different emails in the chain, but I don't see a way to remove or separate the rouge email. I have never sent a group email or any email with both of them as the recipients , but for some reason they are showing up in the same email chain
 and I need to find a way to seperate them into two different emails. Thanks

            <p><span>Hi Michael,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In Office 365, if emails appear in the same conversation view, we cannot split them into different email threads. Thanks for your understanding.</span></p>
<p><span>As a workaround, if you are using the Outlook client (for Windows), you can click the arrow button to expand the email thread, double click the email you received from your client (last sending from your client not you). Then select the message subject
 and change it to a different one, click the save button, the email thread with the new subject will be in a different thread.</span></p>
<p><span>Please note that the new email thread will still be in the original thread after changing the subject as it is not actually split out.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand it would be nice if we have such a feature in Office 365. </span>
<span>Therefore, I suggest you submit feedback about the feature via the link below:</span></p>

            Office Pro Plus is a very limited distribution bundle. Exactly how did you get / buy it?  There are 2 legitimate ways for you to get it. 
<br />
<br />But it also happens that Pro Plus is the most commonly bootlegged version of Office. 
<br />
<br />Let us know how you got it, then we can provide specific suggestions.

    <title>PRINTING FROM VISIO - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnd-kei  say:</h3>
<h2>            PRINTING FROM VISIO</h2>
                    <p>I am new to Visio and am using 2010.&nbsp; My task is to attempt to use existing AutoCAD-generated information and insert it into Visio in order to add smart shapes, etc.&nbsp; My problems are as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Inersting an AutoCAD 2005 drawing is nearly impossible, takes forever&nbsp;and disappears after insertion.&nbsp; That being said, we've decided to use PDF's/TIFFS/JPGS, so</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; After inserting these easily and quickly (Visio allows this nicely), we've found that their printing is horrendous in our app.&nbsp; I am attempting prining to a Sharp AR-M205 (ID# L3453).&nbsp; All the plots are of poor quality, some much worse than others.&nbsp;
 I've attempted all the formats above.&nbsp; With the JPG's, I've even tried varying the pixel settings allowed in the AutoCAD print setup menu with minor success.&nbsp; Then, I've had to "tweak" the parameters in the sheet shape dialog as a trial and errror and that
 showed some minor improvements as well, but the print quality is still not at the same quality as if printing the Visio document it self, or the CAD drawing itself.&nbsp; I did have a modicum of success converting a pdf to a word document (.doc), but the print
 came out "fuzzy" and was difficult to size and&nbsp; could not be "tweaked" like the JPG's.&nbsp; So, after 3 days of this trial and error, it was decided to attempt to contact you "experts" to ascertian whether there is a printer driver download we can aquire to improve
 the print quality, or, if there is another solution you might suggest.</p>

            <p>Print Preview versus actual Print output is something to compare.&nbsp; Some drivers do work better than others.</p>
<p>However, introducing conversions is almost always going to introduce fidelty loss.&nbsp; Especially with JPG, which is a compressed format by default. If the JPG from AutoCAD looks good when you zoom in using a viewer, and also looks good when you zoom in with
 Visio, then try checking in the Printer options for a way to retain the graphic fidelity, perhaps.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Also, in Visio, there is a Picture Compression function that you can check, as it might be automatically compressing the JPG imports.&nbsp; Select one of the images in the drawing, and the Picture Tools ribbon should appear.&nbsp; Select the Format tab, and then
 click on the expander at the bottom right of the Adjust group on the left to open the Format Picture dialog.&nbsp; Select the Compression tab in the dialog, and make sure that "Compress pictures" is Unchecked, and also make sure that the "Change Resolution" option
 is set to "No Change", and click OK to save.&nbsp; You will want to do this to each picture if it helps your print output, as it is saved for each item and there is no blanket "Change all pictures".&nbsp;&nbsp; (If you have multiple pictures on the same drawing page, you
 can multi-select them and apply the changes to them all at once.&nbsp; This is not possible for images on separate pages).</p>
<p>Having said all of that, I am concerned that you are seeing so many issues in trying to save the CAD drawing from AutoCAD 2005 to use in Visio 2010.&nbsp; You should be able to import and convert CAD files saved from AutoCAD 2005.&nbsp; When you say they 'disappear',
 that is a problem.&nbsp; However, I have seen the CAD file relocate after importing/conversion.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Try these steps with one of your simpler drawings:</p>
<p>1. Open a blank drawing in the format you want to use (scaled page, standard letter size, whatever you like)</p>
<p>2. Go to the Insert tab, and select the CAD Drawing option</p>
<p>3. Browse to your DWG file and select it, click Open</p>
<p>4. In the CAD Drawing Properties dialog, you can see the suggested scale that Visio will import with, you can change this later as well - but go ahead and set it as desired. Click OK to insert in your drawing.</p>
<p>5. By default, the drawing object should be centered in the drawing view.&nbsp; If it doesn't appear to be present, try zooming out in the drawing using the Zoom Out option on the bottom bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- TIP: One way to see if you are zoomed out as far as your largest object is to use Select All (Ctrl-A) to select every object on the drawing page.&nbsp; Then keep zooming out until you can see all of the highlighted objects.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is the issue, but it's worth a try.&nbsp; If you can figure out the import method for your CAD DWG files, you will have a much better print output.</p>
<p>By the way - are you creating files in the actual AutoCAD 2005 application, or in another application that creates DWG files in the 2005 format?&nbsp; You can also try saving the files as "DXF" instead of "DWG", and see if you can import those as a work around.&nbsp;Visio
 supports up to AutoCAD 2007 format for both of these files, as far as I know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3> blakecarstensen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel Calculation request</h2>
                    <p>Good Day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm developing a Request For Information (RFI) workbook. Each worksheet is a new RFI. on each worksheet there is the option to ask one to five questions. Upon receiving the response, there is a field for each question to input the received date. Since one
 RFI may have multiple questions, we may get each answer on different days (upto five different days), but most often the same day. This revived date is then compared using this formula =NETWORKDAYS(J17,J18) which calculates if there was a delay from the acceptable
 date that we provided to receive the questions i.e. we outlined June 1, 2016 would be acceptable, the answer came in June 2, 2016 results in a 1 day delay not including weekends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These auto calculated fields are located at J19, J28, J37, J46 &amp; J55. If there is only one question asked, then only J19 is expected to display a result, the others will snow " #N/A "</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the bottom of the RFI page, I want a formula within a cell to displays the longest delay out of the questions (upto 5 questions).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>i.e. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 1 = zero day delay</p>
<p>Question 2 = 3 day delay</p>
<p>Question 3 = 1 day delay</p>
<p>Question 4 = 5 day delay</p>
<p>Question 5 = " #N/A " as there was no 5th question filled out</p>

    <title>Interactive Powerpoint Presentation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mirrormn00  say:</h3>
<h2>            Interactive Powerpoint Presentation</h2>
                    I would like to create an interactive powerpoint presentation whereas an individual user can input information and VBA manipulate it to return individual results. I have a few macro's I've found and a few I've developed, but what I really want to be able
 to do is have an "Input Box" already on the screen and instead of returning the results in a Message Box it would appear on a slide as a paragraph. (along with other paragraphs based on other information entered previously). Is this even possible or am I asking
 too much?<br />

            It sounds possible BUT you have to be much clearer about <strong>EXACTLY</strong> what you want to happen. Maybe post a sample slide somewhere.<br />

            <p>Hi John. You responded to one of my earlier posts about this same thing. You wrote me this program:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sub chexName()<br />
Dim strName As String<br />
Dim i As Integer<br />
Dim lngResult As Long<br />
strName = InputBox("Please enter your first name.")<br />
strName = UCase(strName)<br />
For i = 1 To Len(strName)<br />
lngResult = lngResult + GetAlphaValue(Mid(strName, i, 1))<br />
Next i<br />
While lngResult &gt; 9<br />
lngResult = SumDigits(lngResult)<br />
Wend<br />
MsgBox lngResult<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Function SumDigits(lngNum As Long) As Long<br />
Dim i As Integer<br />
For i = 1 To Len(lngNum)<br />
SumDigits = SumDigits + Val(Mid(lngNum, i, 1))<br />
Next i<br />
End Function</p>
<p>
</p><p>Function GetAlphaValue(strAlphabet As String) As Integer<br />
&nbsp;Select Case strAlphabet<br />
&nbsp;Case "A", "J", "S"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetAlphaValue = 1<br />
&nbsp;Case "B", "K", "T"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetAlphaValue = 2<br />
&nbsp;Case "C", "L", "U"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetAlphaValue = 3<br />
&nbsp;Case "D", "M", "V"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetAlphaValue = 4<br />
&nbsp;Case "E", "N", "W"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetAlphaValue = 5<br />
&nbsp;Case "F", "O", "X"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetAlphaValue = 6<br />
&nbsp;Case "G", "P", "Y"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetAlphaValue = 7<br />
&nbsp;Case "H", "Q", "Z"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetAlphaValue = 8<br />
&nbsp;Case "I", "R"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetAlphaValue = 9</p>
<p>&nbsp;Case Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GetAlphaValue = 0 </p>
<p>End Select<br />
&nbsp;End Function</p>
<p>
</p><p>EXACTLY what I need is for somebody to be able to put their birth name and date of birth into open dialogue boxes and then hit "calculate" or "get my reading" or something similar... and the next series of slides be filled in using values "crunched" by their
 input. The first letter of their name means one thing... the first vowel, all the vowels total, all the consonants total, how many letters valued "1" "2" "3" etc., whether any valued groups are missing... among various other calculations, ALL mean one thing
 or another. I am currently working on an Excel spreadsheet that shows EVERYTHING I'm needing to happen in the background, it's about 90% done. Is there a way to put it up here for you to look at?</p>

            <p>part of what you need to do is create a flow chart to define all of the decisions required to reach the right "answer".&nbsp; The final answer will be the result of MANY decisions.&nbsp; Rather than trying to do it all at once, start small / simple. Start with one
 category, ie first letter, first vowel etc, and diagram the decisions. Then add in another category.&nbsp; Are the categories interdependent or separate.&nbsp; If they are separate it is easier to calculate the answer for each separately (a separate function like the
 "GetAlphaValue" one) then at the end use those results to combine for your final results</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds like you are trying to automate "numerology".&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you could put your spreadsheet (or at least part of it) into your skydrive then paste an "edit" link back here in a new reply.

            <p>If I'm understanding correctly what you want, you want to do basically the same thing as the code above and more of the same thing, AND you want a form rather than a series of InputBoxes to collect the input. You can use control text boxes rather than InputBoxes
 to collect information, and it can be processed in similar ways as the above code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that your project is getting more and more complicated. There are many of us here who are willing to churn out a few free code samples, but as the project gets more complicated, I think you are either going to have to pay someone or learn
 enough to write most of the code yourself (maybe you have done this, and I'm just misreading what you are asking for). That is, for free, you can get small bits of code and you can get people to help you as you try to write your own code. Anything beyond that
 is likely to require you to hire someone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind two things: (1) I do not do this kind of consulting for money so I am not trying to sell you my services (several others who frequent this group, including John, do sell their services); (2) these are general statements and this is a group of
 volunteer users helping each other, so any individual might choose to do more or less for free.</p>

 I can help with code you already have but not usually write if for you unless it is short and straightforward.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you are able to write the code to perform the calculations</strong> based on the code you have I would be happy to show you how to create ActiveX textboxes to input the names etc and show the results on slide. You would need to contact me off
 forum as it is too complex to fully explain here but you should be able to find my email on PPTAlchemy.co.uk easily.</p>

<h2>            Unable to flash phone, keeps rebooting</h2>
                    <p>After trying to revert my Lumia 735 to Windows 8.1 after installing the Windows 10 insider preview, I am now unable to stop the phone rebooting.</p>
<p>A hard reset does not work.</p>
<p>I have tried using the Windows Phone Recovery Tool 2.1.1 but the phone reboots just before the software is fully installed.</p>
<p>So I get the message 'operation ended with failure'</p>
<p>Is there any way to force the phone to stay on and let the software installation complete?</p>
<p>I selected 'My Phone was not detected'</p>
<p>'Lumia'</p>
<p>and downloaded the following from the server:</p>
<p>Firmware version 02177.00000.15184.36004</p>
<p>Operating System version 9651.15148</p>

            <p>Since you've already tried all the recommended troubleshooting steps for your concern, the next option is to take the phone to a Care Point for an evaluation &amp; repair. Take note that this process will delete all your stored data &amp; you can only restore backed
 up files. In addition, repair charges may apply as this is not covered by your phone's warranty. You can use this link to locate the nearest repair facility in your area:

            <p>So Microsoft releases OS that is bricking Microsoft phones with hundreds of people reporting bricked Lumia 735 phones, yet Microsoft says the repair is not covered under warranty.&nbsp; You are losing the trust of your Insider Team members.&nbsp; My brand new Lumia
 735 was bricked when it installed Windows 10 under the insider program.&nbsp; When&nbsp;I went on the forums, I found this has been a problem with the 735 for at least the past month yet Microsoft has said nothing or done nothing to prevent Lumia 735 phones from downloading
 the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my new Lumia 735 half working.&nbsp; When I tried to recover back to Windows 8.1, it appeared successful, but it still has Windows 10 on it.&nbsp; At least it is not a brick now.&nbsp; It appears to be running a crippled Windows 10 as many of my programs do not
 function at all and the apps crash all the time.</p>

<p>The phone just continually reboots to a red screen. I have no OS or software version because the phone reboots before the Windows Device Recovery Tool has the time to install any</p>

<h2>            Syncing has stopped -  OneDrive for Business - Office 2016 Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Syncing to my home machine abruptly stopped. I attempted to reinitialise sync by renaming the synced folder and resyncing, but now am told that my account is already syncing when it is not. The original renamed local folder is not being updated either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I hover over the tray I see&nbsp;<span>‘OneDrive for Business - Get started’&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ed50628-dc65-49e4-a238-5565ca98cb0e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9ed50628-dc65-49e4-a238-5565ca98cb0e" /></a></p>
<p>Clicking the cloud shows "Which library do you want to sync?". "Paste your library URL here"<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b7c80566-09c1-477d-848a-a75dbcf238e1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b7c80566-09c1-477d-848a-a75dbcf238e1" /></a></p>
<p>If I use my OneDrive for business URL&nbsp;<span>I get:</span></p>

<p>Clicking Get the app gives:</p>

<p>Signing in says:</p>

<p>I am definitely already signed in with my work credentials and the folder name is what I expected.</p>
<p>Opening the folder shows my empty folder in explorer which is not syncing. This was happening while using Office 2013 install under Office 365 in windows 10. I upgraded to Office 2016 hoping the issue might be resolved but I am still stuck.</p>
<p>Note: A few months ago I had to revert back from Windows 10 anniversary update as I was getting a Bluescreen boot loop. I am on version 1511 and reluctant to try the update again. Could this suddenly be causing my sync problem?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply Sheen. I thought I had switched to the next gen sync client long ago, so I really thought I was using the next generation Sync client but it still wasn't syncing. I'm really not sure why groove.exe was now starting up again. Perhaps
 in trying to get sync working again I had somehow reinstalled the old sync client. Could that have happened when I clicked on the Sync button while looking at my OneDrive folder on the web page?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, before trying your solution, I had rebooted my machine due to running Windows Update and after boot up I got a dialog box warning me that the folder which OneDrive for Business was now trying to sync to was different from the original. As mentioned
 I had attempted to reset sync by renaming the original folder, so I renamed them back setting the new (empty) folder to something else and the original folder with its original (organisational) name. I then clicked the 'Try Again' button in the dialog box.
 This seems to have done the trick, all files are synchronised and hovering over the blue cloud in the tray says that all is up to date.
</p>
<p>I have not therefore followed your instructions to modify the registry entries at the moment, since all seems to be working well again. I think therefore that this post can be closed as having been resolved by a reboot and following OneDrive instructions
 which alerted me that my folder renaming was preventing sync.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>
