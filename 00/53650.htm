<p>You have two 4-core CPUs? You don't say whether you are running Home<br />
Basic or Home Premium, but either way you're out of luck. Neither can<br />
use more than one CPU. If you want to use both, you'll have to upgrade<br />
to at least Professional. </p>

            I'm sorry, but the home editions of Windows 7 can only use one CPU.&nbsp; To use both CPUs, upgrade to Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 frequent BSOD&#39;s &#40;w&#47; Minidumps&#41;</h2>
                    Hey folks!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Just built a computer back in October and have been getting very frequent BSOD's for the past few weeks. &nbsp;All of them seem to be related to the kernal and/or memory management, but the actual error message displayed on the BSOD seems to change every time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've ran MemTest and it showed no errors with my RAM. &nbsp;I've uninstalled/reinstalled anti-virus software. &nbsp;I've swapped hard drives, and reinstalled Windows. &nbsp;I've deleted and reinstalled drivers for nearly every piece of hardware. &nbsp;I'm running out of ideas.
 &nbsp;I'm leaning towards a problem with the mobo, but I just wanted to see if you had any feedback before I bite the bullet. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've done a ton of research in regards to the error messages, but it doesn't seem like any of the fixes I found have had any effect on my problem. &nbsp;I've even attempted to learn how to read minidumps files but quickly realized that I was in WAY over my
 head.</div>

            Hi Mike,<br />
<br />
We have various different bug checks:<br />
<br />
<u><b>SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M (1000007e)</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that a system thread generated an exception which the error handler did not catch.</i>
<br />
<br />
BugCheck 1000007E, {<u><i><b>ffffffffc0000005</b></i></u>, fffff80347d22686, ffffd0002097f4f8, ffffd0002097ed00}<br />
<br />
The 1st parameter of the bug check is 0xc0000005 which indicates that an access violation occurred. Let's see what caused it:<br />
<br />
<i>0: kd&gt; .exr 0xffffd000208bf638<br />
ExceptionAddress: fffff803d9522686 (nt!<b>MiDemoteCombinedPte</b>+0x0000000000000042)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; ExceptionCode: c0000005 (Access violation)</i><br />
<br />
+<br />
<br />
<i>IMAGE_NAME:&nbsp; <b>memory_corruption</b></i><br />
<br />
<u><b>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (a)</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that Microsoft Windows or a kernel-mode driver accessed paged memory at DISPATCH_LEVEL or above.</i><br />
<br />
This bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high. The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.<br />
<br />
<u><b>CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION (109)</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that the kernel has detected critical kernel code or data corruption.</i><br />
<br />
<i>There are generally two causes for this bug check:</i><br />
<ol>
<li>A driver has inadvertently, or deliberately, modified critical kernel code or data. Microsoft Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later versions of Windows for x64-based computers do not allow the kernel to be patched except through authorized
 Microsoft-originated hot patches. For more information, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=50719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Patching Policy for x64-based Systems</a>. <br />
</li><li>A hardware corruption occurred. For example, the kernel code or data could have been stored in memory that failed.
</li></ol>
<p><u><b>MEMORY_MANAGEMENT (1a)</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that a severe memory management error occurred.</i></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>BugCheck 1A, {<u><i><b>403</b></i></u>, fffff680000abdb8, df500000c5ae7847, fffff680000afba8}<i><br />
</i></p>
<br />
<i>- </i>The 1st parameter of the bug check is <b>403 </b>which indicates the page table and PFNs are out of sync . This is generally a hardware error, however a driver causing corruption is possible as well.<br />
<br />
<u><b>PFN_LIST_CORRUPT (4e)</b></u><br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that the page frame number (PFN) list is corrupted.</i><br />
<br />
<p>This error is typically caused by a driver passing a bad memory descriptor list. For example, the driver might have called
<strong>MmUnlockPages</strong> twice with the same list. Faulty RAM can cause this as well.</p>

</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>2. If you're still crashing after #1, please enable Driver Verifier:</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
8. Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
If your OS became corrupt or you cannot boot into Windows after disabling verifier via Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier. <br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />

            It crashed about two hours after I made those changes. &nbsp;I wasn't at the computer so I couldn't read the verbage on the BSOD, but here's the minidump. &nbsp;FWIW, I also removed the ATI video/graphics card earlier today to rule that out as the culprit, and it
 hasn't made any noticeable difference in the frequency of crashes.

            Right, okay, bad news. Verifier is enabled but this doesn't appear to be caused by a driver causing memory corruption:<br />
<br />
-- DEFAULT_BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; VERIFIER_ENABLED_VISTA_MINIDUMP<br />
<br />
However it remains a *A bug check and there's no driver in the stack, etc.<br />
<br />
With this said, we are dealing with a hardware issue. You mentioned you ran Memtest, but please run it again for NO LESS than ~8 passes (several hours).<br />
<br />

            Well that's actually somewhat reassuring as I've assumed it was a hardware issue from the start, and you've just confirmed my initial thoughts.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I ran MemTest twice (last week), both time 10 passes (took ~3 hours each time) and it showed zero errors. &nbsp;I'll run it again tonight to re-verify but assuming it again shows no errors, what's the next logical step in narrowing down my hunt? &nbsp;I can just
 start swapping parts out, but I'm really trying to avoid that if at all possible.. or at least getting a "most likely culprit" list so I know what to swap first :)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can't tell you how thankful I am for your help. &nbsp;</div>

            Is there a BIOS update available for your board? If there is, I'd go through with that. As far as RAM timings go, even though you pass Memtest, is your memory on Auto, or XMP, or manually set? If it's anything but Auto, set it to that.
<br />
<br />
Also, we can run HDD diagnostics if you'd like to be sure your HDD is healthy:<br />
<br />
<br />
There are various ways to run Chkdsk~</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>Method 1:</b></u><br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search bar &gt; Type cmd (right click run as admin to execute Elevated CMD)<br />
<br />
Elevated CMD should now be opened, type the following:<br />
<br />
chkdsk x: /r<br />
<br />
x implies your drive letter, so if your hard drive in question is letter c, it would be:<br />
<br />
chkdsk c: /r<br />
<br />
Restart system and let chkdsk run.<br />
<br />
<u><b>Method 2:</b></u><br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the "Computer" window<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click on the drive in question<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the "Tools" tab<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Error-checking area, click &lt;Check Now&gt;.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you'd like to get a log file that contains the chkdsk results, do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
Press Windows Key + R and type powershell.exe in the run box<br />
<br />
Paste the following command and press enter afterwards:<br />
<br />
get-winevent -FilterHashTable @{logname="Application"; id="1001"}| ?{$_.providername –match "wininit"} | fl timecreated, message | out-file Desktop\CHKDSKResults.txt<br />
<br />
This will output a .txt file on your Desktop containing the results of the chkdsk.<br />
<br />
<span><u><b>If chkdsk turns out okay, run Seatools</b></u></span> -<br />
<br />

<br />
You can run it via Windows or DOS. Do note that the only difference is simply the environment you're running it in. In Windows, if you are having what you believe to be device driver related issues that may cause conflicts or false positive, it may be a wise
 decision to choose the most minimal testing environment (DOS).<br />
<br />
Run all tests EXCEPT: Fix All, Long Generic, and anything Advanced.<br />
<br />
<u><b>---------------------</b></u><br />
<br />
If you have an SSD, ensure the firmware is 100% up to date.<br />

            <div>Good morning, Patrick!</div>
<div><br />
<div>The BIOS updates are up to date.</div>
<div><br />
<div>RAM is set to auto.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ran MemTest last night, 13 passes, 0 errors.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ran ChkDsk on both of my hard drives, 0 errors found. &nbsp;I'm not going to bother with Seatools because I'm getting the same BSOD activity no matter which hard drive is used.</div>
<div><br />
<div>No SSD.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, I guess my question is.. in your opinion, should I replace the RAM or the mobo? &nbsp;At this point, I don't see any other piece of hardware being the issue, and with MemTest now completing a total of 26 passes with 0 errors found, I'm leaning towards the
 mobo.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again!</div>

            Thanks for your information, much appreciated. With all of this said, I am going to agree with you. I'd replace the board, and when the new one arrives, run through with a clean install of Windows with nothing but the latest drivers for your hardware and
 devices, and no 3rd party antiviruses, etc. You can of course install a few games, but nothing like an antivirus for now, etc.<br />
<br />
If you ARE going to want an antivirus, make sure it's Windows Defender.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

<p>Yes I believe so, However are Kinect is downstairs, so I would take the HDD off my Xbox and put it on the downstairs one and he would take a memory card and move his profile on to it. Then we would both sign in with 2 different controllers and I would select
 Interview (2 player mode) for Avatar Kinect. But it does not give my brother the option of picking which Avatar he would like to use or show him in the actual game. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for giving us the opportunity to assist you!!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I see that the Wild Tangent Games aren’t working properly in Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Let us work together to resolve this issue.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But before we begin, could you give us more information?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error messages/code when you play the games?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the computer (including Graphics Card)?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you play the games online?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this issue occur in Internet Explorer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s what you can do:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Perform Clean Boot and check if the issue occurs.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup
 programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts<b>.&nbsp;

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Please go through step 3 of the Kb to keep the computer
 in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Try updating the graphics card drivers and check if it works.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to update the graphics card driver:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

When I was a Win XP user I used to join with friends on Skype and sometimes I played music in my PC and my friends were able to heard my music through my headphones
<br />
<br />
<p>But now, since im an Win 7 user, I can't do that anymore, and I tried everything to do that again uninstall,reinstall, put, quit.. etc etc.. but nothing works to me :C</p>

            <p><span>Hi Atomsk Duskait,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>As per the description look like you want to make other people hear the sounds through my headphones.</span></p>
<p><span>What exactly do you mean when you say “How i can make other people hear the sounds through my headphones?”?</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the Head phone jack is properly inserted the socket. Try to remove it and reinsert it firmly
 into the socket and check if you can hear sound only through head phones.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Run the Audio troubleshooter built in Windows 7 and check if it can find any issue and fix it. Access
 the link below and follow the steps to run Audio troubleshooter in Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Check to see if your headphones are set to be used as the default Communication device instead of
 the default device, or if both devices are set to default. If so, make the headphones default, so that Windows will use them only when they are plugged in.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Check with&nbsp;volume settings.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on the speaker icon in taskbar and select volume control options.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click a check mark on "All devices currently playing sound".</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Make sure you have "The default communication device unchecked".</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Place a check mark on both speakers and headphones.</span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to refer the link and check.</span></p>
<span>Connect a microphone, music player, or other audio device to your computer</span>

<h2>            Mixed Reality on Laptop with i7-3630qm, Intel HD Graphics 4000 and Geforce GT650M</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I would like to try some WMR action and I understand I won't be able to run most things with my rig but from my understanding I should meet the minimum requirements. Here is a screenshot of the WMR Check App. As you can see (sorry it's in German but you
 know the drill) CPU is fine and so is everything else except for the Gaphic drivers or driver rather. Apparently my nvidia driver being wddm 2.4 is fine but my HD graphics with 1.3 is not. Does this mean I won't be able to install say a lenovo explorer? It
 seems to me like my dedicated GPU is sufficient to run WMR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>

            Hi Conman588 
<br />
<br />That is a strange report, while it appears, your GT 650M meets the requirements, there is an advisory mark (exclamation ark) on your graphics and even though that Nvidia driver is WDDM 2.4, it somehow does not pass the test
<br />
<br />Sorry, but I seriously doubt the GT 650M will run Mixed Reality, it is 1/3 the power recommended for VR and Nvidia recommend minimum a 1050Ti for mixed reality or VR. From a quick browse on the Nvidia forum, users reckon the software will load, but it sill be unplayable . . .

<p>Wow, that was fast. Thanks folks, I guess I'll just try. After all "unplayable" is a very relative term in forums and I enjoyed playing loads of games on my laptop that were allegedly unplayable. In any case 2 week return policy ftw ;)
</p>
<p>@saltgrass: unfortunately not, the driver I have is the newest for the HD 4000 and I couldn't find any WDDM 2.2 for it on the web.</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately neither SFC nor DISM found any issues with the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue started... I can't remember really. 2 weeks ago? There hasn't been any big changes in settings lately. However there was an installer which tried installing a lot of junk programs at one point. I think I got rid of them all with an antivirus scan
 and uninstaller. Maybe it has somethign to do with that?</p>

<h2>            Do I have to give Microsoft my address in order to buy things&#63;</h2>
                    So I'm trying to buy Gears of War Ultimate Edition. It would simply be a download. But I can't buy it without giving my address. Its not like I need anything physically sent to me so why do I need to give it? Its not that big of a deal; I just won't buy
 it, its just frustrating.

<p>I've never bought anything from the Store but I guess you give your details (whether download or physical item) so your full records are on file. Presumably in the future if you wish to buy something physical your account will already have your address for
 delivery.</p>
<p>Same as any other online purchase. If you can't skip that section and it is shown as mandatory then you have no other choice.</p>

    <title>Using internet while backing up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> briasylum13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using internet while backing up</h2>
                    Hello, I was wondering if someone could help me. Is it possible to use the internet while backing up to a system image. I've done it in the past..no problem. But, recently, I've had some computer issues and I want to kind of play it safe. I've searched
 for my question in google. I came across some stuff that said that it could corrupt/ruin your backup if you use internet. I can't just sit there and do nothing while it backs up. I need internet to pass the time. HELP!

            Press and hold the power button for 10 seconds. Once you turn it on again, it should work. This worked for me.&nbsp;

I would suggest you to see the keyboard guide on how to open the battery case. </span>
<span>Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop is built on advanced ergonomic principles, with a split keyboard layout that keeps wrists and forearms in a relaxed position, and a cushioned palm rest to provide wrist support. The domed keyboard shape works to reduce and correct
 wrist pronation that can cause pain and limited mobility.<br />
<br />
Also refer to the link: Troubleshooting: Keyboards<br />

Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span></span>

    <title>When using &#34;Garry&#39;s Mod&#34; via Steam, shortly after booting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thesharpestspoon  say:</h3>
<h2>            When using &#34;Garry&#39;s Mod&#34; via Steam, shortly after booting up a map, the application closes, and the error message pops up, &#34;Paged Pool Memory Has Been Exhausted.&#34;</h2>
                    So, I cannot play Garry's Mod, because within the course of a couple seconds, my error message pops up, and closes the application. However, I followed the link that the error message mentioned, and it took me back to Steam. There, at Steam, it gave me
 several steps to alleviate "Paged Pool Memory Exhaustion" by editing some values on my computer. However, I'm not very savvy with editing values, so I thought I might want to come here to get some help first. The page, if interested, is
<br />
<br />
https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?p_faqid=150<br />
<br />
Also, my operating system is Windows Vista, and I'm running an Inspiron 1501, with a 1.8 Ghz processor, and plently of RAM for handling the program, and I've ruled out anti- virus programs as the cause. So forth,<br />
I was wondering how I would go about doing the things listed in the steps, or if perhaps someone could do it remotely through this service or another, because I don't want to put my computer's functionality at risk by mishandling some values.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ever hopeful,<br />

<p><span><span><span>Hi TheSharpestSpoon,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may try updating the drivers for the video card as well as the sound card for your computer from the manufacturer’s website.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>For information on updating drivers follow the link given below.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may also check if any of the background program that is causing the issue. To help troubleshoot error messages and other
 issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The steps to be performed in clean boot are given below:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini
 check box is unavailable.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Note: Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging,
 Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Once you boot to the desktop check if the issue persists, follow the steps given in the article and figure out which of the program
 is causing the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>For further information on clean boot please follow the below given link:</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Click start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If the above mentioned steps do not resolve the issue you may contact the support team of Steam from the below given link.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Questions for the Skyrim veterans...</h2>
                    
<p>Well, thanks for looking at my thread first and foremost...I am about 40 hours in and in true RPG style I've exhausted every possibility in the game that has come my way so far. I am a level 19, nearly 20 Nord with level 65 Two handed combat. Really loving
 this game to say the least but there is a few things, as with most RPG's, that I am still unsure of despite the time I've spent on it already. If anyone would be so kind as to address my questions I would really appreciate it...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 - I have completed 72 Misc quests, is there any need for me to complete the rest of the Misc quests I've encountered so far before I progress with main and side quests?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 - I'm currently using a weapon with 52 damage. I've just found the dawnbreaker and notice the damage is incredibly low. Should I disregard low damage weapons or can they be levelled up?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 - Is it worth me waiting to complete the main quests before I download and start Dawnguard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4 - I seem to have accumulated an incredible amount of stock. I'm currently storing it in the only property I own in Whiterun. Is it worth keeping weapons or should I just disenchant and sell all of them apart from the ones I'm using?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5 - I have at least ten of each dragon scale and dragon bone. I've been storing them as I don't particularly need the gold from selling them due to the high value. What else can I use these for?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6 - Followers **** me off. I've sent pretty much every one of them packing. Lydia is useful at times. Nobody has died on me yet and I've no interest in glitching with the likes of the dog for example. Is there any specific need for followers and do they
 in effect 'steal' exp to go towards levelling by killing enemies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7 - I have multiple Misc quest lines to join imperials etc etc. and I have also noticed one or two crop up in main and side quests in the menu. If I join one group does that eliminate the possibility of joining another for the sake of completing the quests?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8 - If answer to the above is YES then what are the advantages and disadvantages of joining each one? Perhaps a lot to ask but I don't want to miss something epic for the sake of becoming a thieving ***!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9 - I've not really gone down the magic route. I've put a small focus on destruction but my primary focus is two handed weaponry and archery. Should I wish to go the magic route, will any problems pose as a result of investing perk points into two handed
 and archery?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have answered these for me, I thank you very much. Loving the game and I'm sure if nobody answers I'll crack on with it as I would anyway however a little discussion could possibly go a long way for my character! Have a good weekend!</p>

<p>1 - The Misc quests add gameplay to the game and increase the replay/continuation value of the game. Doing them is your choice but they don't affect the Main/Side quests other than the rewards for completion.</p>
<p>2 - All weapons and most clothing can be improved through the Smithing skill/perk tree.</p>
<p>3 - The Main Quest line and the Dawnguard DLC are unrelated. Completing the DLC before you go through and complete the main quest will make it easier but may water it down.</p>
<p>4 - Short answer, yes. Unless you want to upgrade them via smithing (to help along level progression).</p>
<p>5 - Other than the base value of them the only use they have is making armor (and weapons with the DLC).</p>
<p>6 - Other than combat use they are only useful for extra loot storage until you can get to your home unless they are quest related. That's my opinion.</p>
<p>7 - If you join the Imperials you can't join the Stormcloaks and vice versa. That's one of the main side quests, it's the Skyrim Civil War quest line.</p>
<p>8 - Their are vast pros and cons to each side. Wiki can give a list of both but which ever you choose, in the end they will be the dominate government. Much like the American Civil War, just not the same reason for the start of it.</p>
<p>9 - No, just make sure you know what skills you want to max (RPG related) and which ones you are only leveling to increase your overall level. Max overall level cap is 81 and the skill level cap is 100 (level 100 on all skills = level 81).</p>

<p>Dawn-guard definitely worth downloading at anytime, IT has the ability to make your own arrows, its very hard to find an affordable place early on so I just marry that wench in Whiterun the one who's always watching the merchants? an carrying on about Kajit,
 anyway her little house is fine, she throws you some coin every time you see her, getting with the thieves guild early is also good 1<strong>. you can bribe guards to look the other way on a small petty crime that you got caught doing, score a speech skill
 in the process, then pick-pocket the money right back, you score a pickpocketing skill, just make sure you do a save before you pick his or her pocket</strong> as you might get caught, I just go with the two handed weapon &amp; Bow as my main weapons of choice..&nbsp;
<em>ohh I choose thieves stone at the guardian stones SO my pick-pocketing IS considerablly higher skill even though
</em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I did both my speech &amp; pick-pocketing all at the same encounter every guard that I met who recognized me as a wanted criminal</span>..</p>

<p>At the end of the day they all come out to personal preference. If you want to reach the max level and experience everything you payed $60 for you'll need to reach the level cap, complete the main quest, and chose a side in the civil war (main side quest).
 After that it's all exploration, small side quests, radiant quests, and dungeon crawling.</p>

<p>Well, thanks for looking at my thread first and foremost...I am about 40 hours in and in true RPG style I've exhausted every possibility in the game that has come my way so far. I am a level 19, nearly 20 Nord with level 65 Two handed combat. Really loving
 this game to say the least but there is a few things, as with most RPG's, that I am still unsure of despite the time I've spent on it already. If anyone would be so kind as to address my questions I would really appreciate it...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 - I have completed 72 Misc quests, is there any need for me to complete the rest of the Misc quests I've encountered so far before I progress with main and side quests?</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">&nbsp;No need to do misc quests. &nbsp;You only get exp from using weapons, taking damage, using a skill, etc. &nbsp;Though, the game is yours to do what you wish with.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2 - I'm currently using a weapon with 52 damage. I've just found the dawnbreaker and notice the damage is incredibly low. Should I disregard low damage weapons or can they be levelled up?</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">&nbsp;If you have the appropriate smithing you can improve weapons making them better. &nbsp;Also, some enchantments on weapons can offset their damage to a degree.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 - Is it worth me waiting to complete the main quests before I download and start Dawnguard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Really not necessary, but again, the beauty of Skyrim is that you can really do most anything in any order you want.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4 - I seem to have accumulated an incredible amount of stock. I'm currently storing it in the only property I own in Whiterun. Is it worth keeping weapons or should I just disenchant and sell all of them apart from the ones I'm using?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Money quickly becomes a non-issue. &nbsp;It's best to sell anything you don't think you will need or use. &nbsp;Hoarding isn't necessarily a good thing, as it will just clutter up your menu screens when you are looking for something. &nbsp;Though,
 saving the special weapons and armor is a good idea.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5 - I have at least ten of each dragon scale and dragon bone. I've been storing them as I don't particularly need the gold from selling them due to the high value. What else can I use these for?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">At level 100 smithing you will be able to make Dragon armor, weapons and arrows. &nbsp;The armor isn't great, but the weapons and arrows are actually very good.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6 - Followers **** me off. I've sent pretty much every one of them packing. Lydia is useful at times. Nobody has died on me yet and I've no interest in glitching with the likes of the dog for example. Is there any specific need for followers and do they
 in effect 'steal' exp to go towards levelling by killing enemies.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">&nbsp;Followers are terrible. &nbsp;Though, I actually like the follower in Dawnguard, she is pretty awesome, and a very well done character.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7 - I have multiple Misc quest lines to join imperials etc etc. and I have also noticed one or two crop up in main and side quests in the menu. If I join one group does that eliminate the possibility of joining another for the sake of completing the quests?</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">You can only join one side or the other. &nbsp;All the quests are for the other side will disappear when you join up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8 - If answer to the above is YES then what are the advantages and disadvantages of joining each one? Perhaps a lot to ask but I don't want to miss something epic for the sake of becoming a thieving ***!</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">They are essentially the same. &nbsp;No advantages or disadvantages.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9 - I've not really gone down the magic route. I've put a small focus on destruction but my primary focus is two handed weaponry and archery. Should I wish to go the magic route, will any problems pose as a result of investing perk points into two handed
 and archery?</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">&nbsp;You have a finite number of skill points, so, if you wish to become a "jack of all trades" you will indeed be a master of none. &nbsp;That said, it doesn't hurt to level everything you can.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have answered these for me, I thank you very much. Loving the game and I'm sure if nobody answers I'll crack on with it as I would anyway however a little discussion could possibly go a long way for my character! Have a good weekend!</p>

<p>Superb answers, thank you all. Its been real difficult to find some of this information on the skyrim forums and here. There is one last thing I forgot to ask though; Once I complete the main quest, can I continue with the game to finish any side quests
 etc? I've done as I said, 72 Misc quests and only 4 main quests and about 2 side quests at the moment. I'm quite keen to progress with the story after all thos misc quests but would like to go back to all of them! Thanks ever so much by the way, full kudos!</p>

<p>As they said, you can continue to play after the main quest ends. Without spoiling anything PAY ATTENTION TO EVERYTHING!...if you miss a few things toward the end you are blocked from getting them unless they make some places returnable via fast-travel or
 future DLC later on.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems to be an issue with the driver software that you are trying to install. I would suggest you to try downloading the driver software from the manufacturer’s
 website and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Download the driver software from the following link from the printer manufacturer’s link.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And also try installing the driver software in clean boot state and check if it helps.</span></p>

    <title>&#34;USB Device Not Recognised&#34; Annoying Repeat Notification - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cornelius iii  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;USB Device Not Recognised&#34; Annoying Repeat Notification Banners&#47;Sounds</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Pro. &nbsp;When I plug my eCig vaporiser into a USB port to charge it I receive repeated "USB Device Not Recognised" notifications that are rather annoying. &nbsp;In Device Manager I can see that a USB device has an exclamation mark. &nbsp;Naturally, updating
 the driver doesn't work because there isn't a driver required in the first place. &nbsp;It's an eCig. &nbsp;Uninstalling the USB device from within Device Manager doesn't fix it, either, because it simply reappears in Device Manager moments later and the notifications
 start popping up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime I'm using a normal mains power USB charger, but it would be nice to be able to charge it via a USB port in the future. &nbsp;You would think that Windows would be able to recognise that this is not a 'smart' device, wouldn't you? &nbsp;And not something
 that even requires a driver? &nbsp;And that there's no need to keep playing sounds and popping up notifications about the device not being recognised? &nbsp;Bloody annoying ....</p>

Thanks for that but no, even if that were the case (which it isn't, as it's designed to power directly from a machine's USB port) you wouldn't then have the notifications I've mentioned and the conflict that appears in Device Manager. &nbsp;It's just Windows looking
 for a driver for something that doesn't require a driver and then driving me mad about it every 30s without providing any way to shut the damn notification(s) off (it's not listed in the Notifications section of Settings and therefore I can't toggle the alert
 on/off).

<p>Well, there are still teething problems with 10 but all-in-all it's been a great roll-out with a lot of good, new features. &nbsp;I really like it. &nbsp;'SP1' (or 2?) or the equivalent (whatever they're calling it these days) is coming in November. &nbsp;A major OS update,
 so perhaps the fix will be in there.</p>
