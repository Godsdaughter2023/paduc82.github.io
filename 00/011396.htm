<h2>            Unable to recover Outlook account password</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: Passwords and Security</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having forgotten my outlook password I have been asked to enter the last 4 digits of my phone followed by the Microsoft account &nbsp;password code that has been sent to me by text. I am then being asked to verify my secondary security stage by verifying my the
 Email address that I supplied. I am then told that if this is verified then I will receive another code</p>
<p>on two occasions now I have verified my secondary email, which is my work email address ... However I am still waiting to relieve that security code.... What do I do now? ... And no it's not in my junk folder either... Cheers</p>

            <p>Also since the issue occurs with both Word and Excel, try opening them in application safe and check how it works.</p>
<p>To open Word in application safe, click on Start – All Programs – Accessories – Run, and in the open box type in winword /safe and hit ok. (Note: There is a space between
 winword and /). </p>
<p>To open Excel in application safe, you may use the switch excel /safe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If application safe works, you may disable the Add-ins associated to it and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also try changing the default printer to Microsoft XPS / Send to OneNote 2007 and check. If changing the default printer works fine, update the drivers for the problem
 printer.</p>

    <title>Focus Cursor on a specific text box. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tinafulton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Focus Cursor on a specific text box.</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have added a text box to my Access database, specifically to focus the cursor on, upon opening the Database.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like the cursor to retain, and return to focusing on this text box, even after clicking on other text boxes, and moving forward through different Forms.&nbsp; &nbsp; I have set Tab Index to '0' on the highlighted text box.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The database has a tab for each record of contact information.&nbsp; Screen capture is below.&nbsp; I want the cursor to stay focused on the highlighted (hidden) text box, upon opening, and after every action, even after pressing the arrow keys at the bottom of the
 database to move to the next record.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It currently stays focused on the highlighted text box upon opening, and moving to different records, as long as I don't update any of the fields.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I'd like it to return focus to the highlighted text box upon clicking an arrow.&nbsp; &nbsp;It currently focuses on the comments text box and highlights all the content.&nbsp; I don't want it to do that.&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for your help in advance.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I can not provide a template copy in a cloud link due to information security concerns.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a way to keep the cursor focused, instead of highlighting information in a text box that has been altered as I move between records, I'd love to know.&nbsp; &nbsp;As it is, if I update a contact's address, and move to the next record, the cursor highlights
 the same address box in the new record, and I'd like it to instead return to a dedicated text box.&nbsp; This would be ideal, since I've enabled the enter key to be used in all of the text based fields, and if the cursor has highlighted those fields, there is a
 good chance the user may inadvertently erase information upon pressing [enter] key.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>

            I'm not sure I follow. You don't want the user to be able to select any other text boxes, or after they enter a value in the other text box you want it to return to the textbox you setup for focus?
<br />
<br />If you want it to return to the textbox when you change records you the On Current Event. Use the Code Builder to add a line of code
<br />
<br />Me.textboxname.SetFocus
<br />
<br />This will return to that textbox when you switch records. If you want to return to the textbox after each entry into a control. use the same line in the After Update event of each control.
<br />
<br />If you don't want to allow focus into any control set the Enabled property of that control to No.

<p>Hi Scottgem,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like the cursor to return focus to the designated text box after a user has updated other text boxes.&nbsp; In the screen capture above, if I enter the address of a contact for the record, and then move to the next record, the cursor stays in the address
 text box of the new record, and highlights any information in it.&nbsp; I would like the cursor to not do this, and instead return to a focused text box.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the code, and I was unsuccessful.&nbsp; I won't be able to use [Enabled Property control: no] because the control refers to the label of the text box.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But thank you for trying to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Using the code I gave you in the On Current event will do the job for moving between records. What exactly did you do?
<br />
<br />As for moving back to the textbox, you need to use either the On Exit, Lost Focus or After Update event to SetFocus back to the control.

<p>So far,&nbsp; I've tried to use the event procedure with the line of code you provided.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>It partially works, but after updating any of the name or address fields,&nbsp; the cursor starts highlighting the text in subsequent records as I click the mouse to move through the records.&nbsp; &nbsp;But I would like the cursor to focus on the little square text box
 at the top right of the form in the screen capture. The cursor only focuses upon opening the Database, but then after clicking on say... the address box and updating an address, the cursor focuses there - in the updated address box, even when I move to the
 next record.&nbsp; I want the cursor to focus again on the little square at the top right.&nbsp; The user can enter information in all the fields after clicking on one of them.&nbsp; I just want the cursor to lock focus or return to focusing on the little square text box,
 after they click on the little arrow&nbsp; (circled in red below the first screen capture) to move to the next record.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the code so far, that works.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Private Sub Text40_AfterUpdate()<br />
Me.textboxname.SetFocus<br />
End Sub<br />
<br />
Private Sub Text40_BeforeUpdate(Cancel As Integer)<br />
Me.textboxname.SetFocus<br />
End Sub<br />

            Hi Tina,
<br />
<br />That's not quite what I told you to do. First, you have to use the actual name of your textbox, textboxname was just a place holder. Second the code goes in the On Current event if you want it to go back when you switch records. You would use the AfterUpdate event. if you want to move back to the corner after entering data in a different control.

<h2>            Customer Gamerpic</h2>
                    Why can't we upload customer gamer pics using the xbox app on our mobile cell phones anymore? At first we could, but now the option has been removed and it's set up to use either the console or windows 10 app then you gotta do so much just to get it on
 there that I don't even want to try anymore. It was fine with the xbox app on mobile phones. Why was it removed?

<p>
</p><p>In Skype for Windows 10, simply sending an instant message will act as an invitation to the contact you want to add. Once you send a message to your friend/colleague, they will have an option to accept you or block you on their account.</p>

</p><p>If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post. <br />
Thank you!<br />

    <title>Shared Excel Online file is not showing live changes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> patrickdeschamps  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shared Excel Online file is not showing live changes</h2>
                    <p>We have a file that is stored in Sharepoint and shared within several users here at the office.</p>
<p>Today we realized that the function of "live collaboration" have disappeared.</p>
<p>Last month, when everyone was working on the file, we could see the cursors of each one moving around and editing, as well as the name of each person that was currently connected and editing the file on the top right side of the Excel Online.</p>
<p>This seems to have disappeared and we cannot see the live collaboration anymore. Additionally, when someone do a change, there is confusion on if the change is saved or not, because if we close the browser and open the link of the file right after, the changes
 don't appear. If we open later on, the changes are there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some clarifications:</p>
<p>The share is well configured: everyone who is supposed to have access is having access and is able to change.</p>
<p>The file is working fine.</p>
<p>Each person has its own browser preference - THE ERROR APPEARS ON ALL OF THEM. This is a general issue, not specific.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Insert a comment on a picture - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grip&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Insert a comment on a picture</h2>
                    <p>I write collaborative documents lots. As word is the only program ubiquitous enough for all authors to use, the ability to leave and view comments left by others is essential. For the most part, this function works satisfactory when dealing with text. The
 ability to redefine the area encompassed by an existing comment would be nice, but I can live without it. I do however find it rather limiting that one cannot leave a comment on an image. When I select an image and insert a comment, the region that defines
 the boundries of the comment is just an arbitrary zone in the text surrounding the image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is particularly annoying when writing a paper with figures, as moving the image, leaves the comment in the random spawn point near the original location. If for instance I wanted to tell someone to increase the thickness of a line on a graph (inserted
 .jpg or .png) I cannot stick the comment to the image, so if I choose to relocate it, all is lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to do this? I only use word when working with others, so I will admit that my knowledge is lacking with this program. I would appreciate any help.</p>
<p>

            If you are inserting pictures in-line with text, turn on the display of non-printing characters by clicking on the ¶ button on the Home tab of the ribbon and the, when you want to insert a comment that is&nbsp;in respect of a picture,&nbsp;select the ¶ that appears
 adjacent to the picture.&nbsp; The comment will then move with the picture as its position in the document changes as a result of other edits to the document.

            <p>Hi Doug,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very helpful indeed. Is there no way to stick a comment to an image, regardless of text wrapping / alignment? Most journals have a very specific template that one must adhere to, which includes positioning / size of figures. I've already had to put my image
 into a text box, just to get a fig caption to stick to it (seriously, it feels like herding cats with a laser pointer), trying to get images to do what you want them to in word I find very frustrating. A slight movement and the image jumps to the last page
 and ruins the formatting there! Is there some kind of tutorial for image manipulation with common problems? The only ones I can find refer to very specific examples that work (of course) perfectly...which is rarely the case. Or better yet, a typesetting code
 I can use with word?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>

            In my experience, particularly with documents created by other people, textboxes are more likely to cause havoc with the document.

            <p>This only removes the OneNote APP, not the main program. Unfortunately, it appears that running the main program re-installs the app.</p>
<p>I don't care what Microsoft say, I DO NOT WANT to use office 2013; I already have office 2010 and it is more than adequate for my needs - and does not require a poxy microsoft login to use it.</p>
<p>

                    <p>I'd like to&nbsp;double-space line numbers in my Word 2010 document.&nbsp; How can I format line numbering in Word 2010, e.g., add line spaces between the line numbers?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried selecting "Count by" "2" in the Line Numbering Options, but that doesn't do the trick - it merely omits all the odd numbers. Thanks for whatever advice you can give.</p>

            You can get double-spaced line numbers when you double space the text.&nbsp; But if what you want to do is number every other text line, I don't think that can be done through the interface (the menus, ribbon, shortcut, and options offered to the user).&nbsp;&nbsp; A
 workaround is to add the numbers spaced the way you want to the header.&nbsp; Those numbers won't adjust with the text though the way Words line numbers do.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error of finishing analyzing your document happens when you are working on a large file. It might be caused by an add-in which is not working properly with your Word application. We would like to know the following information for us to better isolate
 your concern:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the device that you are trying to use when you access your Word app?</li><li>When did the issue first occur?</li><li>What is the exact error that you get?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For the meantime, you can try to launch your Word app in safe mode and check if you will encounter the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

    <title>Word document text allignment suddenly went out of horizontal - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Word document text allignment suddenly went out of horizontal alignment</h2>
                    In the midst of typing a Word document, my lines of typing suddenly went out of alignment. They seem to be about 4" from the left instead of the 1" that I set in layout.&nbsp; I've tried everything I can think of to rectify this problem.&nbsp; I've tried backspace
 delete, page alignment beginning at the spot where things went awry. I've tried working with columns and other alignments and can't think of anything else to try. I've even looked on youtube.&nbsp; I originally set up for 1" margins throughout but now my paragraph
 is taking up what appears to be one column of the right of the page.&nbsp; I've tried just about every option that I can find on the menu to no avail.&nbsp; My spacing appears to be correct and so does page layout and I have selected only one column. I've also set up
 right justification.&nbsp; Please help.

    <title>Smart form in Word 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diego_mauricio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Smart form in Word 2010</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a recruitment form with some tables that feature multiple candidate options. Managers will complete the fields according to how many candidates they wish to hire.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I wish to remove the table from the main view and two options such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Is this form for one appointment, if so click here</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Is this form for multiple appointments, if so click here... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once they click on the option, I would then like the relevant table to appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is purely to make a somewhat long and clunky recruitment form easier&nbsp;and more pleasing to the eye.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible to be done via Word?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance for your help.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Access 2007 Report sort order not the same as query or data sheet</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am creating a database for a small bakery and I have already received some very useful help from this forum. Currently I have everything up and running as I require but I have one final problem when it comes to ordering my information on the report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my report currently grouped by CategoryName and then Grouped by ProductName.&nbsp; This shows the category (e.g. Brown Bread) and all the products listed under this category. Then under each product name I have a list of ingredients. The problem is the
 order of the ingredients. I need the order to be exactly as I have entered them into the database and infact the query and the table shows them in the correct order. However, the report shows them listed in a random order (I can see no pattern to it). I have
 tried sorting the ingredients in the report but this only shows them alphabetically, which I do not want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is really important I get this order right as with all ingredient lists they are shown in order of largest quantity to smallest. I don't have the quantities as this is not required for this database so I have no idea how I can fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. I do have ID fields in my table but I didn't use them in the query, which is what my report is based on. I am assuming I do need to do a query first? I have four tables:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Categories (*CatergoryID, CategoryName)</p>
<p>Ingredients (*IngredientID, Ingredient, Allergen)</p>
<p>Product (*ProductID, ProductName, CategoryName, Photo)</p>
<p>Product_Ingredients (ProductID, IngredientID)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to display Report as Category Name, then ProductName with a photo and&nbsp;list of ingredients underneath.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My query pulls these required fields from the tables. I have the product name and category in ascending order but the ingredient field has to remain unsorted for it to view in the correct order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I going wrong somewhere?</p>
<p />

            <blockquote>I need the order to be exactly as I have entered them into the database</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that you can see no discernible pattern to the ordering is because there isn't one.&nbsp; A table in a relational database represents a set.&nbsp; By definition a set has no intrinsic order.&nbsp; A query's results can be ordered, but reports do not respect the
 sort order of the underlying query.&nbsp; A report must be sorted by means of its internal sorting and grouping mechanism.<br />
<br />
If you want to sort by the order entered into the table the only really reliable way is to include a DateTimeStamp column in the relevant table, giving it a DefaultValue property of Now() so that the date/time when the row is inserted is automatically entered.&nbsp;
 Strictly speaking it's the date/time when you navigate to the empty new row in a form or datasheet, but that's not pertinent to the issue here.<br />
<br />
Using an autonumber column for the sort order of the report might at first sight seem a simple solution, but an autonumber guarantees one thing and one thing only, which is that the values are distinct.&nbsp; You cannot confidently assume they will be sequential.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>First, you have to understand that reports have their OWN order, They do not, necessarily use the same order as the underlying tables or queries. So you have to use the Grouping and Sorting function in the report to manage the order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have an Autonumber ID on your ingredients table and this number is the sequence you want to sort by, then, by all means, add it has a hidden control and sort by it. However, if you ever have to change the ingredients list, this will no longer work.
 So, I would suggest that you use a sequential number per recipe ID (see my blog on Sequential Numbering). You can set the increment to 5 instead of 1 to give you room to insert ingredients in order. Or you can manually adjust the sequential numbering if you
 change the the list. Then sort by that value.</p>

    <title>TwoWay binding breaking change in Windows 10 build 10041 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ianier  say:</h3>
<h2>            TwoWay binding breaking change in Windows 10 build 10041</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In build 10041 two-way binding introduces an annoying breaking change, at least for the Slider control. I haven't tried other controls.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;you bind the slider Value to a property in TwoWay mode and the application programmatically changes the property, then the slider will move (as expected), but it will also call the property setter back again (breaking change).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8.x the property setter is not called back, which makes sense because it's the app that changed the property.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: is this a bug or an acknowledged&nbsp;breaking change in Windows 10? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ianier</p>

    <title>Nokia 6230 question &#40;manual operator selection&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikexx---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 6230 question &#40;manual operator selection&#41;</h2>
                    When I go: Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Phone Settings &gt; Operator Selection &gt; Manual I get a list of networks.&nbsp; I'm being trying to establish the relative strength of these networks and was wondering if the order has any significance.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure that the first
 operator in the list is likely to be the strongest, and was wondering if I can deduce if the others are in order of signal strength.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm this?

            not&nbsp;necessarily, it provides you with the list of operators but you can't use all of them, you can only use the provider that you have the sim card for. click on a option from non provider, you should not be able to have any service as your options are
 dependent on your sim card/opearator/mobile network provider.

<p>Many thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I'm trying to ascertain which of the operators will give me the most reliable reception as I'm about to change.&nbsp; I'm very aware that only my current operator will actually accept a true connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the list is not necessarily in the order of field strength, what does the order signify?</p>

<h3> smartysapphire  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 6700 screen failure</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>
<p>I really hope senior staff at Nokia read this thread and reply. I will be more than happy to discuss the Nokia care centre and the Individual employee involved (I took note of her name). I also have all receipts and paperwork to back this up. I'd like someone
 at Nokia to have the courage to follow this up, I dare you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Had my Nokia 6700 a few months. So far it's been great. It gets minimal use as It's my secondary phone, not my work phone (BlackBerry). I took a few snaps of some items I was going to sell on ebay, placed the phone on the kitchen table...picked it up again
 5 minutes later to transfer the photos to my PC and discovered the screen was dark and the icon images corrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've never had a Nokia phone fail on me before &amp; as inconvenient as it was, I thought no problem, I'll just pop into my local Nokia care centre and have them sort it out, after all, it's still got seven months of warranty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is when an amazing thing happened - I was told that I had cracked the screen through miss-use and that I would need to pay $130 for a replacement to be fitted! **bleep**?
<i>😞</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm festidious with the care I take of my phones...always kept it in the nokia pouch it was supplied with, never in my back pocket, never in the same pocket as my keys, etc. (I still have a nokia 6230 that looks in original condition and I've had that for
 over 5 years!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, I shared my frustration with the Nokia care centre employee, but handed over the money through gritted teeth for the repair, at which point she said (And I quote word for word, my wife was also present at the time to witness this statement) -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We've seen this a lot, Nokia are well aware of the problem, I recommend that once we repair it you sell it on ebay and buy a different model, I can show you the more robust version If you like"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd already paid the $130 via my Credit Card for the screen repair. I was, as you can imagine, speechless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got home, did a quick web search, and discovered many other Nokia 6700 Classic owners appear to be experiencing the same screen issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been tempted by the iPhone since they were released, but always stayed loyal to Nokia because of their ease of use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple, here I come, once I've had Mac I wont be coming back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take note of this story if you're considering a Nokia 6700 Classic (or any other Nokia for that matter).</p>

<p>Just to add to the above post as I forgot to mention a couple of things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phone was in pristine condition, not a single mark or scratch, never been dropped or banged around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I intially discussed this 'Cracked screen' with the Nokia care centre employee I pointed out that the actual outer glass screen is perfectly intact with no marks, scrapes or scratches, so how could I have possibly damaged the LCD screen underneath?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To which she just restated that it was 'rough handling'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To which I replied 'The phone was bought last year, it looks brand new, does it look like I've treated it roughly?'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>'No' She said.</p>

<p>Wow, I would be really annoyed and upset if I was in your situation...can you actually see any crack on the LCD screen underneath the outer plastic screen? If you can't I would be definitely telling them that it has to be fixed under warranty..even if you
 can, if you know you haven't dropped or knocked it then you should persist with getting the charges waived.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I must admit I have dropped my 6700c once or twice but luckily this has not occurred to me!</p>

<p>I notice you're in Australia..did you go to the Melbourne care centre by any chance?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia care centres in Australia are renowned for flatly rejecting anything that looks like it could have been caused by physical damage, even if it isn't or the damage is a rsult of normal wear and tear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My advice to you is to call the Nokia Care Line, explain the situation fully and make sure they send the care centre an email saying that the charges have to be reversed!!!!!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you say that the screen went dark do you mean it went completely dark or the contrast randomly got much darker and the text sort of blurry and difficult to read? Because my phone has done this TWICE now. The first time it was working perfectly then
 I picked it up and the background had become much darker, making it very difficult to read or see anything on the screen. However, the problem was solved when I switched to another wallpaper. Today I put my phone down and when I picked it back up the same
 thing had happened again. I only bought the phone in October and there is no outward damage to the screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was this what happened to you? I'm a student and really don't want to have to shell out hundreds of pounds for repairs especially not if it's likely to happen again!</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer some of the questions above first -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes the screen went dark and icons became unreadable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, there was no damage visable to the phone at all, the outer glass screen had no marks or scratches (As with the rest of the phone, it's in perfect condition), and as I said previously I simply placed the phone on my kitchen table in working order, then
 picked it up again 5 minutes later to find the screen had failed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Nokia Care outlet is in Sydney, they took one look at the phone and immediatley said it was a cracked screen due to miss-use. However, as I've stated before, I did not miss-use this phone in any way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally speaking I don't think this phone has been designed well and it obviosuly can't put up with normal use. I'm going to do exactly as the Nokia care employee advised me to do and sell it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see the reply below that I was sent from Nokia regarding this issue -</p>

Hi Paul,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting Nokia Careline. I could relate how frustrating this issue can be. However, since our certified technicians from our Nokia Care Center has already diagnosed that the issue is not covered under warranty, we are not able to assist you
 further as much as we wanted to. You can try to seek assistance from other Nokia Care Centers to a second opinion or for further diagnosis on your phone.<br />
<br />
Please understand that under the Manufacturer's Limited Warranty of your phone, Nokia will handle the repair cost for phone repair under warranty provided that the phone does not have LCD screen issue, has not been exposed to moisture, to dampness or to extreme
 thermal or environmental conditions or to rapid changes in such conditions, to corrosion, to oxidation, to spillage of food or liquid or to influence from chemical products. Please take time to read the Manufacturer's Limited Warranty information below:<br />

<p>Laughable that they suggest I seek a second opinion when they've already fleeced me $ for repairing an obvious design fault that should be covered by warranty and that their own employee admitted that they know these phones have this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My advise to anyone owning this phone is to wrap it on cottom wool and keep it in a bomb proof cover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've just bought an iPhone to replace my Nokia 6700 Classic, can't see me owning another Nokia for quite some time....Say's it all really.</p>

<p>I tend to agree with you that there are design issues with the 6700 (not to mention still unresolved usuability/firmware issues).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The screen failed on my 6700 after only one month of ownership and meticulous care, I even still had the screen protector stuck on the screen from when it was new out of the box. There was no rough handling nor was it dropped etc. Yet the LCD screen "broke"
 anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interesting for a phone fitted with a sensor that encourages you to firmly tap the phone that the phone itself should appear to be of such delicate internal construction. Does anybody use that feature anyway? I found it quite alarming how hard you have to
 hit the phone to get it to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was much luckier than yourself though, it was repaired under warranty without fuss and has been ok since but my confidence in how sturdy and resiliant the 6700 is under routine daily handling has been dented.</p>

<p>I'm from belgium,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got this phone&nbsp; for 3-4 months</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and one day i just take my phone and the screen is very dark and there is a crack in the LCD screen(in the left under corner)&nbsp; on the inside not on the outside,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but the phone did never fall on the ground or something</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the outside the phone is in outstanding condition&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there are no marks or scratches on the entire phone and on the screen there is stil the plastic protection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we went to nokia service and they say that this problem not fell under waranty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Price to repair= 170 euro under your own responsibility</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>see 2 pics</p>
<p>dsc03534 = screen when phone is on you see the crack&nbsp; and the dark screen</p>
<p>dsc03530 = same phone on the same moment only the phone is off now</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Due to what appears to be the fairly regular occurance of cracked screens on the 6700 I would argue that it is a fault in workmanship and materials (a design flaw) and therefore very much a warranty issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course getting Nokia to universally accept that is another thing altogether.</p>
