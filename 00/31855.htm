<h2>            Can&#39;t enable &#34;Hey Cortana&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to enable "Hey Cortana". When I go to the setting and click </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Check Microphone - It opens up the Cortana search window <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5db395ed-3fd6-4aaf-9e6b-25f228204703?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>2. I try to turn on the Hey Cortana - toggle, it toggles back to off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I tried to Troubleshoot the microphone and it didn't detect any problem. </p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/736a7496-bab8-4461-a1d3-f1f2a4a2ea78?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/736a7496-bab8-4461-a1d3-f1f2a4a2ea78?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Then I did a sound test with Skype and evrything worked fine. So the mircophone is working fine.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea83b597-1e9f-41ae-9095-946a5300f831?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ea83b597-1e9f-41ae-9095-946a5300f831?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Then why I am not being able to configure "Hey Cortana"?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Kindly suggest,</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<br />Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it. 
<br />
<br />Click Start
<br />Scroll down to Cortana

<br />
<br />
<br />Method 4: Reinstall Cortana
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />At the command Prompt, type then following the hit Enter.
<br />Exit Powershell the restart
<br />

&nbsp;Hello,</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
To begin with I have followed the following steps:</div>
<div>
<em><br />
</em></div>
<div>
<em>Click Start <br />
Scroll down to Cortana <br />
Right click Cortana <br />
Click More &gt; App Settings <br />
<br />
Click Terminate <br />
Click Reset </em><br />
<div>
<br />
<div>
Doing that, and Checking the Microphone - Got "Hey Cortana" to work. <br />
<div>
Then I asked Cortana to Open MS Edge. It did open it <br />
<div>
<br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>Very Slow</li><li>&nbsp;Now "Hey Cortana" after the operation has stopped responding and I can't even bring up Windows Start Menu. I check the setting for "Hey Cortana" and the same is turned on.<br />
</li></ol>
Not sure why? Any thoughts why it has hung.</div>

            It seems like there are some issues with IPv6 compatibility of either your network adapter or your router, but nothing to really worry about. Disabling IPv6 for your current network adapter might keep the error from showing up in the Event Viewer. Network
 and Sharing Center -&gt; Change adapter settings -&gt; Right mouse click on said network adapter -&gt; Properties -&gt; Uncheck 'Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6)' -&gt; Press OK. You might have to reboot your computer for changes to take effect.

                    <p>Since updating my Windows 10 OS today on my work Surface Pro 4, I no longer have any power options available to me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the power symbol, I no longer see: Sleep/Shut Down/Restart a message comes up stating&nbsp;'There are currently no power options available', the only way to sleep/shutdown is to log out as I have power options available on the sign in screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas anyone as its pretty frustrating!! If you do have solutions please be as detailed as possible in instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

    <title>No sound on HP laptop after Windows 7 updates - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No sound on HP laptop after Windows 7 updates</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have run into some problems this week with the sound on my HP DV6 laptop.</div>
<div>Initially, Windows Automatic Updates failed at installing about 7-8 updates, but I noticed after the failure that the speaker button next to the volume slider bar just above the keyboard turned from white to orange (meaning that the volume was muted),
 however, it didn't show muted on the speaker icon on the task bar nor was the actual speakers or headphones actually muted. They continued to output sound as normal.</div>
<div>I looked up how to get these Windows Updates to install and they did install successfully. However, after updating Security Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2887069), my sound completely stopped working. Speakers, headphones and HDMI are completely
 gone.</div>
<div>I searched Microsoft forums and found many tips to try, but no luck...still no sound!</div>
<div>I tried trouble shooting, uninstalling and re installing the IDT HD Audio CODEC, disabling it, enabling it, updating the BIOS, cleaning the Temp Folder, updating all the other audio drivers, doing a system restore, etc, still NO JOY! Now I'm ready to take
 a hammer to my laptop!</div>
<div>Everything is showing normal with the drivers, trouble shooting is saying there is no problems, I don't have any red X on the speaker icon, the speakers/headphones are set to default audio device.</div>
<div>Can anyone help me figure out this problem?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
                </div>

<strong>64bit to 32bit Custom Clean Install Steps</strong> <br />
<br />
You can use an upgrade disk, but you can't do an in place upgrade from a 64 bit system into a 32 bit system, the only way is to do a custom clean install. This means you'll have to reinstall all your programs, but you can save your files and settings to an
 external storage before doing so with Windows Easy Transfer. Here are the steps according to Microsoft:<br />
<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</a> ) to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation
 and whether you should install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
2. Back up your files and settings. To avoid losing anything you'll need to save copies of all the files, photos, and other information you want to keep on to an external hard drive. Windows Easy Transfer (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer</a>
 ) is a free tool you can use to copy your information (but not programs) from your PC and then put them back after you install Windows 7. If you don't have an external hard drive you won't be able to use Windows Easy Transfer, instead you can copy files you
 want to keep on a USB flash drive, or on CD/DVD.<br />
<br />
3. Locate the original installation disks and any associated product/license keys for the programs currently on your computer because you'll need to manually reinstall all your programs after you install Windows 7. You might be able to download some programs
 from the Internet.<br />
<br />
4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC, restart, and boot from the DVD. When asked "Which type of installation do you want?" click "Custom (advanced)."<br />
<br />
5. After Windows 7 is installed you can use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your files &amp; settings, and use your installation disks to install all your programs.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Ambassador Program</h2>
                    I was once in the Ambassador Program, and then I had an enforcement action against me, it was only a 24hr ban.&nbsp; Its been over a year and was curious as to why I am unable to join back, because from what I can remember, in order to be one you cant have
 any enforcement actions against you in over a year.

            I think it got changed from a year of the date from the enforcement but I could be mistaken, But I know you don't need gold anymore to become an xbox ambassador. If possible you might be able to speak to the ambassador xbox program via email, if you remember
 there contact email address.&nbsp;

            <p>If we get your concern correctly, you'll be adding an alias to your existing Microsoft account that has a domain of bigpond.net.au. You may refer to the discussion posted by

    <title>Can&#39;t see other computers on network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spinneyhill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t see other computers on network</h2>
                    <p>I have three computers on the home network, all on Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit. I had them all seeing each other and sharing files. I allowed this computer to move to Windows 10, which made it unstable with frequent lock-ups. After 3 weeks I took it back
 to Windows 7. The problem seemed to be related to the wireless network card and driver: the computer tried to reset the card when it stopped responding, and a lock-up followed. It is a desktop Dell Studio One (1909).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can't see or be seen by other computers on the network. Network discovery is on as is printer and file sharing. I have tried with antivirus disabled. We do not have a homegroup because it requires IPv6 and the router does not do that. The network is
 set as private. The other two computers can share files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I resolve this problem?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been through the posts you point to. All of those things are done. Network discovery is on everywhere (the others can exchange files). I have full access to the internet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, the problem arose after returning to Windows 7 from Windows 10. I don't recall whether it was a problem under Windows 10. All three computers could see each other and share files prior to this one upgrading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried with both firewall and antivirus software disabled with no improvement.</p>

            <p>I have solved part of the "seeing other computers" problem. Under the wireless network card properties, General tab, Configure, Advanced tab, there is a property "IBSS Mode". It was set to "802.11b only" and I changed it to the other choice, "802.11b/g Auto".
 The router does a/b/g networking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a restart of the wireless network card, it reconnected to the network and I can see the other computers and share files. But they still can't see me. So still some work to do...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see the other computers, only. The others can see the wireless gateway and the wireless repeater as well as each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for looking.</p>

                    I've owned a laptop for the better part of 2 or 3 years, it was brand new when I bought it. It had Windows 7 and it worked perfectly. However ever since my dad forced me to put Windows 8 on it, it hasn't worked right. The most recent problem I've had is
 that Every time I turn it on it loads up and I log in, once logged in Skype and other programs that load up when I log in start to load and then I get the blue screen of death. It says Windows has encountered an error and it's going to reset my computer for
 me before it resets it says i can look up with error on the internet later System_Service_Exception(ks.sys)(considering I can barely get my laptop turned all the way on this is next to impossible, i am on my sister laptop now because she just happened to be
 conveniently around about now.). It has done this to me none stop for the last 4 hours. I've tried everything I can think of. Nothing I've done has worked. &nbsp;Not that I've done much because I know little to nothing about the ac

            <p>Thanks for the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's go ahead and do the following, and then the next time the system crashes, a new crash dump should generate:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />

    <title>wifi not working in Windows 10 tablet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bijanzade  say:</h3>
<h2>            wifi not working in Windows 10 tablet</h2>
                    <p>I just received a Windows 10 tablet from an online purchase. I'm traveling tomorrow so I can't do anything about returning it. I prefer to keep it and just want it fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the wifi symbol shows a small red X on the wifi symbol. It won't see any available connections. The wifi symbol shows that it is turned off yet in Device Manager the adapter is showing its there and the hardware is working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the driver and rebooted the tablet, no change.</p>
<p>I disabled it and re-enabled it and no change.</p>
<p>I found an article about VPN but this is a new tablet so it does not apply. but I did try to delete the registry entry that pertains to an older VPN and it did not do anything.</p>
<p>I went into Services and checked the WLAN settings and everything was ok.</p>
<p>I installed Driver Talent and it did not fix the issue.</p>
<p>I found the most recent version of the driver on another computer and then transferred it on to the tablet and installed it. Again no change in functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The wifi settings show that the wifi is on but the wifi symbol is showing its turned off. Driver Talent shows that the adapter is missing. How can the OS show that the wifi is on and then on the taskbar says its turned off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or advice other than what I've done would be greatly helpful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I could connect the tablet to the internet (not sure how as the only way to go online is via wifi) maybe updates would solve the problem. Is there a way to update the tablet via a different computer and transfer the updates to the tablet?</p>
<p>

Assassin’s Creed 3 Hidden Secrets DLC Out Today
“From lost Mayan ruins to the high seas.”

<p>The first downloadable content for Assassin’s Creed III launches today. Called the Hidden Secrets Pack, the content will be available on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and PC for Season Pass holders. The pack will launch for everyone else on December 11th, and
 Ubisoft notes that the content will come to Wii U “at a later date.”</p>
<p>The Hidden Secrets pack includes three missions: the Lost Mayan Ruins, the Ghost of War, and a Dangerous Secret. Ubisoft says the pack will add about an hour of extra content and will take players “from lost Mayan ruins to the high seas.” In-game weapons
 will be rewarded for completing each mission. The pack will also include two single-player costumes (Captain of the Aquila uniform and traditional Colonial Assassin outfit) and two multiplayer characters (the Redcoat and Sharpshooter).</p>
<p>Players who buy the Season Pass will pay 25% less than they would by purchasing each pack separately. The Hidden Secrets pack is the first of five planned expansions, with future content

<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />If you go to start - settings - time and language - region and language - add a language.
<br />Do you have that option in Settings?

            Unfortunately that option is not there. The only Bulgarian keyboard that is available is a latin one, which means nothing or the Cyrillic one which has a different layout. There doesn't seem to be a Phonetic one. Any other suggestions?

            <p>Have you tried reactivating by telephone?<br />
<br />
Activate Windows 7 manually:<br />
1. Click Start, and in the Search box type :&nbsp; slui.exe 4<br />
<br />
2. Press ENTER on your Keyboard<br />
<br />
3. Select your Country.<br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, and hold on for a real person. <br />
<br />
Where did you purchase your license?<br />
<br />
Please run the Microsoft Genuine Diagnostics Tool then copy and paste the results in a reply here for further analysis:<br />

<br />
Microsoft's Response: Microsoft is committed to helping prevent software piracy, which often results in end users being the victims of software counterfeiters. Counterfeiters abuse product keys to create fake software packages and distribute these to the public.
 These packages are not licensed, do not have Microsoft support, and can also include dangerous malware and spyware.
<br />
<br />
Recently there have been a few keys purchased from auction sites showing up here as non genuine, they appear to be connected to this HROnline code HrOnline: 0xC004C4A2. If you purchased a key from EBAY please realize that the seller may have sold that key to
 multiple people resulting in that key becoming blacklisted. These keys were never meant for resale, they were meant for software development or evaluation depending on the program they were obtained through. If you purchased one of these keys and it has become
 non-genuine with the above code you may need purchase a new license for windows 7. Attempt to validate by going to www.microsoft.com/geniune and follow the links provided to repair windows.<br />
<br />
Added note. You only have a limited amount of time (45 days I believe) to file a claim with the auction sites. Stay away from these keys, if you purchased a key that has turned non-genuine and are within the 45 days of purchase file a claim. There are legitimate
 software vendors on auction sites but if it sounds to good to be true then don't buy it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;It seems you are running a license intended for a particular channel. Yes, you might have a perfectly looking hologram disk, but this doesn't mean the license is legitimate since its easy these days to make hologram disks. Persons who work at the factory can
 secretly create hologram disks they resell on the black market or purchase press machines to do the job.<br />
<br />

<br />
EDIT: Additional information<br />
<br />
Things to watch out for.<br />
<br />
Lately there have been several reports of instances of blocked MSDN keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media and reciepts, if you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the store you purchased
 it from and report it to www.microsoft.com/piracy&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you have purchased a key, with or without DVD's or packaging from EBAY or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN key because your key has been blocked you can check a few things yourself, if you received your key with the physical product
 go to www.microsoft.com/howtotell and verify your product however some counterfeit software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.<br />
<br />
To check your PID press the win key and pause at the same time, or open system properties through the control panel, scroll down to activation section and look at the PID It will look something like this 12345-067-1234567-54321, the portion you are interested
 in is the three digit section, if it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have an MSDN key.<br />
<br />
065, 066, 067, 068 for Ultimate, 220, 221 area for Pro and the 230, 231, 221, 232 area for premium, there are probably others but they should be close to those posted<br />
<br />
About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys <br />
They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose
 is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside
 of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses
 it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.<br />
<br />
In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere along
 the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.<br />
<br />
Validate Now:<br />
You can confirm that your software is genuine now. It’s quick and easy.<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate/ValidateNow.aspx?displaylang=en<br />
Click the 'Validate Windows' button, if the validation check fails, then click on the 'Get Genuine' button to get a WGA Kit.

<p>Frequently after Windows attempts to resume from sleep I get the blue screen of death and my laptop reboots. When Windows restart I get an error stating Windows has recovered from an error and suggests I follow the instructions listed below. I have followed
 them multiple times but it keeps happening. Any ideas?</p>

Asus probably makes some of the parts in your laptop.

            Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Cameras
<br />Right click the camera, then click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Note: If you don't see it under cameras, look under Imaging devices. 
<br />
<br />Exit device manager then restart.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 should redetect it then reinstall it.
<br />
<br />Check if the camera is working again.
<br />
<br />If you have a third party Antivirus utility installed, please remove it.
<br />
<br />Option 1. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc or right-click empty space on the toolbar.
<br />Open “Task Manager” and go to the “Processes” tab.
<br />Carefully analyze what programs are currently running in the background of the system.
<br />If you found an app that uses Camera, for example, Skype running in the background, click it, and select “End Task.”
<br />
<br />Option 2. Try a Clean Boot
<br />Click “Windows key” and type msconfig.
<br />Click “System Configuration” and open “Services” tab.
<br />Mark “Hide all Microsoft services” box and select “Disable all.”
<br />Open “Startup” tab and click “Open Task Manager.”
<br />Click on each startup item and select “Disable.”
<br />Close Task Manager and click “OK” on the System Configuration window.
<br />Reboot the system.
<br />
<br />If Clean Boot helped to fix error, we would recommend you to enable apps one by one. After each enabled app, check if the Camera is working. This way, you will isolate the problematic application.

    <title>XBL Rip-Offs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dil power  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBL Rip-Offs</h2>
                    
<p>I would like to start this thread to denounce how Microsoft is ripping us off, XBL customers in so many different ways. Please feel free to add your experiences to the list:</p>
<p>Mass Effect 2 - Xbox owners have invested a lot in the Mass Effect franchise providing Bioware / EA with about 75 % of it's sales of the entire trilogy (Mass Effect 1, 2 &amp; 3) in comparison to PC and PS3 sales. Now it would make a lot of sense for us to be
 somehow compensated for our loss. But what did I discover this week? PS3 owners can get the full brand new Mass Effect 2 game with the inclusion of the following 3 DLC :<span>"Kasumi - Stolen Memories", "Overlord", and "Lair of the Shadow Broker" for how much?
 FREE! On the other hand, proud supporters of the Mass Effect franchise that we are, Xbox owners, we get to buy them for a total of 1920 microsoft points thanks to XBL negotiating rotten deals with EA and Bioware. That is comparing about 30 $ to... 0 $. It's
 a bit like XBL gold actually! You can purchase it for like 59.99 $ a year or you can play online for FREE by simply purchasing a PS3. Yup, think about it, if you own an Xbox 360 since release in 2005 well you have invested 60 $ x 7 years on XBL, for a total
 of 420 $ which would have actually gotten you a PS3 right now, with free online multiplayer! Wow, thank you XBL! Returning to Mass Effect, if you haven't had the chance to play the first game of the trilogy you can either play a 5 $ DLC called "Genesis" to
 catch up on the storyline / decision making or you can simply, once more, buy the Mass Effect 2 game and download "Genesis" for FREE on the PSN.</span></p>
<p>The verdict? PS3 owners take another clear win with what used to be one of the few proud Xbox 360 franchises (i.e. Mass Effect). If you haven't played the game and you like to play the rest of your gaming library online, the only rationale conclusions is
 to trade your system for a PS3 and hell, you'll get your money's worth allright!</p>
<p>(To any xbox.com moderators reading this, don't start wining about the content, I don't work for Sony, I don't own a PS3, I'm simply feeling like I'm getting ripped and I'm using my God given right to express my discontent. The Xbox has it's advantages otherwise
 I would have never bought one in the first place, but Microsoft is doing a terrible job out of taking care of it's customers and the competition, in this case Sony, is making you guys look bad.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mores to the point these are all things MS have no control over, these are all things that are EA's call not MS's. Come to think of it ME2 has been out for a good three years now why have you only just now noticed this discrepancy and why are you outraged
 by this but not outraged enough to stop giving EA money (you've got NFS: Hot Pursuit in your played games list)?<br />
<br />
Come to think of it this is the forum for people with techy queries, why are you here and not in the Mass Effect folder?&nbsp;</p>

            @VernierSlake EA has it's fair share of the responsibility but you'd be pretty naive to think Microsoft couldn't do anything about it, the install base alone gives them tremendous power but they probably did not waive it for the sake of profits. They were
 sloppy about keeping the entire trilogy an exclusive (i.e. not only ME1) and they were sloppy about many other things. Nintendo did a much better job sealing all the "key" Rare characters like Donkey Kong when Rare was purchased from Microsoft... And look
 what is left of the studio!? Kinect Sports ? 1, 2 and now 3 on the way! I purchased ME3 on release because of Bioware, not EA. And since you're asking I also have Battlefield 1 and 2 in my played games list... And those together with Hot Pursuit I paid an
 average of 5 $, I doubt you could say I encouraged EA in the process. Why am I here well perhaps I did land in the wrong forum, but at least posting I did. I in the forumw because this is my last resort after an XBL representative essentiall

<p>It's included in the price, indeed. And I understand most of you guys would have rather purchased it on released. I would have done the same, only as a latecomer to the entire Mass Effect series, I have indeed been ripped given I could have purchased the
 brand new PS3 versions for 15 $ when the bundled DLC would cost a ridiculous 30 $ on the Xbox.</p>
<p>Ahem being on sale at some point vs being bundled is like... infinetely different. They should have at least released a special, for example, game of the year edition with bundled DLC on the xbox, but Microsoft likely couldn't keep it's greedy fingers off
 the lucrative DLC. Mind you the sales part I would like to consider but, I might be the only one with such an issue but I find it extremely hard not to miss good deals on XBL for the simple reason that I haven't found an efficient way (please enlighten me
 if you know of any!) to keep track of the current short lived deals outside of XBL directly on my console. I often don't turn my machine on for a week or two at a time... I could easily order online from xbox.com if they at least had a mailing list or something...</p>
<p>Going back to "getting the full ME experience"... Metacritic and the current state of video game graphics will back me up if I say that if you were two pick 2 of the 3 games, make it ME2 and ME3 (although I did enjoy the story of ME1 greatly the graphics
 were hard to bare not to mention loading and saving times and countless other glitchers)</p>

<p>Just to remind you, there would be no ME2 on PS3 without the included DLC. That's a Sony requirement for a late published title to be put on the platform. Same thing happened with Oblivion.[quote]I haven't found an efficient way (please enlighten me if you

<p>Thank you for the 'Major Nelson' link, it isn't ideal, but it's a start. I still think the initiative should originate from Microsoft and be available through xbox.com but I'll take it for what it's worth.</p>
<p>Yup I am bitter at XBL right now, I have all rights to be. Even if you'd work for Microsoft you should understand that... and nope, it isn't a matter of 'homework' I could still trade my console and get all the content for cheaper buying the PS3 version
 (and get free online gaming in the process, a larger amount of exclusives, to name a few perks, topic which we might as well not get started on... LOL). I probably won't, for the same reason I said in the initial post the Xbox has it's advantages (for one
 I would take Gears over Killzone and Resistance) but the goal of my post was to see what other bad experiences people had with XBL, although you have all rights to disagree with my experience of it.
</p>
<p>Dude, Microsoft distributes the content. I never said EA was clean, but Microsoft is the seller. Just like you said it yourself Sony required of EA to put the DLC on the late release, well it would be nice to see Microsoft lobbying for us XBL users a little
 more often. I'm not saying they never do but I think I made my point.</p>
<p>Anyways I believe my discontent is justified. At this rate I might just get a second console...
</p>
<p>Nah, I wasn't a completionist of ME1 (again the story was amazing but the gameplay and graphics were a huge step back after having played the 2nd one) but I will agree with you I still prefer that over the 'Genesis' thing. As for ME2 mind you I'll definitely
 have to get my hands on this DLC whether it's the PS3 or the XBL way. At least the Shadow Broker one.</p>
<p>Thanks for the blog suggestion once again. Have a nice day.</p>

<p>Major Nelson is the public face of XBOX. He works for Microsoft. Would you rather your weekly source of information for everything on XBOX Live be a fake individual like certain other companies?[quote]Yup I am bitter at XBL right now, I have all rights to

 platforms.[quote]I could still trade my console and get all the content for cheaper buying the PS3 version[/quote]You could. And if money is the only factor you're considering then by all means make the decision that is right for you.[quote]Dude, Microsoft
 distributes the content. I never said EA was clean, but Microsoft is the seller.[/quote]No, that's not how it works. While MS may set some guidelines, EA is large enough that if they want to do certain things which MS does not allow for regular partners, they
 can. EA runs their own servers. EA has cut deals with MS before. EA's pretty adamant about charging for content as often as possible. Putting ME3 up on Origin instead of allowing it on Steam, Origin's lack of Steam-like sales, EA not putting out a Game of
 the Year edition of titles, etc. EA's in this to make sure you are licensing content, not buying games, and when Live shuts down for the 360 you can kiss all your DLC goodbye.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I play the ME series on the 360 as that's where it started and I have a vested interest in my Shepard. I'm under no illisions that in ten years the ability to play ME, ME2, and ME3 to their fullest will no longer be available. The DLC will "go away" and
 there will be no recourse.[quote]it would be nice to see Microsoft lobbying for us XBL users a little more often.[/quote]Google for "XBOX 360 timed exclusive". That's MS "lobbying" for you. MS cuts deals to get DLC, demos, and whole games on the 360 platform
 ahead of Sony on a regular basis.[quote]I think I made my point.[/quote]What you see as lobbying is cut-rate pricing. That's not how Microsoft works. If you want things cheaper rather than first, then buy your content on the PS3. It's the home of ports and
 after-360 consideration for many multi-platform titles and DLC.</p>

<p>I would rather be on a mailing list directly from XBL not from an idependant blog, that being said I had heard of Major Nelson yet I was not aware he 'works for Microsoft'.</p>
<p>What if I like the services but I don't think they're perfect??? That is what feedback is for, that is why all the people who are unhappy with the ME3 ending yet chose to purchase the game will be given an extended cut free DLC thanks to Bioware (I wonder
 what EA had to say about this). Same thing here, I buy Microsoft products and realistically believe the products should be improved upon and as such I'd like to see what issues other people have. But I realise both you and VernierSlake might be utopic (to
 avoid the term biased) in believing one should assume XBL and the Xbox 360 are perfect as they are and anyone disagreeing should buy something else. Issues arise all the time, again you can disagree with mine, but I still think the best companies listen to
 their customers. Sure, not if it's an isolated case but yet I would expect more understanding out of XBL support on the phone than to be enouraged to trade my system for a PS3 (say what you may that was the conclusion of curtious 2 min. conversation). For
 one he could have told me, like you did that the DLC comes on special and where to look for those specials??? Anyways...
</p>
<p>What do you mean when live shuts down? The installed DLC still works even offline doesn't it... ? Gosh that would really suck. Granted it has to be downloaded while XBL is running...</p>
<p>The exclusives could be a hot topic. I don't have to google it. IMO Sony takes the win here at least for 2012, maybe even 2011. All those silly Kinect games are pretty sad excuses for an exclusive there are too many issues with the controls to make anything
 else than kids and dancing games successful (at least to date).</p>
<p>@VernierSlake</p>
<p>Did I ever say Rare owned Donkey Kong characters? Nope. I agree the comparison might be a stretch because Mass Effect "belonged" to Bioware but the essence of what I'm trying to say is the quality of the games Rare has been doing since under Microsoft management
 has been steadily going down. Well unless you think Kinect sports is an improvement over banjo and kazooie.</p>

    <title>Startup Repair is not doing anything - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> captain man  say:</h3>
<h2>            Startup Repair is not doing anything</h2>
                    
<p>First off, I need to vent. This sucks. This is untimely as I have many assignments due this week and one 75% done on the hard drive...</p>
<p>Anyways, here is the problem, I will boot up, everything is fine until the Windows loading screen, the one with the shimmering window, it stays there for longer than usual than there is an extremely brief (less than a second) Blue Screen of Death (I believe
 it is called a stop error?) than the computer retsarts. It does not go to the login screen. From here, it will say (after BIOS of course,) that windows has not started up correctly and needs to run startup repair. So I let it run this, and, honestly, this
 is the worst Windows program I have seen (I am a huge Windows junkie, too...) it has a black screen for a while then goes to a blue screen like the screen for logging in but without the log in box and my mouse is on the screen. Nothing happens from here! How
 long am I supposed to wait? This has happened to me before, a couple months ago, and a grey dialog box popped up.</p>
<p>Another thing I have tried is using the Windows 7 Repair Disk I made. Same situation exactly! One difference: it asks me what language I want and what type of key board I am using, after that, the blue log in screen (not the log in screen... I call it that
 because it's blue but not the blue screen of death.) I literally left my computer on that screen for over 24 hours and NOTHING happened...</p>
<p>I tried doing the f8 thing to do a safe mode bootup, but the only options were startup repair and normally. Can anyone help me PLEASE?? I have system images I can revert to if absolutely necessary, but obviously, I need to at least get into safe mode...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks so much in advance,</p>
<p>Jackson</p>

<p>Try this:<br />
1. Set your BIOS so that it uses the DVD drive as its primary boot device.<br />
2. Boot the machine with your Windows 7 Repair CD.<br />
3. Press a key if prompted to boot from the DVD.<br />
4. Select "Safe Mode Command Prompt" when prompted.<br />
5. Log on as Administrator if prompted.<br />
6. Select Repair when prompted.<br />
7. Select System Restore when prompted.<br />
8. Set Windows back to a point before this problem occurred.<br />
9. When finished, remove the CD before rebooting the system.<br />
In Step 2 you could also use your Windows 7 installation DVD. The subsequent steps are similar to the ones above.</p>
