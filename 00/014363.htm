<h2>            Outlook 2016 &#40;365&#41; Deleted and Sent items not appearing in the approprite Boxes.</h2>
                    <p>I am using Outlook 2016 under W10 imap to a Gmail account.</p>
<p>Q1.&nbsp; What is the plain Outlook Data File (ODF) all about?</p>
<p>Q2.&nbsp; Why are my deleted items showing under the Gmail/Bin folder instead of either of my Deleted Items folders, Gmail and ODF?</p>
<p>Q3.&nbsp; Why are my sent items&nbsp; showing under the Gmail/Sent Mail folder instead of level 1 Folder?</p>
<p>Q4. Why does a deleted folder re-appear in the Bin folder on re-start</p>
<p>I suspect that Q2-Q4 are some sort of setting in Gmail but I can't see it.&nbsp; Neither can I see any Outlook setting.</p>
<p>Any help gratefully appreciated.</p>

            I prefer the direct method of using <i>Alt+nnnn</i>&nbsp;to get the ASCII character. You can refer to the following table to get the ASCII code for each letter:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=161352CE07628E22&amp;id=161352CE07628E22%21570#cid=161352CE07628E22&amp;id=161352CE07628E22%211759" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwcoeyq.sn2.livefilestore.com%2fy1mgsuWZg6OKr_6N5gFf6MXc1ffJ28i7f8pFFyE_oJTVPbepRdHAWD-MhXvGVdQ4tPJO6inJMeA8wTt31migmNUL5-LpbW1qsbrN_xsb294FIZLwN-xtYEumQ%2fForeign_Characters.PNG%3fpsid%3d1" /></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hold down one of the <i>Alt</i>&nbsp;keys and tap the four digit associated with each ASCII character on the NumPad with NumLck on.<br />
<br />
Alternate methods include getting the character from the <i>Insert</i>&nbsp;tab's <i>Symbol</i>&nbsp;command. You can also set up an
<i>AutoCorrect</i>&nbsp;entry to replace <i>U</i><i>·&lt;period&gt;·</i><i>&lt;period&gt;</i>&nbsp;with Ü.

<h3> anton de ruiter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Synchronize only selected catagories</h2>
                    
<p>I have two PDA's:</p>
<p>- Compaq iPAQ 3760 with Microsoft Pocket PC version 3.0</p>
<p>- HTC TyTN II with Microsoft Windows Mobile 6.1 Professional</p>
<p>and I synchronize them with Microsoft Office Outlook 2003 SP3 on the same Windows XP computer with Microsoft ActiveSync version 4.5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In OutLook I have appointments which are based on the Hebrew Lunar Calendar, but because the Calendar application on the PDA's cannot handle these appointments, I have selected for these appointments a special category, named Lunar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I synchronize with the old Compaq with Pocket PC, than I can select the option synchronize only those appointments in the following selected catagories and I can exclude the category Lunar, but this option is not visible during the synchronisation
 with the new HTC with Windows Mobile, with the result that these appointments are synchronized wrongly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I exclude certain categories from the synchronisation with Windows Mobile?</p>

            Unfortunately, this feature has been removed in Activesync 4.x and Windows Mobile 5. I recommend you check out PocketMirror Professional from
<a href="http://www.chapura.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.chapura.com</a>. It lets you sync by Category.

<p>Hello Absolute Computers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for my delayed response and thanks for your information. According to above post, from my understanding, the sending IP have PTR record and can resolve to the server, but the server’s FQDN can’t be resolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further look into it, I’d like to confirm whether issue still persists. Also, may I know where did you get the IP address? How is the frequency of the issue? If issue continues, I need to confirm some information

<p>Hello thank you for your suggestion, however please note that problem which I am facing occures during the instalation of new software update with use of Windows Device Recovery tool. So there is no need to suggest that I should try to use this tool again.
 Unfortunately it does not change the thing and I keep on running into same problem again and again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So once again my problem is that when I s<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">tart instaling a software update with use of Windows device Recovery tool , instalation is stopped with error message - "The software is not signed for this phone

            <p>This virus replaces the sp_connector.exe installed by Sansung printer driver. It then proceeds to popup multiple messages and runs a process that does unknown things. I detected it because of the messages that kept popping up when I started the system. You
 can tell that the file has been replaced because the created date is the current data when you are infected rather than the 2010 date ir should be.&nbsp;I had to restore a backup from last week to get rid of it.There are many websites that offer to clean this virus
 so it appears tio be a well known virus.</p>

    <title>When is Optimization Not Optimization&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cmalcheski  say:</h3>
<h2>            When is Optimization Not Optimization&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been reading a lot of discussion all over the web for some time that indicates an overwhelming consensus that many parts of Windows are "optimized."&nbsp; Trust me - it is not the case.&nbsp; Because a) people just get lazy, and b) what today's universities
 are churning out is a dumbed-down "I know how to use macros" level of "developer" who knows little about what they are working with but carries that almighty degree so they are presumed to know everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Citing DirectX as the most glaring example, because optimization is so critical in that realm, the inefficiencies and mistakes I see are staggering.&nbsp; It was written somewhere that the calling convention for 64-bit functions was designed around "wanting to
 clean up" the old 32-bit method.&nbsp; What resulted was a nightmare of waste and bloat that helps nobody and drags down the system to an amazing degree.&nbsp; The first four parameters are passed in r8, r9, rcx, and rdx.&nbsp; But you still have to create space for them
 on the stack, even though most (all?) times they don't actually need to be placed there; just reserve the space.&nbsp; WHY???&nbsp;&nbsp;Then subsequent parameters go to [esp+20h], etc.&nbsp; Then the entire stack has to be&nbsp;16-byte aligned&nbsp;for each call - necessary for later
 calls to functions that might use SSE, but won't actually care about&nbsp;that stack alignment since each function realigns its local variable usage anyway&nbsp;.&nbsp; "Inline" DirectXMath library functions are even worse.&nbsp; Undocumented parameters are rampant, XMM registers
 are used for parameter passing and obey few to none of the rules for register preservation, and the entire resulting mess&nbsp;is like a circus of incompetence that reflects a disturbing lack of understanding about what is going on at the hardware level.&nbsp; Intel
 requires that XMM registers must access memory on even 16-byte boundaries; movdqu can override this but it's much slower to execute - so in these special cases, the stack alignment MIGHT make some sense except that parameters are always passed in the XMM registers.&nbsp;
 The DirectXMath library is a nightmare of inefficiency, hitting memory with reckless abandon when typically 20x faster register usage could be employed instead at no cost, all indicating the authors just did not have any clue about what optimization really
 means.&nbsp; The ten matrix functions I hand-coded in ASM out of the DirectXMath library ran between eight and one hundred six times faster than their XMMatrix___ counterparts because they got rid of the excessive, sloppy memory hits all over the function and did
 all their work in registers.&nbsp; Half the XMMatrixMultiply function was removed and SIMD capabilities were easily employed to cut out most of the execution time of the DirectXMath version.&nbsp;&nbsp;What I saw in the DirectXMath library&nbsp;is an amateur hack at best that
 the average devoted high school freshman would have no problem increasing the execution speed of many times over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation is not just bad ... it is catastrophic.&nbsp; Left and right are insane implementations like moving a value from memory to a register then, on the very next instruction, moving that same value from the same register to the same location in memory
 it just came from.&nbsp; Filling memory that should not be used in the first place with 0xCC - micro-managing the developer and ensuring no uninitialized pointers are used - in cases where every last byte of the "fill zone" is guaranteed to be overwritten by the
 code ahead of it.&nbsp; Stupid, stupid, inept, incompetent things like this are out of control in the DirectXMath library, and one can only assume that this would be the best case scenario.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMHO this is why Aero was removed: dumbing down the OS to the lowest common phone (iPaci) denominator created a slew of room for covering up this lack of programming knowledge Windows-wide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't assume anything is "optimized."&nbsp; The deeper you go into the code of any API, the more horrific it becomes.</p>

<p>
</p><p>your assertion is correct: &nbsp;it's optimized for THE LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>that means no taking advantage of features available in HIGH END HARDWARE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it also means NO INTERFACE ELEMENTS for SAVVY USERS. &nbsp;Only the "n00b" interface remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And of course it's overly-minimalistic, like a stick figure. &nbsp;The 2D flat look. &nbsp;YUCHKK! &nbsp;(maybe it works on a phone, but *NOT* on a DESKTOP)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the back end, ".Not" is the *LEAST* optimized API I've *EVER* seen. &nbsp;It's basically "bass-ackwards" in the way it does things. &nbsp;You do *NOT* start with "the universe" as a collection, and THEN drill down to what you need. &nbsp;That's just way DUMB. &nbsp;[I think
 THIS kind of thinking with espect to "the registry" has made it THE! MOST! INEFFICIENT! TIME-WASTING! "feature" IN! WINDOWS! and it SLOWS! THINGS! WAY! DOWN! and I've done PERFORMANCE! TESTS! TO! PROVE! IT!]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, ".not" was a boondoggle in the noughties, and now "flat look METRO" is a boondoggle in the teens. &nbsp;No amount of 'lipstick on the boar' is going to FIX this.</p>

            <p>I suppose it is human nature to become lazier and lazier, dumber and dumber, replacing true skill and knowledge with hype, glitter, and b.s. for as long as&nbsp;doing so&nbsp;works.&nbsp; I was quite taken aback to find the sheer number of people who agree with what I
 have been preaching since Windows 8 first came out: a desktop is not a phone ("paci" being short for "pacifier;" i.e. the iPaci).&nbsp; For years before that I was telling people the runaway bloat and inefficiency of today's languages was going to bring MS up against
 a brick wall where degradation of software was outpacing leaps forward in hardware, and the hardware could simply no longer take up the slack.&nbsp; MS probably breathed a huge sigh of relief when the iPaci fad took hold; it allowed them a whole new basement to
 store more useless clutter in.&nbsp; But now that one is full too.&nbsp; Win 10 is not terrible on the whole, other than that start menu which obviously nobody likes.&nbsp; The whole metro concept is lame and idiotic.&nbsp; Find some people who understand how to program.&nbsp; Quit
 being so afraid to pay them an American salary.&nbsp; Every single employee does not need to be an import working at half cost.&nbsp; Aero was the best UI element ever developed by MS; it needs to come back.&nbsp; If code bloat is so great that it can now not be effectively
 supported, clean up the code.&nbsp; I wonder how they'll handle the next huge step backward in technological de-evolution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was amazed to hear all the hype around DirectX 12 being 50% to 70% faster than 11.&nbsp; Clean up the math library.&nbsp; You'd see 10x or more speed improvements across the board just by doing that.&nbsp; When&nbsp;an unknown nobody like me comes out of nowhere without warning,
 with a hand-coded assembly language pop-in version of the DirectX math library that accelerates any and all DirectX apps to 10x or even 20x their current speed, what then?&nbsp; Will that be an embarrassment or what?&nbsp; Perhaps time will tell.&nbsp; There is an ultimate
 price for selling out and hiring only cheap cut-rate foreign labor.&nbsp; The problem is, MS will be decades in figuring that out, preferring instead to grapple with all the problems attendant with that approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. if you're really serious about a project's confidentiality, develop it on a system that has never connected to the internet and never will.</p>

<p>you're definitely RIGHT ON with THAT comment.</p>

</p><p>'Rapid Application Development' aka 'RAD' started back in the 90's. &nbsp;It was an *attempt* to get the expensive software development process 'out of the loop'. &nbsp;".Not" (aka '.Net') was a FAILED attempt with the 'common runtime' and C-pound (aka C#) language
 to do this VERY thing. &nbsp;Basically it was VB-izing java and C++. &nbsp;I *hate* C-pound! &nbsp;It's not very popular as a dev language, either, sorta like how Windows 8 isn't very popular as an OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>yeah too much "object-orientedness" to the point of analysis paralysis in the dev process, too many 'agile' scrum meetings and other nonsensical time-wasters thrown in, making it more SOCIAL and "a chance" for the JUNIOR guy to get HIS way. &nbsp;All of that
 crept into Windows 10, I think, and now we have this cluster-{blank} of an OS and UI and NOBODY will want it! &nbsp;not even if it's FREE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are better ways to do quickly applications. &nbsp;Android actually has a simple one, where you use the webkit engine for the UI and do callbacks into your Java code. &nbsp;I think WinRT was based on THAT concept, but it has *LIMITED* usefulness, NOT! THE! ENTIRE!
 USER! INTERFACE! FOR! THE! OPERATING! SYSTEM!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>added: &nbsp;I'm a fan of MFC 'dialog based' applications for quicky things. &nbsp;You can 'pound one out' in an hour or two, typically, if you just want a simple interface. &nbsp;In the POSIX world, there's a package called 'dialog' (for text-based), and 'xdialog' (for
 X Windows) that lets you use THE COMMAND LINE to do simple dialog boxen stuff FROM A SHELL SCRIPT. &nbsp;You can't get SIMPLER than THAT!</p>

            I would have approached the whole thing in a very simple way: an iPaci is an iPaci.&nbsp; A desktop is a desktop.&nbsp; Ne'er the twain shall meet.&nbsp; Phone development goes this way, desktop development goes that way.&nbsp; I suppose it comes from Leonid Brezhnev's promised
 (during the 1950's) infiltration of the American university system (which was 100% successful): we are indoctrinated from birth into believing certain concepts (commonly called "brainwashing"), like writing even one line of code is "reinventing the wheel;"
 instead you must go dumpster diving for any decades-old piece of trash that can be jury rigged into whatever project your doing.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if you spend 5 days finding and resurrecting and patching that discard, in the name of saving two days of work
 writing it yourself; as long as you're not doing real programming, you're not "reinventing the wheel."&nbsp; Then there is "robust."&nbsp; The most destructive term ever to enter the software development commu

            <p>I have my own theory on this: the people making the big decisions have been so insulated from the real end user "on the street" for their entire lives that the best they can do is make these huge decisions based on surreal conceptualization.&nbsp; How else could
 we see such amazing ignorance in the face of what the whole world is screaming about?&nbsp; Bring back Aero!&nbsp; Lose Metro!&nbsp; A desktop is not a phone!&nbsp; They are not getting it and probably never will.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Chicago area there is a candy company called Ferrara.&nbsp; They had a longstanding rule in that company: nobody goes into management until they have operated every production line and machine on the floor for a certain amount of time.&nbsp; How can you effectively
 manage positions you have never worked yourself?&nbsp; Aside from surviving the Great Depression, they went through a series of acquisitions and mergers, finally merging with the "other" juggernaut candy company Farley &amp; Sathers because they were big enough to
 do that.&nbsp; They acquired Brach's candy, bought a ton of candy lines from Kraft and Hershey, and today dominate the candy world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is MS headed in that direction? Or are they moving backward?&nbsp; The answer is obvious.&nbsp; MS has a history of thinking every new fad is here to stay, and all they need to do is bully their way into a dominant position inside that fad and they're set for life.&nbsp;
 Like a toddler, with a comparable attention span afforded to any given product, they only want to concern themselves with what is hot today, throwing everything else to the ground as they are no longer intrigued by it.&nbsp; There seems to be no concept of good
 and bad times always cycling and riding out the bad.&nbsp; They seem to be under a delusion that Crapple of today is doable for them (Crapple will crash - it is only&nbsp;a matter of time, as 95% of their "value" is inflated and imagined).&nbsp; They make knee-jerk sweeping
 changes with reckless, juvenile incompetence as a matter of course.&nbsp; The world is screaming in their ear and they are not listening.&nbsp; They are not Crapple.&nbsp; They can never BE Crapple.&nbsp; Crapple runs on addiction, not value; they are a cartel.&nbsp; As such their
 market will continue to be chipped away at by a million competitors - none of whom will ever grab the lion's share of their market but all of whom, together, will gradually reduce it to nothing.&nbsp; Crapple survives on charging $15 for candy bar and making the
 victim think they got something great.&nbsp; They survive on elitism, addiction, and insecurity.&nbsp; They put out a new iPaci every 6 months because they known that like MS, every addict will throw out the iPaci they paid $500 for (with accessories) 6 months ago and
 camp out at Best Buy to get the new one.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, not only are they nearly void of American citizens working in their ranks, their management structure is equally void.&nbsp; It is all 1st generation, half-price&nbsp;immigrants from the top down.&nbsp; The point being, these people grew up in a different world, a
 different economy, and they take that ignorance of American intricacies into America where all the rules change and nothing they know applies.&nbsp; This&nbsp;is why they do not listen to the public outcry - they come from countries where you&nbsp;just don't do that, and
 that works in those countries - but not here.&nbsp; They will not change their ways.&nbsp; The next fifty versions of Windows will all stick to Metro as if it were something *anybody* wanted.&nbsp; They simply don't know any better.&nbsp; What happens to any company when you
 get people running it who are not even close to qualified to be running it?</p>

            <p>MSFT has never been about optimization. DX12 is just the latest in this. Many of the library and help functions in DX all the way back to 8 could be hand written to be at least 5 times faster and in many cases smaller. ASM Reg clobbering is standard practice
 at MSFT. I write a lot of asm code for TI Calculators where space and speed are a premium. I think if I had tons of memory and wasn't using a 13MHz processor (or 22Mhz depending on the model) I could afford to be more loose although I would still not because
 its just my nature to be as fast and efficient as I can with my code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bob talks about the dumbing down of machines, which I agree about, but I think it also has to do with the dumbing down of people. Millenials cant understand things too complex so lets make it easier for them. .Nut is a prime example. No matter what you want
 to do theres an interface with a method for it. Anyone can easily write giant programs in just a few short lines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I regularly talk to a guy who swears by .Nut but when he asks me a question its always something so basic. One time I posted some code for someone else to look at there was a line</p>
<p>
</p><p>register volatile short int __inc_counter;</p>
<p>
</p><p>His problem was with the volatile qualifier. He didn't understand that the variable would be altered in such a way (asynchronous) that the compiler wouldn't understand so some optimizations from the compiler could break its usage and that volatile tells
 the compiler to not "optimize" that variable. Now im sure .Nut uses qualifiers as well so wouldn't he already know that? I see that a lot. People who yesterday didn't know how to spell code but today after spending 10 minutes with .Nut feel like a veteran
 developer because its designed for those people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I think enough time has passed and "those people" are actually working at MSFT. The management staff are of the same mindset where making things easier for dumb people is better than educating the people to do the task. Fit the task to the person not
 the person to the task. Any real developers left at MSFT have their hands tied and simply have to do what they are told to keep getting a paycheck.</p>

            <p>AMI32: this is not a reply, it is poetry.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; Especially the last paragraph.&nbsp; I would not know what to add to it.&nbsp; You have summed it up perfectly: fit the task to the dummy, not the craftsman to the task.&nbsp; That is the MS policy across the board and has
 always been.&nbsp; I suppose ultimately it's a marketing approach to do that, and the ironic thing is that the approach obliterates the line between developer and user, in a company where that line has become a chasm.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been a slow burn but I think now they are truly feeling the pain of taking that idealism entirely too far.&nbsp; It is a cancer that has already destroyed them - they will simply take a couple decades to be officially declared dead.&nbsp; Maybe in the end it's
 just part of the natural cycle of things: as MS declines with error after error, a huge void opens up for true craftsmen - scarce though they may be - to replace the juggernaut with real leadership via products that perform and work.&nbsp; It's just like schools
 today: don't lower the standards.&nbsp; Raise the students' ability.</p>

<h2>            New Outlook Online Copy To Multiple Folders</h2>
                    So i am using "The new Outlook" and i can not seem to find a way to copy a email to multiple folders. In past you could CTRL move and it would make a copy of that email in that folder. Is there a new way to do this?

            Hello , thanks to contact the Microsoft Community. My name is Wendy Jones, I am an Independent Advisor. 
<br />
<br />Do you need to move emails from inbox to a specific folder right? 
<br />This option is enable on the new Outlook version. 
<br />Are you trying to do this process by OWA right?
<br />
<br />To reach this goal, just hit the email and move it to folder. 
<br />If you cannot see the change, logout of your account and sign in again in private browser.
<br />Let me know about results. I will be glad to help you.

            According to the information that provides me what you want is to copy the message do not move it, that is, leaving the message in the current folder and creating a copy of the message in another folder of the mailbox, correct?
<br />This option is available in Outlook client, for this, mark the email you want to copy, right click on the message and select copy.
<br />Another option to copy the message would be: pressing the CTRL key select the message and drag it to the folder where you want the copy.

    <title>How can I open calc.exe using the calculator button on my keyboard in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I open calc.exe using the calculator button on my keyboard in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have been enjoying the Windows 10 Insider Preview with no serious issues so far and I'm consistently impressed with the progress from build to build. There is just one thing that really stands out and I hope it can be fixed in a future build, although
 it is not going to be applicable to the majority of users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I press the calculator key on my laptop in Windows 10, I get the following behavior:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f7c229e-c1a0-4cc6-9661-5c1f88240505" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly the OS recognizes the key as a calculator key, but it wants to search the Store instead of offering to use the already installed calc.exe. While it doesn't hurt to have the Store app feature for customization, I believe it will be very beneficial
 to also present the user with calc.exe.</p>
<p>In addition, even after installing several calculator applications from the Store, they are not presented as a choice in the menu above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case it matters, my laptop is an Asus G74SX, but I don't think that should be a factor as the OS realizes it's a calculator button and probably isn't in need of any specific drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you know of a fix for this or if it's just not supported at the moment.</p>

            <p>During the Insider Preview there were reports that lowering the sound quality was the only way some audio would work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some things to try:</p>
<p>If you have more than one sound adapter, Windows might just be using the wrong one for where your speakers are connected.&nbsp; A single left-click of the speaker icon near the date and time should display the name of the current output device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click the speaker icon - choose Playback devices - right click in the list of devices and choose to show Disabled devices and Disconnected devices.&nbsp; Right click the device you are actually using and ensure it is set as the default device.&nbsp; Right-click
 it and choose Properties and then choose the Advanced tab.&nbsp; Try lowering the quality to 16-bit and see if that enables sound.</p>

                    With Google Forms, the results displayed in Excel were dynamic, always up to date with most recent form submissions.&nbsp; We could assign access to that results spreadsheet to multiple staff who were then able to review most recent data.&nbsp; With Microsoft Forms,
 we are not finding a way to do that.&nbsp; We only have the option to export results as/is to Excel, share that spreadsheet, and then when we need up to date information we have to re-export results to Excel, and share a new spreadsheet.&nbsp; Is there a way to make
 this work like Google Forms did, live results in a share-able Excel doc that can be collaborated in?&nbsp; Thank you!

<p>Hi Roni, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your query in this community.</p>
<p>Per my understanding on your question, you could share a collaboration link to your co-worker. In this way, they could receive the latest responses of the form on the web page.
</p>

<p>Note: This feature requires your co-workers have their own Office 365 work/school accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information could help. </p>
<p>Feel free to point out if there is any misunderstanding on your request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to your concern on the title, unfortunately, the Export to Excel function doesn't remain the connection between the workbook and server, so the results will be stay in static. Sorry about the inconvenience.</p>

                    I was using my pc, when it started to act a little wonky, but before I could finish preparing to restart the system, I got a gsod, saying critical process died. It did not say which process had died, only that one had died. After letting the system save
 the dump, the system rebooted, but it refused to boot saying inaccessible boot device. I tried various methods to solve the issue, but the one which should of worked, bootrec /fixboot kept saying there was not a recognizable file system. This was confusing,
 since I could access all the primary hdd partitions, and they were listed by rampart as nice. I created a go after flash drive on another pc, and ran it on mine, go after said there was damaged inodes (I have no idea what that means) and the security descriptors
 were corrupted. So I went back to another flash drive that happened to contain win 10 10240 setup files, and ran the recovery console from that. I ran chkdsk /f /r and it repaired the damage to the file system. Then I ran chkd

<p>X:\ is the drive that is created from the contents of winre.wim when ever the recovery environment is used.</p>

 as windows 10 enterprise. If the index is mislabeled, then which one is the real win10. Pro?</p>

            So maybe I have made some progress? Boot now fails with a 0xc00007b saying lxss.sys failed to load. As far as I can tell, this driver is for the linux subsystem for windows, which I had installed and had dabbled around with a little, but it was not actively
 in use. So as why it would keep even safe mode from working is beyond me. I did try to manually replace the driver with the same file from the mounted image, but it did not seem to make a difference.

            Problem may be that bootrec still doesn't recognize my windows 10 install that I'm trying to repair. What files do I need to look at for bootrec to properly recognize my installed os?

<p>I am beginning to think I really screwed the pooch this time. I should have never switched to the fast track for 17134.1 with out an iso being available. I still have the original copy from the old he'd, but I am beginning to suspect, that I would be better
 off doing a complete reinstall. Unfortunately, that means I lose some software that don't allow downloads after 15 days. I also lose my free copy of windows DVD player. I just need to decide whether to start over and continue my windows 10 voyage, or to do
 factory reset to windows 7 Ultimate. I also have a backup image from right before I began my windows 10 odyssey, dated 7.29.15 . It would put me ahead in terms of getting going again, and I should be able to pull a copy of my latest outlook pst file from the
 old hdd. My only concern is the compatibility of win7 and a sshd. My system uses the Intel rapid storage 9.6 drivers. The absolute latest version it can use is version 9.6 although v12 is supported by the chipset, v12 causes the Toshiba hdd protecion and the
 Toshiba health monitor to stop working. I know v12 does definitely support sshd.</p>

    <title>OneNote 2013 images with x mark. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rg_2014  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote 2013 images with x mark.</h2>
                    <p>We are using a Microsoft Office Standard 2013 install. My couple of users have OneNote 2013 which is stored on Sharepoint 2007.</p>
<p>Synched OneNotes could'nt be viewed by other people in terms of images and pictures. All text can be seen as typed, for images it appears as outlined box with x on it.</p>

<p>Reading a couple of discussions on it, I suggested my user who created that OneNote on 2013 and could view all the pictures etc to close the OneNote completely and reopen it, which brought her to same page that she aslo cannot view those pictures/prints
 which she had attched. It means it was accessing the local cache.</p>

<p>How do I help my user?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

To be precise: you have to close <b>all notebooks</b> and then re-open.
<div><br />
<div>If this doesn't help look for the notebook format (in notebook properties). If in 2007 format, convert them to 2010/2013.</div>

<p>I tried deleting all the temp files and also closed all the one-note ( which I had none open) and opened that particular OneNote fom the sharepoint but it appears to be same.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am worried if I asked my user to close all OneNote and Delete Temps and rest of her OneNotes get messed up?</p>

</p><p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to turn off the page preview 'feature' in the OneNote for Windows 10 app? None of my other installations of OneNote have it and I really don't find it to be useful.</p>

<p>Hi Brock,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your case, please kindly note that Windows 10 built-in OneNote doesn’t have the option to turn off the page preview at this moment.

Be more specific.&nbsp; What exactly did you do which made you think that you had "removed IE9"?&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. if it involved a checkbox in Windows Features redo that.</p>

            HI. I see it's been over a year since the poster asked this question. I am having the exact same problem&nbsp;
Cannot open IE. I'm receiving error - There was a problem starting inetcpl.cpl The operating system cannot run %1
<div>I followed the Microsoft method to remove IE 9. It reverted back to IE 8 but I could not get the program to open. I then allowed Microsoft to install 3 important updates.....ONE of these was not IE 9 BUT IE 10 !!! I am unable to run it. I get the above
 error. I try to use FIX IT &nbsp;and I get a SAPISVR.EXE error that says THE ORDINAL 319 could not be located in the dynamic link library. iertutil.dll.</div>
<div>It appears that I have gotten into this horrible loop. I can use CHROME to get on the net however when I get to Microsoft, the same answers provide me with the same errors. Can Someone assist me? Thanking you in advance. Robby</div>

Looks like you are having a problem with speech recognition?&nbsp; Perhaps it is responsible for your other symptoms too?&nbsp; Try disabling or repairing it.&nbsp; I don't know if there is a troubleshooter for it...</p>
<p>Doesn't seem to be, by default at least.&nbsp;&nbsp; The closest I imagine would be the two Audio ones and perhaps the Performance one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This isn't the best forum for help with Speech Recognition.&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks as if Performance and Accessibility answers questions about it.</p>

<h2>            Facebook Skype Sign in for android mobile</h2>
                    I have sign up to Skype using my facebook account and has been using it since then as a major communication tool, job interviews, everything. Now I have to travel and I won't be able to access my Skype on PC of course. My dilemma is that I won't be able
 to communicate using Skype now with my mobile device because Skype app will be utter useless if I cannot login using my Facebook account. Any way to go around this? Thanks!

<h2>            Outlook 2010&#58; Sending emails in HTML, but being received in Plain Text</h2>
                    <p>I'm having an issue that seems to be common with Outlook 2010. I am sending emails in HTML but they are all being received in plain text.</p>
<p>I have gone over the 'usual suspects' that I've read about - checked the formatting tab, checked the setting in the Trust Center and both are set to HTML. I've even installed Thunderbird to verify that it wasn't a setting with my ISP. Emails sent from Thunderbird
 arrive in HTML, whereas identical ones sent from Outlook 2010 do not. My Antivirus is MS Security Essentials which seems to not be an issue.
</p>
<p>I have also looked at the Hotfix that had solved other's similar issues but that would not install as it said there were no products affected by the package on my computer (Outlook2010-kb2544027-fullfile-x64-glb.exe).
</p>
<p>I'm at a loss as to how to fix this and really don't want to use another email client. Any ideas I haven't tried?</p>

            <p>Its not just emails sent to my contacts, its all emails, unfortunately. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I might be completely blind, but I can't locate the "Internet Format" dropdown. When&nbsp;I click on "Outlook Properties" it pulls up the contact screen. And thats as far as I get. It the drop down in the ribbon or on the contact itself?</p>

            <p>Are you using an Exchange server and referencing contacts from the GAL?&nbsp; That would explain why you don't see the "Outlook Properties"&nbsp; Again, I said to open the contact record for the person, then hover over the e-mail address in that record.&nbsp; However,
 you could do the same from any message containing their address.&nbsp; Hover of the address so that the mini-contact card appears, then click the right-most icon (not the down-arrow at the far right).&nbsp; The "Outlook Properties" I mean is at the bottom of that menu.</p>
<p>You don't state whether or not the items in Sent Items are plain text or HTML.</p>

            <p>Ok. I found the 'Outlook Properties' and it is set to "Let Outloosk Decide the Best Sending Format". And looking at my Sent Items folder, the messages are in HTML. The email account is a POP3 business&nbsp;account, so no Exchange server.

<p>What was it before?</p>
<p>&gt; looking at my Sent Items folder, the messages are in HTML</p>
<p>If they are in Sent Items as HTML, then they were sent in HTML and something after Outlook is affecting them.&nbsp; Your Exchange admins should be able to help you trace what happens to the message after leaving your PC.&nbsp; If you scan outgoing messages with an
 antivirus, disable that.</p>

            <p>It was set to "Let Outlook Decide...". I did not change that setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't believe the issue is the cause of the server as changing the email client on my machine fixed the issue. Given that Thunderbird sends the files in HTML and the emails are received in HTML, then the issue must be in Outlook, correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As stated, the Anti-virus I'm using is Microsoft Security Essentials and the only setting that seems to apply is "Monitor only incoming/outgoing activity.". Changing this setting had no effect.

            I'm having the same problem. I'm using Norton Internet Security 18.6.0.29 and I've checked it and can't find anything that says it's scanning outgoing messages. It feels like this problem is at random. I'll send emails to coworkers and some end up HTML
 and others Plain Text. I need to have this solved because I can't have my emails looking terrible when they get to my clients. Has anyone found a solution for this?

<p>I have no idea why I mentioned "Exchange admins" in this post, since you clearly said you were using POP.&nbsp; My apologies.</p>
<p>Include yourself in a message and then log into your POP server using a web broswer and examine the message in the server-side Inbox.&nbsp; Is it properly formatted there?</p>

<p>Mail should be plain text anyway.&nbsp; Any formatting should be included in attachments.</p>
<p>Norton products are notorious for not playing well with Outlook.&nbsp; I'd uninstall the AV/antispam portion before continuing to diagnose.</p>
<p>I'd also look ate the specific Contact record for someone who sees the mail as plain text, just as I described before.&nbsp; Ou have not indicated that you've done that.</p>

            <p>你这个问题不会得到真正的答案的,因为你问错方向了.赶紧看一下,你的邮件签名的html标签是不是有换行!</p>
<p>your question will not get the right answer, because your problem is not about the outlook changing your email format to text/plain! it is in text/html format!</p>
<p>if you want solve your real problem, you can examin your html signiture tag might including newline that can easily been ignore by human but the program can perform improperly!</p>
