<p><span>Hi LUCA,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you could send the email to your Gmail account in Outlook Web App (OWA), it implies that the mail flow between your Office 365 account and your Gmail account has no problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For the issue that you couldnâ€™t send the email to your Gmail account from the second shared mailbox in your Outlook 2013, if it persists, please confirm the following information
 for analysis:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp; Is the email sent from your second shared mailbox the same as the one sent from your first shared mailbox?</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there any improvement if you send another email from your second shared mailbox?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Moreover, as what the error message said, please reconfirm whether you typed a right email address when sending from your second shared mailbox. And, there might be a connection
 delay between the server and the Outlook client. </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2918777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">This article</span></a><span>

<p>Hi Alan...</p>
<p>Sorry ... It was my mistake..</p>
<p>I found a "FLAG" on "Hide from address lists" of *** Email address is removed for privacy ***-</p>
<p>Toggle the flag, i'm able to send from *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to external gmail account.</p>
<p>I think this set is not influent for OWA, but it is for Outlook desktop.</p>
<p>Sorry for my mistake.</p>
<p>Have a nice day</p>

    <title>Office Repair has been running for days at Step 2 of 4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lorrainesurgin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Repair has been running for days at Step 2 of 4</h2>
                    I recently encountered a disk problem on my Dell Inspiron 1545 , and directly after this, Word could not load (We had been experiencing serious intermittent performance issues with Word, and these persisted even after I upgraded RAM to 4 gb - my feeling
 is that the performance may have been associated with the disk issue) . Following on-line advice, I launched the Repair function for Office 2013. I am connected wirelessly and my downloads are acceptable (we live in a rural community). The repair has progressed
 to step 2 of 4, but this has been running for about 4 days now. Task Manager suggests that the process is still Running (i.e. it does not say 'Not Responding'), and if I attempt to launch Word, it seems to think a repair is in progress. When we purchased Office
 2013 recently, it actually took quite a long time to download / install the app (over 24 hours), which is why I have let this run on. Judging from various posts however, this is well beyond the norm,&nbsp; and it spite of what Task Manager is saying, I think the
 process is in some sort of loop - like many others though, I was fearful of aborting this.<br />
<br />
My suspicion is that there is an underlying disk issue (I did not run a CHKDSK repair prior to attempting the download). Should I simply kill the Repair, do a CHKDSK repair and then attempt to repair Office again?<br />

Dear Sir or Madam,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">I have purchased Microsoft Office 365 and downloaded it onto my mainframe computer and have been trying and
 failing to download it onto my 2 in 1. I have taken this down to basics by re setting it to factory settings and am still not being able to download it. I have tried numerous times and am getting very frustrated. All I wish to download onto the 2 in 1 is Word
 &amp; Excel I do not want any of the other parts of office on this machine. I have previously purchased Office for windows 7 and have a CD-Rom for this but Windows 10 does not recognise this or allow it to update to 10. I would appreciate as much help as you can
 give me on this matter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">Also I am unable to set things onto the start menu bar or remove some of the items which I do not need as they
 clutter things up. I have been able to remove a few items on my start screen but other things I am unable to do. Control panel &amp; Google Calendar ( this I have downloaded but do not see anywhere on the left hand side of my screen ) being the main two items
 I would like to get access to at a touch. I also am unable to do as windows once allowed to right click on a site and put it on your start page. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(102, 102, 102, 1)">The third thing that I am unable to do is to is to open Google chrome and have my Bt account to hand to again

 This cleared considerable space. Now when I am trying to download it onto my 2 in 1 I am not even getting the opportunity to enter the Product key I am being&nbsp;referred&nbsp;to an app setting, this is by opening my Microsoft account page and going onto Office and

    <title>Solver problem in Excel 2011 trial version for Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Solver problem in Excel 2011 trial version for Mac</h2>
                    <div>Dear Mrs. dear Sir!</div>
iÂ´ve got the trial version mac office 2011 (14.1.2) and have a problem to run the solver. A error by visual basic pops up and tells me that solver has a loading issue? Is this because its a trial version. Please help me, I really enjoy working with previous
 versions of the program but now I am a bit desperate....
<div>more in detail:<br />
<div><span>Well, I click on add ins and mark -&gt; solver.xlam. I apply this setting. Then it loads the software-until this point everything runs smoothly. However when I then open the solver a visual basic message pops up and tells me several times ca. 3 times
 that there is a loading failure. After that only a fraction of the solver opens in a dialogue box resulting in a excel crash ... thank you for your help in advance</span></div>

            I just tried to start using the bundled Solver and faced the same issue: 3 VBA errors and clipped Solver configuration dialog. The thing that helped me is changing my region:
<div><br />
<div>1. Go to System Preferences.</div>
<div>2. Open Language &amp; Text preferences.</div>
<div>3. Go to Region tab.</div>
<div>4. From the Region popup choose&nbsp;United States or&nbsp;United States (English) - this depends on your primary language. If you don't see any of two, just enable "Show all regions" checkbox.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Restarting Excel for Mac 2011 at this point fixed my Solver.</div>

            It is possible that when Office was installed that a custom installation was made leaving out Visual Basic for Applications. Restart the computer, and then run the Office installer, and choose to do a custom install. Choose just the VIsual Basic for Applications
 option in the installer. Allow updates to be installed. Then try opening Excel and Solver again.<br />

<h2>            CSV Compatibility between MS Excel and MSOutlook</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am busy creating a CSV file that contains a years worth of Events to import into &nbsp;MSOutlook of Office 365. &nbsp;The Outlook imports ZERO events. I looked at the text files from the CSV and a export from Outlook. &nbsp;Undermentioned the differences.....</p>
<p>Outlook:</p>
<p>"Subject","Start Date","End Date","All day event","Reminder on/off","Reminder Date","Reminder Time","Location","Priority","Private","Show time as","Categories"<br />
"Golf Wingate","12/3/2016","12/3/2016","False","False","12/3/2016","9:45:00 AM","At Wingate","Normal","False","4"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excel:</p>
<p>Subject,Start Date,End Date,All day event,Reminder on/off,Reminder Date,Reminder Time,Location,Priority,Private,Show time as,Categories<br />
Golf Wingate,12/3/2016,12/3/2016,False,False,12/3/2016,9:45:00 AM,At Wingate,Normal,False,4</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please NOTE the fileds are Enclosed with "" when exported from Outlook and for Excel to INSERT this is problematic IMO.</p>
<p>

            The CSV you created (which you wish to use in 365) was created from what program? some programs create different types of CSV, or at least have the option to create a CSV that can be imported to MS Outlook<br />

<p>I used Excel to create the calendar entries as it is easier to put things into columns and then "Save as" CSV. &nbsp;There are other options line CSV(MS_DOS) , CSV (MAC) etc....</p>

            <p>Thanks for the help.. I do however believe that I should NOT resort to programming to resolve an issue between MSOutlook and MSExcel wrt CSV file compatibilities. &nbsp;This is clearly a miss communication between the teams .</p>
<p>This issue was NOT here before and I believe needs to be addressed.</p>
<p>I believe that any OFFICE product should be able to communicate with each other and resolve any compatibility issues between them. &nbsp;How can we get the MSOffice team to look at this????</p>
<p>

            <p>I just saw this answer on the following website: http://forums.windowscentral.com/microsoft-band/320444-myfitnesspal-band-you.html#post2839713
</p>
<p>Hope it helps!! Greetings from Spain! :) </p>
<p><br />
Haha I was just coming to post a new topic about this very issue. I had previously linked MyFitnessPal to Health using the Health app setting. So I just completed a 30 minute row on the erg using the dumbbell icon (the general exercise where it just tracks
 time and HR). I got a calorie consumption of 411 calories. Next I opened the Health app on my phone so that it would force a sync with the Band. Workout shows up in Health. All good so far. Next, I waited about 10 minutes and lo and behold the workout showed
 up in MyFitnessPal as a general exercise with 411 calories burned. This adjusted my daily caloric need as if I had entered in the exercise in MFP by hand.
<br />
<br />
I was actually checking the website on my computer for the workout to show up; once it did, I opened the app on my phone and it was there as well. Naturally this automatically updated the live tile. I don't know if the live tile will update on its own without
 the app being opened (although I assume it will; it does if I enter a workout in on the website manually).<br />
<br />
As an aside, I've been using a formula from this paper (using average HR and estimated VO2max) to determine caloric expenditure prior to my purchase of the Band:<br />
<a href="http://www.braydenwm.com/cal_vs_hr_ref_paper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.braydenwm.com/cal_vs_hr_ref_paper.pdf</span></a><br />
I think the formula in that paper is fairly accurate and, in conjunction with calorie counting, it's been reliable in terms of losing and maintaining weight. That being said, when using the average HR and the time as shown on the Band for my row, the formula
 above and the Band showed almost identical calories burned (within 5 calories, so about 1%). I'm very happy with that.

<h3> agustus galloop  say:</h3>
<h2>            Importing folders and emails from outlook 2010 &#40;desktop&#41; to outlook.com &#40;cloud&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I am trying to import my folders and emails from outlook 2010 to my outlook.com account.<br />
<br />
I have my outlook.com email account set up in outlook 2010. I tried dragging all the folders into the outlook.com inbox within outlook 2010. The send/receive progress bar remained for hours. After it had finished i logged into my outlook.com account. The folders
 where there (jumbled up somewhat) but none of the emails where within the folders. I tried again this time only importing one folder at a time and this worked. Therefore there seems to be some limit on the ammount of folders you can import at any one time.
 Does anyone know what these limits are or is there a better way to import many folders at once from outlook 2010 to outlook.com?<br />
<br />
As an experiment i tried the same thing with my gmail account ie dragged the files and foldes from within outlook 2010 to my gmail inbox, and it worked without problems. With the gmail account your are provided a progress bar to give you an idea of how much
 time is left compared to outlook.com account where all it says is 'processing' then after hours of waiting for it to finish the process hasnt worked.<br />
<br />
Now, I dont feel its safe working with my files and folders from with outlook 2010 knowing that the changes my not be reflected properly in outlook.com.<br />

            Dragging one folder at a time is the best way to transfer instead of selecting all the folders and dragging them.<br />
Hotmail account is setup through Outlook Connector which uses delta sync technology. Probably the delta sync is unable to transfer all the folders at once is due to files and folder size. There must be limitation set which anyways we would not know.<br />

            I have tried finding out what the limits might be e.g. I have just tried it with just two folders (empty folders) one nestled inside the other. These changes where reflected in outlook.com. I then created a third nestled folder, hit send/receive (outlook
 2012 reported errors this time) and checked on outlook.com but this time the new folder was not there.<br />
<br />
Its very hit and miss and not at all reliable. I like to work in outlook (desktop) and dont want to have to be concerned wether or not the changes i make there to the folder structure and the folders contents are being reflected in outlook.com. Currently they
 are not.<br />
<br />
Unitil microsoft sort out this issue it seems the only workaround for me at the moment is to go back to storing the folders locally in a PST file (which means my files are only available on one PC) or work directly in outlook.com.<br />
<br />
Can anyone explain why i am unable to move folders and emails from outlook 2012 to my outlook.com account (set up within outlook 2012) and have those folders show up when i log into my outlook.com account?<br />

<p>I did try chat this morning three times, and there was a "problem" with chat.</p>
<p>Which basically means it was impossible to contact Skype. I did call my credit card too, and they said everything was fine on their end (which turned out to be not true) but this together with the wording of the email I got from skype:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
Auto-recharge suspended
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<div style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Unfortunately, we were unable to Auto-recharge your Skype Credit balance as you have reached your monthly spending limit. For fraud prevention purposes we impose restrictions on the amount
 of Skype Credit you can purchase. We apologize if this has caused you any inconvenience.<br />
<br />
Find out more about <a href="https://api.skype.com/tracking/emails/click?m=7131000038823439071&amp;go=myaccount.limits&amp;x=intcmp%3DT_63-_-H-_-071118-_-myaccount.limits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
monthly limits</a>.</div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>gave me reason to think this was something Skype had done. Now I can't for the life of me understand why Skype would have a monthly limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it turns out, so far as I can tell, that it was not Skype, but my credit card after all, which somehow decided that after this charge of 10 bucks has happened regularly about once a month for 10 or 20 years, that now suddenly it might be a fraudulent
 charge. </p>
<p>Nothing to do with Skype, but why would Skype send a message which makes it look like it was Skype doing it?</p>
<p>After calling the bank and they reinstated it, it went through, no I had not reached any limit, as I very well knew.</p>
<p>But we need Skype to make a different message which more clearly describes who is doing what and why. I spent two hours&nbsp; this morning trying to resolve this, and another hour this morning through no fault of my own (except, I guess, some&nbsp;lack of internet
 savvy)</p>

            <b>Woah Chris, that last detail is an important one.&nbsp;</b>
<div><br />
<div>The specifics elude me right now but basically Outlook Syncs with the Server every X number of minutes, by default I think it is 10 minutes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would think that it would take greater than 10min to sync 6gb of data, so I am led to believe as you try to delete the folder/account, it is still trying to "catch up" and it would not be able to delete.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Ok so I am going to send you over to the MVP's website to the Entourage section, as for deleting the profile, it should be located&nbsp;</div>
<div><u><br />
</u></div>
<div><u>folder/Documents/Microsoft User Data/Office 2011 Identities/Main Identity</u>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So if you removed the actual profile, it would not have the ability to get back into the cycle. I would advise doing a full shut down first, keep it off for a few minutes, then get to work.</div>

            <p>It is NOT an UPGRADE when you make our old settings and home page disappear. I had my important links there. Not to mention the other info items I wanted on one home page. you don't even give a warning that an "upgrade" will destroy the settings so we could
 back up or copy the info so we can rebuild it the new page. its like upgrading someone's home by throwing everything out and telling them they can go out and replace all the stuff they needed.

            You may find that you need to let it get an actual GPS fix and download some map data for the folders to be created. The first fix can take some time if not using AGPS.

</p><p>Hey brother, I always like to confirm your findings but for the very first time, I'm glad I can prove you wrong and not because of rivalry or ego, but becasue if you would've been right, it could've had serious consecuenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I said that it was gonna take me hours and it did, but I just couldn't resist the challenge so...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used MCT to download a fresh copy of 17134<br />
Clean installed it offline.<br />
Went through the updates until I reached 17134.254<br />
Switched to Preview Fast Ring<br />
Mounted my previous WU UUP ISO and ran setup from within<br />
Here I am, writing to you from 17751.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update took about 30 minutes or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So unfortunately for you, this issue appears to be confined to VMs only and I don't get along with them, so somebody else will have to replicate your steps and give us a third opinion.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking that out. Glad to hear that worked. If I understand you correctly, clean installed offline. then went online and updated, joined Insider to switch to Fast ring, rebooted, then mounted 17751 ISO to run setup. So you are online at this
 point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is how you did this, one difference is that I remained offline through the whole process and never joined Insider from the Release build. Never have previously either. From my Release build, I installed the CU as I dl them from Microsoft Catalog
 and then update several machines from the CU file, still offline. Then proceeded as you by mounting 17751 ISO, but still offline. Cannot join Insider this way till one goes online, like clean installing any Insider build, you only need to sign in with MS account
 and you are good. Not like from Release joining Insider, that always requires a reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your other point, that's why I am asking for clarification on "<span>Switched to Preview Fast Ring" as one would have to be online to do this. Could something have possibly changed in the process, that I would&nbsp; have to be set for Insider, do not
 think Fast or Slow would make any difference, to upgrade via the ISO. It did after all work fine from previous insider build, as it would realize that it already is in Insider, even though offline.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As in the verification issue, I am going to try from Release build, go online, verify, join Insider, reboot and then mount the ISO as I believe this is what you have done. Now I am curious to see the result of this. Lets dig some more.</span></p>

<p>You're welcome and yes, you're correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would've done it offline but I didn't know you can update release to Fast without joining the WIP first and also, it didn't even cross my mind to download the updates from the catalog.</p>

<p>Well let's just say you used to be able to. I just used the comparison to installing WIP first, as soon as you go online, and sign in to a MS account, you are good to go. You cannot go to Fast in a Release build without joining Insider, and rebooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, using the vm that was already in Insider, same result that you got. Upgraded in 35 minutes and running 17751.&nbsp;<span>This rules out a VMware issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So where does this leave us, cannot install in Release offline, yet can install in a previous clean Insider offline. Put Release online and set to Just Fixes, upgrade works.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is happening to me as well, although a bit differently. This started right after I installed Mac High Sierra. When I type with my favourite font Charter, all is well. But if I write a quotation mark, it will be automatically written in Helvetica. Whatever
 I try to do, I am unable to change the font of the quotation mark (it looks like this: " ) to Charter. It's permanently Helvetica. If I select all, and then type in Charter in the font box, it still doesn't change the font. If I type Times, it doesn't change
 the font as well. The font box always shows up blank. It gets worse when I'm typing quickly. If I type quotation marks, and then delete it (by pressing backspace), the next words that I type will all be Helvetica. Deleting the quotation mark automatically
 changes the font for some reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please please please fix this soon because it's very annoying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I updated everything and thus far it works. The umlaut is created by typing option and 'u'. That yields the umlaut but does not advance the line such that a letter o,u or a can be typed beneath it. I am intrigued by the way weird things happen - there seems
 to be no real reason - and then they slip back into place. Many thanks to everyone for their responses.&nbsp;</p>
