<h2>            Outlook 2013 H&#38;B Automatic Replies &#40;Out of Office&#41; Freezes when clicked</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Today, one of our users reported that whilst trying to set up there Automatic Replies (Out of Office) in Outlook 2013 Home and Business, Outlook completely freezes and has to restart the application. out IT department has tested this out and it seems everyone
 in the company has been affected by this, as i click on the Automatic Replies button, it stays blue, then Outlook hangs and eventually crashes all together.<br />
<br />
- I have tried running in Safe Mode<br />
- I have tried disabling all Add-ins</p>
<p>- I have tried deleting the Outlook Profile&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Offline and Online repair</p>
<p>- Nothing new was installed or uninstalled</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem remains!<br />
</p>
<p>any recent MS updates that could have possibly caused this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>or anything else i have left out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p />

    <title>Unable to play online videos from HULU website. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to play online videos from HULU website.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: HULU/Flash using IE10. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to play a video in Hulu I get told "Hulu requires Flash Player 10.1.53.64 or higher. Please download and install the latest version of Flash Player before continuing." I checked on the Flash site and was told by a couple of people to try the 'uninstall'
 tool mentioned on the "Find Version" page. I did and now when I am on that page, there is no movie shown - which makes me think Flash is in fact gone. I tried to re-install it and get told that "Your Microsoft Internet Explorer browser includes the latest
 version of the Adobe Flash Player built-in. Windows Update will inform you when new versions of Flash Player are available." I have followed all the steps I could find, in a number of places. I normally do not use IE (this is the first time since I purchased
 this computer in January). I have been trying all day - literally. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was told to try: <a href="http://get2.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://get2.adobe.com/</a></p>
<p>When I click on it, I get re-directed to <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/download-flash-player-windows-8.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go to YouTube, I get, "You need to upgrade your Adobe Flash Player to watch this video.
<a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download it from Adobe.</a> " Yet that vanishes almost right away and the video starts, so it's not a problem with YouTube - just wanted to clarify that it's only a HULU problem for me. I was given
 a link to the newest Windows Update, which I already have installed - I automatically install all updates.

<p>Does anybody have any ideas? ActiveX Filtering is disabled as well, I've cleared Cache, etc. I've tried everything I've read online and nothing seems to help/work.&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#000000">Hi Valerie,</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Let me give you a brief idea about Internet Explorer 10. The Internet Explorer 10 provides an “<b><i>add-on free</i></b>” experience. It supports
 HTML 5 for video content, but you can't install other toolbars and add-ons on Internet Explorer 10.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It has the Flash Player integrated with it. So, it’s unnecessary to install the Flash Player again in it. Let me ask you a few question before we proceed.</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In which version of Internet Explorer 10, are you trying to play the online videos</span><font color="#000000">
</font><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">(Modern User Interface and Desktop)?</span></font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">If this happens with the Modern User Interface version of Internet Explorer 10, then I would suggest you to first try playing the video in the desktop version and
 check if that helps. If the issue persists, then I would suggest you to refer to the section: “<b><i>Why won't videos play in Internet Explorer?</i></b>” from the article: “<b><i>Videos won't play or webpages don't display correctly</i></b>” given in this
 link:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>

            <p>Yes,..Flash Player is <u>updated</u> through Windows updates.&nbsp; But, it is not <u>
installed</u> through updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you ran the Adobe Flash Player <u>Uninstaller</u>, it more than likely did not erase the program files.&nbsp; This is good news, because the next Windows Flash Player update should bring&nbsp;it&nbsp;back to working order.&nbsp; To "see if its gone"....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Key +X</p>
<p>Control Panel</p>
<p>Programs</p>
<p>Programs and Features</p>
<p>If Flash Player is there, you will see "Adobe Flash Player11 Plug-in " on the list&nbsp; (v11.7.700.202)</p>
<p>If it is not there, try downloading it from<em> this</em> link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, check to see if you have Windows Flash Player Security Update (KB2837386...5/15/2013).</p>
<p>If it is missing, you can "Check for Updates".&nbsp;( So you're not tempted, uninstalling the update and downloading a fresh copy from the Windows Download Center will NOT fix the problem.)&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, did you try disabling the graphics accelerator?</p>
<p>Tools</p>
<p>Internet Options</p>
<p>Advanced (tab)</p>
<p>Under Accelerated Graphics, CHECK the box "Use Software Rendering instead of GPU Rendering"</p>
<p>APPLY</p>
<p>OK</p>
<p><strong>Restart your computer.</strong></p>

            Thank you both for the reply. I tried everything you both said as well and I still kept getting the message when trying to watch a Hulu video. I went ahead and did "Refreshed" my Windows 8. Although I lost all my installed programs (which is fine as I
 didn't have many) it solved the problem.&nbsp;

            <p>For my edification, if you can .......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before you did REFRESH, was Flash Player 11 plug-in showing on your Programs List? Like to know if Adobe UNinstaller actually<strong> works</strong>, before I recommend its future use.&nbsp;(suspect it does
<em>not</em> remove FP in Windows 8).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you tried to download the latest Flash Player, did you get a message saying that it was already installed?&nbsp; Did you enable JavaScript before trying to download. (suspect the download link is faulty)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that you are probably running about going <strong><em>OMG it works!....it works!!</em></strong>&nbsp;and that's great.&nbsp; But, there are a whole lot of&nbsp;folks still looking for answers to this problem&nbsp;and&nbsp;if you can provide
<strong><em>ANY</em></strong> feedback&nbsp;about the advice&nbsp;you received maybe the next person won't have to take such drastic measures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After REFRESH, do you notice any obvious changes to your computer as far as FP is concerned, e.g. messages, new icons, new add-ons, old add-ons removed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did Windows re-apply the last &nbsp;Flash Player Security Update (KB2837386) ? (check the date...should be the REFRESH date, instead of 5/15/2013)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We would all like to find a REAL solution to this mystery and any clues are appreciated.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>It was <b>not</b> located/shown in the Programs list, yet whenever I tried to install it using the download links, I was told it
<b>was</b> installed or that it couldn't install because it comes embedded in IE10. That is why I went ahead and did the
<b>refresh</b>&nbsp;because even though it wasn't showing up in the installed programs list, when I tried to install it I got the messages above. Which is why I was confused because when I'd go onto the hulu video page it told me I'd need to download/install 10.1+
 to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I just looked in my updates, and I haven't installed <i>any</i> updates since doing the refresh, so the newest update I have installed on my computer is
<i>KB2751148 </i>which is a Windows Update. I don't have any FP updates installed.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for the feedback.&nbsp; REFRESH should have <em>automatically</em> installed all of your Windows updates to bring your up to speed.&nbsp; Go to updates and install them yourself NOW.&nbsp; Many are security updates that are important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Key + X</p>
<p>&nbsp;System</p>
<p>Windows Update</p>
<p>Check for Updates. (will start downloading)</p>
<p>Click on the downloaded updates and install all of them.</p>

<p>When it finishes, go back to the update page and select "Change Settings" to see if you have "automatic" turned on.</p>

            <p>The way you fix this error is running "regedit" and changing the version number so that the site thinks you have "said version".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since some websites require you to always have the latest version, but Microsoft uses its own version of adobe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE THIS IS FOR WINDOWS RT..YES TOPIC IS OLD BUT I NOTICED THIS ISSUE</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you open up regedit go to</p>
<p>1. Click on "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE"&gt; "Macromedia"&gt; FlashPlayerActiveX</p>
<p>2. Edit the version to the latest flash player version number.</p>
<p>3. Flash player should work like normal again</p>

            I had the same problem and I tried many ways to fix it. Uninstalling, downloading and installing the latest version of
<strong>Flash playe</strong>r didn't do it for me. This is just a generic error message that Hulu spits out when it has problems using flash in your browser. Some malware may have altered registry permissions for flash player.
<strong>Read this </strong><a href="http://computerfive.com/hulu-flash-player-error/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>article</strong></a>, download and use Tweaking.com ResetFilePermissions.exe. This worked for me!

<h2>            How to dekete istart123 from my desktop.</h2>
                    My wife noticed on July 15, 2014 a file ( istart123 ) was downloaded from a site she was on. I have tried to delete this file . I have called our ISP for help on this issue.&nbsp;I was told it is a browser issue and therefore out of their boundaries. When we
 click the Internet Explorer button on the start menu, I get the istart123 home page appearing. I have got the Home icon on the upper right when clicked, to open our ISP's Home Page. Today, I tried to locate a file when I clicked the upper right icon. A diagnostic
 came up that the page was not there. &nbsp;I have been able to open a couple of Home pages before. Any suggestions?&nbsp;&nbsp;

Thank you for your solution to my problem. My system now pulls up my "normal" home page. I still may need to follow your instructions again.&nbsp;It took about three hours in total to get AdwCleaner Download link to &nbsp;install and run: I then ran a restore to the
 previous week. Then a restart. Tommorrow, I run McAfee anti-virus. Thank you again for your help.

<h3> jim guess  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Application add-ins have been disabled&#34; Excel 2007</h2>
                    <div>I have this problem. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
So, I searched the forum and found this answer: <br />
http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/help/enable-or-disable-add-ins-in-office-programs-HA010034127.aspx
<br />
And I saw to do the following:&nbsp;
<div><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">1.<span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Click
 the&nbsp;Microsoft Office Button, click&nbsp;Excel Options, and then click&nbsp;Add-Ins.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">In
 the&nbsp;Add-ins&nbsp;box, identify the add-in that you want to enable or disable and note the Add-in type located in the&nbsp;Type&nbsp;column. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Select the Add-in type in the&nbsp;Manage&nbsp;box and then click&nbsp;Go. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">4</span><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Select or clear the check box for the Add-in that you want enable or disable and then click&nbsp;OK.</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The box is clear for my app. &nbsp;I check it. &nbsp;Then I get a pop-up stating:&nbsp;<br />
This add-in is installed for all users on this computer, and can only be connected or disconnected by an administrator.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I AM the administrator! &nbsp;Guaranteed! &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What is going on here? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Help! &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks! &nbsp;</div>

            Thank you for getting back to me quickly. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Your steps solved one problem. &nbsp;the Excel.exe file is actually in Office 12 folder. &nbsp;
<div>Now there is another problem. &nbsp;I think it is related to my Macro settings. &nbsp;I did the following:&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; 1) Excel Options</div>
<div>&nbsp; 2) Add-Ins</div>
<div>&nbsp; 3) Manage &gt; COM Add-Ins &gt; Go...&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; 4) The pop-up shows Lexmark Tools for Office and the box is not checked. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; 5) Click to check the box &gt; click OK. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; 6) Close Excel and go back in. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; 7) The error message stating "Application add-ins have been disabled" is still there.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; 8) Back on the pop-up in 4) there is text at the bottom stating:&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Load Behavior: Not loaded. &nbsp;The user selected to disable macros.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; 9) I go to Excel Options &gt; Trust Center &gt; Trust Center Settings ... &gt; Macro Settings</div>
<div>10) I see that the radio button for Enable all macros ... IS selected. &nbsp;</div>
<div>11) I see that the Trust access to the VBA project object model is checked&nbsp;</div>
<div>12) I have changed nothing at this level. &nbsp;</div>
<div>13) I AM running as administrator. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>What is wrong? &nbsp;</div>

                    <p>Original title: Adss taking 1/4 of my screen</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ads are now taking 1/4 of the right side of my screen. I can hardy read my e-mails. With the old HotMail you could click at the bottom of the ad and it would go away thus opening more room on the screen to view e-mails.You have to continue doing this, but
 at least the ad would go away and your screen is widen.. I don't understand why this has changed. Not very happy with OUTLOOK right now..</p>

<p>Hi David_123,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to further isolate this concern, kindly open the Excel application in safe mode. This would help us identify if an add-in or extension is causing the problem. Here's how:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Find the shortcut icon for your Office application.</li><li>Press and hold the <strong>CTRL</strong> key and double-click the application shortcut.</li><li>Click Yes when a window appears asking if you want to start the application in
<strong>safe mode</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>When running the Excel application in safe mode and the scroll bar still appears, let's repair your Office application by following the steps provided on this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>. If there are no changes after repairing the application, there might be some
 system components that's resulting to this issue. Let's go ahead and run the <strong>
Easy Fix tool</strong> to completely uninstall Office that can be found on the same article provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</span></p>

            Recently i have also updated my firmware OTA to 10.12. Immidiately i have noticed that it is not an update but a downgrade. After updating my browsing speed as well as downloading speed has gone very very very low. In terms of % i would say a 60 % reduction.Now
 i feel like a complete fool. I have a ? Do they release new firmware version without testing it on the related phone? They have completly ruined my every day. Please release a new firmware for 6303c to fix the problem.

<p>hi all,</p>
<p>sadly the low ringing volume gets slightly louder when adjusting the equlizer, but still not loud enough, I really wish if that problem has nothing to do with the hardware itself they would release some kind of update to fix this problem</p>

<p>Hey Everyone,</p>
<p>I am using&nbsp;<strong>NOKIA 6303c. </strong>
I have always kept my phone up to date with the latest firmware.</p>
<p>But it has been a while since NOKIA released <strong>V10.12</strong>, probably updates&nbsp;have been&nbsp;stopped. The
<strong>LOW Volume </strong>is at it's best, It can't get any Louder. <strong>CAMERA</strong>, well that's something you have to keep adjusting&nbsp;according&nbsp;to your liking. Leave your phone memory<strong> EMPTY</strong>(as much as possible) in order to avoid applications
 from shutting down suddenly.</p>
<p>I would <strong>ADVISE</strong> anyone who is facing these problems to sack it off.. and get a new phone.
<strong>Nokia C3</strong> seems to be a cool phone at a reasonable rate, and there are many more, if budget is an issue then stay put till you can afford one.</p>
<p>That's pretty much what I'm doing. ;-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. I hope there's an update with these&nbsp;issues&nbsp;fixed sometime soon cause I really don't wanna have to buy a new phone!</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 won&#8217;t install or update apps</h2>
                    <p>So when i try to install apps it comes up with the message ‘My family setup needed’, it also wont update them. This hasnt always been a problem, though i dont use my phone much. My microsoft account is adult, and when i try to set up my family it says US
 and Canada only. I dont see how adding my phone as a family member will help, its already connected to my adult account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:&nbsp;Just found what it was, I wasn’t signed in on the store, I think signing in fixed it. It’s pretty simple but I thought I’d update for anyone who has the same problem.</p>

            Yes, though they’re not updating any more. Its just that it’s an old phone (Lumia 535), and the issue has probably been around for months.

<p>No, its still not working. I’ll try to find some more errors if it helps narrow down the problem:</p>
<p>-Microsoft account doesnt sync, i click sync, nothing happens, still says not up to date. Icloud and google mail both say attention required when i press sync.</p>
<p>-failed downloads say attention required. Tap here. When i tap it comes up with error 80070020. This is also happening when trying to install apps.</p>
<p>-when i try to backup my phone it says ‘there was a problem backing up your settings. Try again later’</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>Thank you for providing us more information. Attention required error usually appears when the date and time settings are incorrect or not aligned, same goes with region and language. Please follow the steps below and check if it resolve the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Store</strong> &gt; (<strong>...</strong>) ellipses &gt; <strong>downloads</strong> &gt; tap and hold apps that shows
<strong>attention</strong> <strong>required</strong> and <strong>pending</strong>
<strong>downloads</strong>. </li><li>Turn off backup on your Messaging app. Open the <strong>Messaging</strong> <strong>
app</strong> &gt; (<strong>..</strong><strong>.</strong>) ellipses &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; disable
<strong>Text</strong> <strong>message</strong> <strong>backup</strong>. </li><li>Please make sure to use Wi-Fi connection instead of mobile internet to avoid interruptions.</li><li>You may also consider changing your Microsoft account password. For other email account, check if removing the accounts and adding it again will made any differences.</li><li>Make sure to sync your account again after changing the password. Re-enter the password if needed.</li></ol>
<p>You can perform soft reset to refresh your phone's OS. Press and hold <strong>
Volume</strong> <strong>down</strong> and <strong>Power</strong> button until the phone vibrates and restart. Check if you're able to download apps.</p>

 restarting the PC several times, with a few-minute break between the restarts (Start button &gt; Power &gt; Restart), as suggested by Le Boule in this thread:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn’t work, then check the Security Center for the status of Windows Defender, and for any messages pertaining thereto (Control Panel &gt; Security and Maintenance).

</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, you can query the registry to make sure that Defender is properly enabled in its own registry folder.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Right-click on the Start button and launch Windows PowerShell; and then copy, paste, and enter these commands</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)">REG QUERY "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Defender" /v DisableAntiSpyware

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, if you’ve already run the cleanup tools for any preinstalled or previously installed AV apps, and also confirmed the integrity
 of the system with both the System File Checker and DISM, then you can try rebuilding the WMI Repository to clear any possible corruption in the Security Center:

</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you can’t get Windows Defender up and running, then you’ll either have to resort to the recovery options,
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Or else install a free third-party AV app for real-time protection so that you’ll be able to connect to the internet safely:</span></p>

<h3> jam212  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem installing the driver software for iPAQ 212 with Windows Mobile Device Center </h2>
                    Can somebody help? I have an iPAQ 212 running Mobile 6 and I've not been able to establish a connection with the Windows Mobile Device Center despite reinstalling the darn software. It keeps saying it needs to install a driver software for the unknown
 device and since it is unable to do so, the installation is terminated prematurely. I've even uninstalled my Norton and stopped my windows firewall to no avail.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been previously using the XP and synchronizing via ActiveSyn.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the help!

            Are you running Vista 32 or 64bit? Let Windows Update run on your PC and you should see an update for WMDC. Install it to see if that resolves your issue.

            Thanks for suggestion.<br />
<br />
After consulting the HP engineers who were rather patient with me (might I add), I managed to get my iPAq212 to talk with the Mobile Device Center.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So what's the problem?&nbsp; I hope this info will help all those who may have encountered the same problem.&nbsp; It
 appears there's some kind of glitch with the administrator user account.&nbsp; Nothing to do with firewall or whatever.<br />
<br />
The problem was resolved by creating another administrator user account and using that to set up the connection!&nbsp; It was as simple as that...<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I now encountered yet another problem.&nbsp; I managed to sync all except my calendar.&nbsp; So, I'm still talking to the HP engineers despite all that's done.<br />
<br />
Somehow, I get the feeling that the developers of this Mobile Device Center have not thought through the whole process from the users' perspective.&nbsp; Users typically would be syncing on the ActiveSync 4.5 on their Windows XP and now that there's Windows Vista
 with the Mobile Device Center, surely Microsoft would know that users will now need to sync the same device without making it so painful?<br />
<br />
If anyone knows what I can do to sync my calendar, I'd be most obliged.

    <title>Improvements to the Microsoft Band 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> acea sands  say:</h3>
<h2>            Improvements to the Microsoft Band 2</h2>
                    <p>I love the Band 2! It really is nice to have such a powerful device on my wrist at all times! But unfortunately, nothing in this world is perfect and when it comes to the Band 2, I have noticed several things that I would like to see be added/changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I want to be able to read more of my emails and texts. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I love getting emails and texts right on my watch, being able to read them on the fly. A problem I encounter often is that I can't read even 1/2 of the email. I don't want to have to get out my phone to read the email-that's why I got the band 2!</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. More calendar events able to be displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Calendaring function is wonderful when it comes to syncing with all platforms and warning me when they are closing to happening.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I encounter this quite often: The band 2, upon syncing with my mobile device via the health app, only displays a certain amount of calendar events before it needs to sync to get the others. I don't get wifi through the majority of the day, so I want all
 of my calendar events for the day synced to my device <em>the day before </em>if possible (It does do the calendar event syncing the day before, but again, it is restricted to a certain number of events).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The number of alarms available to set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one alarm in the sleeping tile, and one in the watch tile, but only 2 alarms? I have many things I would like to have a watch reminder accompany, but it's not available. A Timex Ironman watch has 4 alarms, and that's a $30-$40 watch! A couple more
 would be nice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. The watch function is nice, but is lacking in customization.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thoroughly enjoy the watch function on the Band 2. It tells me the time when I flip my wrist and does not turn on the whole band when I do (though that would be a nice option to have happen) which would guzzle more energy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find myself with 2 problems with it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.1: I want to see seconds. When I want to time something and don't have the time to start a stop watch or I just want to see 5 seconds or see how close I am to the next minute, I am unable to because of the lack of seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.2: I almost always right my dates as (IE:) 5/12/16. The date display only says the day of the week, not the month or even its corresponding number. I know that sounds a little trivial, but I often have problems with determining what May's number is. I
 just want to see it, just like with all other non-smart digital watches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. GPS connectivity and adaptability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GPS is wonderful and is such a creative idea! Never had I thought that you could get that on your watch. Now that it's out, I would like to see a very specific function using GPS that is currently unavailable: the ability to let other devices use that
 GPS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a tablet that can only connect to the internet via WiFi. If I'm on the road, I have no internet access. The app I normally use for my navigation is Google maps and its offline GPS is...well...lacking. It's not accurate and is often 30 seconds behind
 me. I would like to see the option to turn GPS on (without the running workout function starting too) and let other devices, such as my tablet, use that signal to accurately pinpoint my location in apps such as Google maps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Even though it is meant to only connect to smart phones, It would be nice for it to at least sync text messages with non-smart phones. Bluetooth is also limiting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't always have my smart phone around, or I'm using someone else's phone, or I want to keep track of my kid's text messages on a non-smart phone. The band won't let me connect at all to any device that is not Apple, Android, or Windows. If I've got a
 flip phone, it'd be nice to see if it were possible to sync texts from those types of devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have more than one smart device. If I have multiple notifications coming in from multiple devices, I have to pick and choose which one I want synced to my band. I would love to be able to connect to more than one device (IE: my phone and my tablet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To wrap up, the Band 2 is such a wonderful piece of technology! I just flat out love it. It's sleek, stylish, fast, glitch free, cheap (-er than the iWatch), health smart, personal, customization friendly, and easy to use. Go Windows! These are not complains,
 but things I would like to see added to the watch at a later date. Let me know if you agree, or if you have any other ideas you want to share!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would highly recommend this watch to anyone who's looking for a good smart watch, a good fitness watch, or both. It does both well.</p>

<br />
You will have to find some way of getting the product key. Without the key you are totally out of luck.<br />

Exactly how did you buy Office 2010 in the first place?<br />

Do you have any image copy backups of the old installation?<br />

<p>&lt;/snip&gt;</p>
<p>So talk to your Help desk to find out if this applies to your school</p>

</p>
<p>Firstly a silly question - you did pay EXTRA for Office over and above the cost of the machine?<br />
If so, then you need to go back to the store where you bought the computer and ask them where the disk and product key are, because you should have been given those on purchase....</p>

<h3> david lincer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rule for reception of &#34;on behalf of&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I get messages sent as an example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***; on behalf of; Eric Lofholm [*** Email address is removed for privacy ***]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the first part, *** Email address is removed for privacy *** belongs to infusionsoft a CRM automation system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the "real address"&nbsp;&nbsp; Eric Lofholm [*** Email address is removed for privacy ***] is the one that I care about.&nbsp;&nbsp; It does not matter how eric sent me the message, it is from "ERIC" and I want to build a rule in Outlook 2007 that will recognize this as a message from Eric -- NOT
 -- from infusionmail.com</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have several companies / speaker that all use infusionsoft to manage their contacts / list / leads.&nbsp;&nbsp; So sorting on
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** will not get me what I want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to say, "If this message is from *** Email address is removed for privacy ***" no matter how he sends it to me, it gets to my "ELofholm" mailbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, If I setup a rule that says "look for 
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** " and put that message in the ELofholm mailbox.&nbsp; It seems not to trigger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your assistance and consideraton appreciated in advance.</p>

            <p>You could create a rule with the "with specific words in the message header" condition and then have it look for the address in the header. Depending on how the header is written, you could get quite specific such as;</p>
<p>X-Sender: &lt;address&gt;<br />
or<br />
envelope-from=&lt;address&gt;<br />
or<br />
From: "Display Name" &lt;address&gt;</p>
<p>To see the message header, right click the message and choose Options. For Outlook 2010, choose File-&gt; Properties after opening the message with a double click.</p>

<p>Hi Cathy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few things to check:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office won't be able to connect to the add-ins catalog unless there's a live internet connection, so when you see this error message, start your browser and make sure you can bring up a page or two that you haven't visited before.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a company-supplied PC, there may be policy/security settings that prohibit your installing add-ins.&nbsp; You'd want to check with the help desk or IT department, if any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's your own computer but on a company/enterprise network, there may be network policies that prevent your connecting to the catalog.&nbsp; It'd be worth testing to see whether you can use the add-ins at home but not at whatever location you're at when you
 have the error message.</p>

<h2>            Shared mailbox not showing up in Outlook 2013&#47;2016</h2>
                    <p>We've created a shared mailbox in Office 365 Admin center, added a few users as members but none of them seeing the share mailbox in outlook. As per the link below, it is supposed to show up automatically. Given that all members has both read write permission
 (by default).</p>
<p>https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Open-and-use-a-shared-mailbox-in-Outlook-2016-and-Outlook-2013-D94A8E9E-21F1-4240-808B-DE9C9C088AFD?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've then tried the Web Office 365 Mail "app". Don't know why, nothing show up under the shared folder at the first time we added the shared folder. However, removed it and added it the second time, add the subfolders (inbox, sent, etc) shown and the test
 mail the we've sent can be found. The Outlook side is still no luck. </p>
<p>

<p>Did you get a copy of the reported email and look at it? It sounds like it was a phishing attempt so by analyzing the headers of that email you'd likely see it didn't come from you at all.</p>

            Yes, I looked and there was nothing in the sent folder or the deleted folder.&nbsp; I do not have a copy of the email, they will not share it with me which leads we to question&nbsp;whether they are telling me the truth or not.&nbsp;I was hoping that I can have someone
 look at where my email account was being accessed during a two week time period to determine whether someone logged&nbsp;other than me.&nbsp; If there were no accesses other than from where I am located it will demonstrate that my account was not compromised.&nbsp; This
 involves a very large sum of money that was misdirected to an unauthorized account.&nbsp; Sender says it was because he received an email from me directing him to send it.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 10, Edge and Verizon email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevek255  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10, Edge and Verizon email</h2>
                    <p>I'm having the same problem as others after upgrading to Windows 10:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. If I go to webmail.verizon.net, go through the sign in process I can view all my email but none of the folders, in the left column, are shown.&nbsp;I have tried clearing the browsing data and running under compatibility mode. Neither made a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Verizon email under IE11: Everything looks normal through sign in. After signing in I should see my email and all the folders in the left column. Differing from Edge, IE 11 at this point shows none of my email nor the folders in the left column.
 Once again, I tried clearing browser data and running IE 11 under compatibility mode to no avail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Last option was to use Firefox to get to my email. Under Firefox all is as it should be.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please resolve the Edge and Internet Explorer 11 issues as soon as practical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last issue dealing with Calendar: I'm getting error code 0X80072ee2 without a clue as to what is causing it or what the error code is trying to tell me. A search, under Microsoft Support is a dead end, no such error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More information on setting up Calendar in conjunction with Mail would be helpful. Do I need an account in Calendar to match every account in Mail? Is there any way to import calendar data and contacts from Verizon? How about importing contacts from Outlook
 in the Office Suite?</p>

<h2>            Very slow startup with Outlook</h2>
                    Just recently I&nbsp;started to experience a 1 to 2 minute delay in getting Outlook to start. It is happening on other Outlook accounts also that use the family&nbsp;PC. It use to come on almost instantly but something has changed in the last week or so.&nbsp;&nbsp; Outlook
 box comes up and then a minute or so later left side of screen appears and then the rest pops up. Any help to get it back to a normal startup would be appreciated. I have Windows 7 on a Dell XPS 8000...its only about 2 months old. Thanks

    <title>Pivot Table to find Average Number of Calls by Hour or Weekday - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> varadigm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pivot Table to find Average Number of Calls by Hour or Weekday</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a call log that has dates, and times. I've been able to add a "Day of Week" column. When I run a "Count" of the caller name, ofcourse, it works well and gives me the number of callers per weekday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I want to "Average", it won't work - ofcourse because it cannot average alphabets, lol</p>
<p>So, I created a new column called "Number" and put 1 in all rows so I can use that in the "Value" (or column) of the pivot table - but that doesn't work and that's where I'm going nuts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sample data looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0351fad7-79de-4b29-bf25-17276f0e71c1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Pivot Table (and builder) for number of calls by weekday look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce90bb6e-c0ee-4140-bd40-4193cbd370e4" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Trying to get the Average number of calls per weekday using the "Number" column looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b08f8d8c-859b-48dc-b791-8a0446f05a2f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to get from this pivot is average number of calls by weekday, and by hour. So I can identify what hour of the day on what hour of the week is peak time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much!</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response!</p>
<p>However, this only returns me the average of all those days combined. For example, if I have grouped the row labels by Day of Week, I would like the "Average" to be for that particular day. If I group them by Hour of Day, I would like the average to be of
 number of calls within those hours. Can you please elaborate?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response!</p>
<p>That solution isn't the same as the one I seek (but it is kind of the same). The software is different and there seems to be overlap in their solutions which is confusing and made me waste more time trying to get the answer - and it didn't work. I like where
 Jim is going though - but I can't be certain if it will give me the solution I seek in the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks guys!</p>

                    <p>Hello there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am facing this problem for the last five days with WORD 2016 only, When I click the "OPTIONS" in WORD 2016, it hangs and stops responding. I have tried every possible way to troubleshoot WORD, Followed all the instructions on Microsoft regarding WORD issues,
 Uninstalled and Reinstalled, Repaired, and Updated Office But still the problem is not resolved. Screen Shots also attached. Again mentioning this, It only Happens with WORD 2016, Other Office Applications just work fine and smooth. I have to work with some
 important documents on Word, and my work is being delayed due to this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help in this regard will be highly appreciated.</p>

 would be worth a reinstall.</p>

<h2>            IPV6  meet.lync.com</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem with the invites to use SkypeWebApp. The link forwards to the following host: meet.lync.com. This all works fine with IPV4. But when you use IPV6 the name resolves to an IPV6 ip but no webserver on that ip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So or remove the&nbsp;&nbsp;meet.lync.com IPV6 DNS entry. Or fix the IPV6 address or IPV6 webserver of&nbsp;&nbsp;meet.lync.com</p>

    <title>Downloading app updates kills my internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xcell miguel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Downloading app updates kills my internet</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
On small bandwidth connections there's a real problem with donwloads in the store : it opens so much connections (20 to 30, or more) that I can't even use Internet on any of my devices.<br />
<br />
It's not only happening to me, but to a friend that leaves 150Km away, has a different router and ISP.<br />
<br />
On large bandwidth connections it should not be a problem and can even help to maximize download speed (if one chunk is not enough), but on small connections, what's the point of opening more than one chunk of download if it can already use all the available
 bandwidth ?<br />
<br />
Most of the time it causes problems as routers usualy split bandwidth between each opened connection, thus, every other devices and internet pages are getting a low priority (sort of), as the Store opens many download chunks.<br />
<br />
Uplay on PC did the same mistake last year, many complained on their forums, and they fixed that by making it dynamic, if two chunks are faster than only one, it tries one more, until bandwidth is maximized on large bandwidth, but on small bandwidth it can
 only use one or two chunks, and internet is still usable on the same PC or other devices.<br />
<br />
I tried different routers, it's always the same, internet pages take a very long time to load and most of the time it crashes and I have to pause the Store downloads (when I can, because sometimes it just continues) to be able to just surf the internet.<br />
<br />
There's also the same problem on Xbox One and games/app downloads and updates, it opens too much connections to download updates on a 3Mb internet, making it unusable until it finishes downloading. I made a post about it in the Xbox Preview forum.<br />
<br />
Hope this will be fixed, it's been weeks now that me and my friend are having trouble each time the Store download an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first (before Windows 10 launch and a few days after), it did not open that much connections, an update of the Store (or Windows ?) made it that way.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can disable auto-updates, but that's not a solution, I want to have the apps I use daily up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that this behavior is only on Insider builds (10565 on my home PC), on my work PC (RTM 10240), it only opens one connection by download (3 at a time), not causing internet to crash.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Downloading updates should not kill the internet in any case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My internet works fine even when Torrent etc are open (which are known to slow down the internet), but not when Windows Store is downloading app updates. Internet literally stops working for any other application but Windows Store until the downloads are
 completed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is something that is seriously wrong there and disabling updates is not a solution. This is similar to suggesting don't use Windows if you are having issues with it... Just saying...<br />

            Not for me. Downloading a single application on Build 10586.104 (non-insider).<br />
<br />
Simply resuming the download stops every other app from connecting the internet. I believe and suspecting it might be using so many connections even for a single download, or maybe P2P to reduce the stress on the servers. Can't think of any other way a single
 download to stop internet from functioning.<br />
<br />
But good to know, it is working for some people :)

<h2>            inadvertent switch from 10 pro to enterprise</h2>
                    <p>I have been an insider since windows 8. &nbsp; With the ver 10, I decided to load it on my primary machine, thus going from 8.1 pro to 10 pro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>kept up with the updates as soon as available. &nbsp; But with build 10240, some how I got switched to the enterprise version, and my system is no longer activated, and the release version of ISO won't run on it. &nbsp;so the question is, am I screwed. &nbsp;and will have
 to start from scratch??,</p>
<p>during a room cleanup, somehow my registered win 8 Pro disks have disappeared. &nbsp;(old guy syndrome)</p>

            <p>I can see where he may have mixed them up, for example, I am registered for both 'normal'

<p>
</p><p>I haven't done it personally ;-) .... but I can see how someone could - but, they would have to be registered for both !.</p>
