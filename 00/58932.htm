    <title>AC&#47;DC import for Rock Band 4 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            AC&#47;DC import for Rock Band 4</h2>
                    
<p>I used the instructions listed at <a href="http://harmonixmusic.parature.com/link/portal/16080/16097/Article/591/How-do-I-export-the-AC-DC-Live-Rock-Band-Track-Pack-into-Rock-Band-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://harmonixmusic.parature.com/link/portal/16080/16097/Article/591/How-do-I-export-the-AC-DC-Live-Rock-Band-Track-Pack-into-Rock-Band-4</a> (the "alternately, you can also part") to bulk import my legacy content into Rock Band 4.</p>
<p>When I verified that everything installed, I noticed that it did not import any of my AC/DC tracks.
</p>
<p>So, I tried using the instructions that specifically import the AC/DC tracks and went here:</p>
<p><a href="https://store.xbox.com/en-US/Xbox-One/DLC/Jailbreak-Live-AC-DC/34cfc19b-0f80-4e55-967f-2cc1f647e0d4#bundleWidgetWrapper" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://store.xbox.com/en-US/Xbox-One/DLC/Jailbreak-Live-AC-DC/34cfc19b-0f80-4e55-967f-2cc1f647e0d4#bundleWidgetWrapper</a></p>
<p>Even though I previously owned these tracks under my BigDaddyMaxx ID, they are showing up as "bundle only" for me.
</p>
<p>How do I get this rectified?</p>

<p>Also having the same issue. &nbsp;Have been able to find and see the songs when I search for them, but can't import them. &nbsp;Only get the Bundle Only option and when I click that i'm not even getting an option go get or re-buy whatever "bundle" they are talking
 about.</p>
<p>Lets get this fixed already.</p>
<p>The songs look to already be converted over to play on RB4 so what's the hold up in releasing the music?? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Same here. Somewhere In the Harmonix Rock Band Forum I read the entitlements for Legacy DLC are done in batches (without more precise information). Unfortunately I do not find this information at the moment. I'll wait a few more days. I also checked my purchase
 history in case I have to contact support. No hurry for me, since other Exports (RB1, 2, 3, LRB and Green day) worked. I'm not sure about the 20 Bonus Songs from RB2 Aldo. They should be available afaik.</p>

<p>I am also having issues downloading the AC/DC Live track pack on my Xbox One. I have all other exports, and they all worked, except "Kung Fu Fighting" from Lego Rock Band. Which I think is stupid on how only 1 doesn't in a game with 40-50 (can't remember
 the exact number off hand).</p>
<p>When I look at my Order History on my Microsoft Account, it only goes back to February 13, 2015. Can't find the old Purchase History on the web anymore. So, I've gone into my Download History on my 360, and redownloaded the export (probably 20 times already)
 and the songs are still locked in the One Games Store. FIX IT MICROSOFT!!!</p>

<p>Same issue here. And I have some disconcerting news. I have taken the time to correspond with Harmonix and Microsoft support several times over the past two weeks, and each of them points the finger in the other direction. So I don't see how this gets fixed
 anytime soon. I think for it to get resolved, somebody has to say "this is our problem, we know what it is, and we are fixing it". But until that happens, nothing will get resolved because it's like they're both pointing at an imaginary friend in the middle.
 And it's us who lose.</p>

<p>Are the ACDC songs not showing up under "Manage Game" for Rock Band 4? Scroll all the way to the right when you're in Manage Game and all the songs from the ACDC export should be there. When I had the Xbox One back in February I had the ACDC export working
 just fine for me, Im not sure why theyre not working for you guys.</p>

<p>Doesn't work for me either. &nbsp;Can't see any of my download history where the export key would be and MS chat was no help what so ever. &nbsp;Still have the disc and export code so for giggles I tried to re enter it and it said it has already been used.....probably
 because I used it the day i bought it to import into RB 2 or 3. &nbsp;But with support basically calling me a liar and the fact that not a single piece of addons appear in my 360 download history, I can't prove otherwise.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Screen Saver Slide Show</h2>
                    Windows 10 updated recently (April 2017) and I can no longer make a slide show for screen saver by going to Control Panel&gt;Personalize&gt;Screensaver&gt;slide show.&nbsp; I can go to Settings&gt;Background&gt;Slideshow and choose photos, but there is no place to click on
 Apply or Finish there and it doesn't get established. Also, the Background slideshow suggests that I choose as time allotment 1, 10, 30 minutes or 1, 6 hours, or one day, so it is not the same as the former Screensaver slide show that permitted various short
 periods of time (in minutes).&nbsp; QUESTION:&nbsp; How can I set up a slideshow screensaver such as I have in the past, for many years?

<p>Try running Memtest86+, this runs from a boot disk or CD, ths should eliminate or confirm if your one or more of your memory sticks are bad or the SPD values in the BIOS are correct.<br />
Let it run for as long as you can: 2,4,6,8 or more hours, if no errors by then your ram is OK.<br />

<p><span>Hi Brabru,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you get any error message or error code?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you remember making any hardware/software changes or any new updates installed after which the issue started?</span></p>
<p><span>Try the steps below and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Unplug all external devices except mouse and keyboard and then try booting to the desktop and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check the status of the issue in safe mode. Let us know if the issue persists in safe mode.</span></p>

 in safe mode</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in safe mode then, place the computer in a clean boot state and troubleshoot the issue. You can start Windows Vista or
 Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

 boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong></a><strong><br />
(Step 1: Perform a clean boot)</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the following KB article to narrow down the exact source:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p><span>Also, see the section on how return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under “Reset the computer to start as usual”, after
 performing the clean boot troubleshooting.</span></p>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 4 &#34;Loading Please Wait&#34; error</h2>
                    So every time I launch up Forza Horizon 4, it launches up normally. Then it gets to the place where you hit [ENTER]. And then I do so. And the text in the bottom "Loading, please wait" shows up and it just keeps spinning. I left it for at least an hour
 with no background apps (that I am aware of) running. This problem either started on Thursday or Friday. If this is happening to anyone else or if there is a possible fix, please let me know!<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4956040f-1e25-4f67-b4b0-d62a1ef2009f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4956040f-1e25-4f67-b4b0-d62a1ef2009f?upload=true" /></a>

<h2>            HP 1012 printer doesn&#39;t print after windows 10 upgrade.</h2>
                    &nbsp;My hp 1012 printer won't print after installing my windows 10 upgrade. My pc had windows 8.1 and I had tricked it with the hp3055 pcl5 drivers to make the printer work&nbsp;which windows 10 still recognizes. It just says error and the printer does nothing
 when trying to print a test page. Any ideas?

            Mine didn't either and after all the fix it downloads and reading and frustration for days, it was just a simple click of sharing printer. Go into control panel (type in Cortana search box)&nbsp;Devices and Printer, right click on pic of printer, printer properties,
 ck mark sharing box.

            <p>If your current Windows is Genuine and activated, after a clean Install it would automatically activate.You do not need to do anything.Choose skip this or DO this later when prompted for a key.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>With the November update available for Windows 10, you can use your existing product key of Windows 7 to activate Windows 10 also.Please note that the ISO is the one with November update, not the build 10240 one.If you do not have that, download a newer
 one using media creation Tool.</p>
<p>Also note that if you use 10240 build ISO, through Windows update you will be required to download the November update again.</p>

</p><p>I am unable to run Skype because it keeps on saying "STARTUP_LOAD_ERROR". I have tried to uninstall and reinstall it many times. I tried Skype Classic and it seems to work fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered something while waiting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was actually using RDP to run it and it was failing. But on the actual desktop, it runs fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on an RDP session on macOS via Microsoft Remote Desktop 10 for macOS. Not sure why it doesn't work there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype for Desktop works on both desktop and on RDP desktop.</p>

<p><span>Hi Harisri Menon,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>.Lnk is a shortcut file type. LNK is Windows Shortcut file which links to a program, file or directory. This type of file creates a link to a program
 or application, from another location. These files are used as placeholders for executables and other files. If the real folder has been deleted from the drive, then you can’t open it using the shortcut.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This could be due to virus infection.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Get a complete scan of the USB drive and see if there’s any trace of infection. Ensure that you update your virus database definition before running
 the scan.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you do not have antivirus/antispyware software on your machine, you may download Microsoft Security Essentials.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s the download link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/market.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/market.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>There are many instances of .exe files changed to .lnk. Go through the links below and see if you find the information helpful.</span></p>

<p>Try doing a hard reset EXACTLY like this. &nbsp;Press the power button on the front of the console for 10 seconds or until the power shuts down completely. &nbsp;Then unplug the power cord from the back of the console for five minutes. &nbsp;Plug the power back in and
 power the console back up. &nbsp;Once it is up and operational test the results. &nbsp;Let us know. &nbsp;Good Luck!!</p>

<p>Try as the previous comment mentioned, but also check to see if your controller is set to a different mode with different button mapping.

<p>That link will help you trouble shoot the buttons if nothing works. If all else fails, if you have a receipt and are within a certain time frame you can try and take it back to place of purchase and request a refund or replacement.</p>
<p>You can also request one from Microsoft, by sending in your faulty controller with all the removable and customizable pieces taken off and just sending in the BARE controlller. This next link will help you figure out how to get your controller serviced:</p>

            Try that same search trick, but from a "higher" folder (like starting in just the C:\ drive, type a single * mark in the search box to list out every file on the entire computer), then group it by tag.&nbsp; That should be a quick way to see the full list of
 every tag used anywhere, and hopefully find the one you want to remove pretty easily.<br />

<p>Not an expert in this area, but just did some testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tested with .jpg files. Started in my <strong>Pictures</strong> folder. Typed '<strong>kind:</strong>' in the Search bar &amp; then selected
<strong>Picture</strong> from the drop-list. (this presents you with all picture files in both the folder and all its subfolders in a flat view) Went to edit tags, testing various first letters to see what was offered. Found a tag I wasn't familiar with (toppix).
 Returned to the Search bar, clicked at the end of the Search string and added <strong>
tags:toppix</strong>. This produced a single result. Once I removed that tag from the picture, I went to tag another photo. When I typed '<strong>T</strong>', toppix was no longer offered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes me think the offered list in generated 'on the fly' and if you are being offered an option, it still exists in some file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So try the <strong>tags:<em>BadTagText</em></strong> search and see if you still have files with the bad tag.</p>

<p><span>Do you know when this problem began (presumably when yoiu installed File Cure)?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in
 time <strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make
 the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted,
 push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a><span>&nbsp;along with burning software like:
</span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</a><span>&nbsp;and, of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting) and go to safe mode with networking.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span><span>While in safe mode with networking, download Revo to help uninstall the program:
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/reviews/revo-uninstaller/revouninstaller.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.snapfiles.com/reviews/revo-uninstaller/revouninstaller.html</a>. Go to Start / Control Panel / Programs and Features / and make sure File Cure is listed as installed program then use Revo to uninstall it (it often works better than the standard uninstall
 feature in Vista and in this case we want to be as sure as possible that we remove all traces of it).&nbsp; Reboot and see if that resolves or at least helps the problem.</span></span></p>
</span></span>
<p><span><span>If that doens't resolve the problem, then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C;\Windows\System32.&nbsp; Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It may want to schedule itself to start at the next startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Agree and then reboot so the program can run. It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning startup (Start
 / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>=============================================================================================================</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>One possible solution to the access denied error is that File Cure altered your permissions and or ownership.&nbsp;
 You may need to give yourself Full Rights and Ownership of the entire drive.&nbsp; Here are&nbsp;some guidelines on how to change permissionas and take ownership:</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span>To see your permissions, right click the folder/file, click on properties, and check out the security tab.&nbsp; Check to see what permissions
 you have by clicking on your username (or user group).&nbsp; Here are&nbsp;the types of permissions you can have:
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You need to be an administrator or the&nbsp;owner to change permissions (and sometimes being an administrator or even an owner isn't enough - there are ways to block even them from access (though a smart administrator knows these ways and can get around them -
 but usually shouldn't because they were denied access usually for a very good reason).&nbsp; Here's how to change folder permissions in Vista:
</span><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To add take and grant full right permissions and ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:
</span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/</span></a><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>To fix this problem with the folders, take
 Owner tab.&nbsp; Click edit and then click the name of the person you want to give ownership to (you may need to add it if it isn't there - or it may be yourself). If you want it to apply to sub-folders and files within that folder/drive, then check the box for
 replace owner on sub-containers and objects and click OK.&nbsp; Back out and now there's a new owner for the folders/drive and files who can change permissions as needed.&nbsp; You can now change them from read-only (even if the main folder says they still are read
 only - you can have access yourself as the owner).&nbsp; You can keep them as read-only for other users and guests and even administrators (though they can take ownership themselves and gain access if they so desire and there really isn't much you can do to stop
 this except protect the folder with a password using a 3rd party product.&nbsp; Here's more information on taking ownership of a file or folder:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To add take ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:

<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE) but ONLY if we can first get your computer to boot into normal mode (which doesn't seem likely if
 we've reached this step).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</p>
<span><span>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix
</span><span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></a><span>&nbsp;along with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough
 access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated
 by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted as necessary by the procedures of your computer
 manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly 100 updates pending,...</span></span></p>
<p>Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</p>
</span></span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Although this will not affect
 your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work (assuming you've removed File Cure {and can boot normally}- otherwise it
 will probably carry over to the re-installed system).&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll
 need to make a slipstream disk as follows: </span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.</span></span></div>

    <title>Since installing the January 2018 updates on my Windows 8.1 64-bit, it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grangeland  say:</h3>
<h2>            Since installing the January 2018 updates on my Windows 8.1 64-bit, it will not wake up reliably. Any fix suggestions&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ever since my Windows 8.1 Pro desktop PC was updated with the January 2018 updates, on attempting to wake from sleep sometimes it will power up the disks and fans for a couple of seconds then power off completely. This happens on between 30% and 50% of the
 wake up attempts. If it does wake up properly then it works perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it fails to wake, then when I press the power button it goes through a full reboot sequence, but takes longer than normal presumably because there are some problems that it has to clean up first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Fast Start-up feature has been disabled for several years as I am not convinced it is of any benefit since C: is on an SSD. Incidentally, Fast Start-up means a slower Shut Down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have hybrid sleep enabled, and have demonstrated that it is working as I can remove power while it is sleeping and it does a normal hibernate restore when restarted. However, the problem also seems to apply when hibernating either explicitly or using hybrid
 sleep. When I power up again from a hibernate situation about 30% to 50% of the time the fans and disk lights come on for a few seconds then the power goes off again. After this, the next start is similar to that described above when a wake up fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a temporary fix, I have disabled hibernate completely using the command</p>
<p>
</p><p>powercfg /h off</p>
<p>
</p><p>which seems to have eliminated the problem, but means that the protection from power loss provided by hybrid sleep is no longer present. Since the hybrid sleep had become unreliable, this protection was not really valid anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a great pity that Microsoft moved away from separate updates and introduced the Roll-up of updates into a single large update. It no longer seems possible to leave out updates that cause problems while still applying other important security fixes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest a fix that will restore the original functionality while allowing my PC to continue receiving security updates normally?</p>

            Hi Grangeland,<br />
<br />
I'd like to get more information regarding this so we could further check and provide a more established workaround.
<br />
<br />
Any other recent changes made to the system that might have caused the issue apart from the update?<br />
<br />
Please confirm which KB update was recently installed so we could further verify.<br />
<br />
Also, how do you normally turn off your computer?<br />
<br />
If you're getting any error messages, it would help us narrow down possible cause. An event number is used to report that something unexpected happened that prevented Windows from shutting down correctly. There may be insufficient information to explicitly
 define what happened hence the series of questions.<br />
<br />
Moreover, if you haven't run the power troubleshooter yet, please do so: <br />
<br />
<em><strong>Control Panel </strong>&gt; located at the upper-right corner of the window, search for
<strong>Troubleshooting </strong>&gt; left pane of the window, select <strong>View all</strong> &gt; locate
<strong>Power</strong></em><br />
<br />
<em><strong>Note:</strong> Follow the on-screen instruction to complete the scan.</em><br />
<br />
We will keep an eye out for your response.<br />
<br />
Regards.

<p>Hello Jane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I will try and answer your questions in order:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Any other recent changes made to the system that might have caused the issue apart from the update?<br />
<br />
No. Apart from signature file updates to my anti-virus (Kaspersky Internet Security 2017); updates to my Chrome and Firefox browsers; and Flash Player I am not aware of any other changes. On 26th January, I updated to KIS 2018, but that made no difference.<br />
<br />
2) Please confirm which KB update was recently installed so we could further verify.<br />
<br />
The following updates were applied on 9th January after which the problem started appearing:<br />
<br />
KB4056895 - January Quality Roll-up for Windows 8.1 64-bit.<br />
KB4033369 and KB4055266 - updates for .net.<br />
KB890830 - Malicious Software Removal Tool.<br />
KB4056887 - Adobe Flash Player Update.<br />
and six updates for Microsoft office. I am not sure these will be relevant but I can supply the numbers if required.<br />
<br />
3) Also, how do you normally turn off your computer?<br />
<br />
Normally I turn off using the following sequence:<br />
Windows key + 'X'<br />
then 'U' twice on its own.<br />
<br />
I have also tried the Shut Down option from the Start Menu and from the Charms Bar and even pressing the Power button, which is configured to shut down the PC.<br />
<br />
Note: I disabled Fast Start-up when I first got the PC two and half years ago. Since it has C: on an SSD, there is very little improvement in start up time with this feature enabled, and shut down time is extended with it enabled.<br />
<br />
4) If you're getting any error messages .....<br />
<br />
When the problem occurs, the monitor does not get a video signal for sufficiently long to turn on. Power goes off typically in about two seconds.<br />
<br />
I have looked through the Event Viewer logs for the Windows System, and starting just after the 9th January, there are a series of events that do not appear in the logs before that date. An example is:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39cfab17-be1f-4d6a-9c42-fedb7a4a16d6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39cfab17-be1f-4d6a-9c42-fedb7a4a16d6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The first entry (bottom of the list) is the operating system start time due to the wake up. Then the error immediately above it says "Windows failed to resume from hibernate with error status 0xC0000001.".&nbsp; It should have been waking up not resuming from
 hibernate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then going up the list:<br />
<br />
There are 0x1 boot options on this system.<br />
The bootmgr spent 0 ms waiting for user input.<br />
There are 0x1 boot options on this system. [again]<br />
The bootmgr spent 0 ms waiting for user input. [again]<br />
The last shutdown's success status was false. The last boot's success status was true.<br />
The boot type was 0x0.<br />
The firmware reported boot metrics.<br />
File System Filter 'FileInfo' (6.3, ‎2014‎-‎02‎-‎22T12:13:10.000000000Z) has successfully loaded and registered with Filter Manager.<br />
File System Filter 'Wof' (6.3, ‎2014‎-‎03‎-‎13T08:27:29.000000000Z) has successfully loaded and registered with Filter Manager.<br />
File System Filter 'mfehidk' (0.0, ‎2014‎-‎09‎-‎24T22:26:25.000000000Z) has successfully loaded and registered with Filter Manager.<br />
<br />
Then the next Error message, "The previous system shutdown at 09:28:41 on ‎13/‎01/‎2018 was unexpected."<br />
<br />
Finally the critical error message (at the top of the list) said "The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly."<br />
<br />
If you require more messages from the event log please let me know.<br />
<br />
5) I ran the power trouble shooter. It reported it was changing the disk shut down time, the display turn off time and the system sleep time. I changed these back to my original settings of 'never', 15 minutes and 'never' respectively. When I am not using the
 PC but expect to use it again shortly, I put it to sleep using the keyboard sleep key combination. I have some long video editing programs that stall if the PC sleeps automatically while they are running, although I have not used those for a while. Also, since
 C: is on an SSD I don't see any need for that to sleep. D: is on an HDD, and this spins down if it is not used for a minute or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, the February updates were applied on 15th February. I have also re-enabled hibernation now to see if sleep still has a problem. I will report back if it fails again or give it two or three weeks to see if it is now working properly again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need more information, please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Richard.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Looking at the details of the preview of 2018/01 roll-up I found:</p>
<p>
</p><p>""Addresses multiple symptoms that occur during power transitions including a stop error 0x9F (0000009F) when a device tries to enter sleep mode or restart. USB PnP devices may also be unusable after waking from sleep.""</p>

<br />
Hmmm. The error message <em>"Windows failed to resume from hibernate with error status 0xC0000001."</em> is normally related to driver problem. Have you considered updating the GPU driver?<br />
<br />
Make sure all drivers are all up to date. I recommend manually downloading the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s website to make sure the one installed on your PC is updated. Outdated or incompatible drivers could cause issues such as this one. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Here's a support article for guidelines: <br />

Note to check for compatibility. You may refer to this article for steps on how: <br />

<p>Hello Jane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked all the drivers against those listed on the PC manufacturer's site, including the video driver, and they all appear to be up to date. Microsoft also implies they are up to date for the ones that are on the manufacturer's site. I have not identified
 any specific graphics chip set so I cannot go to the chip manufacturer's site to look for drivers. Since the PC is just using the motherboard graphics, I would hope that the manufacturer's site covers this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not easy to understand why the system should react differently when waking from sleep depending on whether hibernate is enabled (allowing hybrid sleep) or disabled. Although there will be a hibernate image on C:, it should not be involved in waking
 from sleep if the power has not been removed completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed all Microsoft Windows Updates that have been applied since the beginning of the year - the first incident was on 13th January, four days after the January updates were applied. I have re-enabled hibernate, and I will run it in this configuration
 for a while to see what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Microsoft started using the Rollup format for updates, it is difficult to track just what is happening. If I look at the Update History it shows certain update numbers, which generally do not align with all the numbers in the list of installed updates.
 What also confused me at first was when I removed the February Security Monthly Rollup, the January Rollup appeared in the list of installed updates with today's date. Since I suspect that the January update was probably when the problem appeared (hopefully)
 I removed that one and the December update appeared with today's date. I assume the Rollups include previous updates so it sort of makes sense once I thought about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Update History, the installation dates are the dates when the updates were first installed. When a Rollup update is applied, the preceding update disappears from the list of installed updates, and reappears when the subsequent Rollup is uninstalled.
 Only now it has two installation dates: In the Update History, KB4054519 was installed on 15/12/2017 (UK date), but the Installed Updates page has its date as 24/2/2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem arose as a result of the January update, then one of the following might be responsible: KB4055001, KB4054854, KB4033369 and KB4054999. I also uninstalled a Flash Player update although I don't believe this is significant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I wait and see. If it stays working properly, I will have to work out how to apply updates going forward as the monthly Rollups will probably cause the problem to reappear. It was much easier in the old system when each update was clearly documented
 and separate so that known individual problematic updates could be hidden rather than being installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Richard.</p>

<p>THREAD REVIEW</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having this issue as well. It really takes the energy out of my workflow, and usually leads to procrastination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Richard (aka Grangeland) is way more thorough than Jane. All of Jane's answers try to pass the problem off&nbsp; to Richards behavior (shut down technique and old drivers, for example).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Richards take on this is proactive and advanced. In the end, Jane recommends that Richard take more of his time to fill out a bug report. Perhaps less time snuggling kitties and more time cuddling computers would lead to a more helpful forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Final score: 2 out of 7.4</p>

<p>Hello Nasness,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear you are having problems, but pleased to realise I am not the only one with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current state is that I have taken out all the Windows updates that have been released this year including some Adobe updates, although I don't believe these are causing a problem. I have left all the Office 2007 updates in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have hibernate re-enabled, but this is required only as protection for power loss when sleeping as hybrid sleep is enabled. I don't use fast start-up as it makes very little difference as C: is on an SSD, and don't hibernate the system. When I am not using
 it during the day it sleeps and over night it is fully shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How I shut it down should be irrelevant providing I initiate a normal shut down and don't simply remove the power. At the moment I have not experienced any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plan to give it another week or so and then reapply the .NET updates. If that is still okay, then I will see if I can install KB4056898 which claims to be the 2018-01 Security Only Update, rather than KB4056895 which is the 2018-01 Monthly Roll-up. It
 is very difficult to know what the differences are as the documentation on these updates is really atrocious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is still okay after that I will try KB4074587, which is the 2018-02 Security Only update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that the Roll-up updates that appear as a single item in the update history expand to a long list in the Installed Updates page. For example, Office2007 shows one entry in update history February 15th , but there are 36 entries in the Installed
 Updates list for the same date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I hit a problem, I will try uninstalling various component updates to see which one is causing the problem. This could take several months as the issue does not occur every time the computer sleeps and no failure does not mean the problem has been removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will add further updates to this thread as I progress with my investigation.</p>
        </p>

            Hello Nasness, <br />
<br />
If you were reading through the thread, I did state: <br />
<br />
"If you're getting any error messages, it would help us narrow down possible cause. An event number is used to report that something unexpected happened that prevented Windows from shutting down correctly.
<em>There may be insufficient information to explicitly define what happened hence the series of questions.</em>"<br />
<br />
That is one way to isolate and check the current state of someone else's PC.<br />
<br />
I am thankful that Richard is being thorough with his troubleshooting. Him knowing the current state his computer is on and the changes made to the system that might have lead to the issue.
<br />
<br />
The reason why the feedback was suggested was because, if it was due to the KB update (as he is still on the process of eliminating the possible cause) then he can let our developers know about his suggestion of each update to be clearly documented and separate
 so that known individual problematic updates could be hidden rather than being installed.<br />
<br />
Now if you have any suggestions to help sort the issue, then by all means, spill the beans. If you have no other workaround to advise, then perhaps less time procrastinating and more time cuddling computers would lead to a more helpful forum.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.

<p>Hello again, Richard. <br />
<br />
Noting that your antivirus also recently updated, you might want to also check on this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1/bsod-windows-81-bug-check-code-0000009f/7b4fdb5a-8955-497b-903e-14e5e6e874ac">
thread </a>with almost the same issue. <br />
<br />
Moreover, taking into account the KB updates that was recently installed on your computer, seems that after all, it is not the latest update there is. You might want to check
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4057401/windows-81-update-kb4057401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB4057401 </a>as this addresses some of the issues you've indicated in your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate you working with us throughout this issue you're experiencing.<br />
<br />
All the best!<br />
