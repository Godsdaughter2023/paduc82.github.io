<h2>            windows store not working</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I was trying&nbsp; to reset my windows but as it was taking a lot of time so I force shut down it. But when I reopened my windows most of my apps were gone and they all show an error like the picture<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6d2cee7-13d4-42bf-a836-054de1aa9615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6d2cee7-13d4-42bf-a836-054de1aa9615" /></a></p>
<p>And not only this my store app is removed&nbsp;and I cannot find it in the start menu and I have tried searching for it but seems&nbsp;to have developed&nbsp;an error same as above.&nbsp;Moreover I have not been able to&nbsp; download any app fro the windows store from its website
 also. Please help me. I already asked this question once and received an advice to do something with powershell but that didn't work. So please help me as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Hi when this happens this is usually caused by the fact you have a bounty within the town, or for some reason like happened to me you are thane, you committed a crime guards come up, say you are thane, they leave but the bounty is still there so you get
 attacked, I recommend if you can't pay off your bounty is commit another crime and pay off the bounty then, this should sort you out.</p>
<p>Dump any stolen stuff you don't want to lost in a cupboard or something to pick up after you are arrested.</p>

<p>it could also depend on who you side with. its like fallout in this aspect, if you sided with imperial you wont be able to do stormcloack missions and vise versa if you sided with stormcloak.</p>
<p>p.s. if ur a stage 4 vampire you will be attacked on sight</p>

<p>LOL I've doen the same. just to hard to NOT attack them? xD What I did was I went to another town, and sheathed my weapon. A guard stopped me and gave me the choice to go to jail. I did, didn't try to break out, and everything was perfectly fine again.</p>

<br />
<br />Restart PC, try again.
<br />
<br />If that's not enough add Take Ownership shortcut to your right click menu to use on any folders that need it:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />Another thing to try is to enable the Hidden Administrator and Sign in (leaving password blank)  to see if it has the ability to do this after you copy some of the files into its own folder (not while they are still in your account). 
<br />
<br /> If it works then it means the problem is your account is corrupted.  Create a new Local Admin to sign into and test, move your files over and set it up.  When ready you can delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.
<br />
<br />If the problem remains the install and not the User account, go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Back in early versions of Windows, when you logged in as Admin, you had full admin rights all of the time.  But that was a security risk.  Back a couple of Windows versions ago MS introduced "UAC", User Access Control,  a feature that requires you to provide the admin id and password when doing things that require higher access rights.  By Windows 10 they extended UAC to include the Admin ID.  So even though you are logged in as "admin", you are operating at standard (or maybe slightly higher, I'm not positive) Windows access rights.  
<br />
<br />When you see this UAC prompt, the proper action is the submit the password on your admin account and press OK.

<h2>            Outlook 2007 contacts not transfered to a new computer with the old .pst file&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I consider myself an advanced user, but I've been wrestling (unsuccessfully) for nearly 8 hours now on these problems:</p>
<p>PROBLEM 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;I recently purchased a new laptop and have successfully moved a copy of my old .pst file to the new laptop and have made it the default data store file on my new computer.&nbsp; All of my old emails are there; that part went perfectly.&nbsp; But the new
 address book is empty. All of my contacts are&nbsp;there in the C:\Users\{accountname}\Contacts folder on my new laptop, but they are not available in the Outlook address book. I even went through the entire proceedure spelled out in "MS Knowledge Base Article
 ID: 287070 - Last Review: July 2, 2010 - Revision: 7.0" regarding using a backup .pst file to backup just my Contacts folder and import that folder via the backup.pst file.&nbsp; THe contacts are still not in my Outlook address book.&nbsp; Interestingly, my new Outlook
 2007 has Business Contact Manager (the old one did not), and all of my contacts -- I had five groups: Business, Family, Friends, etc.) show up when I go the the Business Contact Manager Home page and click on "Business Contacts" under "Start a Task."&nbsp; When
 I do that, all of my old contact groups are listed under "My Contacts" in the navigation pane, and all of my old contacts are there in their proper groups.&nbsp; But that still does not help me get them into my Outlook Address Book - which is where they need to
 be for me to use them.</p>
<p>PROBLEM 2.&nbsp; I used the Easy Transfer Wizard to try to transfer my email accounts and contacts to my new computer. When I look at the new C:\Users\{accountname}App Data\Local\Microsoft\Outlook\Accounts folder, the same 6 .oeaccount account files that are
 on my old computer are there on the new one.&nbsp; But when I open Outlook and go to TOOLS &gt; ACCOUNT SETTINGS, there are no accounts displayed.&nbsp; Obviously, I can't receive or send email until I get this problem solved, and I have way too many accounts to want to
 set up each one manually.</p>
<p>Any help will be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>As an aside, with so many millions of people and businesses around the world using Outlook, how can Microsoft make it so *$%^^ difficult for users to move their Outlook setup from one computer to another?</p>

<h2>            Uninstall from all my synced PCs &#40;app info will be lost&#41;</h2>
                    Hello!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In Windows 8.1, when I uninstall any Windows Store app, I get this option to
<b>Uninstall from all my synced PCs (app info will be lost)</b>. I want to understand the meaning of the statement in parenthesis. Does it means that if I select this option, the data that apps stores in
<b>RoamingState</b> folder will also be removed from Microsoft servers, and in future if I reinstall this app, I won't get back my settings that app store in RoamingState to create a seamless experience between devices?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            Okay. And what about the scenario when I use only 1 computer, but I don't select this option while uninstalling the app. Will my data be preserved in Microsoft servers? And when I reinstall some app (on same computer or another), will I get back my settings
 (whatever the app stores in RoamingState.

<p><span><span>With Autoruns you can uncheck an item, which disables it from starting, or you can right click an item and then delete it. If you uncheck you can recheck to re-enable the item. It is

                    <p>Hello, i was wondering if anyone can help me. As seen in my question, something is wrong with my activation. I've been searching for the past 2-3 hours and found some guides that didn't help. What's confusing to me is why the "Activate Windows" icon in the
 bottom right of my screen only showed up today after launching my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 pro (edition) and under Activation is says "windows is not activated".

            Hi, James,
<br /> Message "we can't connect to your organization's activation server" at home computer means unfortunately that activation was made illegally, using corporate licensing mechanism. 
<br />Last Windows version has enhanced detection if this, that's why you've get this message right now.
<br />You have to buy a legal Windows, sorry for bad news.

<p>My xbox one controller started drifting upwards. Even as iam typing this message now if i leave the cursor on the page it starts moving upwards and moving the whole page to the top. I have been reading this is a common problem for the xbox one controller.
 Should i just buy a brand new controller?</p>

<h3> duckers_mcquack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Software issue&#47;bug with xbox one controller wireless dongle</h2>
                    The wireless dongle causes my pc to emit "low pitch beep" when i press the mouse down and once when i release the button. And only way for me to fix it is to reboot my pc (first time it happened was when i was playing black desert, then my keyboard and
 mouse both shut down and both spammed the keys, causing the "boop"ing to spam until i hard reset the pc.<br />
<br />
If i don't have it connected, the pc then works as normal. But as soon as i connect the dongle and use my mouse and keybard, one of them are bound to go "boop"<br />
<br />
Could this be a faulty hardware or software bug within the dongle itself?

            I reverted back to the Ximput drivers from 01/01/16 and now the controller works fine. But in trackmania the game reverts how the triggers react. It accelerates when i don't do anything, and releases the throttle when the trigger being pressed in.<br />
<br />
Have to use my old xbox 360 with a wireless dongle until this gets fixed.<br />
<br />
Clean boot? This even happens on a newly formatted pc. It's the 2 latest Ximput drivers for the xbox one and x360 controller that is shait buggy and glitchy. The microsoft insider program actually has the fixes for it, but i won't join that program, so i just
 have to use old drivers until the patch releases.

<p><span>Hello, Barbara</span></p>
<p><span>Have you been able to watch Internet TV previously without any problems?<br />
<span>If it was working previously, you may try running a system restore to when it was working correctly:<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>System
 Restore: frequently asked questions</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>A few other&nbsp;steps you can try would be to reinstall the Internet TV add-in and to try a new user account.</span></p>
<p><span>To reinstall Internet TV, ensure that Media Center is closed and go to Start, Control Panel, Programs, Uninstall a program, select Internet TV for Windows Media Center then choose
 Uninstall.<br />
After doing that, open Media Center and reinstall Internet TV.</span></p>
<p><span>You can create a new user account by clicking the link below, if the new user account works, your account is likely corrupt, if that is the case, you can follow the other link below
 to fix it.</span></p>

 I try to install AMD catalyst center again, it simply says that installation "failed". Suddently, my laptop only has integrated graphics. What's wrong here?&nbsp;

    <title>Trying to close a skype account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying to close a skype account</h2>
                    So as the title says I am trying to close a Microsoft Skype account since I no longer want to use it. I already know I can uninstall the program by itself and what not but I would like to permanently delete the account on Skype. My question is the following
 : Is there a way to delete a skype account without closing your Microsoft account in the process? Unfortunately the email I primarily use is connected too it and I don't want to accidentally delete it. On a final note I am trying to also find a phone number
 or anything so that I can call microsoft or whoever handles all this technical support. If anybody knows or has an idea, an answer for any of this that'd be really helpful

<p>
</p><p>How was the account created, via Skype name or email address?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was created under Skype name, log on at <strong>account.live.com </strong>
using Skype name and password, it will prompt you to enter your Microsoft account. Instead of entering the Microsoft account that you're using, create a new Microsoft account. Please make sure that you're not signed in any browser&nbsp;using&nbsp;your active&nbsp;Microsoft
 account&nbsp;when doing this, as it might be linked to your Skype account. You may use a private browser as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, proceed with the deletion of your Skype account, kindly refer to this link,
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-skype-account?q=close+account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I close my Skype account?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the Skype account was created under Microsoft account &nbsp;and you used your active Microsoft account to sign in&nbsp;with Skype, deleting the Skype account will also delete or remove your access to your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>

I have remembered the password now after a permutation and combination of tries and its working for me now.<br />
<br />
I have few suggestion though</p>
<p><br />
1. Password Expire feature should not be set by default on windows. There could a lot of people who use fingerprint reader's or a PIN and does not know about this password expire feature. they could get into a problem like I did where I was not able to recall
 my password but was able to remember other 'Windows Hello' sign in features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. A User should be allowed to change password after expiration either by password, fingerprint reader or a PIN.<br />
These are also known to a user and it should allow them to reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure how feasible these suggestions are from a security point of view, but Microsoft should consider them if it could be of any value in future.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply Arul_D</p>

<p>I am writing on behalf of a novice user. &nbsp;I am certainly not a novice user, but I am floored (and disgusted) at the way Microsoft is treating people by increasing the complexity of problems that any user can face. &nbsp;She got a used computer many months ago,
 running Windows 7; upgraded it (unwillingly, BTW) to the atrocious Windows 10. &nbsp;She reports that a few days ago, she got a pop-up message saying her 'password was going to expire in [fill in the blank] days'. &nbsp;As far as SHE knew, she DIDN'T HAVE a password,
 and didn't need one. &nbsp;Yesterday, she &nbsp;said today, she was locked out of her computer. By Windows 10. &nbsp;Asking her for the password. &nbsp;She didn't have. &nbsp;Because she didn't need to know a password. Because there wasn't a password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't a "feature" &nbsp;This is OBVIOUSLY a designed-in bug. &nbsp;Microsoft needs to learn how to stop victimizing people who aren't as good as their average employee at fixing THEIR software problems.</p>

            <p>Now, a different problem is happening to MY OWN computer. &nbsp;It's a different problem.</p>
<p>But I really have to laugh at these kinds of "solutions". &nbsp;If a person cannot log onto his/her computer, she/he CANNOT FIX THE PROBLEM AS YOU SUGGESTED! &nbsp; They MIGHT depend on a friend (that they don't have), or a relative (again, that they don't have),
 or a second computer (as I happen to have).</p>
<p>If they cannot get their computer running, THEY CANNOT PUT A QUESTION HERE TO ASK!</p>
<p>Do you realize how BAD Microsoft is at software? &nbsp;Do you realize that you are VICTIMIZING probably MILLIONS of users with these bugs? &nbsp;DO you UNDERSTAND that people hate you? &nbsp;DO you understand that you are costing your victims (customers) BILLIONS of dollars
 in excessive service fees and other costs due to the downtime that your software's bugs are causing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Here, I copy text I've already placed, elsewhere:<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; "Now the problem is happening to me, too. &nbsp;I was apparently forced to upgrade from Windows 7 to 10, on ajn HP laptop. &nbsp;For a few days, the thing SEEMED to boot. &nbsp;Today, &nbsp;now, it FIRST shows a screen with a beach, and when my mouse wheel brings down the
 other screen, I see my name, "Jim Bell", in large letters, as well as my direct email address in smaller letters below. &nbsp;A box appears below that, saying "Password". &nbsp;Problem is, I don't have a password, &nbsp;I've never had a password. &nbsp;So, I don't type anything,
 except hitting the "Enter" key. &nbsp;"Please enter your sign-in information and try again". &nbsp;But I have no "sign-in information" to provide. &nbsp;Thus, I cannot log in. &nbsp;I cannot use that computer. &nbsp;The only reason I can access this is that I have a SECOND computer
 that isn't YET screwed up. &nbsp;As far as I can tell, I am completely locked out of my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is OBVIOUSLY a major problem with Microsoft and Windows 10. &nbsp;Many other people have the same problem. &nbsp;When I see other questions which seem to be related to the same problem, I often see the answerer suggesting that people do things, things that I
 cannot possibly do, in large part because I simply CANNOT log on to my computer. &nbsp;I cannot EVEN BEGIN to solve the problem, because your brain-dead software DOES NOT ALLOW ME to do so.</p>
<p>Please note: &nbsp;I did NOT "forget" my password(s). &nbsp;I NEVER HAD such passwords, period. &nbsp;It is clear from other questions here that this very serious bug doesn't occur simply because somebody "forgot" their password, but because there is a problem inherent
 with Windows 10. &nbsp;It clearly wasn't debugged well. &nbsp;I was happy with Windows 7. &nbsp;I could tell that many or most people hated Windows 8. &nbsp;SO I was smart and never tried Windows 8. &nbsp;Little did I know that Windows 10 would be the disaster that it has become.</p>

            I simply logged in as administrator. It said "your organization requires that you change your password." As a new password, I supplied the same password as before, confirmed it, and it was accepted. Now I need to stop having to reset my password. "My organization"
 is just me...

    <title>Lost gamertag and email access to account. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lost gamertag and email access to account.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, &nbsp;I have had a gamertag for about 3 years but the email address attached to it has now been replaced meaning that when I came to sign in today the email account is no longer recognized as a Microsoft address meaning that I can no longer do a password
 reset or log in using those details. &nbsp;I set up an alternative email address so I thinking that I would be able to use this to do a password reset would be fine but this does not work either. &nbsp;I need to access my account to link my old gamertag to my new email
 but there appears no way to do this without access to the old account meaning that 3 years of gaming has been lost and 4 months of a live subscription has gone too.</p>
<p>I have attempted to log in using my old email address and the alternative but it says that they are not Microsoft accounts but when trying to set up a new account on that email address it says they are! &nbsp;Clearly something isn't right there to make this occur.</p>
<p>I would really like to pick up the phone and just speak to somone to sort this out but I don't get that as a support option so can someone point me in the right direction please or should I just accept that it's gone for good?</p>
<p>Thanks, Dan.</p>
