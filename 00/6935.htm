<h2>            I have forgotten my password. Help me sign in to my account</h2>
                    <p>6 days ago I created an Outlook account purely to use the OneNote Online service as part of a portfolio for my university finals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using the service intensely over the following 5 days, I needed to reboot my machine. Predictably I needed to sign-in again however I could not remember my password (I accept this is my fault entirely). Various attempts at guessing what it might be
 were fruitless. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As I'm aware you end up locked-out if you try an incorrect password too many times, I attempted to use the Account Recovery form. I completed the form with as much information as I could supply such as, Names, Date of Bith, Address Details, etc then clicking
 Next to be presented with another section of the form which included information I could not answer for example: 1) Old passwords -the account is 6 days old and doesn't have any previous passwords, 2) Information about emails sent -I've never used it as an
 email account, 3) Billing information/Xbox -I've never used any of the services that needed my credit card details with this account. Leaving these fields blank and pressing Next I was presented with the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"You didn't provide us with enough information to confirm your identity. Please complete more fields in addition to the ones you have currently completed."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The only missing fields related to information I couldn't provide as it didn't apply to this account. I re-ran the process anyway and this time I completed the password field with a couple of variations of what I remembered the old password to be, in the
 unlikely event the system was bias based and may have been able to consider close variations as close enough. Sure enough clicking Next let me proceed to a page notifying me that my account was being checked and I'd be notified of the result within the next
 24 hours. Within minutes I received an email notifying me the Recovery had failed, no doubt in part because of the incorrect information at the old password stage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke with a Microsoft Online advisor about this who whilst very polite could only supply me with a link containing tips of how to complete the form, which was of no use to me in this situation. He told me the Account Recovery form was the only option
 available to either myself or Microsoft to reset the password and seemed to conceed with me that if you could not add the information I could not provide, you had no way to recover your password and re-establish access to your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst I completely respect attempts to enhance security, this seems to highlight a potential major flaw with the Account Recovery system as it would seem if you have forgotten your password your only hope of recovery is if you have:</p>
<p>1) Changed your password in the past and can remember the old one, 2) Have used Outlook for emails, 3) Have used your billing credentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would seem anyone in my position is essentially limited to relying on their own memory to try and work out the password for themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other help or suggestions would be gratefully received.</p>

<h2>            How to convert hours &#38; minutes to 0&#58;00&#58;00</h2>
                    <p>This is a little embarrassing but I’m designing my own Music Library Database.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I belong to an online music club where I can listen to any artist/albumn you can think of in the world.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I wish to keep track (or Records) of which artists I daily play/listen to &amp; the time length.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Here’s the problem, the site where I download &amp; listen to music displays the albumn/CD in hrs &amp; mins, whereas I wish to imput them into my database as CD/Albumn length<span>&nbsp;
</span>I know thatAccess has an imput mask for CD/Albumn, but it’s not any good to me if I don’t know how to convert hrs &amp; mins into 0:00:00.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Might anyone have any suggestions?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I’m sorry for soundingstupid because I feel really stupid in asking</p>

            I'd agree with Scott that, if you are entering the time manually, the simplest solution is to use a column (field) of date/time data type and a suitable input mask.&nbsp; This will be fine for showing the individual times as it will cater for times less than
 24 hours, and even Wagner doesn't run to that, though the whole Ring cycle might get close!&nbsp; Where you would have a problem is if you wanted to aggregate the values, e.g. to sum the running times of all CDs by a particular artist or composer.&nbsp; If you sum date/time
 values you'll get strange results if the sum is 24 hours or more; this is because the date/time data type is really for storing points in time rather than durations of time.&nbsp; However, you can get round that by adding the following function to a standard module
 in the database:<br />
<br />
Public Function TimeElapsed(dtmTime As Date, _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Optional blnShowdays As Boolean = False) As String<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' Returns a date/time value as a duration<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' in format hh:nn:ss, or d:hh:nn:ss if optional<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' blnShowDays argument is True.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim lngDays As Long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strDays As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dim strHours As String<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' get whole days<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; lngDays = Int(dtmTime)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strDays = CStr(lngDays)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ' get hours<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; strHours = Format(dtmTime, "hh")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If blnShowdays Then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TimeElapsed = lngDays &amp; ":" &amp; strHours &amp; Format(dtmTime, ":nn:ss")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Else<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TimeElapsed = Format((Val(strDays) * 24) + Val(strHours), "00") &amp; _<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Format(dtmTime, ":nn:ss")<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End If<br />
<br />
End Function<br />
<br />
In a query for instance you could then return the sum of a CDlength column of date/time data type with:<br />
<br />
TimeElapsed(Sum([CDlength ))<br />
<br />
which would return the total time in the hours:minutes;seconds no matter how long it is.&nbsp; You'll see the function also includes an optional argument to return the value in days:hours:minutes;seconds, but in this context that wouldn't be appropriate of course.<br />
<br />
BTW, if you ever wanted the CD length&nbsp; in minutes just multiply the date/time value by 1440, which is the number of minutes in a day.&nbsp; A date/time value is actually a 64 bit floating point number in days under the skin.

<p>Why do I get message asking if I want to continue running scripts on a page?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10?</p>
<p>IE11 or Edge?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> If the message is basically... Script error do you want to debug...</p>
<p>Disable the warnings.</p>
<p>From IE&gt; Tools&gt; Internet Options&gt; Advanced...<br />
Check "Disable script debugging (Internet Explorer)" </p>
<p>and "Disable script debugging (Other)" </p>
<p>and uncheck "Display a notification about every script error."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It it's a "long running script" message</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.</strong> If this is happening only on one (or a few)&nbsp;website(s) there is probably some poorly implemented JavaScript on the page and IE is doing you a favor by providing the "Stop script" option. Click on the Stop script button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, if only&nbsp;a site or two are affected...</p>
<p>It might break a desirable feature on the site, but placing a site in Restricted Sites will disable JavaScript and the script messages will stop.</p>
<p>Internet Options. Security&gt; Restricted Sites...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're seeing the message on all or nearly all sites, a browser add-on might be causing it.</p>
<p>Note: The Google Toolbar has caused script problems for some users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start Internet Explorer without add-ons from Start&gt; Programs&gt; Accessories&gt; System tools&gt; Internet Explorer (no add-ons)<br />
or</p>
<p>from Start&gt; Run (or Windows logo key + r) type in <em>iexplore.exe -extoff </em>
</p>
<p><em>(iexplore.exe&lt;space&gt;-extoff)</em> then hit Enter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem goes away,&nbsp;an add-on is causing it. </p>

 &nbsp;I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling it without success, the problem was still there. &nbsp;I searched google and didn't find a solution, then I<strong> uninstalled a Windows Update for Office compatibility</strong> that was installed automatically and

<h2>            Office 2016 Traditional .msi &#40;Non click to run installer&#41;</h2>
                    <p>This query is about office 2016 installation.</p>
<p>After installing Microsoft Office 2016 Professional Plus on my machine, below are the entries present in the registry:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Office 16 Click-to-Run Licensing Component</p>
<p>2. Office 16 Click-to-Run Localization Component</p>
<p>3. Office 16 Click-to-Run Extensibility Component</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not getting product entries for the respective office components (For Example, Micorosft Word, Microsoft Excel,etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a possibility of acquiring office 2016 .msi full installer from a msdn or any other authentic source?</p>
<p />

<p>If you need to install Office 2016 without an active Internet connection, or if you're having problems with slow speed or tenuous connections, you can download the offline installer file and then install Office 2016 at your convenience. Go to the Wiki link
 above for instructions with pictures</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Start on the On the </span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=624746&amp;clcid=0x409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="My Account"><span>My Account</span></a><span> page, choose
<strong>Install</strong>.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p><span>Choose Language and install options.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p><span>Choose Download offline installer.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p><span>After you see a prompt to open or save the offline installer file, choose your preferred option.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p><span>If you choose <strong>Open</strong>, the file will download. Once the download is complete, you'll see a new virtual drive D that contains the Office installation files.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note </span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you already have another drive labeled D, Office will create a virtual drive with the next available letter.</span></p>
<p><span>If you choose <strong>Save</strong>, you can specify where you'd like the image (.IMG) file to be saved. For example, you can save it to your desktop or to a USB drive. On Windows 10 and Windows 8 machines, you can open the file directly.
 If you use Windows 7, you'll need to copy the image file to a disc before you can open the file and continue to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>Launch <strong>setup.exe</strong> to begin the offline installation. When you see the message,
<strong>You're all set</strong>, you can now access your Office applications.</span></p>
<p><span>The first time you run one of your Office applications, you'll receive a prompt asking you to enter your product key to activate the product. Since you already have a Microsoft account that's associated with Office, choose
<strong>Sign in with an active account instead</strong>.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in">
</p><p><span>Enter your email address, and then choose <strong>Next</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note </span></strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure the email address and Microsoft account you use is the same one you used previously.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 issues</h2>
                    <p>I have installed Windows 10 32bit technical preview on an i5 Intel NUC and found that, whilst quicker than Windows 7 - is&nbsp;not without issues</p>
<p>1. I have found that it is incompatible with Piriform Speccy (which I am aware is not MS problem)</p>
<p>2. It appears incompatible with Office 365, but Office 2010/32 installed EVENTUALLY !!</p>
<p>3. There is no Windows update - despite obviously being totally out of date </p>
<p>4. I hate the TILES and&nbsp;believe that MS should offer a classic option</p>
<p>5. Why has MS decided to put an Xbox icon on the tiles ? How many people use Xboxes - please think before offering us these options - I have deleted it....</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Why force ONEDRIVE on&nbsp;us -&nbsp;I do my own back ups - locally.</p>
<p>7. WiFi loses connection at reboot - forcing me to manually reconnect every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from these - good show, so far......</p>

<p>There are 50 pages of Windows 10 update errors - So I am guessing that I am not alone with this error</p>
<p>Why doesn't MS admit to making a <strong>MAJOR </strong>mistake with this and possibly hold off on the general release of Win 10 for a while ?</p>
<p>Instead of trying to fob us off with various "fixes" such as REINSTALL Win 10 !!!</p>
<p>This will cause extreme&nbsp;hassle to millions of users who will, for some reason, update early ...</p>
<p>This is a real shame - because Win 10 appears to be quick and possibly the version of Windows&nbsp;that was missed in Win 8/8.1</p>

            <p>Steeboo, have you tried downloading the missing or defective/corrupt drivers from the manufacturers e.g. Intel, Realtek, etc manufacturers?&nbsp; Also the system manufacturers, HP, Dell, Toshiba, etc. also have interactive, driver finders&nbsp;which can quickly identify
 what files are needed to bring, or keep current the drivers that can help your machine to run while operating their systems with Windows 10.&nbsp; If you need further assistance after trying these fixes, please repost here or go to win10epicfail.proboards.com,
 and we can probably help you there.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            how to unlink contacts with the same email address</h2>
                    <p>I have several instances of contacts who share the <strong>same email address</strong>, but different first names.&nbsp; I want to RETAIN the contacts with TWO entries.&nbsp; Outlook has "linked" them.&nbsp; I tried to UNLINK with information from "outlook help" and instead
 it deleted one of the entries.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to add back the second entry, but outlook will not accept it as a separate entry, it continues to combine them.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I search on a first name, the other persons entry comes up, so I cannot "address the email"&nbsp; to the person I want.&nbsp; I realize
 this is the same email address, but I used to be able to keep communications separate with the two contact entries.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to&nbsp;keep the two entries separate?</p>

<p>Might sound like a silly question but have you turned the ear piece volume up, you can only do this when on a call. ring a friend and while on the call turn up the volume using the volume buttons just above the Nokia logo on the phone, if you have already
 tried this then thats all I can say.</p>

            Look, I don't mean to sound unkind but the advice you just gave is totally useless and completely off point.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with AlcSteel's Windows 10 installation, just as there is nothing wrong with mine; everything is working perfectly so
 we don't need to do any file-checking or other system repair type of operations - our Windows 10 OS&nbsp;has no operational problems whatsoever.&nbsp; We just need practical advice&nbsp;about how&nbsp;share a link&nbsp;using the "circle" icon&nbsp;in either Outlook 2013 or, in my case,
 directly to a Microsoft Community post on a web page (such as I'm using here).&nbsp; Neither of us use the Mail app nor do we need to; both of us use Outlook 2013.&nbsp; Please just tell us how to use the share feature to embed a link to either an Outlook email or a
 post in a MS Community Forum like this one; that's pretty simple and really all we're asking for here.&nbsp; Standing by for a truly helpful answer...

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had issues with this. Whenever I tried clicking the 'mail' link in the sharing module, the blue screen would keep displaying.</p>
<p>However, when I tried it just now, it was working. When clicking 'mail', an overview of my email accounts is shown (Outlook 2013 and accounts from the mail app).</p>
<p>When selecting an account, an email editor shows, and you should be able to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take care</p>

            <p>You may have swerved into something here, quite to my surprise! When I just tried it out (per Wouter's post above),&nbsp;lo &amp; behold it suddenly gave me the choice to add some different mail accounts, among those my Outlook 2013 account (via the POP3 option)
 and my Hotmail account. The crazy thing is that like so many others here before, I tried to do this numerous times and the only option I had was the built-in "Windows Mail" app.&nbsp; Somebody, somewhere must have been listening and activated this new &amp; improved
 feature.&nbsp; However, I still can't discover how to use it to embed a URL in these (or other) posts in "real time" or to bring-back the initial configuration screen to add even more accounts - at this point it seems kind of like a one-shot deal, but&nbsp;surely that's
 not the case. Hopefully it's just a matter of finding out how to do it rather then actually not being able to do it.&nbsp; Anyway, this is indeed a small step in the right direction.</p>
<p>I would welcome other folks here to try and experiment with this to see if they can come-up with even more solutions to this rather strange turn of events...</p>

            I am in Travis's boat.&nbsp; It works fine on Windows 10 mobile, but it does not show the Outlook mail in the shared link from Edge on PC and tablets.&nbsp; Edge on mobile behaves differently from PC and tablets.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ruth's solution to this is not revelant.&nbsp; I believe
 that Microsoft should send a fix to give users to have options to choose either Windows mail or Office's Outlook from Edge shared link for PC and tablet. Cheers!

                    <p>I am sick and tired of every other download just stopping at varying points during the download. It could be at any point, ie 25% / 51% / 99 % etc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not have these issues with IE8 and since going back to IE8 the problems with the same downloads have gone so it MUST be an issue with IE9. Whats going on with it? IE9 is so unreliable and when you have to monitor the amount you download and then you
 get to 99% and lose the download thats a lot of data you have wasted on a download you lost!!!!!!</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Do you have any security software installed on the computer?</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 1</span></u></b></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Check
 if any add-ons installed on the Internet explorer is causing the issue. </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>I
 would suggest that you try opening Internet explorer in the no add-ons mode and check if the issue persists.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click the Start button, click All Programs and click Accessories</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click System Tools, and then click Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</span></span></span></p>
<p><b><span>How to manage add-ons in Internet Explorer 9</span></b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-to-manage-add-ons-in-Internet-Explorer-9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><b><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-to-manage-add-ons-in-Internet-Explorer-9</span></b></span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 2</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then
</span><span><span>try resetting
</span></span><span><span><span>the internet explorer settings to default and check</span></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>For more information refer the link below.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Reset Internet Explorer 9 settings</span></b></p>

<p><span><b><span>Important</span></b></span><span><span><span>:
 Reset Internet Explorer to its default configuration. This step will also disable any add-ons, plug-ins, or toolbars that are installed. Although this solution is quick, it also means that, if you want to use any of those add-ons in the future, they must be
 reinstalled.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><u><span>Method 3</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then temporary disable the security software and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important:
</span></b><span><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus
 software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable
 to attacks.</span></span></p>
<p><span><b><span>Disable antivirus software</span></b></span></p>

    <title>Install Office 2016 OEM without Live account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian d. hart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install Office 2016 OEM without Live account</h2>
                    <p>I manage IT services for several small businesses and periodically need to purchase new computers with Office. I just purchased a new Dell laptop with the OEM version of Office 2016 Home &amp; Business. It will not let me activate it without adding it to a MS
 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is a perennial question, beginning with Office&nbsp;2013, that is a major headache for independent technical consultants that support small businesses, as I do. But I have never seen a solid answer as to how to get this installed on the computer without
 the MS account--just a lot of try this, try that. This is NOT Office 365, just Office H &amp; B 2016!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I will not:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Add it to my MS account, or it will be forever stuck to me--which is inappropriate, since I will not own the computer or software once I am paid for the system by my client.</li><li>Make&nbsp;my client set up a MS account just for this.</li><li>Pry into my client's information to get his MS account information (if he even has one).</li></ul>
<p>But I must have Office installed, activated, and updated before I give the system to my client. The activation dialog, in fact, gives me the option of using a product key instead of a login, but then proceeds to "Redeem Online"--which I believe will end
 up with the same result that requires a MS account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, I now have a bigger issue. I backed up the Program Data folder that contains the cached Office installation files, then uninstalled MS Office, hoping that a reinstall would give me some option to truly install without being forced to figure
 out a MS account for my client. The uninstallation removed the original setup folders.&nbsp;Good thing I backed it up, but then when I reinstall from any of those, it installs Office 2013, not Office 2016. And while it still validates the key when I click the option
 to use a key instead of a logon, it (as before) takes me to "Redeem Online".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello, Microsoft: this issue alone has just&nbsp;eliminated my entire profit from this project, given the time I have already spent trying to get this done, then uninstalling and attempting to reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there are versions that can be activated without a MS account, but I do not buy in bulk and can never seem to figure out which is which.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get this installed for my client without being required to use a MS account?</p>

            <p>Sushma,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't helpful at all. &nbsp;What Brian said is spot on. &nbsp;My company is an IT consulting company for many small businesses. &nbsp;We order computers from many vendors such as Dell which has OEM licensing. &nbsp;I cannot activate office with my Microsoft account, nor
 should I. &nbsp;And I cannot setup Microsoft accounts for all of my clients. &nbsp;This is time consuming and frankly a waste of time. &nbsp;We should not have to do this. &nbsp;We sell hundreds of computers a year, and can't possibly force my clients to create a Microsoft Account
 for their office license. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That link did not help at all. &nbsp;There needs to be a fix immediately. &nbsp;Otherwise the giant of Microsoft will suffer great losses in sales. &nbsp;I think that many IT companies like mine will start looking at alternate products at this point. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So please help us to help keep you in business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p><br />
Alex</p>

            <p>I totally agree, the OEM activation process is an absolute nightmare.&nbsp; And even if you're able to setup or access a client's MS Live account, good luck trying to identify which licenses are tied to which devices.&nbsp; There's also a limit on the number of license
 registrations per account (don't recall what it is, think it's maybe 10 or so?) which often requires creating an additional account(s) to handle all of the licenses.&nbsp; So now, you also have to maintain a spreadsheet or some kind of documentation of what licenses
 are tied to which device and which registration account...&nbsp;&nbsp; it's a huge PITA.&nbsp; After all this, then you pray you never have to reinstall office at some point in the future...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that Dell's (and I think HP's) OEM Office keys were able to activate without an account, but right now, computers that are shipping with Office 2016 license have the 2013 CTR installation and you're forced to go through the Live account registration
 process to get 2016 installed.&nbsp; Maybe this will change once the 2016 OPK is out and Dell gets that into their base image - not sure how long this will be though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't anything new, it's been this way beginning with Office 2013 and continues with 2016.&nbsp; Microsoft has pretty much ignored all complaints related to this and I suspect they really don't care as they continue to beat the O365 drum and march everyone
 towards a subscription model (and having a MS Live account gives them a great hook into these customers).&nbsp; Makes one wonder if this OEM activation mess isn't largely by design...</p>

            <p>I posted over on the Office 365 forum as Sushma suggested but got only a list of which products require which type of account (personal or private). That again missed the point entirely (if not downright avoiding it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is nice to know I am not the only one beginning to suspect that the activation difficulties may be intentional. Of course, it affects the independent&nbsp;consultant far worse than anyone else. Larger companies can take their
<em>soma</em> (with a nod to Huxley's <em>Brave New World</em>) and have no problem setting up corporate accounts; single-user companies that do their own software have little choice and must do the same or set up the MS account in the owner's (or user's) name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the outside consultant that provides service and computers to small businesses is peculiarly stuck. We cannot use our own accounts, or the licenses are stuck to us forever. We are not about to share our Live IDs &amp; passwords with someone trying to reinstall
 Office on a computer we originally provided. But the owner's birthday is also none of our business--and not easily obtainable at midnight even if it were. And what if a computer (or the entire business, with its computers) is sold? How does the new owner reinstall
 Office if required? I guess that is one way for MS to generate more revenue--make the activation process quirky enough that it is actually easier to just buy a fresh copy than it is to reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several hours of beating one's head against the wall on this at midnight, it definitely leads one to feel as though Microsoft has more sinister designs towards independent consulting--or perhaps toward independent thought entirely.</p>

            <p>I am in exactly the same boat. This impacts 90% of my clients. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To make matters worse, Microsoft seems to think everyone has gigabits of bandwidth lying around waiting to be used. The loss of SBS is now giving me huge headaches as older SBS2008 machines reach their end of life. I have a number of clients, businesses
 of 8-12 people in remote areas with diabolical internet, &lt;3mbps down, &lt;400kbps up yet they are expected to move their email to the cloud? At least SBS meant email trickled in and out in the background, it was slow but workable. There is no way I can expect
 these clients to suffer through miserable email speed as well as a 1GB download per PC to install office as well as the Microsoft ID issue, nor are they willing to stump up the considerable costs in licencing to run full blown Exchange internally.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also wondering how MS thinks small businesses operate? There is usually regular staff turnover so MS ID's per user are not viable. If we move those with decent internet links to Office 365 then the licences can be transferred to other users but as mentioned
 above, this is not always possible. There is also no way they will be prepared to spend three times the cost per seat for volume licencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been creating a generic Microsoft ID (literally microsoftid@clientdomain) as an alias on an existing account (usually the admin account that I have access to, a generic birthdate and the business owners mobile number ) to activate Office Home and
 Business so I can download and install on my 70mbps connection. I have not yet had any issues but also have not connected more than 5-6 activations to any one account. When that happens, it will require microsoftid2@clientdomain etc. A few things concern me
 though, also my clients, such the privacy and security off all these PC's making direct connections to MS cloud services under the one account. Users are being told to only save data to internal file servers but there does appear to be some two way history
 that sometimes comes through to another machine such as recent files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For non-business users, I simply hand them a licence key card and tell them that unfortunately for reasons outside my control, I cannot install this for them unless they trust me with their MS ID login, they will need to do it themselves and if they dont
 have a Microsoft ID, they will need to create one or move to the free Libre Office if it has enough functionality for what they need.</p>

            <p>For what it is worth, when I took Sushma's original suggestion and posted to the Office 365 forum here:
<a href="https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/156/t/412487," target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/156/t/412487,</a> it began another thread just like this one--accompanied by a MS support response that dodged the question by pointing to which products
 require which types (personal/corporate) MS accounts. Not a word of which products, if any, might allow activation by product key only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For sure, buying retail (if even that can be activated w/o an account in 2016 versions as it was in 2013) will be cheaper than OEM, at least from my time-lost perspective (i.e. considering all the extra wasted time I spend trying to figure out and babysit
 the OEM licensing process now). Of course, I cannot charge my clients for my headaches or extra time involved, but I will charge them the extra for retail. The loss of time for me is just too significant for me to risk repeating this beating-head-against-wall
 over OEM licensing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In last night's debacle, I finally just gave up on OEM 2016, bought a retail copy of 2013 H &amp; B online from a retailer that still carries it, and this activated w/o a MS account. I guess I will just keep the 2016 for when I get a new computer and can put
 it on my own MS account. But that is not something I can repeat regularly.</p>

            <p>Just to make your opinion of the system even better, it is not just OEM, you cant activate Office 2016 Retail without an MS live ID either. You could with 2013 but you cannot even buy Office 2016 with installation media , it is just a product key card and
 you cannot even download it, let alone activate it without a Live ID. At least not here in Australia.</p>

            <p>OEM keys that come with Dell laptops are asking for Microsoft Accounts to be created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I refuse to do this, if I order 200 new computers I am not making 200 MS accounts, nor am I going&nbsp;to pile them all into one account because we'd never know which key went to which machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was on the phone with Office subscriptions, Presales and Licensing, Professional Support, the Product Activation Department, a Partner technical router, and then someone else who took my name/number and then dropped the call&nbsp;and didn't call me back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the teams told me that these keycodes in the box are flagged as RETAIL and not OEM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But regardless, this is a huge problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can't activate these machines on a one-by-one basis, no sane IT department would undertake the task of creating discrete Live accounts for each and every new machine they get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus the whole point of licensing @ the machine purchase is to cover the DEVICE not a PERSON.&nbsp; That's what OEM licensing is supposed to be.</p>

            <p>Very glad I opened this thread, now. I thought maybe I was missing some simple workaround or was the only one bothered by all of this nonsense. As one user posted, it seems that the same applies to the retail license the same as OEM. So even if using a corporate
 MS account to activate these office licenses en masse, what happens when you sell a batch of old computers three years from now, along with the Windows &amp; legitimate Office license, as part of a rotating replacement plan? How does the new user, wanting to clean
 up the computer, after&nbsp;wiping &amp; reinstalling Windows, then reinstall Office on the same computer without your corporate activation account? Sure, I'm going to give my corporate MS account information to Uri's Used Computer sales so they can use the license
 they legitimately purchased with the used computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is obvious this is obnoxious behavior from Microsoft. Not sure&nbsp;if they are mean, or just stupid.&nbsp;But the big question is whether we can get Microsoft to reconsider this obnoxious behavior? Their tech support has no say over how things are done. Is there
 anybody at Microsoft that actually cares what the customer thinks? Have they finally just said, "Well, we have them now. Time to force everyone to drink the green Kool-Aid to prove their loyalty?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe MS will get the picture if Dell's (and HP, etc, etc) business sales start falling off. For sure, I will not be buying Office 2016 on any new computers from Dell. I would rather purchase 2013 retail as long as I can still find it. At least,&nbsp; with that,
 I already have the downloaded installation media and know I can still activate it purely with the product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it is not even a question of price. I have always said, "If you want to use a Microsoft product, you have to pay the price." But all of this account-based activation puts it over the top for me, and I can just save a bundle of money by switching to a
 free product. I am seriously considering "Goodbye Microsoft, hello, LibreOffice..."

    <title>Outlook 2007 not receiving all emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lauralyn8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook 2007 not receiving all emails</h2>
                    I'm using Outlook 2007 with Win 7. No e-mail scanner. This started a few months ago, but before this I didn't have any problems. My inbox won't receive all messages sent to it, but others, even from the same email host will be received. My co-worker will
 receive all of them(we both use Outlook 07), so it's not a problem with the server. I created a test message and sent it to my business email, which my co-worker does not get, and I will still not receive it. Even email forms of the same type that get sent
 to me, half I will get, the other half I won't, but my co-worker will get all of them. I don't even know where to start with this problem. I haven't messed with the settings ever, so I don't know what happened. Any direction on how to solve this would be wonderful.
 Thanks!<br />

            Well, I think it's the program itself. My email is also forwarded to other people and they have no problem receiving the ones I don't get. It's e-mail from different domains. It's really random. I work for a college and our students submit forms to us.
 It is the same form, but with different information in it each time. Half the time I get these, the other half I don't. The same ones are forwarded to other people and they get all of them.<br />

            <p>If they were not backed up to onedrive you can not easily&nbsp;recover the pictures. There are some utilities available that say they can do this, I never have used any.</p>
<p>The most important thing is where were the pictures saved to, the phone or an SD card,</p>
<p>Use only name brand SD cards. Paying more is worth it.</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that the device is locked with a particular network provider. In order to use it with a SIM from a different subscriber, you have to contact the original network provider and they would be the one to provide the unlock codes.</p>

            <p>If the phone was SIM locked, there would be a message saying so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>endetion, do you have a Dual SIM phone – what happens when you place the SIM into the other slot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your case sounds like a hardware issue. Is the SIM detected at all by the phone? If not, either the SIM is faulty or the SIM card holder. However, when a local inspection already determined a hardware issue, you face a hardware issue. In that case, you have
 to bring that phone to your point of sale (retailer). Then, your retailer either refunds you or rejects the claim. Looking at the 2nd-hand-market prize of a Nokia Asha 502, even bringing that phone to your retailer might be a total financial loss. Therefore,
 I would go for another phone. If you need buyer’s advice, please say so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to refurbish the firmware, to make sure it is not a software issue, please, continue

<h2>            Office 365&#58; OneNote 2016 PowerPoint Sub-pages, Refresh Results Tag Summary and Embedding Files</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have been trying to find the answers to the following questions online and have been unsuccessful. Can someone please help?!?!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When I import a presentation, it is not showing the "</span><span>sub-pages</span><span>" for each slide like it is supposed to. I have looked in options to see if there is a default
 setting to change. I have found nothing online either.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the Tag Summary, when I click on "Refresh Results" it duplicates everything. What is the point of the "Refresh Results" option in on the Tag Summary page?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>How do you embed files to update the source file as well? I understand OneNote gives you only a static copy of the file; however, in the training manual I am going through it states you can embed Excel and Visio files. The training
 manual does not explain how to do this. I read online you can link the files. Of course, the training manual I have does not explain how to do this either.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are able to embed only Excel and Vision, it does not make sense you cannot do other Microsoft files too. What am I missing?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Kindly respond with understandable instructions. I have a comprehension and cognitive disability. I am struggling through the training manual and you have no idea how frustrating this is for me ~ Thanks!</span></p>

 with the activity. It is doing it on both notebooks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, one of my questions was pertaing to embeddng other files. I am everything importing from my laptop.

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for porting in our forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We understand you would like to know if any app on an iPad can be used to take notes and save it directly to SharePoint online. From my research, I
 don’t see any information about integration between SharePoint online and GoodNotes.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since you want to use an app which can take notes and save them to SharePoint online, in this case you can use Microsoft Office apps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On your iPad, you can install SharePoint and Office apps and use Microsoft Word to take notes and then save it directly to SharePoint online</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To install SharePoint app on an iPad, see

            So you're suggesting a user should change their behavior to accommodate Msft? If they want to use Goodnotes, how about offering options that may allow them to do that? I'd first ask what file format Goodnotes uses to check whether you can save those files
 in SP.<br />

<p>Hi CaraJohnson1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am writing to follow up on this case. Did you check above reply? If you still need help, please update us when you have time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@ webbrewers3, Office apps can be saved/opened to/from OneDrive for business/ SharePoint online directly. We don’t have to navigate to cloud location in browser to open Office files, we can do this task from within the Office apps. You can preview hundreds
 of file types in SharePoint online and I believe Goodnotes documents should be one of them. But Goodnotes is a third-party app and it can’t save or open the document directly like it does in Office apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Goodnotes document file type is supported in ODFB/SharePoint online, then they can be stored and shared. Here’s an

    <title>Permanently change cell format to preferred format in Excel&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Permanently change cell format to preferred format in Excel&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had one too many miserable experiences with the answer desk chat support system so I'm going to try here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if there is a way to permanently set the cell format to my preferred format so that when I create a new worksheet it will automatically enter all typed/imported information in a certain format? When I export from our POS program it automatically
 changes all numbers with /'s to decimals. For example when exporting certain reports that include shoe sizes (7/8 or 6.5) it will change them to date and when I edit the cell format to the desired format it does not change it back to the size in the report
 but instead a decimal. I would like to find a setting or something I can change so that all files imported into Excel will have the cell format permanently be set at text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please if anyone has an knowledge on this I would love some help since I can't seem to get any from the actual company. Thank you for your time.</p>

            <p>It could be achived by creating a default template with the set format and fonts.

            <p>Disclaimer:&nbsp; I don't have Excel 2013 so possibly some of the below may have changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming your POS program exports the data as a text file, and you Open it in Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think that will work.&nbsp; When you "Open" a file, Excel parses the data according to some internal algorithm, and changing the format after won't fix things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of "Open"ing the file in Excel, you should "Import" the file.&nbsp; In Excel 2007-2010, that tab is on the Data ribbon / Get External Data group.&nbsp; (I don't know where it is in Excel 2013).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you do that, Excel gives you the opportunity to specify the data format for each imported column by first opening the Text Import Wizard.<br />

<h2>            Trial and old version</h2>
                    <p>I installed a trial version of Microsoft 2016 in order to use Microsoft Publisher. This was on my mac. I did not realize that Publisher does not work on a Mac so I immediately deleted it and am currently using the trial on a PC at work. Once I deleted the
 trial applications from my mac the old version of Microsoft I have (2011) is no longer working. This error message comes up:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3210fb06-bea1-4741-80b2-f2edb468cf1b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3210fb06-bea1-4741-80b2-f2edb468cf1b" /></a></p>
<p>I can't find my CD for the software. What can I do?</p>
<p>
