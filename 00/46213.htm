<h2>            Upgrade RAM or HDD or ReadyBoost for best performance&#63; Win7 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hallo. I have a 1 year old laptop which runs like a slug compared to my old laptop. It got so bad last year that the manufacturer replaced the HDD and we're just going through the same process because after working OK for a while, it went back to its old
 ways.&nbsp; My old laptop runs Vista Business SP2 32 bit, Centrino Core Duo @ 2.2GHz with 4GB of RAM. It gives a Windows Experience Index of 3.8 however it feels like greased lightning compared to my new Windows 7 Pro 64 bit Core i7 @2.7GHz with 6GB RAM and a WEI
 of 5.7. I'm using Office 2010 on the new one and 2007 on the old one.</p>
<p>But, frankly, the performance on the new one is demonstrably slower than the new one: opening browsers, Office applications, Outlook (which appears to hog resource as per usual when sending / receiving). I would have thought the WEI should be the other way
 round. It was disappointing because I went for every "go fast" option I could like a greedy kid in a sweet-shop when ordering and got a slug instead of the high-performer I was hoping for.</p>
<p>I've even got 16GB of ReadyBoost on the new one which doesn't seem to have a major effect (but then I only found out how to get the USB stick to be more than 4GB today thanks to another post on a forum here - thanks).</p>
<p>The manufacturer is being helpful with some good though lengthy support.&nbsp; Everything passes all diagnostics. The 500GB HDD is used 179 / free 271GB so that should have plenty of room.&nbsp;The only thing I have notcied is in Resource Monitor where the "Highest
 Active Time on the Disk goes to 100% and sticks there with Response times going into multiple seconds (yes, thousands of milliseconds.). It looks as if this may be associated with the updating or syncing or indexing of a network drive which I have set to be
 "always available offline" but that's largely guesswork looking at the lines in Resource Monitor.</p>
<p>Sorry quite a long intro but the actual question I am&nbsp;asking is how to get better performance? I think there are three options:</p>
<p>1) Increase the RAM from 6GB to how much? (and yes, I'll do it in matched pairs)</p>
<p>2) get more ReadyBoost - again how much?</p>
<p>3) Swop the HDD for a SSD version.</p>
<p>What have I missed, what would you suggest and any useful diagnostics?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Of the 3 options an SSD will give the most noticeable improvement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Memory increases have diminishing returns and quite significantly so even a hike to 12GB would not be as good as the increase from 2GB (64 bit minimum) to 6GB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Readyboost I have never seen any significant benefit and is mostly aimed at a system with minimum spec.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use MSConfig to look at what is preloading in the startup&nbsp;tab and get rid of the non essentials. There are lots of complaints about the big antivirus suites slowing systems down, if you have one look at the modules that load and see which ones are really
 not needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It takes a little interpreting but instead of Resource Monitor get Process Explorer from SysInternals to get a better idea of what is slowing the system down although from recollection you may have already seen it with the offline files option. Make sure
 the network store only has what you are actually going to want in offline mode to minimise the replication process.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. This behaviour was seen shortly out of the box with a fresh factory PC (back end 2011) and again after a replacement HDD just under a year ago (May 2012) and again over the past couple of months. Last year, I found some references to
 very similar reports with HDD issues and also the 4 core CPU but I didn't bookmark them!</p>
<p>But to respond to detail, I normally use MSE for system protection once the Norton runs out.. It updates automatically and I scan regularly. In this case, the support person installed and ran: SuperAntiSpyware, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware, CCleaner, Rkill
 and TDSSkiller. Just a few ad tracking&nbsp;cookies found - nothing malware at all.</p>
<p>Thanks for the info on ReadyBoost, I thought it was a bit OTT but I had a 16GB stick handy so tried it anyway.

            <p>OK thanks. SSD noted. I'll look at Process Explorer but this is over my tech level such as it is. I already checked through MSConfig and used Iolo System Mechanic (as that's promoted by and available through the PC manufacturer) - marginal gains. I've also
 run chkdsk /f twice and no faults found, also the manufacturer diagnostics all check out 100%</p>
<p>The whole thing is strange because both my old and new laptops have mostly the same applications and environment including the offline drive access (they're both "my" work machines so that's logical) and yet the high spec newer one is slower than the old
 one. </p>
<p>I'm just re-syncing my old laptop to the same offline network drive so I can check the Resource Monitor data simultanously on both machines. From memory it was the same a year ago so worth checking to make sure I'm remembering correctly.</p>

            <p>About the only other thing I can think of is the fact that it is HP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not that there is anything specifically wrong with the hardware, just that they used to be top in the list for crapware preloaded. It was a policy to wipe them down and make our own load for them, that was even quicker than trawling the Programs and Features
 list and more effective.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your advice, Ken. The problem is that CCleaner was installed by and run to fix registry by the Dell support person. And Iolo System Mechanic is also part of the system care process available from Dell. So if you want to get their support, you
 sort of have to go through their process.</p>
<p>I agree with you on Norton. I have had more issues with their apps over the years (and McAfee) than I care to recount and I have been mostly very happy with MSE so it's my av/protection of choice. Again, the PCs are supplied with NAV as installed by Dell
 so I tend to leave it exactly as supplied until expiry, then ditch it. Otherwise, it's just an excuse for the manufacturer to avoid support (because you changed the config as supplied).</p>
<p>If I have to do a replace HDD and clean install, that will be the 3rd time since August 2011 and, frankly it's getting tiresome (used to be a lot quicker with MS-DOS).</p>
<p>I've taken note of your advice and HairyFool to, in a nutshell, avoid snake-oil and plump for SDD so thanks for that, but does anyone know of anything more forensic than just reinstall? I'm suspecting some design issue with the hardware and disk but the
 only benchmark I have is my old XPS which beats this thing into a cocked hat. How to prove this to Dell or Intel or MS is my issue.</p>

            <p>Thanks. I understand your POV. Ockham's Razor is usually right and snake-oil never delivers (along with the risk of unintended consequences).</p>
<p>Next time round, I'll just uninstall NAV(or not bother to reinstall) and stick with MSE (works for me) or maybe one of the others you suggest.
</p>
<p>But I digress. Can I come back to the main point of "this supposed high spec laptop runs like a slug". If 6GB is "enough" RAM and ReadyBoost is approximately irrelevant for this spec then how come this spec performs objectively and subjectively slower (not
 just in things like mouse movements and windows opening) but also so badly that when the browser window (or Word or Outlook) stalls so as to be unresponsive to mouse wheel movements that the only cure is to do something else while it sorts itself out (can
 take a few seconds to tens of seconds or more), what should I do?</p>
<p>I'm awaiting Dell 2nd level support tomorrow and don't have an issue with them as they were helpful last time and have been helpful again this time. But I will be a bit disconsolate if we end up with the "don't know why it's doing it but we'll replace the
 HDD and then you can spend a month reinstalling everything and tweaking so it's back the way it was to see if that works" approach as I did that twice already. Actually I don't mind doing it as long as we know what the problem is and how to cure it.</p>
<p>Other than WEI, is there a useful performance benchmark suite that could provide some useful metrics?</p>
<p>Is there anyone who knows what "HAT" is and why it should go to 100% and is this normal?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the inconvenience you are facing currently.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Since when are you facing this issue?</li><li>Did you install any software recently?</li></ul>
<p><span>As of now, you may right click on that process and click on “end task” to stop that process and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Further, y<span>ou may boot the computer in a clean boot state </span>
</span></span>to avoid any third party software conflict<span><span><span>&nbsp;and check if the issue persists.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue persist, I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if this helps:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Uninstall and re-install the drivers.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong><span>: I suggest you to uninstall the Audio drivers and then install them.</span></p>

<h2>            DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION, Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sorry if it's not the place for this topic, but I'm having this problem. I know it happens to a lot of you, and I was reading a lot of topics, but I just couldn't find a solution. So I get this Blue screen of Death whenever I try to Add a new printer, I
 can't use my printer, it just doesn't work, so when I'm trying to add it - it just freezes, so basically I can't print right now and I will need it in short time and it freezes when I try to add a new device. Also I had Blue screen when I tried to update CyberGhost,
 but when I ran as administrator - it updated. Also I was getting Blue screen back in Windows 8 when I would try to install LogMeIn Hamachi, when it didn't work I tried Tunngle, but it was no luck. Haven't tried it on Windows 10. I'm just hoping that someone
 could help me out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Minidump file:</p>
<p>http://1drv.ms/1OoDxXi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a gaming laptop MSI GT70 2PE Dominator Pro, </p>
<p>NVIDIA GTX880M as well with Intel HD Graphics 4600, </p>
<p>Killer Ethernet E2200, </p>
<p>Realtek, </p>
<p>Intel Core i7-4810MQ.<br />
</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure BSOD is caused by drivers, but I just don't how to get to the bottom of it, in MSI Drivers section I can't even choose Drivers for Win10, only for Win8 and Win8.1.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Big thanks to whoever tries to help.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS, chipset drivers, and major<br />
drivers. That error can also be caused by incompatible 3rd party antivirus<br />
and other startup programs and drivers. Of course there are other possibilities.<br />

<br />
If you had a 3rd&nbsp;party antivirus&nbsp;on the OS you upgraded OR if you&nbsp;have one<br />
now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender<br />
which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus.&nbsp;Despite&nbsp;all the hype&nbsp;out there<br />
Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are&nbsp;true superstars.<br />

<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
<br />
Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.<br />
<br />
When that completes run these :<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth<br />
<br />
DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
<br />
Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.<br />
<br />
Then restart the computer.<br />
<br />
Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS and drivers.<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates <br />
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>BIOS</strong>, <strong>low level chipset drivers</strong>, and the<strong> major on-board and separate&nbsp;<br />
device&nbsp;</strong><strong>drivers</strong>.&nbsp;Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update
<br />
those without&nbsp;Dump in&nbsp;their name.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current.&nbsp; Right Click Start Button -&nbsp;Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down
<br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t play streaming Recorded TV - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peted66616  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t play streaming Recorded TV</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to set up Windows media streaming, so that Recorded TV from the PC with the TV tuner can be watched on other Windows computers in the household. I have followed all the instructions in Windows Help, but cannot get it to work. While regular "Video"
 library files seem to work just fine, anything from the "Recorded TV" category plays back garbage, or doesn't play at all, depending on which client PC I'm using.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the PCs involved are running Windows 7 Ultimate. I've included a link to an example of what I see on one of the PCs when I try to play the video. On the other PC, Media Player shows an explicit error stating that the correct codec is not installed. I
 suspect/assume that there's some kind of missing codec even on the PC that doesn't show an error, but have no idea how to fix it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a sample of what the video looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://tinypic.com/r/15daqtf/5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tinypic.com/r/15daqtf/5</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why doesn't the host PC just transcode the video (at least optionally) to stream it in a format that can be played on the client?</p>

            <p>Opening using Media Player: yes. I thought the screen shot made that clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DRM'ed: they are recorded from encrypted cable TV service, with a CableCARD tuner. My cable TV provider marks some but not all shows as "Copy Protected", and the problem occurs with either type of show.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Browse and play: it depends on whether the show is marked as "Copy Protected". In either case, double-clicking on a file starts Windows Media Center; if the show is marked as "Copy Protected" I get the "Copying Prohibited" message, otherwise Windows Media
 Center itself is able to play the show.</p>

            <p>1. No, this is a problem that I have been trying to resolve off and on ever since I started using Windows Media Center. It's never worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. The problem happens with every "Recorded TV" file I've tried to play.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. There is no error message or code on one PC. Windows Media Player acts as though nothing is wrong, but displays a corrupted image (see screenshot I provided).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have access to the other PC at the moment, so I can't provide the exact message, but it says something about not having the correct codec installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. All of the files in the "Recorded TV" folder have the .wtv extension. I wasn't aware that Windows Media Center would even ever use any other extension.</p>

            <p>Do I have third-party decoders? Sure, probably. The computer came from the manufacturer with Adobe Premiere Elements and PowerDVD both preinstalled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't forget: there's another computer on which an error is reported, saying that no codec was available. That computer probably has no DVD playback software, and for sure not Premiere Elements.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see how the incorrect playback could be a matter of the wrong codec being used, but that doesn't really go to the root of the problem. More to the point is how to get the _right_ codec to be used, whether no codec at all is present or the wrong one
 is available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for converting to DVR-MS format, I have not done any conversion on these files. They are exactly as Media Center has recorded them from the TV tuner.</p>

            The same outcome occurs when double-clicking a .wtv file in Windows Explorer, whether that file is found on a network share or on a local disk.

            Hey Cynthia,
<br />
<br />This is likely a recovery partition brought into view in 1803, is drive D in This PC around 400 MB in size, and have you updated recently? If so, follow these instructions:
<br />
<br />You should remove its mapping, which we will refer to as D. Once you do this, it brings it back to its intended visibility, being hidden and out of sight. Once you do this, you won't be pestered with low disk space notifications anymore. You will need to remove the drive letter and mount point in DiskPart in order to do this.
<br />
<br />Hit Windows key + R together to go into Run. Type in the following: diskpart
<br />
<br />Enter the following in the new DiskPart window:
<br />
<br />select volume D
<br />remove letter=D
<br />
<br />Does not work after a reboot? Try entering this instead in an administrator session of Command Prompt: mountvol D: /D
<br />

            Hi Cynthia, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />In the second Command window, run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />select volume D
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />remove letter=D
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and restart your PC       
        </p>

<h3> eingram  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get mp3 files to play in the right order&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased an audio course in Spanish. It consists of 12 audio discs. I have converted the files to .mp3 so that I can burn them to one cd for use in my car player.&nbsp; (I am on the road a lot and find that an excellent use of my time to learn another
 language.)</p>
<p>My problem is that the lessons always come out in random order (no, I haven't set the player to shuffle, in case someone was going to suggest that)</p>
<p>I have tried renaming them like 1001, 1002,................1011, 1012, etc. but my computer seems to think that 1012 is a smaller number than 1001 because it always plays 1012 and then 1011 before 1001.</p>
<p>Am I being clear enough what the problem is?</p>
<p>I just want the files to play in the same order as the original cd's.</p>

=========================================<br />
I'm guessing you are creating a Data CD? When you view <br />
the directory of the burned CD do the MP3 files appear in <br />
the correct order?<br />

            I'm checking out the playing order on my computer before I burn a cd/mp3.<br />
I'm checking if I have renamed them correctly.<br />
Apparently 1012 is a smaller number in ASCII than 1001, because when I load the folder ( with the files listed in the correct order) into my player the 1012 plays first, followed by 1011, then 1001.<br />

OK...Thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
I realized you checked them "before" you burned the CD <br />
but what order are the files in "after" they are on the CD?<br />
<br />
I was wondering if the files were actually out of order on <br />
the CD or if the CD Player was at fault when reading them.<br />
<br />
Also what are the file extensions on the CD...MP3 or CDA?<br />
<br />
If you go to "Computer" and right click the drive letter of the <br />
drive the CD is in and choose...Open...you should be able <br />
to view the directory of the CD.<br />

            I haven't burned them yet.&nbsp; I said this so you wouldn't jump to the player as being at fault.<br />
I think it has to do with the fact that computers sort using an ASCII hierarchy, which is not like a standard numerical sort.<br />
They look to the most significant digit, then next most, and so on.<br />

================================================<br />
Sorry, apparently I did not understand the question. I thought the<br />
purpose for the task was to burn a CD that would play in the correct <br />
order on a CD Player. If the CD has not been burned we have no<br />
idea how the files would be sorted.<br />
<br />
Good luck finding an answer that works for you.<br />

            I have been having the same problems with mp3 music burns. I just tried loading a blanc cd then dragging the albums to the specified drive that had the blanc cd. I did notice that the albums are then listed in alphabetical order. I then edited the albums
 to be burned by adding a number/letter in front of the album name so that it would burn in the order I specified. Then clicked burn. It asked me if I wanted to burn regular cd or data. I selected data and it burned in the order I wanted. I have been VERY frustrated
 and was getting ready to purchase 3rd party software when I tried this as a last resort. It worked ! Hope this solves your problem. God Bless and good luck. Hope this works for you.

    <title>Missing Gears of War Collection Codes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cukar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Gears of War Collection Codes</h2>
                    <p>I purchased Gears of War 4 last October and was supposed to receive the Gears of War Collection (1, 2, 3, Judgement) codes if I played prior to December 31, 2016. I did in fact play the game then and purchased the game, so as I went to download the prior games today for some nostalgia I saw that I was only sent Gears of War 1 and 2 codes. I never received codes for the other two. They were supposed to be sent out as messages, but again, I only received messages containing codes for Gears 1 and 2, not 3 and Judgement.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Removed application stuck on update, cannot reinstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stuarteagles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removed application stuck on update, cannot reinstall</h2>
                    <p>The application in question is State of Decay 2, installed via the Windows Store, Windows current with all updates at time of writing;</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Win10Pro v1803 build 17134.81</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the basic setup;</p>
<p>3 drives C:(SSD), D:(HDD), E:(HDD) &lt;-- installed here<br />
<br />
I used the Application list move function to move the install to the SSD so it loaded quicker, all was good in the world.&nbsp; What I did not realise is this left all the registry and other Windows specific nick-nacks intact and just placed a hard symlink in the
 old directory location on the E: drive.&nbsp; So today, when I wiped that drive to install Linux (flavour not relevant) it wiped out that symlink.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into the windows store, it suggested I update, update failed.&nbsp; Not surprising.&nbsp; I tried to uninstall, that failed also.&nbsp; After some digging I found two Windows utilities `MicrosoftProgram_Install_and_Uninstall.meta.diagcab` and `Appsdiagnostic10.diagcab`
 which attempted to remove the app and fix the Windows Store Apps respectively.<br />
<br />
The state of play now is this;<br />
- There is no trace of any of the application files on the system `Microsoft.Dayton_x.xxxx.xx.x_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe`</p>
<p>- When searching for the application in the store it appears in the drop-down like any other uninstalled application (try search for an installed one, it will not appear in the drop-down)<br />
- When viewing the store page or app list, the only option available is `Update`, which fails<br />
- When I select `Get Updates` the store page displays the following...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok... now I am totally confused.&nbsp; At this point in writing this post I loaded up the store to get a screenshot of the oddness, the page saying all your trusted apps are up to date, yet with a pending update for SoD2.&nbsp; Yet this time, when I clicked update,
 and it failed, it showed an error "Could not connect to Microsoft Store", with a retry.&nbsp; Click retry and it showed ~24...~24Gb downloaded &gt; installing &gt; same fail message again.&nbsp; Then the update disappeared completely.&nbsp; Confused I went to the store page, and
 after 4 hours of fruitless trying to fix this issue it fixed itself randomly.<br />
<br />
So this post now becomes a question - does anyone out there have any bloody idea how it fixed itself???<br />
<br />
My suspiscion is that there was an update record stuck somewhere, unable to complete because of the path yet the presence of the pending update prevented the option to install from appearing.&nbsp; Unfortunately I have no way of verifying this any more.</p>

<h3> panda englisheducation  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 menu button, action centre and search buttons don&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I have a original copy of windows 7 ultra and upgraded to windows 10 once I was sent the upgrade invitation. I downloaded and installed windows 10 upgrade. My system says the windows 10 is activated BUT... The windows menu button doesn't work. I click on
 it and nothing happens. I press the windows key on the keyboard and nothing happens. I have tried powershell solution (as administrator) and as suggested, still nothing! I have searched the internet, watched several YouTube videos regard this problem and followed
 every one of them, nothing! I can't even roll back the windows 10 to give me the original windows 7 back because the windows 10 start menu button doesn't work at all. Further note: The window.old file is still in my computer, so the data is still there for
 recovery but can't access it.</p>

            <p>I did exactly what was instructed... everything is still exactly the same as before... nothing works...</p>
<p>I still don't have the windows start button or I can't use the property options, the action centre doesn't respond... Also, when I restart the computer, an error box appears before it closes down.... It won't let me copy or cut any files from the C: including
 the windows.old file (should I need it).... any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded a CD of the window 10 and I am about to try reinstalling... I might have to format my hard drive, which I hope I don't need to because my computer system is huge with a lot of specialty programs for my rat9 and strike7 keyboard (which took
 Madcatz assistants to install) and I am running a RAID 10 system.</p>

<br />
On my laptop, I tried using Cortana but it says "Cortana isn't supported in the region and language you've selected"... I clicked why? but the explanation says Cortana does speak English and she works in all the countries that apply to me... I also use a VPN

    <title>Screen corruption with Aero in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sydboy007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen corruption with Aero in Windows 7</h2>
                    I have a Dell E4200 with Intel HD4500 IG-FX.<br />
<br />
When I have aero turned on the screen slowly getts more corrupted.&nbsp; IT seems to be a problem around the boreder of a window - IE, FF, Word etc.<br />
<br />
Every so often parts of the screen will sort of squiggle and then it becomes hard to read text or see pictures.&nbsp; Video seems to be OK, but I think this is more to do with the image being constantly refreshed.<br />
<br />
If say IE or FF gets corrupted if I minimize and maximze is fixes the problem, or if i scroll the text sometimes that fixes it too.<br />
<br />
When I run in 16 bit mode none of these problems occurs.<br />
<br />
I'm running the latest Intel Drivers - 8.15.10.1986 - with nil improvement.<br />
<br />
Hopign someone has an idea as to what could be wrong.<br />

            Hi sydboy007,<br />
<br />
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Windows 7 Community site.<br />
<br />
Try the steps in the methods and check if it helped.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1 :</strong> <br />
<br />
Try booting your computer in <strong>Safe Mode </strong>:<br />
<br />
<strong>To boot into safe mode, follow the below steps:</strong> <br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.<br />
Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do one of the following:<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon
 prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER. For more information about options, see Advanced startup options (including safe mode).<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.<br />
<br />
When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of the display. To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let Windows start normally.<br />
<br />
Refer the below link for more details:<br />
<br />
Start your computer in <strong>safe mode</strong> <br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a>
<br />
<br />
If the screen works fine in <strong>Safe Mode</strong> then try performing <strong>
Clean Boot</strong> as some <strong>Third party software </strong>may be causing this<br />
issue to occur.<br />
<br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original behavior.<br />
<br />
<strong>Follow the below steps to put your computer in clean boot state:</strong>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note </strong>If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer
 unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.<br />
<br />
1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.<br />
<br />
2. Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
<br />
3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)<br />
<br />
4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.<br />
<br />
Note Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this
 if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.<br />
<br />
5. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
Check the below link for more details on <strong>clean boot:</strong> <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
<br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<br />
<br />
If the safe mode and clean boot do not fix the issue, try <strong>Method 2 :</strong>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Troubleshoot problems with Windows Aero</strong> : <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-problems-with-Windows-Aero" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-problems-with-Windows-Aero<br />
</a><br />
<strong>Method 3</strong> in case 1 and 2 do not work<br />
<br />
<strong>Things you must do in order to fix the issue :</strong> <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Install latest nvidia drivers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Upgrade BIOS to latest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Disable Aero Glass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Ensure running correct monitor drivers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Check that the TMM Task is not running (as I have seen elsewhere the suggestion that the Transient Multi-Monitor Manager can sometimes interfere with nvidia driver settings)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Install Powerstrip and use it to lock the vertical frequency<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * reinstall the Vista monitor driver in Vista compatibility mode ( if your previous Operating System was Vista)<br />
<strong><br />
Make older programs run in this version of Windows</strong> : <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a>
<br />
<br />
<strong>BIOS DISCLAIMER:</strong> <br />
Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this helped<br />

<h2>            In troubleshooting Windows Update, how do the recommended DISM and SFC commands actually work&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I am trying to understand what the DISM and SFC commands listed in the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fix Window Update errors</a> guide actually do. I have searched posts online about these two commands but I still have questions about how they work in this situation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>One of the later steps in the guide is "Fix Windows File Corruption". The two commands in that step are:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>1. &nbsp; DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>(explanation: </span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>/RestoreHealth<span>&nbsp; </span>Scans the image for component store corruption, and then performs repair operations automatically)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Followed by:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>2. &nbsp;&nbsp; sfc /scannow</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>(explanation:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>/scannow Scans the integrity of all protected system files and repairs files with problems when possible.)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Is the “image” that DISM is cleaning up a copy/image of the operating system, or is it the actual components/files of the operating system running on the computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Is this DISM command actually altering the operations of the computer, or just modifying an image?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Is the image checked/cleaned up by DISM used by the sfc command?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What is the difference between DISM and sfc commands?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Another article about using DISM says: <span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Important</span></span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
 However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running Windows installation as the repair source, or use a Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD, as the source of the files.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If the reason you run DISM is to troubleshoot windows update on your computer and DISM uses Windows Update to fix corruptions, what is the point of using this DISM command in the Fix Windows Update Errors guideline?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A docs.microsoft.com article about DISM best practices says: We do not recommend that you use the Sfc.exe scan options to automatically fix Windows system files.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Is there a risk that having DISM /restorehealth and/or sfc /scannow make changes will further corrupt the system?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Thanks for any replies that help me clear this up.</span></span></p>

 using DISM command with the /online parameter, which, as I understand it, does not use installation media as its source?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-----In the quote below, Microsoft's DISM best practices doc recommends against using SFC scan options to automatically fix system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/deployment-image-servicing-and-management--dism--best-practices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DISM best practices</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>You can also use System File Checker (Sfc.exe) on an online or offline reference image. System File Checker is released with all versions of Windows.System File Checker requires elevated permissions,
 and you must be an Administrator to run it. It scans all protected files to verify the file versions. To verify only the integrity of the Windows system files, run the
<strong>
sfc.exe /verifyonly</strong> option. For complete command-line syntax, at an elevated command prompt, type
<strong>
sfc.exe /?</strong>.<span> </span>
</p>
<p>Running Sfc.exe can take a significant amount of time. The expected result is that there are no system integrity violations. However, if there are problems with Windows system files, you should
 investigate the issues. <strong>We do not recommend that you use the Sfc.exe scan options to automatically fix Windows system files. &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>(Bolded by me)</p>

<p>
</p><p>What it is basically saying is that you could run the tool by typing PowerShell in your Cortana/Search Window, right clicking on the first option in the Menu that appears and selecting run as Admin then type DISM in the command line and&nbsp; what you'd

<p>(partial image. If you do this on your device you can scroll down and see the rest of the options).</p>

</p><p>SFC/SCANNOW is a SCANNER. It will find (and occasionally <em>fix) </em>
SOME of your problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So will typing CHKDSK/F in CMD for that matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DISM compares your Windows Image with the ideal image stored at Microsoft and corrects any errors that may have crept in through corrupted downloads, etc. It will not touch your personal files and folders. It is only looking at files that Windows
 needs to run.</p>

<p>Charles: thanks for your reply and the link. I read that document and quite a number of the other pages related to DISM on docs.microsoft.com. The Microsoft docs posts did not help me much in understanding what roles DISM and SFC and their various options
 play in fixing system corruption related to Windows Update. I did get a lot of the information I was looking for on various posts and tutorials on the tenforums.com site.</p>
<p><span><span>The best discussion I’ve found about using DISM to check and repair Windows is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/7808-use-dism-repair-windows-10-image.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use
 DISM to repair Windows 10 image</a></span></span></p>
<p>My reading does seem to confirm your reply that using /online with DISM compares local my Windows Image with a reference source located at Microsoft. It uses Windows Update to do that. What I still don't get is: if my problem is that Windows Update on my
 system is/may be bad, and DISM /online needs Windows Update to work, how does running DISM /online with broken Windows Update helps me fix/troubleshoot Windows Update? I'm going to pursue this elsewhere. Thanks again.</p>

<p>True. DISM command is pointless if you are required to create an external image of Windows 10 which is automatically downloaded or upgraded from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead Windows 10 should have been given as an installable file with .ISO or whatever has the install image.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is just an issue everywhere, now.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> kimmied  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS 10 LAPTOP WILL NOT WAKE UP</h2>
                    PLEASE HELP!!! I have an ASUS Q550LF laptop, and ever since I upgraded to Windows 10, my pc wont wake up when I open my lid, causing me to have to hold down the power button to shut down the computer.&nbsp; That CANT be good for my computer, but nothing else
 works.&nbsp; I have adjusted my power and sleep settings, Ive turned off the HDD&nbsp;sleep, &nbsp;and I've even deleted the Hibernate option.&nbsp; Still,&nbsp;if I close my laptop lid,&nbsp;and later&nbsp;I open the lid on&nbsp;my pc, it will not wake up.&nbsp; This does NOT happen every time, but
 often enough that its a pain and can't be good for my computer.&nbsp; Does anyone know if Microsoft is planning a fix?&nbsp; I noticed I'm not the only person having this issue.&nbsp; Thank you!!!!

<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>To wake up your Windows computer from Sleep mode at a fixed time, type Task Scheduler in Start Search and hit Enter.</span></p>

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Next under the <strong><span>Actions tab</span></strong>, you have to mention a task. Click New. You can run a simple task, like say, first launching &amp; then closing the command prompt window. This thus will wake your

<h2>            missing winmail folders and files in Windows 10</h2>

 indeed we can). &nbsp;There are a lot....... and not all recent. We have tried some of the suggestions and nothing works so far. &nbsp;Most of the suggestions are from an older version.

<h2>            laptop shuts down</h2>
                    My hp pavilion dv6t-2100 laptop will sometimes take 4 or 5 times hitting the off-on button before it comes on,,when it come on the fan is very loud but calms down and the laptop goes into diagnosis but in trying to fix problem the laptop will shut down.
 I push the on button and it will do the same thing. I tried hard reset, I cleaned the fan, check the memory,hard drive, and power supply. also when the laptop shuts down there is one click near the power jack. like a click or pop, not very loud but it can
 be heard..

<p>Sounds like it could be a short in the port or cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>High speed fan is standard behaviour at startup, but should slow down in a few seconds.&nbsp; If it does not, it could mean overheated internals.&nbsp; Is your&nbsp; laptop being used on a soft surface?&nbsp; It should not.&nbsp; Cooling air is drawn from the bottom of the laptop.&nbsp;
 If it is placed on fabric for example, those vents are blocked, which causes over-heating.&nbsp; An&nbsp; over-heated system will shut down to protect itself.</p>

            Thanks much for your reply--Canadian Tech-- The fan does slow down after a few seconds&nbsp; I use my laptops on an Airflow grid-- I have been able to get it to stay on a little longer each time, long enough for me to run Malwarebytes then it shut down. next
 time I ran command for virus and on both test everything was free and clean.. I ran a core-temp&nbsp; found the cpu at 37--48 running one time it got to 56 but only for a second then back down to the low 40's.&nbsp;<br />
Everything on this laptop works great aside for the shut down from nowhere, it runs fast, loads good, looks good, sounds good, and when I shut it down that is good,, but I cannot find out why sometimes it just shuts down by it's self.

</p><p>The most common first failure in a laptop is the hard drive.&nbsp; Your description is confusing.&nbsp; Did you say you replaced the hard drive with a used one that was previously used as a backup drive?&nbsp; If you did that, it was a mistake.&nbsp; New hard drives are not
 that expensive and your 6 year old laptop should have a new one if you want to continue to use it for a few more years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your description is confusing.&nbsp; &nbsp;Did you physically install&nbsp; the 300 then completely install Windows 7 from scratch ("custom")?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you replace the battery? How long ago?</p>
<p>Did you replace the charging cord?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the charging cord plug in tightly or is it loose?</p>
<p>Are there any other physical defects or damage?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are using probably the weakest antivirus software available.&nbsp; You need to spend a few dollars to get a top quality one.&nbsp; If you are willing to do that, just ask and I will advise on how to choose one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use Data Lifeguard software to test the drive hardware.&nbsp; Run all three tests</p>

 morning until now.--The hard drive failed about 3 1/2 years back so i put this 500 in it for her, did a custom install of windows 7 from my DVD and a usb back-up 300 drive I had that I cloned. I think it maybe the power jack ,I have never had one make that
 click noise when they shut down, I am going to order a power jack for her, the battery isn't any good but she will have to buy one when her SSC comes in. On laptops lasting a long time--I have 5 from 9 years old to 11 years old and all are running very good--2

            Hi Daniel, the stated size of gears of War 4 is 130GB
<br />
<br />It is possible, that some of the download became corrupt and it had to be re-downloaded, this would account for the amount of data downloaded . . .

            Daniel, I would give it another while to complete the download. 
<br />
<br />If it does not complete within an hour or so. Then probably your best option is to completely restart the download . . .

            I have build 10162 and I'm getting the same message. Everything I've read online tells me to click "Get Started" in the settings box, but the box says I'm already set to receive insider builds. Just spell it out for me, okay? If I'm not going to get any
 more builds, I will go back to the old operating system and forget about it. I am really disappointed how Windows is handling this insider program. For months, we tested, provided feedback, experienced crashes, overcame bugs, and now that windows 10 is out,
 you can't even get an answer as to how to get an update.

<p>
</p><p>All I have heard is that the statement in <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/bloggingwindows/2015/06/19/upcoming-changes-to-windows-10-insider-preview-builds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Upcoming changes to Windows 10 Insider Preview builds [UPDATED 6/22] | Blogging Windows</a> is still operative:
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><em>“I want to continue as a Windows Insider!” If you want to continue as a Windows Insider past 7/29 there is nothing you need to do. You’re already opted in and receiving builds in the Fast or Slow ring depending upon your selection.
 This is prerelease software and is activated with a prerelease key. Each individual build will expire after a time, but you’ll continue to receive new builds so by the time an older prerelease build expires you’ll have received a new one. Since we’re continuing
 the Windows Insider Program you’ll be able to continue receiving builds and those builds will continue to be activated under the terms of the Windows Insider Program. We provide ISOs for these builds for recovery from any significant problems, but they are
 still pre-release software. As part of the program we’ll upgrade Insiders to what is for all intents and purposes the same build as what other customers will get on 7/29, but that will be just another build for Insiders, and those who stay in the program will
 simply get the next build after as well.</em></p>

</p><p>Hi, This is complicated but you have to leave for a while then re-join immediately. See screenshot</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/96bbbcc7-ae4c-4fff-bd27-d88194ec49ed" /></p>

</p><p>Await for uninstall to take place, restart PC to be safe.</p>
<p>Now follow instructions to reinstall at</p>

</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then make sure Windows Update is working</p>
<p>This is what I had to do to get the Insider Hub to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- In Active Directory Users and Computers, move the computer to a group where the WSUS doesn't apply</p>
<p>- reboot (gpupdate /force was not enough to get it to take the settings)</p>
<p>- Settings/System/Apps &amp; Features/Manage Optional Features/Add a feature - install Insider Hub</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things are getting better, but domain-attached with WSUS is still quite weird at times.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Summary</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically the Windows Update process has broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this still fails, then you have to upgrade manually.</p>
<p>This can be short cut by downloading a copy of Windows 10 and carrying out instructions in :-</p>
