<h2>            XBox One connecting to TCL TV</h2>
                    
<p>My Xbox One and Kinect will not sync up with my TCL TV to control the "Xbox On" and "Xbox Turn off" feature. &nbsp;It does not find the proper model number to correctly sync. &nbsp;The only thing I found that comes close is a Vizio model but it only control the volume
 on my TV and still does not turn the TV on or off. &nbsp;Is there a way to find the correct model number so my voice commands with the kinect will turn the TV on and off as well? &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have the same problem. It looks like there aren't any remote codes yet for the TCL Roku TV's. They use a special Roku remote that has an ON - OFF button unlike normal Roku remotes.
</p>
<p>Hopefully we will get an update soon that includes a new remote code for these.
</p>
<p>I have a 55FS4610R and all of the codes that the XBOX has for TCL do not work.

<p>Yes, T0885 works. My problem was that i had put the privacy thing covering the Xbox symbol on my kinect and once I took it off, volume and muting worked.

<h2>            Family sharing</h2>
                    <p>My adult son cannot play a game i downloaded for him using my profile unless he logs in as me. I have been through family sharing and designating the xbox one as the home console. I have rebooted. If i log in as me then log his profile in as well it works
 fine. He can play the game on either his profile or mine only as long as my profile is logged in. If i then log me out on the console the game kicks him out. This does not make sense and means i cannot play on another console if he is playing the game.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to Xbox Forums Support. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try this: (Just to be sure) </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Sign into the account that owns the game (license)&nbsp;on the Xbox console. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Go to settings - personalization - my home Xbox - and you should see that the profile is et to the Home Xbox.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Once you've confirmed that the profile that owns the game is set as the Home Xbox... Completely sign out and sign
</p>
<p>into your son's account.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Now that you're signed into your son's account, have him go to his "my games and apps" and let us know if you see the game there, ready to be installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to hearing from you! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck and happy gaming! </p>

<p>Thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have been in to my games and apps having signed in as him. The game is showing as installed but when you open the game i get the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found that if he first logs in as me, then logs in as him (two users logged in) he can then play as his profile. If he logs my profile out even whilst playing the game under his profile the game stops and goes back to the same error. If he keeps both
 profiles going and i log in to my profile on another xbox one (therfore logging my profile out of his xbox) it seems to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>the xbox is already set up as the home xbox and family sharing is already set up with the other user added to family sharing. He is set up as an adult so all that should have been done has been done. This technically should work according to all the guidance

            Yes this is how my set up works as well the "shared" console is the "home" console. On this console I have it set to auto sign in with the account that holds the valid gold membership and purchased games. Then I will use the secondary console for my personal
 gaming as the other console is set up for shared family use.

<h2>            Windows 8 Mail App randomly closes all the time</h2>
                    I'm having issues with the mail app. I would use it more often except there are things you can't do on it (annoying) and I've only had my computer a month and the app just keeps randomly closing on me (even more annoying). I don't know if I'm doing something
 to make it close (I'm still trying to figure out all the new stuff with Windows 8) and it's only been doing this for about a week. This leads me to believe it's not me because as far as I know I haven't been doing anything different this last week. This happens
 when I'm reading a message, when I'm trying to write a message, just any old time it wants. It closes and goes back to the Start screen.&nbsp;

            <div>Hi,<br />
Thank you for posting the issue on Microsoft Community.<br />
We will try to help you resolve the issue.<br />
If you could answer a few questions it would help us to resolve this issue:<br />
1) Have you made any changes prior to the issue?</div>
<div>2) Do you receive any error message code while the apps are closing?<br />
3. Do you face similar issues with any other app?<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here are a few steps which you can follow:<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 1:<br />
Run the apps troubleshooter and follow the steps from the link below:<br />
What to do if you have problems with an app<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</a><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 2:<br />
Disable third-party Security Software and check if issue persists.<br />
Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />

a. In the desktop screen, press Windows + X<br />
b. Click command prompt(Admin)<br />
d. At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow<br />
This will check for any integrity violations<br />

<h2>            How do I reinstall windows after replacing hard drive&#63; Laptop didn&#39;t come with a disc.</h2>
                    My internal hard drive&nbsp;went bad in my laptop, easy to replace and relatively cheap. However, the laptop didn't come with the windows disc. So how do&nbsp;I reinstall windows once I've replaced the hard drive?&nbsp;

            <p>You basically have two choices. You can contact whoever made the computer and see if they can supply either a set of disks to restore Windows Vista (I dare presume) or an install DVD set for Windows Vista (probably OEM). If going with&nbsp;the second choice,
 determine if you will need to download any device drivers or supplimental software package(s) from their web site. OR, you can purchase the operating system of your choice, retail. Wisdom dictates that, if that is your choice, you see if you will need any
 device drivers and get those from the maker's web site.</p>
<p>Once you have the disks, install in the usual way.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly I ran the Windows Store Apps Troubleshooting tool. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I got a message of <strong>"Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem" &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>This actually did not surprise&nbsp;me at all... &nbsp;None of Microsoft's "Troubleshooting" tools have ever worked for me before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then deleted the folder&nbsp;<strong>C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.WindowsStore_8wekyb3d8bbwe\LocalCache\perUserCache_00034001825B21B0</strong></p>
<p>Opened the Windows Store again after restarting my machine. &nbsp;Got the same error message as before:
<strong>"We encountered an error. &nbsp;Please try signing in again later."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Seeing as there are literally thousands of other people on the internet (in forums) that have the exact same problem as me I wonder why Microsoft has released an operating system full of bugs. &nbsp;This is merely one of my existing Windows 10 upgrade problems.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am giving it another week of teeth grinding, sweating and troubleshooting. &nbsp;After that I am uninstalling Windows 10 and will never use it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            HI GB.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />For slow file transfer speeds here are some things that worked:  
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files-winpc/copy-speed-very-slow-in-windows-10/950c8f96-d9de-41e2-8d35-977944eb5c01">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I have same problem, I have exact same setup and driver version between version 1803 and 1809, 1809 is slow.&nbsp; this is also apparent in all 1809 versions that I have tried so far, Win10 pro 1809, 10 enterprise 1809, win 10 ltsc 2019, server 2019, none of
 the suggested fixes have worked.&nbsp; all the same editions I have mentioned in 1803 version all work fine.&nbsp; Oh when I tried all these version they were all clean bare metal installs.</p>

    <title>CHKDSK error, system file checker error, computer will not boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonkip  say:</h3>
<h2>            CHKDSK error, system file checker error, computer will not boot</h2>
                    Hello, everyone.&nbsp; My name is Jason.&nbsp; I am a first-time poster.&nbsp; Usually when I have a problem, I turn to either my computer friend (we all have one) or at least google, but this time my problems have been progressively getting worse and I think it's time
 to recruit some hard-core pros out there.&nbsp; Up to the challenge?&nbsp; Pshaw, this will be a cake walk for you, I'm sure.&nbsp; Anyway, I'll try to be thorough:<br />
<br />
I first noticed a problem 7 days ago.&nbsp; My wife said that the laptop (a sony vaio running windows vista) had unexpectedly frozen, and the only thing she was able to do was power down by holding the power button for 8 seconds.&nbsp; I had this same problem the next
 morning.&nbsp; While restarting, the computer checked the drive and started up fine.&nbsp; However the problem happened again, a few more times, each time about 10-15 mins apart.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I tried Alt+Ctrl+Del during the freezes, one press wouldn't do anything, but 25 or so presses would bring up a black screen and an error message that said "Logon process has failed to create the security options dialogue."&nbsp; Pressing OK would take me back to
 the desktop where I could move the pointer but not do anything otherwise.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I first started researching this problem lightly myself, but you should know that I only follow instructions, I often don't really understand what's going on with things like drivers and indexes and such.&nbsp; Anyway I started reading about some memory problems
 and I checked Task Manager.&nbsp; I was also reading about a few people who had done things like stopping Windows Defender, and SuperFetch.&nbsp; After googling those, I figured they weren't really the problem but I tried stopping them anyway.&nbsp; I noticed how my memory
 cache kept increasing and my free memory would decrease until it was only at say, 3.&nbsp; I looked at processes and stopped one of the official looking ones which had been constantly growing (related to the windows search service, I think).&nbsp; I messed with all
 of these one at a time, in between freezes and shutdowns, so I don't remember exactly in which order or which one seemed to work, but at this point, I thought I had fixed the problem for the first time.&nbsp; The computer didn't freeze up again after 15 minutes...it
 was more like 6 hours. <br />
<br />
I restarted and also went in to remove some software that my wife had installed in August.&nbsp; It's called "Populous Downloader" or just "Live" but I could not find it in the list of programs to uninstall.&nbsp; I didn't really know if this could be related, but while
 trying to delete some of the files, I wasn't given permission at first and so I grew suspicious.&nbsp; I ended up just deleting the files using command, instead of messing around with all of the permission changes needed.&nbsp; This didn't have any positive effect,
 but I wanted to mention it in case it could be related to future negative effects.<br />
<br />
I told my wife to go ahead and try to get the videos she wanted onto her ipod...from itunes...which she just recently installed.&nbsp; Hmm.&nbsp; Could it be related?&nbsp; I told her I was going to uninstall everything apple and try.&nbsp; She had to reinstall quicktime, I had
 uninstalled that also since it was recently installed and I didn't know she needed it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I installed Malwarebytes onto the laptop too.&nbsp; I then ran a full system scan which took a while.&nbsp; It got 41 minutes into it and then froze...there were 16 problems counted at that point.&nbsp; I restarted and tried to do a quick scan.&nbsp; It found 5 "problems" and
 fixed them...they didn't appear to be serious.&nbsp; I tried restarting and doing a full scan again but it didn't work.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Now somewhere along the way, I don't remember exactly when, but I think it was after the itunes and quicktime stuff...I got a pretty bad looking message.<br />

I got worried at this pint.&nbsp; I used my desktop computer to download and burn a dvd with the vista recovery tools on it that I booted up with.&nbsp; At first I let it do the startup recovery.&nbsp; I looked at the results but don't really know what they mean:

</a><br />
<br />
It sait it would let me restart and see if Windows would load...which it did...with no functionality.&nbsp; Hard shutdown.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I restarted and looked at the available system restore dates.&nbsp; I went with one that was right before the original itunes installations.&nbsp; The system restore completed and I restarted, everything seemed to load up but it was short lived.&nbsp; More freezes.&nbsp; This
 time I got a lot of error messages too.&nbsp; They took a while in between each one, but they kept coming so I took pics of them (most I think).&nbsp;

OK so I've tried running the chkdsk utility from command, but I am not getting good results.&nbsp; It first got to 16% before it said "An unspecified error occurred." and abruptly quit.&nbsp; Another suggestion said to rename the driver file (listed on the boot manager
 screen) from .sys to .old, and then retry chkdsk, but my problem was that I've received at least 3-5 of those screens with different filenames and status numbers each time.&nbsp; I did try renaming the most recent driver name, after which I tried chkdsk again...<br />

WOW, I've written a lot.&nbsp; Well, I've tried a lot.&nbsp; I feel like I either didn't even scratch the surface, or the problem is something simple like I'm totally screwed.&nbsp;

Anyway, I'd really like to have my laptop running again, and it would be very cool if I didn't lose my pics and vids in the process.&nbsp; What do you think?<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
There were a couple of pics of a nice car, do I get that if this works? Drat, I don't drive or even have a license,<br />
just bicycle (car free 17+ years).<br />
<br />
Your data can probably be saved by a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at BestBuy or other BigBox<br />
Stores) or by the System maker. The drive can be put in another computer as a 2nd drive or put in an<br />
external case and accessed that way "usually".<br />
<br />
From the COMMAND prompt of your Boot Disk run these (you can run them in windows however they are<br />
more efficient from the boot disk prompt so I will list both ways).<br />
<br />
Command Prompt of a Boot Disk<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />

<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Inside Windows - Regular or Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot up)<br />

===================================================<br />
<br />
If you regain access or at least the drive errors stop :<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair from the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do not have a<br />
Vista disk you can borrow a friends (they are not copy protected) or make one. Also your System maker will
<br />
sell the physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />

=======================================<br />
<br />
If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.<br />
<br />
You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data)&nbsp;or a repair installation (hopefully<br />
saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or three.<br />
<br />
You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own Product Key.<br />

<h3> gao1yu3  say:</h3>
<h2>            ICS failure and high CPU after fall update.</h2>
                    <p>I am running a HyperV virtual machine under win10 and it uses a internal switch to share the laptop's wifi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the fall update, (internet connection sharing) ICS is constantly at high CPU use, and it is stuck with the wifi's sharing. When I try unshare the existing shared wifi connect, the "Network and Sharing Center" hangs up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I restarted, same problem.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Rolled back to previous version... after a refresh restart next day, SAME problem persisted. ICS is still stuck at high CPU even in previous build.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removed HyperV, same high ICS usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At (internet connection sharing), wired connections have sharing tags, wifi connection does not have a sharing tag, and ICS is constantly "starting".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now the HyperV machine has no internet and can't get anything out of it. Very annoying!</p>

    <title>Xbox live customer support lost when customers are fraudulently - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox live customer support lost when customers are fraudulently charged</h2>
                    
<p>So i saw that my account had some charges i didn't authorize, so i call customer support to inform them. This is what has happened so far:</p>
<p><b>8/27/11 </b></p>
<p>Fraudulent charges on account called Xbox to inform:</p>
<p>Phone Call 1: Phone disconnected when talking to service representative.</p>
<p>Phone Call 2: Finish reporting fraud charges</p>
<p>Was told by&nbsp;service representative investigation team will contact and update me on investigation. Investigation takes an estimated 21 days. Account supposedly locked so no use of gamertag or Xbox live. Given reference number. So sitting there looking at
 my useless Xbox i decide to check it to ensure its locked. Turn on and see my gamertag was on another console (person who fraudulently used my credit card was downloading games they purchased), complete gamertag recovery. Get gamertag back and play a round
 of Halo Reach, upset because account wasn't locked like i was informed it would be, so person who took my gamertag could still use my credit card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Phone Call 3: Lock account</p>
<p>Check gamer tag and able to play Xbox Live. Call customer support again to have account lock so person who was fraudulently using my account couldn’t download or use and more money, reference number given and account now locked from Xbox live</p>
<p><b>8/29/11</b></p>
<p>Call Xbox customer support to get an update on investigation. Service representative says that investigation was not started because information is missing from account to start investigation. Upset because talked to 3 SR on 8/27/11 and none of them said
 anything about missing information to start investigation. Give service representative needed information,&nbsp; and request to speak with supervisor.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Requested supervisor </span></b></p>
<p><b>Supervisor: Michael</b></p>
<p>Informed supervisor I poke to 3 SR on 8/27/11 none of which said anything about missing information to start investigation Supervisor: Michael - Stated that there were two open cases because of phone disconnecting on 8/27/11 and&nbsp; when I called back back
 to finish informing service representative of fraud charges. Michael says it was a mix up of information between service representative notes in the system Mix up of information then goes on to say that the Investigation team will contact you in 3 to 4 days
 and that investigation could take up to 21 days.</p>
<p><b>9/6/11</b></p>
<p>Received email from investigation team</p>
<p>&nbsp;"<i>Dear Xbox LIVE Customer,</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;Your report of unauthorized access to your Xbox LIVE account has been received by our fraud investigations team. To protect your privacy and account information, your Xbox LIVE account is temporarily locked and sign-in is disabled. If you use this Windows
 Live ID for any other Microsoft services, they will also be locked during our investigation. Your account cannot be accessed by anyone outside of our fraud investigations team. No charges or changes can be made to your account while we investigate.</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;Our investigations are currently taking up to 21 days, with our goal being to unlock your account as quickly as possible. We ask for your continued patience as we investigate this case. We are providing you a free, 30-day Xbox LIVE membership code that
 you can use to create a new, temporary account or save and add to your own account.</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;Please accept this prepaid code with our apologies for the delay:</i></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;( NO PREPAID CODE WAS PRESENT)</strong><i><br />
</i></p>
<p><i>If we verify that fraudulent purchases were made on your Xbox LIVE account while your account was not under your control, the purchase amounts or Microsoft Points will be refunded. Refunds may be processed within the next 10 business days after we conclude
 our investigations, but may take up to 30 days before they appear on your credit card billing statement.</i></p>

<p><i>&nbsp;Sincerely,</i></p>
<p><i>The Xbox LIVE Investigations Team</i></p>

<p><i>&nbsp;Contact Xbox Support"</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;Called Xbox customer support to inquire if investigation started 9/6/11 when email was received or 8/29/11, when I originally gave all my information to supposedly start investigation.Service representative on the phone stated the investigation starts from
 the original day called, 8/29/11 and estimated date on completion would be 21 days.</p>
<p>To get written confirmation I send email to Xbox support with the same question:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<i>“Hello, I just received an email from The Xbox LIVE Investigations Team on 9/6/11</i> st<i>ating they are verifying that fraudulent purchases were made on my Xbox LIVE account while my account was not under my control. I was wondering if this means the
 investigation just started or has been since i originally called on 8/29/11. My reference number is
XXXXXXXXXXXX, i just wanted to know because if it just started on 9/6 that would mean my account will be locked for an estimated 29 days and not the 21 days as stated by the 4 representatives i have spoken to
 or the email i received. I do want this to be handled as quickly and professionally as possible because i lost over $100 from the fraudulent charges and when the investigation team sees i didn't have control of account i will be receiving a refund 2 months
 after the initial withdrawal. Please let me know because i have been told different things from each representative i have talked to.”<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;</i></p>
<p><b>9/7/11</b></p>
<p>Receive email response from Xbox support:</p>
<p><i>&nbsp;“Hello Micah,</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;Thank you for contacting XBOX Email support. I am Bella and I will be helping you today.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I understand that there's a query on the duration of the&nbsp;account investigation. If I misunderstood the concern, please let me know. I'm looking forward to be of assistance to you on this matter today.</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;Micah, I'm sorry for the inconvenience that the investigation may have caused you. The investigation is started on the same date the email was sent to you by the
</i><em>Investigation Team</em><i>.&nbsp;We would also like to let you know that there has been a recent change in the turnaround time of the investigation, that is 25 days.</i></p>
<p><i>&nbsp;If you need to call or&nbsp; reply to this e-mail, please reply 'with history' (include any previous e-mail) or reference to Service Request Number XXXXXXXXXX so we can expedite our service to you.<br />

XBOX Support Services<br />
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/support</a>&nbsp;“</i></p>
<p>Called Xbox Support and requested supervisor&nbsp; because i was being given different information from the service representative i spoke to on 9/6/11 and the email i received 9/7/11 on what day the investigation started.&nbsp; The service representative argued with
 me about speaking to supervisor, stating he understands my situation but there is nothing a supervisor could do. I told the&nbsp;service representative&nbsp; I understood what he was saying but I wonted to confirmation for when investigation starts from a supervisor,
 do to past inconsistencies with service representative giving me information. </p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Requested supervisor </span></strong></p>
<p><b>Supervisor: Ronnette</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;Supervisor confirmed that investigation starts 9/6/11,when email was received and now has an estimated time of 25 days, then continues to say that If time goes over initial month any extra time will be compensated back.&nbsp; She stated that the service department
 sends request for investigation to the investigation department but that the investigation team might not even get started on the investigation for 20 days after receive request. Once an investigation is started it normally takes a day or two to complete.
 I asked if i could get an email for confirmation and the supervisor stated that no written documentation can be sent for security reasons. Only department that could give me documentation was from Email support only documentation that can be email.</p>
<p>So point of story is that investigation squad is either understaffed, lazy or they are having a high volume of fraud cases....
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Original date of fraud charges: 8/27/11</p>
<p>Estimated investigation length 9/6/11 till 9/30/11</p>
<p>I wont get a refund until October, it will be interesting not being able to pay electricity bill this month because of the prolonged investigation....</p>

<p>no 30 day locked out, and your credit card will refund it right away.</p>

<p>"Zen" - I did change my password and username after i called support, i waited about 30 minutes from the initial call to check my account and found it was still active. It was a checking account so i contacted them and they stated i had to wait for the charges
 to completely process before i could file a claim. It showed my account had money taken out on 8/27/11 but it was still in processing status until 8/30 when it showed it had completed processing. But my bank has to do an investigation also now.... Bank of
 America is a terrible bank by the way...</p>
<p>"Airwalk" - I did what you said but when i orignaly talked to the support personal they said my CC was locked so there could be any further drafts and that if i took CC off it would end by subscription even though my renewal for he year is due in febuary.</p>
<p>"RHI" - the sad part about it is the investigation started 7 days after reported...</p>
<p>Thanks guys for possible fixes to this issue but it seems like this is a issue MS isnt interested in taking care of. I searched the forums and saw this is happening to many gamers and they all seem to having same issues with MS as me.</p>

<p>My account was hacked on 8/19. &nbsp;Same as most, 4000 and 6000 points were charged to my CC. &nbsp;I called about 20 minutes after the charges since my bank called me about suspected fraud. &nbsp;I was told the same as everyone. &nbsp;30 days! &nbsp;I called on 8/29 to check on
 it and was told they needed additional information. &nbsp;I was very confused why they did not call or email me to get this information.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I was content to let them do their work, then finally called back on 9-19. &nbsp;I was then told that they needed additional information again. &nbsp;Only to find out that the additional information i gave them on 8-29 was not entered into the UA claim until 9-17.
 &nbsp;That's right it took them 2 1/2 weeks to even enter the information.</p>
<p>&nbsp; So if you think the customer service people talk to the investigations team you are kidding yourself. &nbsp;I called back again on Monday, 9-26, only to be told there are no new notes on my account. &nbsp; I am currently sitting on day
<span>44</span> with no end in sight.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Mine was compromised on 8/2, Pretty sad that we can't get any information on timeframes.</p>
<p>I did receive an email with a free 30 day subscription code which is going to run out soon, I'm getting no answers from the 800 number. I still haven't been reimbursed for the fradulent charges, and every time I call I get the same repsonse:</p>
<p>"Oh wow, it is taking a long time... I'd be upset too!"</p>
<p>Now I can't play half the arcade games on my xbox because I only license transfered about half of them after my red ring, I can't use my save files, and my gamertag/gamerscore is lost.</p>
<p>Thanks for taking my money Microsoft, I'm going to gamestop this weekend to switch my COD/Battlefield/A Creed preorders to PS3, considering any DLC I get for games I buy can't be linked to my real account.</p>
<p>I'm going to give them until 10/9 to get this sorted out (8/9 is when my claim finally made it back to the investigation team), after that I will be contacting my bank to put in a claim.</p>

<p>AS far as I'm concerned THEY are at fault for not having any security in place at the time of purchase. The crimes against us could just as easily have come from inside xbox live with someone passing on details for a price. They have our information and
 are refusing to secure it. I googled it as soon as I was robbed from my bank (not a credit card) and found microsoft have had this problem for years and it's happen 1000s of times before and they still refuse to put any security questions in place at the time
 of purchase.</p>

                    My Surface Book (config: i5, 256 SSD, 8gb RAM, dgpu) has terrible battery life. What do I do to fix this? It is really new and I use it for work (word documents, online stuff) and play (Steam games, fps). Has i got something to do with the computer overheating
 or did I not charge it right the first time around? If so, HOW DO I FIX IT? Thanks.

<h3> blackystrat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Pro x64 - Black screen after welcome on boot</h2>
                    Hello
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using Windows 7 Professional 64bit with SP1 installed</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been getting a black screen post the Welcome screen that stays for about 30 seconds while booting, before I could see my desktop</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When booting in safe mode with networking, this issue doesn't happen, so it looks like an issue with a specific driver.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I uninstalled AVAST and installed MSE, but that has made no improvement at all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please find my boot trace log at <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/158559175/boot%20trace%20-v3.7z" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a> and kindly advise on how I could resolve this issue</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks!</div>

            I have recently received the Black Screen of Death also. <br />
r<br />
This did not appear until Windows performed an automatic update. Now my computer when loading Windows 7 each time attempts to update Windows then a black screen appears.<br />
<br />
From the research I have done on this issue is that it is Malware that has infected your hard drive. I think it is a Windows update issue. I run the premium Norton Anti Virus and Windows Defender yet this still occurred. Further research points also to others
 who have experienced the similar issue coincidentally occurred when Windows 7 was trying to perform an update.

            <p>I have the same Black Screen after the Welcome and Login. It seems to always eventually come to the desktop but it takes &nbsp;more than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both our computers are experiencing the black screen which started after our last Windows Update, but do not know if that was the cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running McAfee and bought a couple of programs that said they could solve the problem, base of internet search response, all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got a messsage it was from Conduit Background Container malware. Removed it with Remove Programs but cannot get rid of the link I finds in "start" accessed by Control Panel, Administrative Services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know the real cause and how to fix it.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to the Forums for advice on what to do when you're unable to broadcast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could definitely see how being unable to broadcast like this could be distressing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to more accurately help with this problem you're having, it would help to have a little more info for context.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't mind letting us know, what platform are you trying to broadcast from, the Xbox or off of a PC?</p>

    <title>Deleting Temporary files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> w.lutz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting Temporary files</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7 and use Stopzilla as my anti-virus.&nbsp; When running a full scan it takes hours due to C:\Windows\Temp\tmp... files.&nbsp; I have used the disk cleanup to reduce the amount of data being used up, but I am still 260 of 923 GB space free.&nbsp;
 I just had my computer in the shop because I received a message that my C drive was full.&nbsp; I am not a computer techhie and do not want to mess up my computer by doing something I am not sure of.&nbsp; Can anyone give me some advice on how to free up this memory.&nbsp;
 It would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>To be clear, you still have lots of files in C:\Windows\Temp after the shop working on your computer because the C:\ drive was full?&nbsp; That seems a bit odd.&nbsp; The Temp folder ought to have been one of the first things they would have cleaned out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event, it's always a good idea to delete temp files before doing a full scan and it is generally perfectly safe to delete files in C:\Windows\Temp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just open that folder, click Edit &gt; Select All (or press CTRL+A) and then press the Delete key.&nbsp; Windows will prevent you from deleting anything that is in use or otherwise ought not to be deleted at that time; just click the "Skip" key and continue with
 the deletions.</p>

            <p>Do you think that's the only temporary files that Disk Cleanup didn't clean up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb and in the box enter the following text and press the Enter key:</p>
<p>
</p><p>%temp%</p>
<p>
</p><p>That folder should be empty too - is it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you going to remember to empty these folders manually every time you want to do a scan?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't Disk Clean up do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The built in Windows Cleanup is notorious for not doing a good job of "cleaning up" things in the Temp folder:</p>
<p>
</p><p>c:\Windows\Temp</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take a look at the size and contents of that folder after Windows Cleanup and see what was missed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you right click C:\Windows\Temp and check Properties how much did Windows Cleanup miss?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e123908f-a157-426b-84cf-7e48523a4668" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e123908f-a157-426b-84cf-7e48523a4668" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After Windows Cleanup - no change but the folder should be empty:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb8f17ff-f7a4-46d8-ba9e-f00f8ae883b5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb8f17ff-f7a4-46d8-ba9e-f00f8ae883b5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You might consider using the popular and free version of CCleaner which you can download from here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/download</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Most people recommend NOT using their registry cleaner but I have never had a problem with it - but I always have a plan for what I am going to do if it somehow breaks my system and it malfunctions or does not boot afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After using CCleaner your Temp folder will look like more like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f094ae6-777c-48ae-b291-bbd20867e913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f094ae6-777c-48ae-b291-bbd20867e913" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The free version of CCleaner will also clean out the Temp folder for the Current User - the paid version will let you do all or some other users but you can always just clean those out yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't pay attention during the installation it will install a startup item you don't really need so go into the settings and uncheck all these boxes:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6b90208-2e77-4842-b756-db7f3c72bab5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b6b90208-2e77-4842-b756-db7f3c72bab5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Give it a whirl - if you don't like it, uninstall it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Do this so we can see what you have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the search box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your system has lots of RAM (8, 16, 32GB) it could be that your paging file is consuming as much or more disk space as the amount of RAM you have.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have hibernation enabled, there goes another 8, 16, 32GB of hard drive space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These things can be adjusted - but more information will prevent you from trying things that might work sometimes maybe.<br />

<h2>            Nvidia graphics card keeps disappearing from Device Manager</h2>
                    Hello, I'm been having a really annoying problem lately. For some reason, after an arbitrary amount of time of using my laptop, resetting it or shutting it down will cause the graphics card to disappear. I have an Inspiron 17R 7720 SE with a Nvidia GT
 650M graphics card. I have to hard reset the laptop to get it back, but it still disappears. I've tried deleting the drivers and reinstalling, updating the BIOS, updating drivers in general. I'm still stumped on what to do. Please help!

<h2>            How to stop Casino ads having paid a one year subscription to Microsoft Solitaire Collection</h2>
                    I have phoned Microsoft for help and after spending over 45 minutes on the phone and been transferred six times to different departments, still no help in getting the Casino ads stopped whilst playing solitaire as a Premium Edition player.&nbsp; I was told
 that if you pay the ads will not appear to interrupt the games, but they are still playing during the games and are very annoying..<strong> I
</strong><strong>have had no help at all from Microsoft</strong> and have<strong> had to pay for 45 minutes telephone conversation for nothin recept being passed from one department to another</strong>.&nbsp; Each department saying they cannot help, try another
 department.<em><strong>&nbsp; IF THIS IS THE BEST MICROSOFT CAN DO, THEY SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES.
