<h2>            Windows 10 and Rosewill RNX-N600UBE Wireless Dual Band USB Adapter issues</h2>
                    With the previous install of Windows 10, my Rosswell Wireless Adapter&nbsp;has issues connecting to the computer. When plugged in, my Network and Sharing Center bugs out, causing it to crash. I believe this is due to the lack of compatibility with it since
 it's old hardware, but, would there be a way around this as it worked perfectly fine on the previous Windows 7 OS installed on&nbsp;this computer.

I'm having the same issue. When you say enabled protocols, what exactly does that mean?

    <title>Why explorer.exe is running in my computer. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why explorer.exe is running in my computer.</h2>
                    <p>Original title :Explorer.exe Problem</p>
<p>I want to know why explorer.exe runs in the background when I'm not doing anything on my computer and why it keeps my Trend Micro software from starting or scanning. Also, when I shut down the computer, I get a "waiting for background program to close" screen
 but no programs are listed.&nbsp; Unsure if the program running is explorer.exe or another program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes after playing games on Steam, I close down the program and explorer.exe is running in the background.&nbsp; I'm not sure what it is doing when I'm not using the computer, but after being connected to the internet for a few minutes, I worry that there's
 a virus/spyware that uploads from the web even though I'm not surfing the web but playing video games online.&nbsp; Anyways, whatever it may be, whether it's a legitimate programming error or another type of unwanted malicious software program, I can't start or
 open my Trend Micro Internet software.&nbsp; I'll double click the icon, try to run it as administrator, try the smaller hidden icon in the taskbar and I get absolutely no response from the Trend Micro program.&nbsp; CPU usage is around 13-17 percent for explorer.exe
 and maybe 20 total while my desktop is idle and this is occuring.&nbsp; I don't understand why when&nbsp;there are plenty of system resources (CPU&amp;Mem.) Trend Micro won't start.&nbsp; I fixed the problem with a reboot, no errors occured during reboot,and no spyware, viruses
 or cookies detected on first scan after reboot.&nbsp; So I'm not sure what the cause of explorer.exe running while idle is.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,
<br />
Explorer.exe is a safe file developed by Microsoft Corporation. The file is part of Microsoft Windows Operating System. The explorer.exe file is a Windows GUI shell, that is usually called Windows Explorer. Its graphical user interface lets you see your hard
 drives, folders, and files. At first explorer.exe was used only to browse files, but with the release of newer Windows versions it evolved to being a task-based file management system. WindowsExplorer.exe location is usually at the %WINDOWS% sub-folder and
 its usual size is 1,032,192 bytes.<br />
Note: The explorer.exe file should be in the C:\Windows folder. If you find it anywhere else, then explorer.exe is a virus, trojan, worm, or spyware! Scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner to make sure it's not infected.<br />
<br />

Note: The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again. It also performs check disk and you may lose amount of data.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still exists, you may start your computer in safe mode and then see if it works fine.</span></p>

<p><strong>Step 2 :</strong></p>
<p>If the issue doesn’t persist in safe mode, I would suggest you perform clean boot to see if any third party services are causing this issue.</p>

            <p>Hi Caleb,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. What is the exact make and model of the video/graphics card and the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Is the issue specific to Windows Live Photo Gallery?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to install the graphics card drivers from the manufacturer’s website and install it in Windows 8 compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode:</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Download the display/video/graphics drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>b) Right-click on the driver and click on ‘properties’.</p>
<p>c) Click on the ‘compatibility’ tab and check the box ‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’ and select Windows 8 operating system from the drop down.</p>
<p>d) Click on ‘Apply’ and click ‘OK’ and run the file to install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

Most new machines come with a recovery partition allowing you to go back to the time of purchase, you will have to check your user guides (or the manufacturer's Web Site) for instructions.&nbsp; Choosing that path requires you to save all valuable data first.&nbsp; Unfortunately
 upgrading to Windows 8.1 may lose such Recovery Partition.</p>

<p><span><span>Hello jrino,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks for using the Microsoft Answers Forum</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Aside from the printing pdf problem can you print from other programs such as Word, Notepad or Wordpad? Try going to the Event
 Viewer and see what the errors are being given in the viewer list. Also when enabling the Print Spooler service, make sure that any services that the spooler is dependent on are started as well.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Accessing Event Viewer: Right click on Computer and select Manage. Click on Event Viewer and then expand the view so that you
 can access the different categories. Expand the Windows Logs and then click on Application. Scroll through and see what kinds of errors you are getting and see if that helps you trouble shoot the issue. Post what you find in this thread.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Looking for dependent services: Within the Computer Management console click on Services. Click on Services and Applications and
 then click on Services. Find Print Spooler and double click to view the properties. Look at the dependent services for the spoooler and make sure that those services are started and running as well. If one or more of the dependent services are not running
 this may cause your spooler to stop working as well.</span></span></p>

    <title>Xbox in Preview program failed update and OSUDT2 wont work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xenturionxtc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox in Preview program failed update and OSUDT2 wont work</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Support</p>
<p>I hope someone can help me with an answer.</p>
<p>Today I received a 2 GB update to my Xbox, as it is part of the preview program.</p>
<p>During this update, the Xbox was stuck at the screen for "Preparing update" for 4 hours (about 75 to 80 percent according to Progress bar).</p>

<p>I had to turn off the Xbox, and when it comes back on, it will not load beyond the green startup screen.</p>

<p>I have searched the internet, and found that I am not the only one experiencing this issue.</p>

<p>Some people has had luck using the offline diagnostic tool, to get back into the system.</p>

<p>I have downloaded, extracted and tried this process as well, but sadly it gives an error code of : E101 00000504 8B050041</p>

<p>I have also tried having the Xbox run the green startup screen for an hour, hoping it might somehow resolve the issue by itself.</p>

<p>I used to Work as a system administrator, so I know that I have unpacked and placed the files correctly.</p>

<p>I wonder if this issue is caused by members of the preview program, having to download a different version of the OSUDT file, than the publicly offered OSUDT2 file.</p>

<p>I hope someone that sees this post can tell me how to proceed.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Hey guys. Anything involving the preview program should be posted in the preview forums:
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_early_access/update_preview/update_preview_forums/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../default.aspx</a></p>
<p>Before you run the offline update diagnostic, hold the Xbox logo to turn the console off, then unplug the power cord from the back for 5 minutes. Try again, but let it sit on the green screen for up to 15 minutes. I also don't believe the OSUDT2 file will
 work with the preview, but the reset to defaults file should work.</p>

    <title>Windows Explorer won&#39;t run - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> homerjsimpson743  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer won&#39;t run</h2>
                    Hi all!<br />
I have Win 7 64-bit on my HP notebook.<br />
<br />
Recently Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer!) &amp; my USB mouse won't load under windows (although I can log in, I just get a black screen), nor sound nor networking. I can boot up into Linux with a USB and these things all work. I had some random shutdowns
 &amp; tried System Restore several times (before WE stopped working) &amp; it wouldn't restore properly. I'm wondering if overheating could've damaged some Windows files &amp; if a new install would help?<br />
<br />
My only question in that case is, would 3rd Party software I've bought need to be re-purchased or would the old registration codes still work after this? I don't want to pay for things again so if there's another way than a re-install I'm listening!<br />
<br />
Someone from HP said to update the BIOS, but I can't&nbsp; access that &amp; can't connect to the internet under Windows anyway.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help! :)<br />
<br />
M.<br />

            OK thanks but I can't start explorer.exe from task manager or anywhere else, so that won't work either...<br />

I'm having problems in linux too, so I think it's likely a hardware problem, something with memory. graphics seem fine.<br />

<h2>            window focus</h2>
                    I work with serval windows at once. I click on the tool bar and the window disappears to the background before I can get my mouse to the window. The windows I use frequently i have set to open touching the tool bar so I can slide my mouse to them with
 out touching another window. Yet if I have to pass over another opened window to get to the newly opened application than windows 10 automatically changes focus before I can get to the new application. I have checked my foreground flash count and foreground
 lock&nbsp; timeout but still can't seem to figure this out. I hate closing all my windows every time I need to research something else. All application will do this and the only workaround I have found is to try to get them to touch my tool bar so it stays open
 long enough to focus on the newly opened app. I have seen this problem all over with different variations. I have not seen a solution that works yet. I have reset my computer and it still does the same thing. I asked someone at t

<p>Hello billlariviere,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its possible that this message is a scam. These websites with persistent pop-ups displaying fake warning messages and a phone number to call and get the “issue” fixed. They might offer to help solve your computer problems or sell you a software license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this rate, I recommend not to engage to this page and take precautions in protecting your personal information. Do not call the number in the pop-up. Microsoft’s error and warning messages never include a phone number. I highly suggest checking this

<h2>            PC &#40;Acer Aspire S7 392&#41; no longer shuts down &#47; goes to sleep properly</h2>
                    <p>When a shutdown or sleep / hibernate is initiated, everything turns off (screen shuts off, key backlighting etc), but the power light remains on. In this state, the PC is wholly non-responsive at all. I need to kill it by holding the power switch for a number
 of seconds, until the power light goes off. After that, it will start (by pushing the power switch or by simply opening the lid) with no issues, no error report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has occurred after installing the Fall Creators Update, but not immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Recovery to reinstall W10: after that, initially, shutdown was working properly - but after a couple hours the situation has reverted to not-working again (as if W10 has pulled down a bad update after Recovery). I have not installed any device
 drivers after Recovery, and the Update history also shows none (only the latest Defender has been auto-pulled down and installed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that others experience similar issues, but I haven't come across a solution yet.</p>

    <title>Mouse double clicking with single button press after anniversay update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fiore325  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse double clicking with single button press after anniversay update</h2>
                    <p>I use Citrix and Remote Desktop to connect to my work computer when I'm working at home. Last week it worked perfectly fine running the Windows 10 version that came installed on my laptop. This past weekend the anniversary update was installed. There are
 no issues with the mouse when I'm using the laptop itself (and I use the track pad and usb mouse alternately</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this week when I've connected through Citrix and Remote desktop, although it connects okay, once I'm in the virtual workspace, the mouse no longer works properly. When I try to move a window, it just maximizes it to full screen, so I can't drag
 programs to my second monitor, or even have two programs next to one another on one screen. I can't move them at all (except to full screen) I also can't resize them with the arrows. The arrows appear, but nothing happens if I try, I've also noticed that if
 I click on things, like say an email an in outlook, it opens right away, when normally I have to double click to open the email. Also, if I click on a link, the website opens twice in two different windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make it even stranger, when trying to get help with this issue from the IT department at work, the person helping me me took control of my screen and it worked perfectly normal when he was in control. Yet the second I tried to do anything, it still did
 the same thing. He determined the issue must be in windows 10, because the computer he was using was still running windows 7. This was confirmed when I remotely connected using a computer that was running windows 7- the mouse behaved normally. I also remotely
 connected on my surface pro 4, which also installed the anniversary update this past weekend, and the same issue exists on the virtual desktop then, as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The IT people at my job don't know how to fix it. I need help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this issue? Does anyone know what could possible be causing this issue?

<p>No the problem does not happen on either computer I tried when not connected to Citrix and remote deskt top.</p>
<p>
</p><p>yes different mice were tried- the track pads on two different laptops experience the same issue as well as a seperated usb mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sub mouse also functions fine &nbsp;when connected to Citrix and Remote Desktop on a 3rd laptop that still runs Windows 7.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi! Unfortunately my IT people at work said it's a known issue with something in the update and Citrix. Citrix has no fix yet. So instead of trying to come up with a fix or work around to the issue they just issued me a laptop with windows 7 on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish i I had a better answer!</p>

            <p>I have been fighting the same issue for the past few days. &nbsp;Cannot work from my desktop. &nbsp;Also have to use old work laptop with Windows 7. &nbsp;All my coworkers using Windows 10 starting having difficulty after the Anniversary Update. &nbsp;Microsoft and Citrix are
 no help. &nbsp;Have gone back to the previous version of Windows 10 two times. &nbsp;Even though I followed instructions from Microsoft Help, Anniversary update keeps coming back, three times now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went back to older version of Windows 10 and problem went away. &nbsp;Don't know how long Windows 10 Updates can be delayed to keep problem from coming back.</p>

            <p>Change your Citrix connection settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue occurs when the user experience is set as SEAMLESS. change it to any other option. This is the only workaround now. It worked for me.</p>

            <p>I tried your suggestion to change the option in Citrix to something other than SEAMLESS and, while that did eliminate the issue with auto double-click, it caused other serious issues with each application opening in it's own Citrix window and some apps timing
 out, etc., that it wasn't a viable solution for me.&nbsp; I'm back to trying to rely on all keyboard shortcuts and radically limiting my mouse use until a fix is in place.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate the work-around suggestion...just won't work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This still needs a fix by either Microsoft or Citrix.&nbsp; I hope the moderator has escalated this issue!</p>

<h2>            WiFi Adapter&#47;Network drivers causing BSOD&#39;s - How to fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Since mid August my PC has been bluescreening, seemingly out of nowhere. After weeks of digging through .dmp files and asking questions on here, I decided to get it sent off for a proper repair. They concluded that the crashes were caused by my network drivers
 and simply re-installed them, this coincides with my observation that just before a crash the Wi-Fi icon in the bottom right would loose it's bars and instead display a white star (*) next to it and then it would BSOD under Kernel_Security_Check_Failure.</p>
<p>I got the PC back today, Windows performed a slew of updates after a minor and probably one off complete system freeze, all seemed fine for a good few hours: I was messaging, reading articles and using Google Drive etc... Without issues and then out of nowhere
 the internet stops, the * comes in and the BSOD occurs again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is temperamental as to when it will occur but is clearly related to my network drivers and or my Wi-Fi adapter, despite reinstalling the drivers, the issue seems to persist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My adapter model is:</p>
<p>Realtek 8821AE Wireless LAN 802.11ac PCI-E NIC</p>
<p>and its current driver version is: 2023.30.301.2016</p>
<p>being used to connect via Wi-Fi to a basic BT HomeHub 5 router</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the latest available driver, if not can someone provide a link to where I can find them?</p>
<p>What kind of diagnostics can I run in an attempt to fix it?</p>
<p>and, although inconvenient, would switching to an Ethernet connection (via a separate Intel adapter) and disabling the wireless one fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help you can provide.<br />
</p>

    <title>XBox Originals not working at all... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maplehoodog  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox Originals not working at all...</h2>
                    
<p>Neither disc based nor downloadable XBox original games are working on my console.&nbsp; I have deleted and re-downloaded, cleared the system cache, even wiped my update data and reinstalled, no luck.&nbsp; This is my third XBox360 I have had (first two sent in for
 repair and got back refurbished models), and yes each time I got a new one I did a license transfer, that still hasn't helped either.&nbsp; Below is further info, I hope somebody can help as I really want to play these games again!</p>
<p>What game are you trying to play?</p>
<p>Jade Empire, Sid Meier's Pirates, GTA: San Andreas, Burnout 3: Takedown, Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge</p>
<p><br />
Is it a disc or downloaded version?</p>
<p>Jade Empire is a disc, the other 4 are downloaded.</p>
<p><br />
What type of console are you using?</p>
<p>Older style, the big 360.</p>
<p><br />
What size HDD are you using?</p>
<p>120GB</p>
<p><br />
What error code or message are you receiving?</p>
<p>No code, the message that pops up simply says the game couldn't start and to try downloading it again.&nbsp; It then says to visit xbox.com/support.&nbsp; It should be noted this message appears when I try to play any of the games, whether disc based or downloaded.</p>

<p>So that is that, the only other thing I can think to say is all other content on my 360 works fine including add-ons, movies, apps, about 20 XBL Arcade games, Indie games, and any other installed content along with just regular old 360 disc-based games.&nbsp;
 Any help here would be nice, I know all of these games are compatible, anyone else having these issues?</p>

<p>Yes I have, that is where I began and got the idea to clear system cache and reinstall the update. &nbsp;The only step I have not taken from that post is reformatting my hard drive, which I would rather not do as their is over 50GB of installed and downloaded
<p>If it helps clarify further, the more I think about it I believe all of these games (the downloadable ones at least) stopped working when I got this hard drive which I bought used as an upgrade to my old 20GB. &nbsp;The drive itself is an official Microsoft drive,
 although is off an Elite system (the drive is black, my box is just a vanilla variant). &nbsp;When I first installed it I don't remember if I formatted it as it was already blank and I assumed it was formatted by the store I purchased it from. &nbsp;Before I bother
 with wiping the whole thing can anyone confirm if this may be the solution?</p>

<p>I would suggest double checking your license transfers by calling 1-800-4my-Xbox, make sure they're all set. &nbsp;After that, if you already tried clearing the cache and re-downloading the games and updates, and still have no progress, then get your hands on
 a flash drive or use the cloud to back up your saves, and format the HDD. &nbsp;I hope you get your games working.</p>

<p>The casing may well be from a genuine hard drive but the actual drive itself I suspect isn't, even if you format the drive on the console it shouldn't cause any issues with backwards compatabilty. I honestly believe whoever traded the drive in has swapped
 out the original hard drive for a third party hard drive. Formatting it now will I suspect resolve nothing.</p>

<h2>            Large file transfer over network starts and stop again when using hostname</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Here's the setup I have for this transfer (system specs of the laptop at the bottom of the post)</p>
<p><br />
1 Desktop comp on win 7 Pro 64 bits</p>
<p>1 laptop on win 7 Pro 32 bits</p>
<p><br />
I have a file to transfer from the laptop to the desktop, this file is about 1.5GBytes (virtual machine hard drive file).</p>
<p>The desktop is wired to a switch, the laptop is on a wireless hotspot connected to that same switch.</p>
<p>Whenever I access my laptop throught it's hostname (\\mylaptop\whateverfolder) I get this</p>
<p><a href="http://a.imageshack.us/img221/3498/wirednetwork1hostname.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://a.imageshack.us/img221/3498/wirednetwork1hostname.jpg</a></p>
<p>Same transfer, but using IP address to access the laptop (\\192.168.x.x\whateverfolder)</p>
<p><a href="http://a.imageshack.us/img221/4909/wirednetwork2ipaddress.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://a.imageshack.us/img221/4909/wirednetwork2ipaddress.jpg</a></p>
<p>As you can see, when I use the IP address the transfer isn't interrupted</p>
<p>I've also tried without antivirus, nothing changed.</p>
<p>I've tried initiating the file transfer with the laptop, same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the specs for the laptop (I have the same trouble copying files from the desktop to the laptop using hostname)</p>
<p>It's an Acer Aspire AS3410-723G25n</p>
<p>Wireless adapter is an Atheros AR5B93 Wireless Network Adapter</p>
<p>NIC : Atheris AR8131 PCI-E Gigabit ethernet Controller</p>
<p>Desktop :</p>
<p>Motherboard : Asus P6T Deluxe v2</p>
NIC : Marvell Yukon 88E8056 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller
<p>All drivers are, of course, up-to-date</p>
<p>If more infos are needed, just ask and I'll do my best to answer :)</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
edit : I apparently placed this post in the wrong section (Files, Folders, and Search), can someone please move it to the appropriate network section ? Thanks

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I seem to have corrected the issue by clearing both hosts (system32/drivers/etc/) files, that had a lot of entries from spybot search &amp; destroy (that I removed quite a while ago).</p>
<p>Transfers now work fine with either hostname or IP address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the help thought :)</p>

                    Dear All,<br />
<br />
I've been trying to install this update for Microsoft Office InfoPath 2007 for quite a while now, and nothing seems to be working. The error code on the Windows Update section says 57A, and a first glance at some other issues relating to 57A seem to involve
 dual monitors. Something that I have. I have however unplugged my other monitor, and rebooted my computer - still it will not install.<br />
<br />
On the event viewer I get a number of error codes:<br />
<br />
Windows Update Client - 0x80070643<br />
MsiInstaller - Error code 1603<br />
MsiInstaller - Error 1402.Setup cannot open the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Classes\CLSID\{60A896CA-1649-45BF-B63F-2E7312A968F0}\InprocServer32.&nbsp; Verify that you have sufficient permissions to access the registry or contact Microsoft Product Support
 Services (PSS) for assistance.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I think this last one is probably the answer, a registry problem. I've had issues with the registry since I tried to use a cleaner (I did check the validity of the program, scanned using two programs before etc., but...). Does this suggest that there is a problem
 with my Registry, and if so, how could I look to amend this please?<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

<p>Hi Ian Clark,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
Try these suggestions to fix the issue.<br />
<br />
Unregister Windows Installer, and then reregister Windows Installer. <br />
<br />
<strong>To do this, follow these steps: <br />
</strong>&nbsp;<br />
1. On the "Start" menu, click "Run:.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. In the "Open" box, type "msiexec /unreg", and then press ENTER. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. On the "Start" menu, click "Run". <br />
&nbsp;<br />
4. In the "Open" box, type "msiexec /regserver", and then press ENTER.</p>
<p><strong>Configure regedit so that the registry key mentioned in the error is set to have permissions for Everyone.<br />
</strong><br />
Here’s how:<br />
<br />
1)&nbsp; Open the registry editor by typing regedit on the start menu search field and then clicking on regedit.<br />
2)&nbsp; Browse through the registry and select the entry mentioned in the error message.<br />
3)&nbsp; Choose "Permissions..." from either the edit menu or by right-clicking on the registry key's parent directory.<br />
4)&nbsp; Click the "Advanced" button to add a new user.<br />
5)&nbsp; Type in "Everyone" as the new user and click OK.<br />
6)&nbsp; Configure the permissions for user "Everyone" to "Full Control".<br />
<br />
Once this is done, download the update from Microsoft download center.<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Sorry but this didn't work for me. I did exactly as you said, but I'm still told I don't have permission to view the file and the download still doesn't work. Please view the uploaded image:<br />
http://img710.imageshack.us/img710/9206/registry.png<br />
<br />
This seems to also be a wider registry issue that I'm having that's preventing me from amending almost every registry value. Would it be possible to also to tell me how I could look to amending all of my "access denied" errors, and with it hopefully correcting
 this issue? Should I also be adding the administrators group to the list, as I suppose my viewing of regedit comes under the "Administrators" umbrella group?
<br />
<br />
Many thanks for your swift help, I really appreciate it, and just want to be able to use my computer!<br />

            Microsoft Support suggests changing the ACL for an entire registry key to "Full Control" for&nbsp;"Everyone"? I'm sorry, why exactly are we subjected to ACLs if we're going to set them all to "Full Control" for "Everyone" any time something doesn't work? WFW

<h2>            Windows 10 constantly freezing &#40;after windows 10 creators update&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hey all</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i have been having this problem for a very long time. Ever since install the windows 10 creators update I have had constant freezing 24/7. I cant have more then 2 windows and if i dare open a web browser the screen will be forever frozen until I manually
 turn the PC off by the power. What usually happens before freezing is:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Windows will not allow me to open any apps, programs or any other file, nor can i end any process even if task manager is open.</li><li>Windows will allow me to go through the menu and click on buttons but nothing will happen.</li><li>if i dare right click the menu bar or any part of the screen or even touch cortana, my PC will be frozen forever</li><li>Also if my computer is running for more then 10 minutes and it still hasen't come to a complete freeze, its doing very well.</li></ul>
<p>All this will happen anyway whether I try to interact with my desktop or not, it will just happen slower.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CPU I7-4770</p>
<p>GPU GTX-1069</p>
<p>RAM 32GB</p>
<p>Motherboard: ASUStek COMPUTER INC (cant remember model)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even after the windows creators update, Ive seen very small slight improvements, but the freezing was so bad that my computer was just unable. Ive tried many solutions from search online but nothing has worked. I got sick of all the freezing and have temporarily
 gone back to windows 8.1</p>

            Which Antivirus utility do you have installed? Have you tried disabling it?
<br />
<br />The first thing I would do is, power down the system, open the system unit and make sure everything is installed and fitted securely: memory, videos cards etc.
<br />
<br />Your RAM modules might be corrupt, try scanning them for errors.

<br />Reset your BIOS Defaults.

<br />
<br />
<br />Disconnect all external devices
<br />
<br />I would try updating all critical drivers. 
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters. 
<br />
<br />If these suggestions do not work...
<br />
<br />You can try updating to the most recent Windows 10 release, version 1803:

<p>Hey Strok3 I'm glad to know I'm not the only one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Andre for the reply, i haven't tried all of these solutions but ill definitely have a crack at them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far Ive tried</p>
<ul>
<li>Scanning my RAM (no its not corrupt and its still in the barn yard)</li><li>I have installed the latest drivers for the BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, (I haven't tried the Network adapter drivers yet but all other drivers and firmware i installed made no difference)<br />
</li><li>Ive tried upgrading to 1803 (This has made a slight difference but still the system is still unusable)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I also forgot to mention that my PC is a custom built computer and that my motherboard is an ASUS Z87-Expert</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it mainly the motherboard that determines whether the system is compatible with windows 10 or is actually a range of difference things i haven't thought of as well?</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I beleive overall Microsoft performance over the decades remains the same: bad. Their products, only steal time from users and admins. Even if they fix something, immediately some other bug emerges, in anyncase they are not in hurry, obviously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really, Windows as a product, is near 30 years in development, and it survived over several technology generations, re-incarnating in dozens of versions and levels, it is the most long running and money consuming project in human history (becides geoplitics);</p>
<p>
</p><p>And take a look where they are now? Behold, the same all bugs I have had ten years ago: printer issues, sleep issue, network connectivity issues, fisplay drivers issues etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They just cannot fix it once and for all! They are unable to fix it! They sell us this crap, and we buy it, because what other choice we have ("we do as everybody does").</p>
<p>
</p><p>And just look at their level communication with their custpmers! They have trained AI to scan the forums and post typically useless advices... You will never real, human support from them.. they isolated themselves, they live from us, the customers, they
 feed on our money but they do not solve the problems!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hardware demands grow.. theybstarted from 3MB for a whole system, and then they wanted more and more and more. &nbsp;Now typical systems to be stable and usable, have to have hundreds of gig to operate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wherr this space goes to!? Does this add to the value of the product? No! The same old typical tasks average user performed 10 years ago he performs now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now it consumes 10x resources and adds 10x more</p>
<p>Bugs!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fifteen years ago, I had to spend 2 month to build "a system of my dream" based on WindowsXP; I am working on the same goal with Windows 10, for almost nine month good portion of every week! Hey, Microsoft! I am end-user and I dont have to do your (highly
 paid) job for free!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My time also costs money. You steal time from me is equal to you steal money from me. This is simply not appropriate!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A computer is an instrument. An instrument help human to work more efficiently. Instrument saves time, resources and multiply our efforts. And for this, we pay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Windows foes not save time any more. Nine months (9!!!) I am still not happy with my system and the bugs keep on emerging at the rate I hardly can follow. Old bugs come back. New bugs are introduced with every update. Et cetera, et cetera...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Winfows does not save my resorfes anymore. In fact,it constantly consumes them. I have to add hardware which is "more compatible" and software which is "more friendly" than that of Microsoft to compensate their bad design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Winfows does not multiply my efforts anymore. Because 90% of the efforts is dealing with Windows anr the programs itself! They have become too complex</p>
<p>&nbsp;and too unstable, just to learn to use them takes years, if you want to be really competent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just cannot get to work and to actually BENEFIT from this system. If I ignore the millions of bugs and rely on the system "as is", that only means that I will lose the time and resources and efforts, but distributed along the years. Each day, instead of
 working productively I will be loosing with Microsoft here and there and there is no escape from that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really really really hate the Microsoft and the products and I beleive that so many people share the same feeling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider the text a Manifest!</p>

            <p>Three options.</p>
<p>1: Grab the corners of the window and drag it to full screen size. Do not use Maximize. Close all other windows first via the Taskbar and this one last. Windows will remember the size used of the last window closed the next time you open the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>2: Whichever shortcut you are using to launch the window, right click it and select properties. Under the 'Run' drop-down, choose "Maximized".</p>
<p>3: IE New Window Maximizer<br />

                    Hi All,
<div><br />
<div>I have been trying to explore the Signtool option "/as" to append a signature. I wanted to know if this option could be used to append a signature to an exe or a dll ? I have tried to search on the web for an example using the "/as" option and am not able
 to any, Could anyone who has used this share their experience?&nbsp;</div>

    <title>UAC when opening the Sound window. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevolin  say:</h3>
<h2>            UAC when opening the Sound window.</h2>
                    <p>Since the end of April, many things started happening:</p>
<ol>
<li>Opening the Sound window by right clicking the speakers icon and clicking either "Playback Devices", "Recording Devices", or "Sounds" prompts user for permission (User Access Control window).</li><li>Viewing videos in fullscreen on one monitor while the current active (last clicked in) window is on another will make my taskbar show up in front of the fullscreened video.</li><li>Audio playback device not properly changing when plugging into the audio jack.</li></ol>
<p>#2 might not be related to Windows but I threw it in there since everything started happening the same day. This is what is prompted when trying to open the Sound window:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what I can do to fix or at least troubleshoot/detect the issue?</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I understand the inconvenience you are facing. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may be facing the above issue due to the built-in administrator enabled on your PC instead of normal administrator/local user account. Disabling the built-in administrator account will help you to login into normal administrator user profile.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong><span>: I suggest you to follow the steps below to
<strong>disable</strong> the <strong>Built-in administrator user account</strong> and check if the issue is resolved.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows logo + R</strong> keys on the keyboard to open run command, type
<strong>gpedit.msc</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong> to open <strong>Local group policy editor</strong> on your PC.</span></li><li><span>Double click on the following program sequence: <strong>Computer Configuration &gt; Windows Settings &gt; Security Settings &gt; Local Policies &gt; Security Options</strong></span></li><li><span>Locate <strong>User account control:admin approval mode for the built in administrator account</strong> from the window and double click on it.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Enable</strong> from the pop-up window and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></li><li><span>Close the window and check if the changes are effective.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2</strong><span>: let us try to enable the <em>Local Security Setting</em> and check if it helps.(if you are using Windows 10 Pro).</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>R</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In run dialog box type: <strong><em>secpol.msc</em></strong><em>.</em></span></li><li><span>Navigate to <strong><em>Local Policies</em></strong> &gt;<strong><em>Security Options</em></strong> &gt; locate
<strong><em>User Access Control: Admin Approval Mode For built in</em></strong>…..</span></li><li><span>Double-click on it and select <strong><em>Enabled</em></strong> and the click
<strong><em>OK</em></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span></li></ol>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 3</strong><span>: Let us check if the User Account Settings is set to default:</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>X</strong> keys, and select <strong>
Control Panel</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>User Accounts</strong> and select the <strong>Change User Account Control settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Drag the slider to the second option (default).</span></li></ol>

<p>(1 and 2 might be because I'm not on Windows 10 Pro. However, I checked the built-in administrator user account through other means and found that is currently not active, and also set it to inactive myself.)</p>

 problem and thought I'd post to help anyone else in the future.</span><br />
<br />
 work though as the windows updater would keep automatically re-installing it when I rebooted. Here's what I did to fix the issue:</span><br />
<br />
 page (you don't need to do anything there) and choose "Play test sounds".</span><br />
<br />
 audio driver" instead of the Realtek HD Audio Driver. Now once you have confirmed that:</span><br />
<br />
<br />
 playback devices etc.</span><br />
<br />
 the prompt is worth using it over the windows driver or not.</span><br />
