            Signal strength is a function of the card itself and cannot be influenced by Windows. Make sure automatic selection of the network standard is enabled (b/g/n)

Looks like I will be "working" tomorrow, so may not be around much for a little while...<br />

Maybe somebody else can help you if you have any questions in the meantime.<br />

In your next pass at timings, I think I would disable Windows Defender too (too much protection):&nbsp;
<br />

What Internet Browser are you using most of the time?&nbsp; You can have several installed at the same time.<br />
<br />
If you are primarily using Internet Explorer (ugh), you may want to check out Firefox:<br />

            If I use CCleaner for example, the startup list is empty but of course I do have XP Services starting up.<br />
<br />
You have a lot of startup items related to Skype, camera stuff, photo stuff, etc.&nbsp; I have a lot of that stuff installed too, but I don't keep it running all day and don't have it loading at startup, but I am not really a social networker - but there are some
 other things in there you can just get rid of.&nbsp; Some folks "need" all that stuff to be running all the time, I just want my stuff running on demand.<br />
<br />
Let's do this first...<br />
<br />
You should time your startup before making any changes to you can see what happens when you make adjustments.&nbsp; I can get paid $1 for every second I can take off a boot time (up to $50).&nbsp;&nbsp; In order to get paid, I would like to say here is the before time and
 here is the after time.&nbsp; If your boot time increases, there is no charge!<br />
<br />
I believe I could just take a system into the back room for an hour or so, do nothing, give it back to the person and they would say, yes - that's a lot faster (psychologically)!&nbsp;&nbsp; So I like to measure things.<br />
<br />
Here is a good free tool to use to measure your boot time that does not install anything, so use it to see what your boot time is now, then make a few adjustments (not too many all at once) and run it again.&nbsp; You will also have a nice bar graph so you can see
 what takes a log time to start and then decide if you really need it loading or not:<br />
<br />
BootlogXP:<br />
<a href="http://www.greatis.com/utilities/bootlogxp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.greatis.com/utilities/bootlogxp/</a><br />
<br />
Set your system up to login automatically (if it is not already) so there is no human component involved in your startup timing (test that part first to make sure XP logs you in automatically), run Bootvis and it will ask you to restart and be patient as it
 works, then it will give you a nice bar chart and the total boot time so you can write it down (or print it).&nbsp; What are all those big horizontal lines in the graph and who it taking the most time and do you really need them?!&nbsp;&nbsp; Write a few of those down too.<br />
<br />
Using CCleaner, <span style="font-weight: bold">Disable</span> (<span style="font-weight: bold">do not</span> Delete) for example, the Java Automatic Updater and the Adobe Automatic Updater:<br />
<br />
SunJavaUpdateSched&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Java\Java Update\jusched.exe<br />
<br />
Adobe ARM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "C:\Program Files\Common Files\Adobe\ARM\1.0\AdobeARM.exe<br />
<br />
I know that I can run the Adobe and Java updater manually once a month or so if I feel like it and they will check for updates anyway whenever I use them so there is no need for them to be starting every time my system restarts and running all day long with
 nothing to do.<br />
<br />
After the adjustments, run BootlogXP again and see if there is an improvement in the total boot time, and if so, by how much.
<br />
<br />
There are a few other things in there that I would get rid of, but let's start with those two first - and now you also have a way to measure things (at least your startup times) instead of thinking it might be faster maybe...<br />

            <p>Okay so I have no idea what or how this happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I just had task manager up and randomly the task at just loaded with a blank desktop screen. As you can tell I was really happy after days of having a black screen with cursor and nothing working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But everything is extremely slow and barely loads. I'm worried if my laptop restarts or I turn it off that it will just go back to black screen. How can I ensure it stays working or how do I even make it faster everything is ridiculously slow. Thanks</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p><br />
Does anyone know where the option of how much the volume changes when using the Volume up / down command has gone to?</p>

<p>It used to be in under TV &amp; OneGuide -&gt; Troubleshooting -&gt; Audio but now I can't seem to find it in any menu and resetting the TV and kinect don't seem to pull the option up anymore.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

    <title>WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN MY LIFE &#36;25 GIFT CARD XBOX LIVE MEMBER - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joey10pack  say:</h3>
<h2>            WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN MY LIFE &#36;25 GIFT CARD XBOX LIVE MEMBER</h2>
                    
<p>Ok so where do I start.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I just talked to both a customer service rep and the supervisor. ID #1309559939. So basically what I did was the following. I ran out and had 2 options in front of me. A 59.99 12 month gold package from a store or a $25-50 gift card. Not having enough for
 the 12 month gold until friday and my previous 12 month just expiring I was left with this problem to get back online.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So I bought the $25 gift card to buy a 3 month gold or a 1 month I do not really care. Learning this now I kinda recalled it and hesitated almost to purchase a prepaid credit card for $30 thinking the gift card wouldn't work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Little does the prepaid card mention anything about it being unable to be used to purchase xbox live memberships. NOWHERE.</p>

<p>It says</p>

<p>XBOX</p>

<p>Buy games,movies,music* "and more" on xbox and windows.</p>
<p>SEE BACK FOR MORE :)&nbsp;</p>

<p>$25 microsoft</p>

<p>BACK</p>

<p>All it says is may be used for eligible purchases (exclusions apply) &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Doesn't mention what it excludes...</p>

<p>Thats all it says. So ya wasn't able to get on xbox live was told by the people running the customer service department GLEN S AND JASON D. (Don't deserve jobs..) Couldn't help me with anything. I have been on xbox live for 8 years... Thats a good 5 xbox
 360's deep 1 original xbox and hundreds of games and hours of my life. And these people can't give me a trial code or a extension on my xbox live. These people in that situation and yes I said these people.... Terrible employees and abilities these employees
 have to offer the customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no loyalty there is no customer service other then informing you they cannot help you. I have a xbox one on pre order with halo and I'm strongly reconsidering this after this event. I feel offended and insulted that there is no solution other then
 to bend over. So again thank you to the customer service of microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Worst customer service ever.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sorry you're upset. &nbsp;However, currency cards have never been allowed as a payment method for a Gold membership. &nbsp;Your only options for a Gold membership have always been either a pre-paid Gold card, credit card or paypal. &nbsp;This is because when you purchase a membership online the system automatically sets itself up to auto renew unless you turn it off.</p>
<p>Even purchasing a pre-paid/refillable credit card would not have worked as they are not allowed either.</p>

<p>I can sympathize with Joey10, </p>
<p>I use to be a fan of Microsoft, until they started with this strategy, is it necessary to create a purchasing format confusing to the novice customer, disrespectful to make the customers jump through these hoops and be demeaned by arrogant, staff that have
 the gall to blame the customer for not reading the fine print. </p>
<p>I realize that most customers will not fight for their rights when obstacles are placed in their path, and if abused, will turn tail and run, rather than argue their rights, but now we are talking more than $5 bucks, when $50 bucks they will fight and will
 not let arrogant fools tell them, you should have read the note.</p>

<p>Ummm it's clearly written on the front of the card</p>
<p>Dlc games and movies and music nothing about subscriptions</p>
<p>Even when you purchase subscriptions it clearly states you need to turn on autorenewal and you need a billing sccount</p>
<p>I don't know how many more info you need</p>
<p>Any promotions also make it clear what you need &nbsp;a renewable payment option </p>
<p>No online service allows currency to be used for online subscriptions</p>
<p>So what makes you think it could ever be used if no one else uses it</p>
<p>You have clearly labelled prepaid membership cards and currency cards specially labelled for dlc</p>
<p>It is not the services issue if the user doesn't use common sense</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>I recently tried to tried to get into steam on windows 10 and it has only recently after their latest update gave me the message 'failed to load steamui.dll', i contacted them to see if they could help and mentioned that it could be a windows component that
 may be the problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched on the community to see if i could find any solutions and found a post saying to use the command prompt (admin) and type in '<span>regsvr32
</span>steamui.dll', i did this and got a message that the module in question was missing. i uninstalled steam and reinstalled it again and i still get the 'failed to load steamui.dll' message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted steam once again to see if there is any more help to try and solve this but i thought i would as here aswell as i dont understand what could be causing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this will be greatly appreciated</p>

<h2>            HP laptop with Intel Chip set and HP motherboard, originally had Windows 8 was upgraded to Windows 10 then WiUSB USB Controller stopped&#63;</h2>
                    My niece has an HP laptop with Windows 10 upgrade on it and the intel-wiusb-driver-not-working-properly. She cannot use more than one USB device such as a music device or when she tries to download picture from her camera via a USB connection. We plugged
 in a USB mouse controller and in the front socket it was not recognized and the eject command did not show up in My Computer, it does work in the USB next to the HDMI port. I also tried the USB connection next to the DVD/CD player and was not able to get a
 connection. In the tech 8 Forum it showed a reimage site that will reload the driver but do I need to reimage back to Windows 8.1 in order to install the driver and is it a Microsoft driver or an Intel driver?

</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />

2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the the

7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />

<br />
1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>

If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />

If&nbsp;you do not have a Microsoft Vista DVD, borrow one from a friend.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Internet connection and activation</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys!</p>
<p>Laptop- Gateway ID79C<br />
Ok so strange issue, I've upgraded from windows 7 to windows 10 using the media creation tool. Now that I've upgraded my OS is not activated. It appears I'm unable to activate it due to the fact that the OS does no recognize I'm connected to the internet. I'm
 able to browse the web connected to my wifi network, however, apps like the microsoft app store, outlook and the built in bing search register me as not connected to the internet. This issue has persisted across multiple wifi networks. II'm also not able to
 check for updates. I have attempted to manually enter my product key however the program states theyre not able to do that with my product key.
<br />
<br />
Strange issue, I have an alienware 17 as well and all is working fine on that. </p>

            Hi Youcef.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give all possible steps for troubleshooting Bluetooth in order of priority:
<br />
<br />Make sure you're pairing correctly as shown here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15290/windows-connect-bluetooth-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15290/...</a>
<br />
<br /> See Fixes here which are all working:  
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1017867/make-windows-10-recognize-bluetooth-dongle-as-bluetooth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://superuser.com/questions/1017867/make-wi...</a>
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />If this is a mic or headset right click Volume icon in System Tray to Open Sound Settings,  make sure the correct device is selected for input or output in the dropdown menu.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Screensaver - Failing to Start &#40;Not Starting&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zoele  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screensaver - Failing to Start &#40;Not Starting&#41;</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Windows doesn't procure the screensaver resulting in;</p>
<p>- an unlocked computer,</p>
<p>- a screen constantly showing the desktop</p>
<p><strong>Suspected Cause(s):</strong> Windows Media Centre,&nbsp; Intellipoint Drivers</p>
<p><strong>More Information:</strong> This has been happening for a long time with vista laptops and windows mice. I've looked around and it seems to have something to do with Windows Media Centre (ref: http://bryantlikes.com/ScreenSaverDoesntActivateInVista.aspx)
 . I have enough problems with the fact that Windows Media Centre is annoying and useless (to me) but now when it causes problems the solution would be UNINSTALL THIS GARBAGE.</p>
<p>Can't do that... but you can go through a rigamaroll to disable WMC in services. Thats a bit much. Microsoft you reading? Make WMC a windows feature you can just turn off in Programs and Features.</p>
<p><strong>Concerns: </strong>This isn't the first issue Vista has had with the screensaver not being procured. The screensaver is peace of mind for many people. It NEEDS to occur to protect the information of the current user. If it doesn't it means Windows
 is broken and potentially unsecure. Why do so many programs have the ability to interrupt the countdown till the screensaver occurs? Shouldn't the check for human interface device activity be handled by a program or driver that oversees all HIDs? Shouldn't
 THIS be the ONLY program or driver able to interrupt the screensaver countdown. How come Microsoft can't even get this right? Twice if not more now.</p>
<p>Just let someone tell me the solution is buying Windows 7. I dare you.</p>
<p>(Linux is looking mighty fine for day to day usage right now. I could turn on Windows whenever I feel like dealing with fail or whenever I wanted to run my windows applications and when I finish I could switch over to linux and let the computer idle and
 run my idle programs securely there.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I hope you all come up with a proper solution/fix because this isn't the Non HID compliant etc fix. I already have that. Hop to it Microsoft, don't leave people on Vista hanging.</p>

<p>Zoele,</p>
<p>I'm looking to get some more information on your issue.</p>
<p>Does the issue persist when Windows Media Center is closed?<br />
Also, have you tried adjusting the power management settings for your mouse:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start </strong>and type <strong>Device Manager</strong> and press
<strong>Enter</strong> </li><li>Find your mouse that's causing the issue, right click on it and choose <strong>
Properties</strong> </li><li>Choose the <strong>Power Management</strong> tab at the top of the window </li><li>Try different combinations of enabling or disabling these settings to see if the issue persists
</li></ol>

<br />
<br />Format Factory is totally free and will convert and/or compress any video file, much quicker than any other software
<br />
<br />If you have a multi-core processor, it will even convert multiple videos at the same time . . .

            Hi EdRude,
<br />
<br />I'm sorry to hear about your issues with Cortana. After reading your description of the issue I looked for info and found this statement directly from Microsoft:
<br />
<br />"Cortana is part of the Windows 10 experience in the locales where she is available. This means Cortana can't be entirely turned off. For Cortana to work well, she needs to be integrated into the operating system. If you don’t want this functionality available to you follow these steps to hide Cortana from the taskbar: 
<br />Right-click (or press and hold) the search box, hover over Cortana, and then select Hidden from the side menu. This will also remove the search box from your taskbar. We don’t recommend hacking registry settings or similar measures as this can make your operating system unstable or crash. 
<br />You can review and control exactly what personal information Cortana can access by clicking into the search box and selecting Settings   on the left pane. You can also search "Cortana settings" in the search box on the taskbar, and select Cortana &amp; Search settings from the results.
<br />Note: Cortana is removed from the Windows 10 Education and Windows 10 Pro Education editions. See Windows 10 editions for education customers for more info."
<br />
<br />I hope this helps to clarify things for you.

            Hello, EdRude,
<br />
<br />What steps have you taken so I do not repeat the procedure?
<br />
<br />1) To hide Cortana:
<br />Press and hold (or right-click) anywhere on the taskbar.
<br />Select Cortana.
<br />Select Hidden.
<br />
<br />2) You can edit the registry - Ensure you create a Backup for the Registry before making the changes.
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Search.
<br />
<br />Press Winkey + R to open Run box
<br />Type Regedit then press Enter or Ok
<br />Navigate to the following key.
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Search.
<br />If you don’t see a “Windows Search” key (folder) below the Windows folder, right-click the Windows folder and select New &gt; Key. Name it “Windows Search”.
<br />Right-click the “Windows Search” key (folder) in the left pane and select New &gt; DWORD (32-bit) Value.
<br />Name the value “AllowCortana”. Double-click it and set the value to “0”.
<br />

<br />
<br />Close the Registry and Reboot the computer for changes to take effect.
<br />
<br />If you decide you want to reenable Cortana in the future, go back to "AllowCortana" key and change the value to 1.

<h2>            Windows will not accept password</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I am trying to fix my son's tablet. It is a Windows Linx, I think it is running Windows 10. I created an email address for him and he has always used the same password but now it won't let him log in. I click on reset password and I get an error message
 that says "This feature required removable media, such as a USB flash drive. Please connect a USB flash drive and try again".I have tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking the eye button so I can see the characters entered</p>
<p>Logging on to his email account on my laptop (password works fine)</p>
<p>Using the on screen keyboard / holding shift key to get to troubleshooting. I cannot reset this PC, or go to advanced settings and do system restore or use the command prompt as it always asks me for a password. I also cannot get into safe mode through start
 up settings as when I get the list of options the touch screen does not work and I have no separate keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also telling me I need to free up space to do a restore but I can't get in to do it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!!</p>
<p />

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>No that is one of the problems I am having, I cannot get into safe mode as after I click on Startup settings I am unable to select number 4 as the tablet touchscreen will not allow me to. Touchscreen works fine on all other screens!</p>

<p>In Windows Explorer on the root of the external drive, right click and click on properties.&nbsp; Go to the Security tab.&nbsp; Add your name to the list of approved users and give yourself full rights and be sure to check the box to apply this to all files and sub-directories
 as well.&nbsp; Then click on advanced and do essentially the same thing in the Special Permissions section.&nbsp; Make sure the special permissions section does not deny access to to the Everyone user - if so, edit it to allow access (at least read only but any kind
 of access will do - if denied, this entry overrides everything else).&nbsp; While in the Advanced section, click on the ownership tab and make yourself the owner of the drive (and again check&nbsp; the box to apply it to alll files and subdirectories as well).&nbsp; This
 should resolve the problem.&nbsp; If you can't complete the tasks (you get stuck on some file or folder), try to amend that folder or file directly and once done restart the global process.&nbsp; If you can't, move it temporarily from the drive until you've done the
 rest and then return it and try again to change it - especially if that's the folder or file you're talking about.&nbsp; If you still have problems with that file/folder and the following articles don't help, post back with an explanation of exactly what happens
 or doesn't happen when you try to change it and I'll see if I can identify a reason and help you fix it.</p>
<p>Here's some additional information on permissions and ownership in case you run into problems or want more details on the procedures:</p>
<p><span>To see your permissions, right click the folder/file, click on properties, and check out the security tab.&nbsp; Check to see what permissions
 you have by clicking on your username (or user group).&nbsp; Here are&nbsp;the types of permissions you can have:</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You need to be an administrator or the&nbsp;owner to change permissions (and sometimes being an administrator or even an owner isn't enough - there are ways to block even them from access (though a smart administrator knows these ways and can get around them -
 but usually shouldn't because they were denied access usually for a very good reason).&nbsp; Here's how to change folder permissions in Vista:</span><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/</span></span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;</span>To
 add take and grant full right permissions and ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:</span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/</span></span></a><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>To fix this problem with the folders, take<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ownership</span> of the folders or the drive (as an administrator) and give
 yourself full rights.&nbsp; Right click the folder/drive, click on properties, go to the security tab and click on Advanced and then click on the Owner tab.&nbsp; Click edit and then click the name of the person you want to give ownership to (you may need to add it
 if it isn't there - or it may be yourself). If you want it to apply to sub-folders and files within that folder/drive, then check the box for replace owner on sub-containers and objects and click OK.&nbsp; Back out and now there's a new owner for the folders/drive
 and files who can change permissions as needed.&nbsp; Here's more information on taking ownership of a file or folder:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html</span></span></a></span><span>.<span>&nbsp;</span>To
