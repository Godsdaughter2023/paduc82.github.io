    <title>Why is sending and receiving email with outlook.com for other - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why is sending and receiving email with outlook.com for other &#40;pop3&#41; accounts so slow&#63;</h2>
                    I love the interface of outlook.com, but unfortunatly it is not usable for me, because if I send or receive email for other accounts (pop3-accounts) this is very slow. E.g. I already have the email in the webmail interface, and it takes for 30 minutes
 until my outlook.com account gets it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there any way to improve that - or is it a bug that will be fixed?

This is not a fix.&nbsp; It is unresonable to expect people to follow those steps everytime they wish to check email.&nbsp; And waiting 30 minutes to fetch email is way too long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a fix to this proplem?</p>

            Andy - I have the same issue. Someone will send an email, and it takes at least 15-30 minutes to receive through pop3. How is this possible with modern technology?
<div><br />
<div>I was using gmail, but am not crazy about the UI and thought this looked very 'clean.' But clean doesn't matter if I can't receive email in a timely matter. If someone sends something for me to look at while we're in a live meeting, I can't be waiting
 30 minutes for it to arrive.</div>

<span>I discovered a work around....</span>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li><b>In outlook.com</b><span>&nbsp;</span>settings go to Sending/receiving email from other accounts
</li><li>Select Add another account to send mail from </li><li>Enter your gmail address and&nbsp;confirm you're you when prompted </li><li><b>Now go to gmail. &nbsp;</b> </li><li><b>I</b>n your gmail settings<span>&nbsp;</span>go to Forwarding and POP/IMAP
</li><li>Select Add a forwarding address - add your outlook.com address </li><li>Configure this setting to your preferences.</li></ul>
<div>Now your incoming email to gmail will&nbsp;forward&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;to outlook.com. &nbsp;I did this and it is working great for me. &nbsp;Another nice surprse I found is when I receive email in&nbsp;the outlook.com box that was forwarded from&nbsp;my google account I can
 respond, or forward it and the "from" field indicates my google address. &nbsp;This is nice because it does not cause confusion on the part of the original sender when they receive a response from an unknown email address. &nbsp;But if you wish when you're in the compose
 email screen (either a new email or forwarding) you can click the "from" field and change the email address that you're actually sending from, gmail or outlook.&nbsp; Also when composing a new email you can select if the email should be&nbsp;sent&nbsp;with the google address
 or the outlook.com address.&nbsp; Pretty handy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let me know if this works for you or if you need clarification!</div>

<p>Like you Beth I use google apps to host my domain.&nbsp; My google email address is not @gmail but rather @my_domain.com.&nbsp; So the process I outlined above works fine for your situation :)&nbsp; Give it a try and if&nbsp;you hit a snag let me know and I'll walk you through
 it.&nbsp;<br />

Yep.&nbsp; You can specify which emails get forwarded and which remain there in google's house.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand how you folks feel about this issue. There are several factors that can affect the speed of POP3 mail. These include, but are not limited to:</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>1. The number of messages in the mailbox, specifically the inbox. The more messages, the slower it is, due to the amount of data that must be read. The maximum file limit is 30MB.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>2. How often the POP3 client is set to retrieve new messages. If the previous session did not complete before a new session is initiated this will cause performance issues. That is why the "check for new mail" setting is set for 30 minute intervals.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>3. The internet connection rate and speed</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>4. The capabilities of the computer, such as processor speed, RAM, etc.</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>5. Traffic on the servers</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Best regards.</span></p>

            <p>Maybe try a power cycling (soft reset of the phone).</p>
<p>Also try going into the Bluetooth section of Settings on the phone and deleting the pairing connection information for your car, etc. and then let it 'rediscover them' and attempt pairing again.</p>

    <title>Inserting Symbols - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cpatton99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inserting Symbols</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I've recently moved from Office 2007 on Windows XP ("old system") to Office 365 on a Mac ("new system"). I sometimes work with Old English texts and need a number of special characters --
 thorn, eth, aesc, vowels with macron accents (bars), a few others. Book Antiqua, my go-to font on the old system, had almost all of these, and when I needed something it didn't have, I worked in Cardo, a downloadable font designed for transcription of medieval
 manuscripts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I've run into two problems on the new system ...</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One, in documents created on the old system in Book Antiqua, some characters (e.g., vowels with macrons) render on the new system either as an empty box (in Book Antiqua) or as the desired
 character (but in Times New Roman). (Documents in Cardo seem to render these characters faithfully.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Second, no matter what I do on the new system, I can't get Word to display all the characters available in, say, Cardo. So even though a thorn, say, renders faithfully in a document created
 on the old system, I have no way of inserting a thorn in a document on the new system.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So my questions are ...</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>One, is Book Antiqua really less robust in a Mac OS than in Windows? That seems unlikely, but if the font is the same across systems, why are characters that rendered in Book Antiqua on
 my old system reverting to Times New Roman on my new system?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Two, more critically, how do I get Word in Office 365 to offer the full range of symbols available in a given font? Under the "Insert &gt; Symbol" function, the Symbol Browser just beeps at
 me when I click on a character I want,&nbsp;if&nbsp;it's there (and several I need, e.g. the thorn,&nbsp;aren't). And the "Advanced Symbol" option displays the same small set of characters, no matter what font I select.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Am very thankful for any help anyone can offer!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>CP</span></p>

            UPDATE ...
<div><br />
<div>I've found all the characters I need using Character Viewer. So if Word itself offers no way to enter special Unicode characters, I can do it through Character Viewer. Still, it would be great if I could create keyboard shortcuts in Word for the characters
 I use frequently. That still means getting access, in Word, to characters by their Unicode identifiers ... ideas, anyone?</div>

    <title>How to change publisher one page tile default - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michele302  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change publisher one page tile default</h2>
                    <p>I love the new 8.5" page default size. Yay! It is the size I use most often. But why on earth would Publisher make "tile" the default setting? I can't tell you how many times a one page simple print job slid out of the computer in two pages. I have to set
 each job that way? It's another step I don't want to make. How do I change the default to print the single page I am seeing as one page?</p>
<p>Also on the task pane, you can't scroll from page to page, you have to click on each one?</p>

            Make sure the page size and the printer size are same to print the publication without any issues. You can make the printer size as default on the printer properties option. If you have any issues in setting the default printer size, contact the printer
 support.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm sorry but it seems there is something the <strong>Microsoft people are </strong>
<em><strong>just not getting</strong></em> about this subject.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a <strong>FAULT</strong> with MS Publisher 2010 (and from the number of web posts on the Tiled print problem, it goes back to Publisher 2007).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <strong>FAULT </strong>is, that MS Publisher <strong>defaults to "Tiled</strong>" as the pagination&nbsp;setting&nbsp;when you go to print a document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's nothing to do with making sure that your printer's default page size, and your publication's prescribed page size, are the same. Mine are, and I still get this fault.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I create documents in A4 page size, my printer is set to A4 page size, I save my created documents with their A4 page size; and yet I STILL need to manually reset the print pagination setting from&nbsp;<strong>Tiled</strong> to&nbsp;<strong>One page per sheet</strong>&nbsp;--
<em>EVERY</em> time I print.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft, can you <em>please fix this fault</em> - thanks.</p>
        </p>

            Alright, I was having the exact same problem with the tile being the<br />
default printing set to "Tiled". &nbsp;The way to fix this is as follows:<br />
1. When viewing your document on Microsoft Publisher, click on the<br />
"Format" tab.<br />
2. Click on "Format Publication"<br />
3. On the left-hand side, click on "Change page size..."<br />
4. Select "Letter (Portrait)" &nbsp;8.5x11 inches<br />
5. Click Ok<br />
<br />
Now when you select file&gt;Print, it will say 1 page per sheet!<br />
<br />
:)

 more often that the tiled!!!<br />

            I am having this problem also. &nbsp;We just upgraded all of our computers and with that we had to upgrade to Publisher 2010, and it is very&nbsp;frustrating to remember to change the print selection every time I need to print, otherwise it prints on two or more

<h2>            Can&#39;t open www.youtube.com - Internet Explorer cannot display the webpage</h2>
                    <p>I cannot open <a href="http://www.youtube.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.youtube.com</a> or
<a href="http://www.youtube.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.youtube.co.uk</a> in IE. I have installed a spyware program to remove any spyware which might have been affecting it. I have also reset the setting in IE but it still won't open. It says "Internet Explorer
 cannot display the webpage". It used to work fine up until a couple of months ago. I am using Windows Vista and IE 9. Also tried it in Firefox and safari and they do not display it either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope you can help!</p>

            <p><span><font color="#000000">Hello Louise,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.<br />
<br />
Before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.<br />
<br />
1) What happens when you try starting Outlook? Do you receive any error? <br />
<br />
2) Have you configured any email account in Outlook?<br />
<br />
</font></span><font color="#000000"><font>Let us try the methods mentioned below and verify the result.<br />
<br />
1) Start Outlook in safe mode following the below mentioned steps:<br />
<br />
* Hold Windows key + R.<br />
* Copy and paste, or type the following command in the Open box, and then press Enter:<br />
Outlook /safe <br />
<br />
Note: There is space between Outlook and /<br />
<br />
</font><span>If Outlook works in safe mode as expected, disable the add-ins following steps mentioned below to determine the problem causing add-in:</span><br />
</font><font><font><font color="#000000"><br />
a) Click on File menu, click Options, Add-ins, Go button besides Manage: Com-in Add.<br />
b) Check if there are add-ins listed, clear the checkbox. <br />
c) Close the Office program and restart it. <br />
d) Disable each add-in one at a time, restart the Outlook, and repeat the above procedure. If the issue reappears again, it will help you to determine which add-in is causing this issue.<br />
<br />
2) If you're still unable to open Outlook, create a new profile and verify the result.<br />
<br />
Refer to the following article for instructions on how to create new profile: <br />

<br />
<br />
I apologize for not replying in a timely manner.<br />
<br />
Let me assist you further.<br />
<br />
Check whether Outlook is running in compatibility mode. If yes, let’s disable it following instructions mentioned below and then try starting Outlook.<br />
<br />
Right click on <b>Outlook</b> (.exe) &gt; <b>Properties</b> &gt; <b>Compatibility</b>&gt; uncheck all the boxes &gt;<b>Apply</b> &gt;
<b>OK</b> and then try opening Outlook and verify the result.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>Access <b>
Outlook</b> (.exe) from the following location:</font></span></p>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>C:\Program Files(x86)\Microsoft Office 15\Office 15<br />
C:\Program Files(x86)\Microsoft Office 15\ClentX86 or ClientX64\Root\Office15</font></span></b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<font><br />
If issue still persists, create a new Windows user account and then try starting Outlook and check if it works as expected.<br />
<br />
Refer to the following link for instructions on how to create a new Windows user account:<br />

            <p>I have windows 10 with Office 365 and Outlook would not open for me and just kept saying "Processing" on the opening box and would never come up. I uninstalled/reinstalled with the same problem continuing to happen. I finally found this help strand and followed
 the instructions above opening Outlook in /safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In looking at the menu where the "Add-in's" are managed, there is also a tab for "Mobile Devices" and I realized I got a new iPad mini 4 this weekend and two iPad's were listed under this tab. (still have the iPad Air) Coincidentally, Outlook mysteriously
 quit working over the weekend. Hmmm....I removed both iPad's from the account and problem is fixed with Outlook now opening just fine. I can live without the Outlook App on my iPad as it is fairly useless anyway and I just use the default mail app on the iPad.
 (Sorry Microsoft)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on this problem Microsoft?&nbsp;</p>

<h3> neilking84  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t send emails</h2>
                    <p>I am having the following problem with Outlook emails (Hotmail address) on my Windows 7 desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>A new email will not send and I cannot reply to one I've received. When replying, I get a succession of messages:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><em>The sender’s original message will be included</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>The original message can’t be shown at the moment. It will be included when this message is sent.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>The message can't be sent at the moment. Please try again later.</em></span></p>
<p><span>Nor will it upload attachments to the emails that don't get sent.</span></p>
<p><span>It appears not to be able to open or search folders. In fact about the only functionality there seems to be is to open and read a received email. (I have not tried the other Outlook functions
 like the calendar because I don't really use them very much.)</span></p>
<p><span>The problem occurs in Firefox, Chrome and IE but NOT in the Outlook app on my Apple mobile devices.</span></p>
<p>I have tried clearing the cache in all three browsers and disabling all extensions and add-ons but that doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have only used 5% of my storage so it can't be that. It's a Premium account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be intermittent in that everything works fine sometimes but that is becoming less and less frequent and the default is now that it doesn't work for 90% of the time. I had the same problem a few weeks ago but it seemed
 to clear up (without me doing anything I'm aware of) and everything was OK for a while but now it's back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It MAY be the case that it works OK with very short emails, for example when I'm testing to see if it works by sending/replying to messages saying just "Test", but can't handle anything more complicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone might recognise these symptoms and be able to recommend a solution.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply but I couldn't find anything relevant in any of these links.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should try and make it clear (so far as I can when I may not be using the correct terminology and the apparently multiple uses of the word "Outlook") that my problem is not with the Outlook email handling programme, it's with my Hotmail (as I used to think
 of it) account which I access through a web browser at https://outlook.live.com/mail</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas?</p>

            Hi neilking84, thanks for your reply, I got it, then try to:
<br />
<br />1 Go to Tools menu &gt; Account settings&nbsp;
<br />
<br />2Select the relevant GreenNet email account, and click the “Change” button (third from the left above that line)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />3Make sure that the “Outgoing mail server (SMTP)” box reads “smtp.gn.apc.org” if this is a GreenNet account. (If you have “smtp.greennet.org.uk” it is worth changing to “smtp.gn.apc.org”.)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />4Click the “More settings…” button to the bottom right.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />5Click the second tab along, “Outgoing server” and ensure “My outgoing server (SMTP) requires authentication” is ticked. Select “Use same settings as my incoming mail server”. “Require secure password authentication” should not be ticked.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />6Click the right-hand tab, “Advanced”.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />7For “Outgoing server (SMTP)”, remove “25” if that is what you have, and first try entering 587. In this case change “Use the following type of encrypted connection” to TLS. Click “OK” and next.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />8Cancel any messages being sent, and try sending again.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />9If you still get an error, you may want to try using “2525” “Outgoing server (SMTP)” without any encryption (not secure), or possibly “465” with SSL encryption (secure).&nbsp;
<br />Another reason Outlook may not be sending is because there’s a large message stuck in the outbox and Outlook keeps resending. First try File &gt; Offline and deleting the message, or if that doesn’t work, use the Windows Start &gt; Search for “outbox”, wait, right-click the message and choose delete.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />
<br />Thank you

<h2>            Outlook 2010 .pst import failure</h2>
                    <p>Moving to Windows 10 laptop from Windows 7, Outlook 2010 on both devices.&nbsp; My experiences with .pst files has been spotty, and I decided to export/import mail separate from the calendar.&nbsp; The mail .pst imported perfectly, but when I follow the steps to import
 the calendar .pst, I press "finish" and there's no progress bar.&nbsp; If I file-&gt;open-&gt;Outlook data file, I get the dread "no items to show in this view" on either device.&nbsp; I did the export again, with the same results on the new .pst file.&nbsp; Is it not possible
 to export/import the Outlook calendar by itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can export to Excel, and that works fine, but it only grabs the last month and four months forward, and I really want to replicate the historical data.&nbsp;

<p>Much simpler to make a backup of your .PST file on the Windows 7 machine while Outlook is closed, take this .PST file backup to your Windows 10 laptop, place it a folder where it won't overwrite anything and check it to make sure it hasn't been set Read
 Only in the copy process, then open it with Outlook on the Windows 10 machine using
<strong>File &gt; Open and Export &gt; Open Outlook Data File</strong>.&nbsp; You can then drag and drop from one .PST to the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a POP account, you can set the copy as your primary storage location, like it was on the Windows 7 machine, and go on about your business.</p>

<h2>            What does WiFi Sense to on Windows Phone</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm not sure I understand Wifi Sense on my Windows Phone. When it's on does that mean it automatically connects to any Wifi in the area? Will it hurt my phone if it's off? What is the advantage of having it on? Not sure what it does because I think I can
 see all the Wifi in my area if I press manage, so why do I need the Wifi Sense? I do not want to be connected to any Wifi automatically -- I want to&nbsp; control that -- and am not sure if Wifi Sense is on if that'll mean an automatic connection.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Solver inconsistency between Windows and Mac OS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coenradehlers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Solver inconsistency between Windows and Mac OS</h2>
                    <p>When solving a simple linear programming problem (using Simplex LP method), the solver in Excel for Mac 2016 version 15.22 does not find the optimal solution and even states that it has found a viable solution even when constraints are not satisfied... When
 using Excel 2010 in Windows OS the solver finds the correct solution the first time (for exactly the same problem)... Additionally, when I manually change the variables in Excel for Mac to simulate the correct optimal solution (as found from Excel 2010 in
 Windows OS) the solver sees it as the optimal solution and does not change the variables even if I run solver a few times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems as if the solver in Excel for Mac 2016 gets stuck in the first "peak" or "valley" and uses this as the optimal solution. Even when running solver a for a few iterations the variables don't change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am perplexed because it is a very easy linear problem which the solver in Excel for Mac can't solve. Additionally, it creates doubt in the capabilities of this solver in Excel for Mac to produce accurate solutions. And as a student, this is rather vital!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate some help :-)</p>

<h2>            Change default Zoom settings Excel.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Zoom</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I set the default zoom to 90% on Excel 2010 for all tabs? I had my friend write a small macro but I will have to run it every time I open a new workbook and is not any better even though I put it in xlstart. Any help?</p>

            <p>Hello Raja,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no option within Excel to change the default zoom for Excel files. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However it may be possible doing through a VBA code (Macro) to automate the process. You may refer to the suggestions in the following thread which discusses the same and check if it helps.</p>

<h2>            5 programs installed on their own</h2>
                    <p>I am not sure how but when open the start menu, under recently added there are 5 programs that I never added. They are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. spotify music</p>
<p>2. march of empires: war of lords</p>
<p>3. candy crush soda saga</p>
<p>4. bubble witch saga 3</p>
<p>5. dolby access</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure how they were installed or if they are part of windows update of some sort. I right clicked on them and chose uninstall, it seemed to work but they came back later that day. They do not appear under the uninstall option in the control panel.
 Windows defender says my computer is protected. I also ran&nbsp;malwarebytes and it said no threats found. At this point I am really not sure what to do. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. I am not finding that option. The only option I am seeing is one that says "update apps automatically", the problem there is that it would apply to all my applications, not sure these.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, I do see that all these apps are coming from the microsoft store, so its good to know its not a virus but its really annoying to have this crap installed without my permission. I don't play games or have any use for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you have any idea what this option is called or where under settings I would find it.</p>

<p>In the Settings for Windows 10 search for Occasionally Show Suggestions in Start and turn that off.</p>
<p>In the Windows 10 Store settings turn Update Apps Automatically off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remember that's what turned it off for me. However, be aware when there are the major upgrades twice a year (Spring Creators update will be rolling out soon) Microsoft might sneak those apps back onto your system. Uninstall them and make sure those
 settings are off should take care of them.</p>

<p>What is this? I tried to rearm my Office 2013 Trial, and it didn't work this second time. I did it one time and it worked. I don't understand this. I followed a lot of instructions on the web, but they all didn't work. My Office 2013 Trial has a 60-day trial
 period, and you can extend it for that same time with "OSPREARM.EXE", but this second time it is not working. I tried running it as administrator, but this is what I got - on the photo I posted. Please help! Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Windows Live &#43; Microsoft MyPhone &#61; My Windows Live Phone</h2>
                    <strong>Why can't there be&nbsp;just&nbsp;one&nbsp;solution?<br />
<br />
</strong>Hi!! I am a manager at a corporate Verizon Wireless location, and I have been using Hotmail since
<span><span>07/28/1998, PocketPC devices since 2003. I have been through all the changes the Hotmail has gone through (with Passort, MSN, &amp; Live), and I can say that Microsft is moving in the
<span><span>07/28/1998, PocketPC devices since 2003. I have been through all the changes the Hotmail has gone through (with Passort, MSN, &amp; Live), and I can say that Microsft is moving in the
 right direction with it. PocketPC has come a long way as well maturing into Windows Phone, and, having worked with Verizon Wirelss since 2003, I have been dealing with Microsoft mobile devices for sales and troubleshhoting for some time (I have been dubbed
 the "Windows Mobile Guy" and I handle all escalations). I have been an advocate of both for a long time both at work and in my personal life. I started with A Samsung i700, to&nbsp;Pantech PN-820, HTC 6700, HTC 5800, HTC 6900, Samsung Omnia, &amp; now both an HTC Ozone
 &amp;&nbsp;HTC Imagio.<br />
<br />
My question is why is it that GMail &amp; Android devices have a better relationship than Windows Live &amp; Windows Phones if Microsoft has been doing both so much longer than Google???? When an Android phone is sold and activated, the next step required is to enter
 existing/create new Gmail account, and then all of their contacts, calendar, &amp; email items are automaically syncronized via push (ala Microsoft Exchange for that matter!).&nbsp;All of Google's services (Android Market, Google Maps, etc) are then auto linked to
 the Google ID of the device. It is simple &amp; hassle free as it is inate to the operating system.<br />
<br />
Microsoft MyPhone is awesome!!! What it offers is far superior to what Android devices do with the exception of&nbsp;OS intergration and Windows Live syncronization. Windows Phones require you to download the Windows Live app to have mail pushed &amp; contacts synchronized.
 When entering a Windows Live address in MS Outlook Mobile, Windows Live app opens seperately and has to be setup to have mail sync'd, and then you have to choose automatic sync as it defaults to manual (who's idea was that?!?). This is confusing to somple
 customers. &nbsp;My biggest problem is that the contacts &amp; calendar syncronized via MyPhone is completely independent of Windows Live contacts &amp; calendar. WHY? ???<br />
<br />
It is highly frustrating to have seperate contacts/calendar items in 2 different Microsoft accounts. Single sign-on should be synonymous with unified data. Why should I have a 25GB Windows Live storage account for email, contacts, calendar, photos, favorites,
 and documents AND a completely seperate and unrelated 200MB MyPhone storage account for text, contacts, calendar, photos, mobile favorites, and documents?... both under a Micrsoft single sign-on? It is inefficient and wasteful. Microsoft needs to pay attention
 to it's competition. Even Palm is introducing Synergy to simplify life for it's customers.<br />
<br />
I can go on and on about Windows Phone flaws, but I am addressing MyPhone right now. MyPhone is a great step towards unification, but&nbsp;needs to be intergrated with every Windows Phone. After device activation, MyPhone should be intergated in the "Getting Started"
 welcome screen and should require every device owner to enter existing or subscribe to a Windows Live account OR setup an Exchange account. The Windows Live&nbsp;account should be linked to the Windows Phone device ID, and every subsequent Microsoft app would recognize
 the Account ID automatically. Pre-existing email, contacts, calendar, text, fav, etc&nbsp;items should automatically download in the background because MyPhone is apart of the OS. MyPhone shouldn't even be an independent app, it should be an intergrated&nbsp;conduit
 for Windows Live services. I don't speak just for myself, I speak for all of the frustracted Windows Phone users I deal with. I don't think we need to wait for Windows Phone 7 to launch for this to be resolved, this needs to be fixed on the back end. The remaing
 Windows Phone users are dedicated, and Microsoft owes it to them and to potential users a simpler and efficient experience.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

Thanks for all the candid feedback.&nbsp; There are lots of great points that you bring up, as Jack Cook mentions, and your feedback is being delivered to the My Phone team. Though I can't promises we'll be able to fix these issues, I can promise that we'll review
 and take note of them.&nbsp; <br />

I love MS products. I love Windows Live and my Windows Mobile phone. But all my lifes schedule and happenings are on Windows Live. I don't have Outlook, nor do I want it. That is the only thing that frustrates me. I cannot get my Windows Live Calendar and other
 Windows Live Services to mesh with my phone. Even if I did get Outlook, which I won't ( I hate it), the Outlook program and Windows Live programs don't mesh right. The calendars don't sync, you can only view them side by side. So, when I put appointments in
 my Windows Mobile phone they don't appear on my WL calendar, and vise versa. This is annoying, because my life is on my phone and WL. I have to always check two calendars to figure out what is going on.

<p>Jamily,<br />
<br />
As a consumer, I am in total agreement w/your request. I like my windows 6.1 HTC phone; however, the integration of basic apps is very important. I have recently started using myphone and I am very disappointed at the inability to integrate myphone w/windows
 live.<br />
<br />
Hopefully, Microsoft pays attention.</p>

            1.- As a WinPhone 6.5 user I like Myphone service, but as the Great comments "Jamily" did (thanks you, your post is the most explicit about this point, not the first, not the last but the best) I can only think there are a lot of issues with "Win Mobile
 Outlook" (not only sync issues but not finger friendly and a very old odd UI) as there was with PC "Outlook Express".
<br />
2.- I really hope WinPhone 7 will FIX (it is time now, and we the users deserve it, I hope MS team start to realize that a phone's life is like 2 years, 3 years I think is too much, so start to give solution before the 2 years end) this Outlook issues so we
 can start seen better integration and sync so there are not 2 independed instants, just one "My Windows Live Phone".<br />
3.- I also would like to see this improve with Calendar/Schedule.<br />
4.- in the mean TIME can you explain how to sync Windows Live with WinPhone contacts, because 2 times I have lost all my contacts in Windows Live People/contacs when try to sync. And After I get sync the changes I made in Windows Live People/contacts doesn't
 appear in "Win mobile Outlook", this is really awful because the contacts are in fact in the WinPhone but doesn't appear in Mobile Outlook, I have to make change some setting to make them appear but after the next sync again stop to show up in Mobile Outlook.
 Also this is the same issues when you try to sync "Win Live People" to Winphone and them to "PC MS Outlook (2003 or 2007)" it dont sync all the contatcs.<br />
5.- It will be very nice if you add (soon) the option of export/save your "MS myphone" contacts in the webpage, just to be double sure that if something get wrong (erase,disappear,whatever) you have a backup. When I flashed a new ROM to my HTC diamond (CDMA)
 the first time when I sync it erase all my contacts. Then someone told me in this forum to erase the phone from the Myphone webpage and then sync, that help because my second time I flashed I could sync correct the "MS myphone contact from the web" to my WinPhone
 but again I lost all my Windows Live people/contacts. I think this has to be more clearly and more easy to sync/backup, etc.<br />
6.- and Finally do you think that Outlook 2010 will fix this MS "ActiveSync" issues that dont sync all the contacts between PC "MS Outlook" and "Win mobile Outlook". Or maybe and update/upgrade to MS "ActiveSync".<br />
7.- Real Thanks in advance to the "MS Myphone" Team, I'm complete convince that you as I really want to see soon a really "integration" between Windows Live service (WEB), MS PC software Outlook, MS Live messenger , and WinPhone as in the MS advertising. I
 know we have too much expectatives in this, but hope they came true. In the mean time thanks for the GREAT first step and Happy New Year.
<br />
<br />
Sincerely<br />
JC.WILCOX<br />

            I also wish my Windows Live Calendar could be synced on my phone. &nbsp;I have Outlook 2000, but do not use it and I do not want to have to buy Outlook 2007 just to sync my calendar. &nbsp;Even being able to access my Live Calendar from my phone's browser would
 be helpful.

<p><span>I agree with simplification in processes and programs. It does seem strange and cumbersome to have separate "programs" do what one could
 manage.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'm wondering what everyone is talking about with Outlook, though. Outlook is great. My&nbsp;office uses GroupWise and I hate it with a passion.
 Outlook is much more intuitive. While it too has its flaws and weaknesses, it is better than the competition's software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That said, I don't think Microsoft is inclined to modify something in their Windows Phone arena that would undermine the sales of another,
 i.e. Outlook and suites containing Outlook. If&nbsp;you are saying that you want integration so that you won't have to use Outlook, your words will probably fall on deaf ears. If, on the other hand, we talk about the reasons integration would increase usability
 and improve the customer experience&nbsp;with Windows Phones we are more likely to get somewhere.</span></p>

<p>Sounds good. I've been selling cell phones also since 2007. I've been using WinMo since 2008, and have also been dubbed the "Windows Guy". Unfortunately I'm about the only one at the store who even bothers mentioning Windows phones anymore, and for many
 reasons. My co-workers are right to say that Android is much more user friendly and simpler to use. I envy how you can set up your Android phone with a gmail account, and contacts, tasks, and calendar are all synced automatically. I use almost all of the Outlook
 features, and find it frustrating that I don't know how to auto sync my Outlook contacts with Live (I can import and export, but haven't found out a way to AUTO sync, so that if I make a change in outlook, it'll automatically sync on Live or the other way
 around). I don't know how to set up my calender on Outlook to sync with my Live calendar (I think there may be a way if I am willing to publish my personal calendar as a public calendar, which like I said is personal), and I have no clue how to sync Outlook
 tasks with my Live To-Do list.&nbsp;Just today I&nbsp;merged my Windows Live contacts with my phone's contacts (why I regularly sync to my computer through ActiveSync... which should also go wireless), and it added the contacts to my phone, not merged. I had to use
 a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;third part app to merge any duplicate contacts, which then changed information that I wanted to keep (ie: File As), so now I have to go back into Outlook (as WinMo still doesn't have adequate File As editing) to change again. And I still fear that
 I'll have to go through the whole process again if I ever want to sync my contacts again (unless I use Outlook to export my contacts to Live... which still has formatting issues and has been known to drop off information).&nbsp;Why does there have to be so many
 different methods? It is possible to have more smooth&nbsp;synchronization. With Android you can update information on the phone or the internet and it will automatically update on the other end. It is extremely efficient and user friendly. I have been eligible
 to upgrade for sometime now and frequently have the Winmo/ Android debate myself. I fear that as one of the last reps who defends and sticks up for Windows if I go then customers aren't going to be as interested in Windows, because frankly a rep can have a
 dramatic influence on the phone a customer decides to purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please fix this. And fix it so that WinMo 6.5 users can use these new features. Outlook 2007 users or WinMo 6.5 users shouldn't have to spend over a $100 for a new version of Outlook and and then around another $200 for a new version of WinMo (as Windows
 Phone 7 is only going to be on newer devices). Please find a way to make these available now to current users.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sell cell phones. I am also a college student with classes and assignments. I also am a volunteer at an organization of around 200 members where I am an executive secretary where I frequently work with contacts, tasks, and schedule appointments. Because
 of what I do, I have been very comfortable with Outlook. I love Outlook and hope to be able to continue using it.... but the ease of Android and Gmail is very tempting. It frequently gets free updates that make it more and more user friendly. Oh yeah... and
 not to mention Google Voice (where I can click call on a contact on the internet and it rings my phone and then connects me with the contact free of charge). I know Outlook has a call feature... but most people now a days don't have a land line, which I understand
 rends that feature useless. Can we get a call feature on Outlook that works with cell phones?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I love Microsoft products and have been very loyal for a long time... but I haven't heard of Windows Phone 7 or Outlook 2010 fixing these issues... and I don't think a customer should have to spend over $300 to receive these simple benefits, especially
 when they're pretty much already available with Google and Android now for free. (And if you guys can come up with something similar to a Google Voice Number, I'm sold for a very very long time:). Please hear me and do what you can, because frankly, people
 like me can have a lot of influence on other others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I switched from Hotmail to Gmail because of much better spam filtering. That was 3 years ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stopped using Outlook to sync to my WM6.1 PDA 2 years ago, because sync was plagued with problems, and became excessively slow and high on CPU.</p>
<p>When I got my WM6.5 phone I tried Outlook syncing again. This time it wouldn't sync at all, apparently because of Outlook 2007 issues. (By then the company I work for upgraded their Office to 2007). I have given up on Outlook completely.</p>
<p>I was syncing to MS My Phone for about 6 mos. Couldn't really use the online calendar because for whatever reason MS decided to not show recurring appointments; at least I used it as a backup solution. Then, I set up sync with Google Calendar and this was
 it. Very fast, very reliable, very useable web calendar, no ugly flash advertising (bad for work environment). Now, it has its own issues - no category sync, and no task sync. &nbsp;But I can see all of my meetings online, I can actually _use_ the online calendar,
 it doesn't look like I am playing games at work (no flashy ads) and I have a very reliable sync between my phone and Google.</p>
<p>I still have a WM phone. However, it's very likely that my next phone will be an Android device. I mainly went with WM because of stylus - I am used to taking handwritten notes in PhatPad during meetings - but they've done away with that. No reason to pay
 for a WM7 phone when there's so many great Android phones, and such a great choice of software.</p>
<p>Good job, MS. You've given up on the mobile market.</p>
<p>To be fair, though, I _do_ like Windows 7... but in 10 years I will probably be on a tablet device anyway.</p>

<p>This may not be the answer that you want to hear, but I've always found it much easier to export Access data to Excel. There is more ability to manipulate the data in Excel. While to can print the entire report in Excel, I just create an image from the chart
 and export that image back to my Access form or report.&nbsp; I outline the process completely in the book that MVP Doug Steele and I wrote:</p>

<p>The chapter is 14 pages long, so it's too much for a newsgroup post.</p>

<p>Hi Arvin,</p>
<p>Thanks for the response, I guess my next question would be, how do you export the image from excel to the Access report. I actuallly have the code written that creates this graph in excel. The problem I am facing is that I will be printing out many patient
 charts at one time....I need the program to be able to run the report for say 30 patients in one shot and print out the graph for each patient.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>

<p>I think that you will have to loop through the patients and export/print one at a time. The code in my book will show you how to export it to a form, and the report is almost identical code. The form or report would use an image control.</p>

            Hi Luciano<br />
<br />
When you uninstall PC Suite you remove the core application but the cable driver portion remains.<br />
<br />
You perhaps need to go to microsoft.com and download Windows Installer Cleanip Utility "msicuu2.exe"<br />
<br />
Go to Start &gt; Programs &gt; Windows Installer Cleanup Utility<br />
When you run this it looks a bit like the add/remove program window. Now select "Nokia Connectivity Cable Driver" and "PC Connectivity Solution" programs.<br />
<br />
Now go back to Add/Remove Programs in Control Panel and try and remove "Nokia Connectivity Cable Driver" and the "PC Connectivity Solution" programs. They should now uninstall.<br />
<br />
Reboot your PC

            Hi ljorge01,<br />
<br />
Before trying those, you can just re-install PC Connectivity Solution.

<br />
Thank you for your reply. Do you know where I can found the file msicuu2.exe? Because in the Microsoft Download Page when I search by "Windows Installer Cleanup Utility" I going for a page that's doesn't have nothing about CleanUp Untility.
