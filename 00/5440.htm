    <title>Cannot send email to a iCloud user - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot send email to a iCloud user</h2>
                    <p>I am running Outlook 2016 Pro on a Win 7 Ultimate system. My email configurations is set up like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. cfh.pst - this is my master, local copy of my current emails.</p>
<p>2. *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - this is an IMAP link to my Gmail email account</p>
<p>3. *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - this is a link to my Hotmail &amp; Outlook email account</p>
<p>4. *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - this is a link to my BT email account</p>
<p>5. Two other local archives of older emails over the last 20 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mostly use the Gmail account for my emails, and Outlook normally sends them automatically. I manually copy incoming emails from Gmail to my local .pst and delete any that I don't want - that ensures that I do not become dependent on the Gmail account remembering
 my emails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of my family has asked us to use their email account at *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. When I try to add that email address to their contact record in Outlook 2016 I get this error -
<strong>The operation failed. The messaging interfaces have returned an unknown error. If the problem persists, restart Outlook.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the same error if I try to send an email to them. I can save the outbound email in the Drafts folder, which Outlook puts in the Gmail system, and I can then send it directly from the Gmail web interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that Outlook is confused between a remote contact on iCloud.com and an iCloud.com user with an Outlook interface to the iCloud servers, which I do not have and do not want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how do I get Outlook to do this properly and will my system lose it when Outlook is updated, which it recently was.</p>

<p>So they use an icloud address but you don't use icloud at all? That shouldn't affect your ability to change the contact or send mail to the address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you type their name, does it come up in the autocomplete? Delete that entry then retype and see if it works.&nbsp; On editing the contact, try making a new contact and see if it works.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>There something weird going on here. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My Account Settings lists my three external email service providers as my Gmail, BTinternet (both IMAP/SMTP) and otmail/Outlook via Microsoft Exchange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My data files lists 6 files - my local live PST and two Archive PSTs, plus my Gmail, BTinternet and otmail/Outlook as an OST files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Defaulted settings are set to the local PST data file and to the Gmail email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Outlook Address Book lists Contacts as</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contacts (This computer only): chriszzzzz@gmail....... (My Gmail account)</p>
<p>Contacts: cfh (My Local PST)</p>
<p>Contacts: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (My Hotmail account)</p>
<p>Suggested Contacts:&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at My Contacts I see the following entries</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search results</p>
<p>Contacts - cfh == (My local PST, and this is the default)</p>
<p>DeDupe</p>
<p>Contacts - *** Email address is removed for privacy *** == (Opening this gets the error - The set of folders cannot be opened. The information store could not be opened.)</p>
<p>Skype Contacts == (Same error)<br />
Suggested Contacts == (Same error)<br />
Contacts (This computer only) == (Opening this gives me an empty list)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems that my default file is my local PST, my default email is my Gmail account and my default contacts is my local PST. Now, I very rarely need to update my contact list and the last time was probably a few years ago when I was on Office 2010. I
 moved to 2016 about a year ago, and about a month ago I know that the system did an update to Office because a display came up while I was opening Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can put in a new contact in the Contacts list, with no email address. If I then add an email address to it I get the error from my original post; also if I create a new one with an email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Virtually all of my emails are responses to incoming emails. </p>
<p>
</p><p>From a new email message I can use the To: button to get to the address books. This is defaulting to Contacts - *** Email address is removed for privacy *** which does seem to match my Google contact list which I copied from Outlook a few years ago. The options that this gives
 me are</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contacts - *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
Contacts (This computer only) - *** Email address is removed for privacy *** == Gives an empty list</p>
<p>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** == Reports 'No entries in this Address Book'</p>
<p>Contacts -&nbsp;*** Email address is removed for privacy *** == Give an error message that the address list cannot be displayed or opened; probably true since I have never used it. Same occurs with the Suggested Contacts list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated my contacts email address in Gmail but Outlook does not want to pick that up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I am very puzzled about how Outlook manages contact information between itself, my local PST and Google. Should my local PST be counted as an email account, and how does one sync contacts between Outlook, Gmail/Google and my two Android mobile and
 tablets (which have picked up the new address in Google).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

<p><span>These contacts are not backed up or synced. It would be better to move the contents

<p>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Contacts (This computer only) - *** Email address is removed for privacy *** == Gives an empty list</span></p>
<p><span>It probably is empty. :) You really shouldn't use this folder.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>On the suggested&nbsp;contacts - that is no longer used. It was an extension of the autocomplete list and only in outlook 2010. Not many people liked it anyway.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Have you tried making a new profile? Keep the old profile and add a new one with only one account to test it.&nbsp; You can do this from the File menu with newer versions of outlook - File, Account Settings,
 Change profile to create a new profile (or select a different one).&nbsp; If you don't have that option on your build, you'll need to make the profile in Control panel, mail.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

 the Gmail My Contacts against the PST - that matches apart from the one icloud user which i have added to Gmail. Gmail also has a list of other, or more up to date, email address in its other contacts list.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Right, I managed to get Outlook talking to Gmail -- i had forgotten that it needed the 2-way password and I built a new one for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I still have the issue and cannot add any mail addresses to users in the Contacts in my local PST file. Also, when i type an email address into a new email, Outlook will generate a list of potential email addresses which seems to be based on both
 the Gmail My Contacts and the Other Contacts lists, but missing some of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I still cannot send a new email to my cousin at *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Same error as the one when i try to save a contact with a new email address.</p>

<h2>            Receiving notification emails in another language</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like many who have already asked this question with no solid answer, I am receiving email notifications from Microsoft to my email account in another language, specifically korean. And I do not know why. I have confirmed all language settings, timezones,
 etc but Microsoff still continues to send me messages in Korean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some initial digging to find that someone created an Xbox live account with my email account, and I have no way of deleting or accessing the account. I should mention that I do not own an Xbox nor does anyone in my home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need to click send&#47;receive to get new mails in Outlook 2011 for Mac</h2>
                    <div><b>Environment:</b></div>
We have 2 users that do not get new mails automatically with Outlook 2011 for Mac. They have the latest version of Office 2011 for Mac and we recently migrated to Exchange 2013 on the server side. The problem appeared around the same dates.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We do not know if it is related, because we did the test with their account on Windows Outlook 2013 client and everything is working fine, plus I personally use outlook for Mac and do not have this problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only thing they have in common and I do not have is huge inboxes. One of them over 7000 mails.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Problem:</b></div>
<div>They do not get new mails unless they click SEND/RECEIVE. The workaround right now is to plan a SEND/RECEIVE every 5min.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Done:</b></div>
<div>Already tried to flush the local cache and rebuild the Office Main Identity database. They do want to have a cached mailbox (not headers only).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Question:</b></div>
<div>If someone have any clue about what may cause this problem, please respond.</div>
</div>

            Already read about all this, the user did not want to do the cleanup in their mailboxes and they are highly placed in the company.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>We did resolve the problem, the problem was related to our load balancer authorizing only 1min connection. We boosted that to unlimited. The problem was that these users had such big mailboxes that it would take more than 1 min to sync. We did also solve
 our problem with Push mail to mobile devices. Outlook 2013 that has the capability to use Push too is a lot more responsive to the users now.</div>

<h2>            Is the Nokia Suite Software Update Broken&#63;</h2>
                    How come I don't see any updates when I plug in my phone via USB but I see some updates when I visit the Ovi Store with my phone? I have a 808 Pureview. E.g. I currently have Nokia Public Transit (or Transport?) 2.0.1. Viewing the Ovi Store shows me that
 Public Transit 2.1 is available via Ovi Store but not through Software Update? The same was true when I had Maps 3.0.8 initially and Software Update didn't show Maps 3.0.9, etc.

            Not quite sure why it isn't showing up with updates to notify you of. Unfortunately, there is no other way to look for them. Kudos to you for knowing other places to look for it, so you've got it covered. If you've updated all the major apps, then you
 should be fine. I know that on my N8 i've had app updates but the Store only notified me when I went into the app from my app purchase history

            There appears to be a newer version of the Nokia Store App showing up in the browser, and in Nokia Store itself. Again, there's no indication of it in Software Update. Hopefully, it will be fixed in the next version of Nokia Suite.

            <p>Hi Tjmcm,<br />
<br />
I would like to suggest you follow the steps below to recover it with your laptop.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Go to your laptop, disconnect it from the Internet before you start Onenote.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Make a copy of the "deleted" page, then reconnect your laptop. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. The sync process will then finally delete the page (as you have seen) and will sync the copy to your phone. So the page gets recovered.<br />
<br />
Regards,</p>
<p>Yoga</p>

            Thanks. I saw this option before. &nbsp;I thought that here must be a more effective recovery option. &nbsp;It is mind blowing that the app does not require a a confirmation before deleting a page or that there is not an "undo" function. &nbsp;

            HI to answer for first part of your question. You don't need to go to yemen to upgrade your phone. You may do it in your country.<br />
<br />
About loosing of arabic language... Don't really know will you loose it or not, but your english seems to be quite allright. And you shouldn't have any problems with using your phone. Looking from other side. This phone will become useless for some thieves

    <title>Office Pro Plus and activation issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bart.datacore.be  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office Pro Plus and activation issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
We got some strange behavior on our Office365 Pro Plus installations.<br />
We install them all for multiple user activation on each PC (our users move around a lot in the office).</p>
<p>When a user has internet, he can log in with his Office365 credentials without any problem.<br />
However, if we take away his internet access (due to all sort of reasons) we expect that the user has 30 days he can use that office on the machine he was able to activate. However, we see that Office starts using the local AD account as the authenticated user
 (which is NOT the same user as our Office365 user).</p>
<p>When that user comes online again, Office starts complaining that it does not have a valid license and the user needs to log in again ...</p>

<p>How can we change this behavior? We want Office to keep using the Office365 credentials and not the AD credentials untill he comes back on the internet.</p>

<p>Hi Bart,</p>
<p>Have you tried clearing all Office related credentials via Control Panel &gt; User Account &gt; Credential Manager &gt; Windows Credentials? If the issue still exists after clearing the credentials, since it is related to the settings of your local AD, we suggest
 you turn to our <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/home?forum=winserverDS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>SuperNova,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assuming that you use OneNote 2013. Otherwisee, please get back with your exact version and operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your description I have a hunch that the "g" symbol that you see is actually an initial for the person who authored the OneNote notes - most likely you yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check the author initials for your account in File &gt; Options &gt; General, under the heading "Personalize your copy of Microsoft Office". I assume that in your case that same "g" symbol will be there in the Initials field.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Then, how to hide these initials:</p>
<p>Exit the Options panel and open the History menu. In the Authors group of the ribbon, you'll see a button named "Hide Authors". Click it, and the "g" symbol will disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a screenshot of that button:</p>

<p>Hi Karolos,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to make a summary about the case, so other users can easily find the information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Issue Description:</span></p>
<p>Office 365 group sites not display in classic SharePoint admin center. Customer would like to know other ways to manage the site collections without PowerShell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Workaround:</span></p>
<p>We can also manage the site collections in New SharePoint admin center preview.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get new SharePoint admin center, you may consider</p>

 organization</span></a><span> (it may take 24 h for this to take effect) , then refer to

 to be familiar with it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.The new admin center preview will be released to standard release tenant soon. You may wait for some time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@Karolos, here are answers for your other questions.</p>
<p><span>1.</span><span>Can I have Targeted release for selected users that will be only administrators and update the SharePoint Admin Center only but nothing else?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span>Based on my test, it will not work if you just have "
</span><span>Targeted release for selected users</span><span>". You can only see classic interface.</span></p>
<p><span>2.Is there</span><span> a way to prevent or block any users from creating</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>When you create a group, Office 365 gives the group a shared inbox, calendar, OneNote notebook, a Planner for task management</span><span>
</span><span>and a full-powered SharePoint team site.SPO sites </span>
<span>. To block users creating Office 365 group sites from outlook, the global admin needs to
</span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-who-can-create-office-365-groups-4c46c8cb-17d0-44b5-9776-005fced8e618" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>block their ability to create Office 365 group</span></a><span>. &nbsp;(I think it may not apply
 to your situation.</span></p>

<p>There should be no need for an "IF" here. If users can create sites, admins MUST be able to see and manage them. If that's not the case, Msft is breaking the very foundation of their own security and compliance policies in SP Online. Please provide official
 documentation on this so I can report it to my company and we can make a determination about whether to cancel our 7500+ O365 licenses.</p>

<p>Hi Andy Balcomb,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The storage quota of Teams is 1TB per team and can be up to 25TB. Team files are stored in SharePoint sites behind the scenes so the quota is subject to all compliance rules configured at the tenant
 level. See: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/limits-specifications-teams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/limits-specifications-teams</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your second question, I'd like to gather following information to better help you.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Could you please explain a little more about the issue? Do you mean the users cannot access the Teams app but can perform Skype for Business chats?
</p>
<p>2.May I ask if there are any error messages? If so, please capture a screenshot of it.
</p>
<p>3.May I ask if the issue happens to both of the Teams web app and the desktop app?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

<h2>            Sending Emails From MS Access to Office 365</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We have an Access system that has been running for years.</p>
<p>Part of its function is to send confirmation emails. It does</p>
<p>this using CDO and a POP account.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There a plans to change the office mailing system to&nbsp; Office 365</p>
<p>or Outlook 365 or Outlook.com or whatever the thing is called,</p>
<p>however this will not work with CDO.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I need to find out if there is an alternative to sending these emails</p>
<p>using access. I do not wish to use the send object as it will pop up a warning</p>
<p>&nbsp;for every email, and this will irritate the chap sending a hundred emails.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Team Site Not Sending &#34;Welcome to the Team Site Group&#34; Email or Showing up under &#34;Groups&#34; in Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>We have setup a team site O365 group and added 6 members. We created the team site over three days ago. All those members are "owners", however one person never received the Welcome email where they are taken to team site, and it's not showing up in outlook
 on the left hand side under "groups" - from the user perspective it's acting like she was never added.</p>
<p>Additionally, Two people didn't receive this welcome email until over a full day after the site was created, which is too long.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, the emails I send to the team through the team site, using the team site email distribution group, is also not showing up in people's regular inboxes- where in the team site can this setting be changed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know why we have Mary listed as an owner, yet she never got a welcome email or the group added to her outlook and it's been several days?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jen&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jen,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the queries.<br />
<br />
<br />
From your description, there are 2 issues. Regarding "the emails I send to the team through the team site, using the team site email distribution group, is also not showing up in people's regular inboxes- where in the team site can this setting be changed?",
 we would like to suggest posting a new thread so that we can handle it separately.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now back to the "Welcome to the Team Site Group" issue. We tested with exactly 6 additional owners when setting up and the issue can not be reproduced on our side.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then, to better understand the situation so that we can better assist you, we would like you to confirm the below things:<br />
1. If you share the team site to the user who has not received the welcome email, can he or she access it and work as owner?<br />
2. On approximately the same time, did the affected user encounter any delay in receiving emails? How about now? You may test a new email and then share with us the result.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,</p>
<p>Tina<br />

<p>Hi Tina,</p>
<p>Thanks for your help. Please see my responses below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For #1 - If she logs into SharePoint from our O*** and searches for the team site group by name, she can find it, follow it, however, that process flow doesn't work for our customers - they need to be able to have an email notifying them the team site has
 been created, and they need to be able to access their team site group from "groups" in outlook - which she currently can't/it's not even visible. I asked her to go to outlook groups, manually join and she did, and in the below screenshots you can see when
 she requested access her name wasn't showing up in the members group, however she had already been made an owner over a day before she requested to join the group.</p>
<p>Screenshot: Mary is already an owner</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Mary can't see the group in her outlook groups, and never got the invite.</p>
<p>Mary requested to join the group manually from "groups" in outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screenshot:&nbsp;I open the request, and Mary isn't in the members group when opened from her invite (even though she was added as an owner a day prior)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would have expected Mary to already be in the member group in the second screen shot, as she was added as a member over a day before she requested to join manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the people who was added did get an email - about 7 hours later, the other got one about 4 hours later (neither of these two are Mary, Mary still never got hers as I write this).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't actually accept Mary's request to join for #1, because I want to keep the error visible/reproducible in this team site until we have some answers about what's going wrong and how to fix it for our next customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>*We have been experiencing a lot of issues in this particular team site, such as unable to upload documents with no error except "1 document was not uploaded" and, unable to delete documents with no error except "1 document cannot be deleted" as well, and
 unable to restore versions with a "locked for shared use or editing" error (even though nobody else has the document in question open anywhere) - we are thinking this one particular site collection is corrupt, but aren't sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS - I've inserted, copied, and attached screenshots - they don't seem to be appearing. I tried to upload as a png, i tried to upload a word doc with screen shots and tried to physically copy and paste -please let me know how to get the screenshots to you.
 Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Jennifer,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back to us.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, for the other issues with the specific site collection, we still would like to suggest posting one thread per issue so that they can be handled separately and expediently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, also to protect your privacy and make screenshots visible, please check

</p><p>Thanks for the screenshots in the Private Message. And yes, we may agree on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>From the screenshots, we can tell the number of members in the Office 365 does not match th e list which you showed to us in Outlook. Could you please expand or scroll to share with us the full information? You may record a video about the whole process
 and explain to us while recording. Please share the video with us via the Private Message I have already sent to you. Can Mary also provide some related information from her side (e.g. screenshot, video)?&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>2. Run the following command to get owner information:
<strong>Get-UnifiedGroupLinks -Identity</strong> <em>&lt;TeamsiteAddress&gt;</em>
<strong>-LinkType Owners</strong> (You can check the Team Site address via Office 365 admin center-&gt;Group)</span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Run the following command to get member information:
<strong>Get-UnifiedGroupLinks -Identity</strong> <em>&lt;TeamsiteAddress&gt;</em>

<h2>            Windows 10 Technical preview&#58; System Sounds ignoring set volume with UAC prompt.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: System Sounds ignoring set volume</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's an interesting one I've come across.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I generally find the System Sounds to be to loud, as my speakers are generally turned up for when I'm watching something, or listening to music. As such, I opened Volume Mixer and turned it's slider down to 25%, closed the mixer, went on about my business.
 Little while later got a UAC Prompt with a very loud ding. Went back, double checked, was still at 25%, so dropped it down to 5%. Little while later, another UAC Prompt, again, with a very loud ding. Went back again, opened it up, then launched the EXE again
 to hear the ding.. it was quiet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, so now I'm confused. Close it again, run the EXE again, and once again a very loud Ding. Went back, muted, closed, still a ding, opened the Mixer up yet along, ran the EXE again, no sound at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, apparently the System Sounds is ignoring it's volume setting when the Volume Mixer isn't open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried with a few other programs, all respected the settings. Tried other system sounds (not just the UAC Ding) and they ignored it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Audio is onboard Realtek HD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyone else have this problem, and hopefully found a solution?</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. I appreciate your efforts to resolve this issue,
<p>
</p><p><span>To understand the issue better, let me know w</span><span>hat is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could have occurred due to corrupt audio drivers or missing Windows Updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the steps listed here:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span><br />
I suggest you to install all the available Windows Updates including the Optional Updates. Check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:<br />
</span></strong><span>If the issue persists, I suggest&nbsp;you to un-install audio driver from device manager and re-install latest audio driver from the manufacturer website. Check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span><br />
Uninstall audio driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1) Press <strong><span>Windows + R key</span></strong>, type <strong><span>devmgmt.msc
</span></strong>and click <strong><span>Ok.&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>

</span></strong>on the driver and&nbsp;click on <strong><span>uninstall.&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span><br />
Now re-install latest audio driver from the manufacturer website.</span></p>

            <p>All Windows Updates are installed, computers are running the most recent build of Windows 10. I have tried both the "Windows" default driver for my soundcard, and the latest one from Realtek for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can now confirm this happens on multiple computers and soundcards. I have tested this on several separate computers with the same end result, and different soundcards. It was just something I never tested until it was on my main computer with the powered
 speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I will also add that I've filed this bug as an issue through the Windows Feedback in 10, but posted it here too incase there's a fix, and maybe for others to see if it happens to them.</p>

            <p>Windows 10 is now fully released. &nbsp;I upgraded from Windows 8.1, and now I'm having the same problem described here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I reduce the "System Sounds" slider, any UAC prompt or notification 'toast' maxes it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Workaround: &nbsp;keep the Volume Mixer open. &nbsp;So long as the Volume Mixer window is kept open, the System Sounds level doesn't change, even with UAC prompts.</p>

            <p>I've been having the same problem with Windows 10. I'm constantly turning the system sounds down via the Volume Mixer but the system just turns them back up again whenever it feels like it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This wouldn't be so much of a problem if the system sounds weren't so excessively loud compared with everything else. Who tests these things, for goodness sake, and decides: yeah, we'll make the system sounds ten times louder than anything else. That way
 you'll never miss one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's driving me crazy. I don't want to switch the system sounds off completely, but even if I did they'd probably switch themselves back on and deafen me later when I wasn't expecting it...</p>

            <p>I'm running Windows 10 build 10586.11 with Cirrus Logic CS4206B audio and the issue I am having is that the system sounds volume gets reset to match the device volume each time I open an application that uses audio.
<br />
</p>
<p>For example, after booting into Windows with no applications running, I will open volume mixer and set the device volume to 50% and system sounds to 5%. Once I open up a program that can use audio (Edge, Firefox, Netflix app, etc.) the system sounds volume
 gets reset to match the device sound (in this case its back to 50%). </p>

            <p>I'm seeing a slight variation from what you two are describing. On my system I set the system sounds to zero in the volume mixer but the sounds still come out very loud. The setting in the volume mixer doesn't change though.</p>

            <p>It would seem that in order for your volume adjustment to stick (at least for system sounds), you need to click on the X button in the top right corner of the "Volume Mixer" if you click away from the mixer dialog and do not click X to close the system sounds
 previous settings persist... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also Just playing with it more it always works by setting the system volume then hitting X to close, but if you go back in and change other volume settings it occasionally goes back to the same volume setting as your master or "speaker" setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So still buggy as heck in my opinion but it works if it's the last thing you set.</p>

<h2>            Is there a way to delete ALL headers and footers at once&#63;</h2>
                    Thanks to everybody here, I learned how to do headers and footers and page numbering - my print book looks great. But now I learn that an e-book doesn't have these things. For conversion to e-book format, I'm told first to delete all headers and footers.
 That's 553 of them (OK, so I'm long-winded). I've googled how to do all at once instead of one at a time, but can't find anything that applies to Word 2011 for Mac. IS there any way? Thanks again all, even if there's no way.

            <p>Well, if they really are Headers/Footers [as opposed to content copied &amp; pasted from page to page] you shouldn't have to
<em>delete</em> any more than you <em>created</em>... And I doubt you created 553 :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Headers &amp; Footers are a Section property, so if you delete the H/F for a Section it will be removed from all pages in the section. Unless you did something special (such as Left/Right) it should only be necessary to delete the Header/Footer in each Section
 -- i.e., 10 Sections, 10 deletions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you want to take a shortcut, use <strong>File&gt; Save As</strong> to save a copy as
<strong><em>Single File Web Page</em></strong> file type, then close the document. When you reopen it, confirm the conversion then switch to
<strong>Print Layout View</strong> -- All H/F should be gone. Use <strong>Save As</strong> to save another copy as
<strong>.docx </strong>file type. [<strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>This shortcut could cause loss of some content &amp; formatting depending on what has been done in the document. Make sure to review the final result carefully.</em>]</p>

<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>I have ran into a situation with a user where I had to create a whole new Microsoft Identity. After this, when he searches for an old email in Spotlight, I run into the error "outlook cannot open this file because it is not associated with the default identity."&nbsp;
 I have tried all of the steps in this article I have tried excluding the other identities from the spot light search and even deleting them and despite this he is still getting the same error message.&nbsp; Any suggestions?</p>

            Hi Kurt,<br />
<br />
May I confirm if you are indicating this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2741583" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article </a>when you mentioned “<em>I have tried all of the steps in this article</em>”? It is odd that you still get the error message even you tried deleting the old identities.<br />
Here are some tips that you can try:<br />
1.&nbsp; Check if all other identities are removed and set the new identity as default.<br />
2.&nbsp; Rebuild the database referring to step 4 in the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/kb/2360509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
kb</a>.<br />
3.&nbsp; <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201716" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Re-index your default identity</a> by dragging the identity to the Privacy tab list.<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
Jasmine<br />

 I have tried purchasing this software http://www.olk14messagerecovery.com/ and this still did not fix the issue.&nbsp; I have tried excluding all identities except for the New one that I created from spotlight, I have tried removing all the identities except the
 new one.&nbsp; Rebuilding the ID is irrelevant because this is a brand new ID.&nbsp; I noticed that the search results are still pulling up emails from old identities despite this and then I tried re-indexing the entire mac hd by removing it and re-adding it to Spotlight
 and I was still having the&nbsp; problem after that.&nbsp; I have tried scavenging individual messages as noted in the article above, but could not find corresponding emails in the message sources folder I real

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me you have a pretty handle on the concept of an identity. An identity on the Mac is indeed analogous to a Profile in Windows. In Outlook for 2016 Microsoft changed the word Identity to profile for consistency between platforms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 2011, your identities are stored in the Documents folder. For details see this article:</p>
<p>Working with Identiities</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dummies.com/software/microsoft-office-for-mac/outlook-for-mac/working-with-outlook-identities-in-office-2011-for-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/software/microsoft-office-for-mac/outlook-for-mac/working-with-outlook-identities-in-office-2011-for-mac/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a built-in tool for managing identities. This article explains how to activate the tool and how to use it:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dummies.com/software/microsoft-office-for-mac/outlook-for-mac/switching-outlook-identities-in-office-2011-for-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/software/microsoft-office-for-mac/outlook-for-mac/switching-outlook-identities-in-office-2011-for-mac/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you try to open a message associated with one identity it won't open in any other identity. You can open mail messages using File &gt; Open in Word and see the contents that way.</p>

            Thanks for the reply back Jim. It seems that what is going on is that there are duplicate entries of emails that are in the spotlight search pointing to old identities.&nbsp; I did notice this with one of the&nbsp; emails and this happens even though I moved them
 out of the Microsoft User Data/identities folder.&nbsp; I then tried to reindex the entire HD by adding it to the exclusions and then removing it, but the search history is still there.&nbsp; Any ideas?

            Unless you delete the old content Spotlight will continue to find it unless you exclude the location in Spotlight preferences.

<h2>            Nokia 6303 - full freeze, everything is gone</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This weekend I saw a black screen on my 6303. I couldn't put it on or off. So I had to take out the battery. The phone restarted and all the data in my agenda was gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saturday I put everything back in: meetings, birthdays,...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday I noticed that some of my received sms where gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I restarted the phone (just switch off power) and when the phone restarted everything, but I mean everything was gone: sms, agenda, favorites, ringtones, themes, pictures, applications,... Luckily my phonecontacts where still their. I rapidly transferred
 them all to my sim-card. Then did a hardreset (restore factory settings), but nothing came back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know what happened? What can I do? Is their a way to retrieve my lost data? Or just a way to use my phone again as I bought it, I mean standard ringtones, themes, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have my phone about 2,5 year and I was really font of it... I hope it isn't for the wastebasket...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Already a big thanks for the help!</p>

            try hook your phone to pc and see if its picked up using nokia suite<br />
if it works check for an update,if there no files visible they are gone,in future remember to back data up on a regular basis.<br />
the only option after that is to send device to a nokia care point for inspection if there is no luck and the issue is continuous.
