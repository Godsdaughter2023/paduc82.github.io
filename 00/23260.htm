<h2>            Can I drag to a point on a song or a video instead of rewinding or fast forwarding&#63;</h2>
                    As with Android and iOS you can drag a slider to a specific point on a video or piece of music. On WP8 I instead see only FF or RW. Is there an option to change this?

            In Music player, while listening to a song, you cannot drag to a point. But in Videos, you can touch to a point or drag the video file.

<h2>            not receiving mail sent to me</h2>
                    I have not received email from a particular blog I'm subscribed to for the past few weekdays. This happened once before where hotmail blocked the sender although they are in my contact list. I delete stuff from my inbox every day and also go through and
 clear the junk folder. I think there are other emails I'm not receiving as well and hotmail routinely drops newsletters I've subscribed to. Why are they blocking my emails? Do they have a minuscule daily limit for the inbox? They didn't used to. I only get
 a dozen to 18 or so emails a day so why are they blocking my mail?

            As I mentioned already the emails I'm not receiving are posts I receive every weekday from a blog I'm subscribed to. Obviously that means I receive the emails regularly. The sender IS in my contact list. I'm supposed to get emails from contacts. This happened
 once before with the same blog where hotmail blocked it from my inbox and junk file. It just stopped appearing suddenly. I also wonder what else is being sent me that outlook is blocking. Why am I not receiving my email? Again I've received from this sender
 5 days a week for YEARS and they are in my contact list. Please respond. Also how do I complain that twice requesting chat support I was wrongly sent to accounts and billing and the people I was corresponding with twice both wasted about half an hour of my
 time each with inane repetitive questions that I'd already answered - I actually wondered if they were retarded/ cognitively impaired before informing me the chat was over and they were the wrong department. Also I asked both of them

            <p>Also Maria could you please specifically answer my questions? Thank you for responding but it's the ANSWERS that will help - and resolving the issue of course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again the questions are why are emails being blocked that I am subscribed to where &nbsp;the sender IS in my contact list and I routinely get emails from them 5 days a week?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What else is outlook blocking and most importantly WHY??????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have a daily limit on how many emails can come in to my inbox?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How many emails can I send in one day if, for instance I need to invite 1500 people to an event, how many can I send in one day? I believe it used to be 500 for hotmail.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span>Have you received any emails&nbsp;from the blocked IP before? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes - as I've said repeatedly, hundreds.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Does the blocked IP sender received any bounce error messages? &nbsp;I don't know.&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Are you able to send emails to the blocked Sender? &nbsp; I'm pretty sure yes</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I used to receive weekly announcements from meet up and a few other things I am subscribed to and outlook also dropped/blocked them and a couple of them did mention something about outlook not accepting their emails. The sender I'm writing about IS
 a contact however and meet up and the others were not in my contact list. Why is outlook dropping mail? That's really BAD. I could be missing critical messages, that's why I'm concerned about this. I never had any problems like this with hotmail until outlook
 took over. So again, what is going on that my mail is not being delivered?<br />
</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>the Domain Address would be listed in the Blocked list by the server…..what does this mean? Who is the server? Is the server hotmail? Why would they block a

            <p>The other thing I wonder is why is this sender suddenly blocked/ dropped? I was receiving posts as usual from them through weds of last week, then I noticed they weren't coming in th, f, m or T. Why does the server randomly and &nbsp;suddenly block someone. Again
 the sender is in my contact list and also I have sent emails TO them so hotmail should know they are safe. Contacts are obviously safe, are they not?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This is the twelfth attempt to get an answer and have the problem addressed and fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
NO I have NOT RECEIVED an answer nor has the problem been resolved. Hotmail dropped/ is blocking 2 different newsletters I receive daily both of which senders are in my contact list and are definitely NOT on my blocked senders list. I've communicated with both
 senders and they said my email address is on their list and they show I've been sent all the posts I should have received the past 3 weeks that NEVER SHOWED UP EITHER IN MY INBOX OR IN MY JUNK FOLDER. For some reason hotmail is blocking them suddenly although
 my own account lists both as contacts and they are definitely being SENT to me. Where are my emails? I have re subscribed to both lists about 4 or 5 times and still have not received a single email. This is concerning as I have no idea what else hotmail is
 randomly blocking/ bouncing or why????&nbsp;
<div>So WHY AM I NOT RECEIVING MAIL SENT TO ME AND WHY IS HOTMAIL BLOCKING SENDERS WHO ARE CONTACTS?&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also I want to complain about the lack of effective proper customer support. It has been a wildly frustrating experience attempting to get an answer to this and you seem to have no actual way to just ask SUPPORT AND TECH HELP for problems with the account.
 Your system misdirected me 3 times and every person who responded neither listentened to exactly what I was saying nor answered me at all. It's been a giant waste of about 4 valuable hours so far with NO REAL COMMUNICATION AT ALL. Please have a REAL SUPPORT
 TEAM AND CLEAR SIMPLE WAY TO CONTACT REPS WHO ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND WHO CAN HELP. It's not right to leave people with flaws in the system and no support at all. It's been weeks I've been missing my email and I want this resolved asap so I can
 stop wasting time attempting to resolve it. I trust you can understand how frustrating this is. So far I have to say microsoft support seems non existent and truly appalling.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please respond with an answer as to why hotmail is blocking my mail. The senders have no indication of the emails being bounced or sent back to them so why are they not appearing on my account. And again they are NOT appearing in my junk folder nor are
 they on the blocked list. They are showing up nowhere. Please correct this and allow my email Why?????????????????????????????? &nbsp;Please correct this issue and allow my emails to be RECEIVED by my account!!! And do tell me WHY this happened and how to prevent
 it from happening again. I've stated all the facts of the matter a dozen times in an attempt to resolve this and no one is ac tally addressing the problem. How do I contact ACTUAL REAL TECH HELP?&nbsp;</div>

<p>
</p><p>The sender is in my contact list. They ARE a contact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have received posts from them regularly for YEARS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I can email them directly and they have responded that I am on their list and they've been sending me emails for weeks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is occurring now with 2 lists I'm subscribed to. No emails from either for the past three weeks. I don't know what else is being sent me that's disappearing in a black hole but I definitely miss and am aware of suddenly not receiving these emails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have not received info. that my emails are failed or bouncing b ack to them but the emails sent me are NOT showing up at all in my inbox where they always show up or in my junk/ spam folder and I've checked the blocked sender list and they are NOT on
 it. I assume my contacts are considered safe senders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have resubscribed to both lists numerous times over the past few weeks they have been missing and still I have not received a single post from either though they say I'm on their list and they are sending the emails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why has no one contacted me regarding this? Why is there seemingly NO TECH SUPPORT for hotmail? Is there support? will this be fixed? who do I have to speak to? the lack of help is really frustrating.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have asked for help repeatedly in this community forum and have received NO ANSWERS AND NO TECH HELP resolving a problem with my hotmail account which is very serious. How do I GET HELP???????? I've thoroughly and repeatedly explained the situation and
 asked for help &nbsp;numerous times over the past three weeks and there seems to be no way to get help. And no one answers. Is there tech help for problems with hotmail? I am not receiving emails being sent to me and they are not showing up in my inbox or my junk/
 spam folder. The senders have just been dropped / blocked but they are not receiving info that the emails they send are being returned or bounced. Both senders are contacts and definitely not on my blocked list. WHAT IS GOING ON AND MORE IMPORTANTLY PLEASE
 CORRECT IT!!!!!!!!!!! I have re subscribed to both lists many times over the past 3 weeks and still I receive no emails from either. I don't know what other mail is being sent me that I'm not receiving but I do know I'm not receiving from these two lists to
 which I'm subscribed which are contacts. I have been receiving regular posts from both for a long time. Suddenly at the end of september they disappeared and even when I re subscribe they are being blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the help I need so that my account receives the emails being sent to me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How does one get tech help and really communicate with hotmail support?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there hotmail support or are we just left with screwed up systems and no help?</p>

<h2>            clicking favorites &#40;Star icon&#41; in IE11 freezes IE - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I work in the IT Dept at a healthcare company.&nbsp; We are currently swapping users old systems, that have Win7 x64, with new systems that have Win10.&nbsp; During the process we transfer the users data from the old computer to the new, (ie. Desktop, Documents, Favorites).&nbsp;
 Once the users are set, they launch Internet Explorer 11.&nbsp; When they click on the star symbol for Favorites, The mouse will start to lag, and Internet explorer will freeze.</p>
<p>- Have tried, instead of copying the content of the Favorites folder to the new computer favorite folder, exporting the favorites on the old system to an .htm file and then importing them on the new system.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>- Have cleared all IE settings and cache.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is occurring on dozens of new systems.&nbsp; Is there a fix for this?</p>

<h2>            Event ID 396 not getting generated on ADFS 3.0 after every 4 hours</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>We are in Hybrid mode and recently we have migrated ADFS 2.0 to ADFS 3.0</p>
<p>I was getting event 396 on the ADFS Server&nbsp;2.0 and event id 392 on ADFS Proxy after every 4 hours. However on the New ADFS 3.0 these events are not appearing after every 4 hours.</p>
<p>Is this normal behavior ? Is there any different event which we need to monitor for ADFS 3.0</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Manoj,</p>
<p>No, Event ID 396 is available in ADFS 3.0. Event ID 396 is logged stating that the trust between the proxy and ADFS server is renewed. Please refer to this article to re-establish ADFS Proxy trust and then check whether the Event ID 365 is generated in the
 ADFS server.</p>
<p>For your reference the link: <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/rmilne/2015/04/20/adfs-2012-r2-web-application-proxy-re-establish-proxy-trust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>This event (396) was generated only once at the time of setting up the ADFS. Its been 4 days now and there is no such event and all services are working fine.</p>
<p>However I can see event 245 on ADFS Proxy which are appearing after every minute.</p>
<p>Please suggest.</p>

<p>Hi Manoj,</p>
<p>I have done a lot of research these days but to no vail. As of my understanding, the ADFS 3.0 works well. The only concern is the generation of Event ID 396.</p>
<p>The way how ADFS server produces logs is not controlled by Office 365. To help you get further assistance, we suggest you contact our specialists in our

            It's not working at the moment because the piece of crap VBE shipped with Office 2016 doesn't have an immediate window. Microsoft has promised to replace this junk VBE with a real one. When it comes out, the immediate window should work. Every week I install
 the Insider Fast build hoping to see the new VBE. So far, no joy.

<h2>            microsoft project truncates notes field when exporting to excel</h2>
                    
<p>hello,</p>
<p>I am trying to export a microsoft project 2003 project&nbsp; and the notes field is getting truncated. I researched on the web and I see that there are VBA macros that you can use to export the full notes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have or know where I can get a copy of the macro(s) to be able to export the full notes field?</p>
<p>is there any other way to export the full notes other that using a macro?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks in advance for the help</p>

<p>Tim,</p>
<p>You probably saw references to a macro I wrote a few years ago. It has been requested by many users. The macro is freeware and you can get a copy by contacting me at the address below. I will ask a few questions.</p>
<p>When attempting to copy and paste the Notes field, the copy and paste operation will truncate the note text string at either the first 255 characters or the first line feed, whichever occurs first. I'm not sure about Project 2010 (I haven't used it that
 much), but the only ways I know to extract the full notes text string is through VBA or via a SQL directly on the Project database.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10, Skype version 11.19.856.0 and I run Skype Android app on my phone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I get calls, the ringing happens only on my phone. I do not get call notification in my Desktop App.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want it to happen either:</p>
<p>1. Calls come to both Desktop and Phone</p>
<p>2. Calls come to Phone in case Desktop is in Away or Offline mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any setting for this?</p>

<p><span><span>This is only based on my own observations, so it will not necessary apply to your case.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>By design, calls should ring on all devices Skype is installed on and is active. The new Microsoft Skype for Windows 10 (Skype UWP) application has, however, tendency to connect
 to a call with a significant delay. If the call is answered on your Android phone, it will not ring on Skype UWP. There are no settings on Skype UWP that will change this behaviour.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I don't know if your Android phone has an auto-answer activated (never used any Android phone), but have you tried to see if you don't answer on your phone, if the call will eventually
 ring on Skype UWP too?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Skype UWP will only revert to Away mode when minimized or closed, In this mode, Skype UWP will still run in the background and should receive call notifications, but perhaps with
 even larger delay then in Online mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When Skype UWP is Offline, its obvious that calls will not ring on this application.</span></span></p>

            But my problem is that I never get calls in the Skype Windows 10 app. Calls only come to my mobile app. When I am online with both my computer and phone, I expect calls to come in my computer, but it comes only on my phone.&nbsp;

Your margins are there. I mean your formatting has not changed. &nbsp; You or someone must have&nbsp; activated show/hide white space--which ought to be called&nbsp; "show/hide top and bottom margin areas".&nbsp; Move the cursor to the top of the page until you see the&nbsp; tip "Double-click
 to show white space." Do as directed, and your margins will appear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Updating to the latest release while restarting solved the issue. I hadn't realized that I wasn't on the newest build...&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a question, as posed by our auditors, are security/membership elements within Yammer apart from SharePoint credentials or not? &nbsp;Following that is the question to what degree is Yammer integrated with SharePoint and the security provided by it; more to
 the point, if our customer is using Azure AD multi-factor authentication, is Yammer a vulnerability in that regard?</p>

<p>As per Kris, there is only manual way yo confirm members of any Yammer group. I believe it is very tedious job in case i am sending invite to more than 500 + employee of organization. If I want to do quick validation who accepted my invite and how many haven't
 joined.</p>
<p>As of now you can archive this thread. I will be waiting for any alternative way for getting Yammer group member list.</p>

</p><p>Are there any plans on getting this service? I agree with Hiral that&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">it is a very tedious job to do a list manually! I need a list of the members with their names, profession and emails,

<h2>            File Downloads Are Corrupt</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just received 3 computers pre-loaded with Windows 7 Pro and IE 9. When I try to download files, like mseinstall.exe, it substitutes an underscore for the period and it comes out like this "mseinstall_exe". Also, for every download I try I get an error
 e.g. "MSEInstall_exe couldn't be downloaded". If I click retry the download will start. It also takes an abnormally long time for the download status box to appear. All Windows updates have been successfully applied. I have other Windows 7 Pro machines running
 IE 9 that download .exe files just fine. Any thoughts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

I tried almost all of those fixes without luck. So I uninstalled IE 9 and Security Essentials. Now IE 9 won't install with error 3715.&nbsp;IE 8 works just fine but&nbsp;this is not really an acceptable solution for me. I tried running down the prerequisites rabbit hole
 with out any luck there either.

I was able to get IE 9 installed but I'n not quite sure what worked. These are the steps I think worked for me:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Uninstall IE 9</p>
<p>2. Apply all Windows Updates except for IE 9 and&nbsp;Bing Desktop</p>
<p>3. Restart with a clean boot (msconfig)</p>
<p>4. Check for Windows Updates&nbsp;- you should only have IE 9 &amp; Bing Desktop</p>
<p>5. Select IE 9, install update, restart</p>
<p>6. Start IE 9, Tools, &nbsp;Internet Options, Security Tab, De-select Enable Protected Mode checkbox</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I still don't understand why I have to do this. Protected Mode is selected on my other machines and from what I've read it's a good thing.</p>

<p>Thanks for the effort &nbsp;David, but I went back to 2003/7 Word document and found a better version that didn't need so much editing. &nbsp;Incidentally, you might know if you are a long time user that the page header choices are rather complicated to learn and
 use successfully when printing a multiple chapter book where each chapter has its own
<em>h</em><em>eading</em>, as in one or two I've spent&nbsp;<em>hundreds of hours</em>.&nbsp;manipulating. &nbsp;The main cause of trying to utilize Publisher. &nbsp;If all goes as planned I should soon have a professional copy of Adobe Acrobat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, if you are trying to write a book then you should stay with Word, not Publisher. You will be very limited with word processing in Publisher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are only trying to create a pdf then there are lots of choices available to you other than Acrobat. Try www.primopdf.com before waste a lot of money buying Acrobat...its is free. And there are others that are just as capable as Acrobat for under a
 $100.</p>

            <p>No longer getting the error msg "sorry, there seems to be a problem with outlook at the moment" but Nokia 920 takes ages to run its sync cycle and even then is still 4 days out of sync with ie9 outlook.&nbsp; ie9 outlook seems to be upto date with emails recieved
 but when sending an email takes a long time to save/send, the sending cycle graphic vanishes but the saving... remains.&nbsp; When trying to exit the page it asks if sure I want to throw away the email as not sent.&nbsp; leaving that window open and opening a second
 and checking the sent folder the email has been sent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When will the sync of your email server with outlook and mobile be fixed</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand you were getting the message "Sorry, there seems to be a problem with Outlook at the moment." when signing in to one of your accounts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There was a service interruption on the said dates that you mentioned, October 12-13. It is possible that this affected one of your accounts. This has been fixed and we'd like to know if you're still having issues with the said account.</p>

    <title>Copy and Paste of Excel Spreadsheet to New Sheet Results in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Copy and Paste of Excel Spreadsheet to New Sheet Results in Crash&#47;Not Responding</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone run into this issue? And if so, were you able to resolve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can select an area of a spreadsheet and copy and paste it into a new spreadsheet without issue, but when I use Ctrl + A to select the entire sheet, then copy and attempt to paste it into a new sheet, Excel crashes and eventually reports itself as not responding.
 I have removed all plugins, cleared history, repaired both quick and online, and upgraded from 32bit to 64bit version all without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on how to resolve this are appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hello Michael.</p>
<p>Thank you for replying. &nbsp;I've tried both the Quick Repair and the Online Repair prior to my posting of my issue. &nbsp;I even tried uninstalling the 32bit version of MS Office and reinstalled with the 64bit version. All attempts to resolve the issue have been
 unsuccessful thus far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other thoughts?</p>

<p>Hello Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been unable resolve the issue and have come to the conclusion that the issue may in fact be a result of our own doing. &nbsp;It was suggested to me that the spreadsheets we use were likely created using older versions as templates whcih were were created
 from even older versions themselves so, though we think we are using a spreadsheet "created" in 2017, in fact is really just a spreadsheet that was "modified" in 2017 but was really created in 2005 or some time well back in the company's history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we've decided to simply continue using the workaround of selecting an area of a spreadsheet and copy/paste that selection rather than using the shortcut Ctrl-A to select the entire sheet. It's not that different and it's easier than actually creating
 the spreadsheets all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

            The blank emails sounds like corruption. It's possible the corruption in one Identity has been uploaded back to the server. Have you tried rebuilding? If yes, this could result in what you are seeing. Do NOT rebuild an Identity with Exchange account. Create
 a new Identity and let Outlook download from server again into the new Identity.<br />
<br />

<br />
Exchange Basics<br />
<br />
The Inbox syncs more frequently than any other and should be kept as clean as possible. (this is the number one cause of problems with sync)<br />
<br />
Any folder with more than a few thousand messages is going to take some time to fully come down when you first sync your account. Due to the design of Outlook's sync engine (and how exchange works), you will see the 512 newest messages in a folder at the initial
 start of sync then the rest of the folder's contents will be back filled before you see any mail that arrives after this point. This is why it will look like you are not getting new mail when a folder is still going through initial sync. This is also further
 exacerbated by an Exchange issue where it gets unnecessary change events before the newer mail arrives. If you carefully watch the progress during the sync of a folder with greater than a couple thousand messages, you will see "Updating local..." a lot before
 the newer mail starts arriving (newer than the initial 512 that come down).<br />
<br />
Outlook checks the server for updates every minute, any folder that has updates will subsequently be synced. Since Outlook has a limit on how many folders can be synced at a time, there can be a queue of folders waiting. The Inbox does get high priority so
 it will generally sync before other folders that also need to sync.<br />

<h2>            OneNote Mobile App Error Message - Can&#39;t Sign In</h2>
                    <p>I am new to OneNote. Downloaded it first onto my Galaxy Tab S2 and signed in with gmail address. It worked great. Signed in on my desktop in Windows App. It worked great and synced fine. But tried to use the mobile app on my Galaxy Note 5 phone (which I
 need the most) and it won't allow sign in. I have uninstalled and installed 3 times, but it does not seem to be communicating at all. Every time I try to log in, I put my email address in and click "next" and then it gives me the error message: Can't Sign
 In / Please Try Again Later. It even does this if I try to create an account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. No firewalls are installed. I don't have sign in problems with any other app. Except OneDrive. The same thing happens in OneDrive. I'm thinking I need to install microsoft security certificates but the instructions for that do not seem doable
 on my computer. I have no option to copy the certificates on my work computer. Why is there no easy way to install these certificates?? This is a huge annoyance. And why didn't my tablet need these certificates??</p>

            Solved this problem indirectly, by becoming a beta tester. The beta version of the app identified the issue and gave me the error message that the app Android System Webview was not updated and needed updated. Fixed that and it works immediately. What
 a relief!
