Do you have an RJ45 connection on your tablet, or are you using some sort of adapter?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No I am not using any specific brand tablet. I have custom hardware made which has 10.1" LCD and AOSP 7.1.1 ported and there is LAN95XX IC which provides the Ethernet connectivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Via LAN95XX, I can connect RJ45 cable and my hardware gets Ethernet net connectivity and can do all net related stuffs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issues is only with Skype (<span>V 8.37.0.98). Only Skype is not working and not able to login when I connected to network via Ethernet cable. With WiFi connected, Skype is working fine.</span></p>

<p>========================================<br />
Sorry...I don't have "the" solution but maybe the following info <br />
would be worth a look.</p>
<p>The temp folder should be found at:</p>
<p>c:\Documents and Settings\&gt;user name&lt;\Local Settings\Temp\</p>
<p>I have no idea how to adjust the size...maybe it needs to be emptied.</p>
<p>Just wondering how many photos your project includes? <br />
PhotoStory 3 has a limit of 300 and it would be even less <br />
if the project includes lots of Motion Effects and Transitions.</p>
<p>Also what is the duration of the project? Is it more than one hour?</p>
<p>It may be worth a try to do some system maintenance.</p>

                    <p>This eyesore showed up last week. Does Microsoft understand or even care about 'screen burn in' ?
</p>
<p>This info is tucked away in settings already. Why is this necessary ? Seriously ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that i tried so far was . . .</p>
<p>Settings &gt; Ease Of Access &gt; Disable background</p>
<p>This is a very <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>ghetto </strong>
</em></span>solution but it does remove the watermark and leave you with a crisp black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem still remains for those of us who want wallpaper with NO WATERMARKS.</p>

    <title>Wi-Fi consistently drops after half an hour and can&#39;t reconnect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reinholdwillcox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wi-Fi consistently drops after half an hour and can&#39;t reconnect</h2>
                    <p>I've been running into some weird Wi-Fi connectivity issues lately. I did a Windows 10 update recently, and I've read that that's caused some other folks to have similar problems, but I'm not 100% sure if this is a Windows issue. When I connect using my
 login credentials, I get half an hour of steady Wi-Fi with no issues. After half an hour, the signal drops. When I go to reconnect, I get the error:&nbsp;<em>Can't connect because the sign-in requirements for your device and the network aren't compatible. Contact
 your IT support person.&nbsp;</em>I have similar connectivity issues at the local library, but I connect fine at home, suggesting it might be an issue with the public vs private network settings. Weirdly, I timed the connection, and I'm almost certain that it lasts
 for EXACTLY 30 minutes. This reinforces the possibility that it's some weird setting that is scheduled to run (and then break) half an hour after the Wi-Fi connection starts up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at work on my personal device, so I can't touch the router or modem, and unfortunately the company doesn't offer support. I'm sure this issue is with my laptop because my phone connects fine with the same credentials, and no one else here has had any
 issues. I'm running Windows 10 on a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon with an Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 8260 network adapter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Here are some of the fixes I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turning the wifi off &amp; on, forgetting and reconnecting to the network, and restarting my computer each individually do not fix the issue, BUT, forgetting the network, turning off the wifi, restarting the computer, turning on the wifi, and connecting back
 to the network IN THAT ORDER let's me reconnect. For half an hour. Then it drops again. These are not the solutions I'm looking for.</li><li>Updating the network adapter, and rolling it back, both do nothing. It was (supposedly) already updated, but I confirmed that the issue persists on versions20.50.1.1 and 20.30.0.7 of the Intel adapter. (And yes, I restarted after each change).</li><li>Changing the power management of the driver so that it doesn't "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" (i.e unchecking the box) does nothing. I didn't have high hopes for this one since I've been plugged in the whole time.</li><li>Turning on IPv6 did nothing.</li><li>I found a partial solution <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking-winpc/windows-10-wireless-intermittently-disconnecting/e32a4309-9c04-428a-8bc2-d1ded4407357">
here&nbsp;</a>- the user wrote up a .bat file which runs some ipconfig, netsh, and other commands. When the connection breaks, I forget the network, turn off the wifi, and run the .bat file as administrator. Once it closes, I can reconnect. Basically, it skips the
 step in the first bullet where I have to restart the computer, which is definitely a plus.</li></ul>
<p>Any thoughts, internet?</p>

            Hi Reinhold.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br />
<br />Check that the wireless button on a laptop is toggled on.  It may be a Function (Fn) key or it may be an actual switch on the side.
<br />
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try updating the Network adapter driver from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try Rolling back and then Uninstalling the Network adapter driver in Device Manager.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose the Network adapter you're using, on Driver tab choose Roll back, restart PC.  If that doesn't help  ry Uninstall, restart to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />I'd also check at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates if there were WIndows Updates installed before this problem started.  You can uninstall them from the link there to see if the problem goes away.  If so you can hide the Updates using the same tool above.  
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df_B06XSFPDFX5388318/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;creative=394997&amp;creativeASIN=B06XSFPDFX&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=198076677096&amp;hvpos=1o1&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=17389337054377542194&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9012017&amp;hvtargid=pla-373873511931" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06XSFPDFX/ref=asc_df...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Or you can use an Ethernet cable as necessary which should connect automatically.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            RepositoryRestoreInProgress&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 8.1 Pro 32 bit laptop that has a "plugged in, not charging" condition. I wiped the hard drive, and installed Windows, and two drivers, so that's all that's on there. I've uninstalled every app that has an uninstall on right-click. (Some
 don't (OneDrive, Photos, etc.). I've also removed (unchecked) all Windows features except IE11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to repeatedly remove the power cord and reinstall it and then the battery will start charging for awhile. Then, something will turn the charging off and that error will pop up. So, I remove and reinstall the cord, and the battery will charge for a
 minute and then stop with that error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frustrating. So I'm using Sysinternal's Process Monitor and watching every process, every file access, and registry access to see if I can see what is turning off the battery charging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No luck yet, but I noticed this is going on <strong>every 30 seconds</strong>:</p>
<p>RegOpenKey&nbsp;&nbsp; HKLM&nbsp;&nbsp; SUCCESS</p>
<p>RegOpenKey HKLM\SOFTWARE\MICROSOFT\WBEM\CIMOM\RepositoryRestoreinProgress&nbsp;&nbsp; NAME NOT FOUND</p>
<p>RegCloseKey HKLM Success</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would rather not have this operation going on using up CPU time looking for something it can't find....every 30 seconds(!!). I looked through the registry and there isn't a key by that name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I turn this constant searching off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Marilou,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I appreciate your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. This computer is older so it's not covered by manufacturer warranty or support. HP has already said that. If computers are more than five years old, in my experience, the manufacturer's delete their info/spec/drivers webpage for that model, and give you
 a message that support for that model has ended. That's the case here. HP doesn't even show that my model existed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. This process I am questioning is requesting a Microsoft product that is not responding (SOFTWARE\<strong>MICROSOFT</strong>\WBEM\CIMOM\), so again, I think that a Microsoft forum would be more appropriate than the HP forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>leaning</p>

<h2>            External HDD is not recognized by USB after downgrading from Win 8.1 to Window 7 Ultimate</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I got a brand new Toshiba Satellite C5 series laptop with Windows 8.1 pre-installed. &nbsp;because I am used to with Windows 7 I had clean installation(downgraded) Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Toshiba have all Windows 7 drivers for this model I have.I downloaded all drivers from Toshiba web site, most of the features are working on the laptop. Even USB mouse and USB keyboard.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But as soon as I plugged in my external HDD(500gb) &nbsp;TARGA v500 , I am getting error of "&nbsp;<b>one of the&nbsp;USB&nbsp;devices attached to this computer has&nbsp;malfunctioned and windows does not recognize it</b> "</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did full virus scan to my external HDD on my old computer with Malware Bytes anti-malvare and it found no issue, &nbsp;I went in to Device Manager , uninstall the USB drivers and restart the laptop, it automatically installed the USB driver as normal. But
 still my new computer doesn't recognize the external HDD.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did shut down the computer, remove the battery and pressed the power button for 10-15 second to do power cycle.Still not solved the issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then search Targa.uk web site for compatible Win 7 drivers for Targa, there are no drivers for this model. As I said before Targa external HDD works fine with my 5 years old laptop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How come this computer USB ports are working with USB mouse but not with external HDD, and how come the external hdd works on 5 years old computer and doesn't work on this new computer??</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am digging internet for this problem but it seems most people complaining the about same problem!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;Any ideas , how can solve this issue? Thanks in advance</div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Can&#39;t import pictures from SD card. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericibh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t import pictures from SD card.</h2>
                    We just returned from a vacation, and having forgot our SD card, we lowered the picture quality on the camera to 1.2 megapixels so that we could store as many pictures as possible to the internal memory of our Kodak Easyshare C180. When we returned we
 copied everything to the SD card and plugged it into the F drive. It uploaded four pics and then gave us a message that the drive needed formatting, but when we tried to format it was unsuccessful. We ended up formatting the card after plugging back into the
 camera and repeating everyhting. Plugging the SD card in a second time we don't get the format prompt but just an SD file that, once we open both automatically and manually, stops responding. We can't import, copy manually, nor see any of the pictures once
 we plug it into the drive, yet the camera reads the card just fine. I have a brand new HP with Windows 7.&nbsp;

            <p>The following Kodak document states that your camera<br />
has 16MB of internal memory and 11MB are usable for photos....<br />
<br />
Just wondering how many photos you expected to download<br />
from the camera?.<br />
<br />
What are the pixel dimensions of the 4 photos you managed <br />
to download to your hard drive?<br />

(see page : 49 - 8&nbsp;Appendix - Internal Storage Capacity)<br />
<br />
If you can still view the photos&nbsp;on the camera's view screen...&nbsp;<br />
it may be worth a try&nbsp;to connect the Camera to the PC&nbsp;via USB <br />
Cable to see if you could download the photos..<br />
<br />
Once you have recovered the photos...it may be worth a try<br />
format the memory card in the camera.</p>

                    <p>Dear Sir/ Madam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was power shutdown and my PC with Window XP Home SP-2 came to a loop of “Safe Mode” etc. and booting stops. Further bootings reaches to same place again and again. I tried with F-8 button and it shows as
</p>
<p>
</p><p>“ Problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If this is the first time you have seen this stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed. If this is the new installation, ask your hardware or software manufactured on any Windows updates you might need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If problem continues, disable or remove any new hardware or software. Disable BIOS memory option such as catching or shadowing. If you need to use Safe Mode to remove or disable components, restart your computer, press F-8 to select advance start up option

            <p>That error message indicates a problem with your NT File System (NTFS) and is quite common after a power interruption, power failure, aborted restart, ungraceful shutdown, plug pulling, using the reset button or power switch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will not be booting in any mode with that error but it is usually easy to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix it, you need to run a chkdsk with error correction (chkdsk&nbsp; /r) but you are going to have to boot on something in order to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that your system of unspecified make and model has a working CD/DVD drive I will provide instructions to create a Hiren's Boot CD and you can run the chkdsk with error correction from there.&nbsp; If you need instructions to make a bootable Hiren's on
 a USB thumb drive, I can provide those too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:<br />
<br />
Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a><br />
<br />
The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a><br />
<br />
Like many third party programs you might install, the ImgBurn installation defaults to installing things you probably don't want installed on your system in the form of extra Internet browser toolbars or may make other adjustments to your browser.&nbsp; You don't
 want to install any of that so you have to pay attention during the installation.<br />
<br />
When clicking through the installation screens be sure to pay attention to the screens and always choose a Custom install and UNcheck the following (or any other things like it):<br />
<br />
UNcheck:<br />
<br />
Ad-Aware<br />
Powered by Bing<br />
<br />
Click Next and UNCheck:<br />
<br />
Tuneup Utilities<br />
<br />
Click Next to continue the installation of ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />

<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
cmd<br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r<br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.<br />
<br />
Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. <br />
<br />
Depending on the the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk with error correction to complete (several to many hours) or it may appear to be 'stuck'.&nbsp; Be
 patient.&nbsp; If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something so don't interrupt it.&nbsp; It will finish eventually one way or the other.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount to be sure it is still making progress.&nbsp; It may even appear to go backwards
 sometimes.<br />
<br />
You may have to run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; it more than once.<br />
<br />
When the chkdsk runs clean, remove the CD and restart your system.</p>

<h3> olddoc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Print spooler keeps crashing. Had filesys error and corrupt registry hive. Now I can not get the spooler to stay running</h2>
                    I had a hard lockup and ntfs errors recently. They were fixed with chkdsk /f.
<br />
Now I can not get the print spooler to stay running. I can manually restart it but it crashes every time.
<br />
I tried to uninstall all printers and delete everything in .../system32/spool/printers but I still can't get the spooler to stay running. I can not add printers because the spooler won't run. I tried system restore but that didn't fix it.<br />

            Now the system is really getting hosed. I tried to open a cmd prompt and it crashed and reported the error.<br />
I wonder if I can do an in place reinstall to fix it: reinstall Win7 pro 64 bit without formatting and wiping my installed programs.

            Since your spooler breaks because (I do assume) ONLY one of the installed printers, find which one it is and delete it from the registry<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\ HP1020 in my case, and reinstall latest Driver

    <title>Being booted from XBL every 5 Minutes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geeksdontlie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Being booted from XBL every 5 Minutes</h2>
                    
<p>Since last night I have been getting booted from XBL every 5 minutes. I can connect up again straight away as if there's no real connection issue but if that is the case then I shouldn't be getting booted in the first place. It's not my internet as both
 my PC and Laptop have remained connected throughout. My xbox is wired so I changed my ethernet cable but this didn't fix it. I then tried using the wireless as it's a slim 250GB xbox but when it is testing the connection it doesn't manage to connect to xbox
 live. I've reset my router now several times to no avail. I've been playing Last Remnant, and whenever I've been disconnected it won't let me load up any save files as it says:</p>
<p>'Load failed. Please download a required update to load this data."</p>
<p>Which is weird because I swear I've played this game offline before, it is fully updated and it has no problems loading my saves if I am connected to XBL.</p>
<p>My info:</p>
<p><strong>What Country/State/Province do you live in? UK.<br />
Modem brand &amp; model number:&nbsp; - <br />
Router brand &amp; model number: SKY Wireless Router DSL-2640S<br />
Network Connection Type: Wireless/Wired Normally wired but once I encountered this problem I tried using Wireless but it fails once it tries to connect to XBL<br />
If Wireless, what type of encryption are you using? WPA2<br />
If Wireless, are you using a white or black external adapter, or an internal (Xbox 360S) adapter? internal XBox 360S<br />
</strong><strong>Things you have tried: Using 2 different ethernet cables, using wireless adapter instead, resetting router<br />
</strong><strong>Is UPnP Enabled? Yes<br />
</strong><strong>Is NAT Type Open? Yes<br />
</strong><strong>Any Error Codes you encounter:&nbsp; - <br />
</strong><strong>What type of internet do you have? Cable/DSL/T1/3G? Cable<br />
</strong><strong>Who is your ISP(Internet Service Provider)? SKY<br />
</strong><strong>After you run "Test Xbox LIVE connection" and click on "More info", what is the exact message shown on screen?
<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>The wired connection is fine until it boots me. The wireless connection can get through the Xbox360, wireless router and internet stages but doesn't make it through the "Connect to Xbox Live" stage. It loads about 25% and then I get the Test Failed
 message. The "More Info" option says:</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Your console is connected to the Internet but can't contact Xbox LIVE.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Turn your router or modem off and back on, then wait 30 seconds.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Have you restarted your router or modem?"</strong></p>
<p><br />
<strong>I've tried this several times and it doesn't fix it.<br />

<h2>            Bing rewards, can I be given redeem codes from people who don&#38;&#35;39&#59;t want them&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I know Microsoft can tell if you create more than one account from one computer or one ISP but what about those that aren't? I have some friends and middle age family members who use bing. If they sign up and don't want the rewards can they redeem say an
 XBOX Live Gold or MS Points code and then text/email the code to me? I mean if they're going to use it why can't I? Or is that against the service agreement. A lot of them are gift cards so maybe I'm being too hopeful.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Windows doesn't have an alignment grid feature but some monitors do - especially ASUS monitors.&nbsp; They call it the QuickFit function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to find the user manual for your monitor and see how to enable/disable the feature and if you can't find it tell us the make and model of your monitor and we might help you look for one.</p>

            Hi Ezra.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you all possible fixes for Sleep, based on ten years troubleshooting it almost daily.  If you need help performing any step just ask back:
<br />
<br />First confirm you have the Sleep options configured correctly as shown here:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2843-change-power-plan-settings-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2843-change...</a>.  
<br />
<br />You might want to try Hibernate to succeed Sleep, or use Hibernate in place of Sleep - it's just a deeper sleep that actually powers off because desktop stored in RAM during sleep is written to hard drive hiberfile then powered off.  
<br />
<br />Most Sleep problems are caused by the Display driver, so try updating yours from the PC or Device maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service tag.  While there make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Network, Sound, USB and all other drivers by comparing those posted for download with the version and date of the corresponding ones in the Device Manager.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then in Device Manager on Display device Driver tab choose Roll back, Uninstall (then restart to reinstall) or try another one previously installed at Device Manager&gt;Display adapter&gt;Driver&gt;Update Driver&gt;Browse&gt;Let me pick.  
<br />
<br />In addition there are steps here to specifically troubleshoot Sleep mode problems:  <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sleep-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sle...</a>
<br />
<br />What I do is go into Advanced Power options and set Display and Sleep to 1 minutes, Hibernate to 2 minutes, then after completing each step restart the PC and observe what happens for 3 minutes.  
<br /> 
<br />Also did it previously work?  Do you have a System Restore point from when it did?<a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if an Update reinstalls and causes the same problem uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>
</p><p><strong>The Display Driver is not the problem.</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows Update and System restore is pointless. This issue has existed since I bought the laptop and dock together. (im just getting around to fixing it as i have some free time).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The issue is that Windows seems to ignore instructions to not allow mouse input to wake the computer.</strong><strong> The mouse is connected to the lenovo TB3 dock.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This is a legitimate bug. No matter how I disable mice from being able to wake the computer, it still ends up doing so.</strong>

            I assume you've tried other mice to test this.  The problem may be the dock, so remove it long enough to test. 
<br />
<br />The error is interesting because it refers to Connected Standby which was problematic in Sleep in Windows 8 because it can't respond to other Power Management states or inputs.

            Close this I figured out what the issue was. The port on my network was just allowing https protocol so the Windows Update port was not being allowed once taken off my work network it was fine. Have rectified the issue on my work network.

            Hi AlgeraNo, there is a known bug in the 1803 version of Windows 10. Microsoft are aware of this issue and hopefully are working on a patch . . . 
<br />
<br />For the moment, please try this workaround to set your preferred input language:
<br />
<br />Right click your Start Button, choose Powershell (admin) 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />$1 = New-WinUserLanguageList en-US 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList $1 
<br />
<br />Close Powershell and restart your PC
<br />
<br />That's It!       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You should do following - 
<br />
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />Copy and paste below and Enter in Powershell 
<br />Get-WinUserLanguageList 
<br />
<br />Now, you will get the languages which are installed. Make a note of language tag of the language which you want to retain. Let's say that this language tag is en-GB. 
<br />
<br />Now, Copy and paste below and Enter in Powershell 
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList en-GB 
<br />
<br />This will make other languages disappear. (In case, you want to add again or other languages, you can add again from language settings)

<h2>            Bluetooth Headset interferes with flash&#47;HTML5</h2>
                    I got a new pair of IJOY LOGO bluetooth headphones the other day. I tried connecting them like my old headphones and everything was fine, for a while. But i changed from "Hands free mode" to "stereo mode" in my audio output (Hands free mode was muffled
 and echoey) and all videos and audio playback stopped. I could hear other sounds just fine, but everything else stopped. I am using Win 10 64 bit on an ASUS laptop.

<p>Hi Trinity,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several factors that can contribute as to why your new headphones are affecting the audio output of your laptop. This could be caused by the audio software settings on your laptop that needst to be reset or the settings of the new Bluetooth headset
 that needs to be configured. For us to resolve your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any software installers that came with your new Bluetooth headset?</li><li>The settings that your changed on the laptop, have you tried to revert to the previous settings and check if that will correct the audio output?</li><li>Was there any audio software installed in your laptop that controls your audio settings or you are just using the Windows 10 default audio controller?</li><li>Which version and build of Windows 10 do you have installed in your laptop?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response to our queries.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your assistance. As for answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- No software installers came with my headset. It did add drivers unlike my previous Bluetooth headset (which never gave me these problems).</p>
<p>- I restored all settings involving Bluetooth and sound to their default. It didn't help.</p>
<p>- I use the Windows 10 default audio controller.</p>
<p>- I am running Windows 10 Home 64 bit ver. 1703</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that it has been a day, the problem has changed slightly. My headset connects just fine and everything works like normal for anywhere between 5-20 minutes. (i.e. I can watch a 20 minute video with no problem given I don't pause for too long, but the
 next video I try to watch either the sound or video doesn't work.) If I disconnect and reconnect my headset the cycle starts over again. Another thing to note is that every time I troubleshoot Bluetooth it says "Check Bluetooth radio status". Sometimes it
 can fix it and sometimes it can't.</p>

<p>Since this is the case and you are using the default audio controller in Windows 10, we suggest that you attempt to uninstall the Bluetooth related drivers in your computer. This will allows us to verify if the concern is caused by the device drivers the
 system is providing. You can follow the steps below to uninstall the Bluetooth drivers:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Search for <strong>Device Manager</strong> via <strong>Cortana</strong> and hit the
<strong>Enter</strong> key.</li><li>Go to <strong>View</strong>, and click <strong>Show hidden icons</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Device Manager</strong>, Expand <strong>Bluetooth</strong>.</li><li>Uninstall all Bluetooth-related drivers listed in the <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Restart your PC.</li><li>After restarting, allow the default Bluetooth drivers to be automatically downloaded by windows. Make sure that you are connected to the internet for this process to push through.</li><li>Reinstall all other drivers from the support website of your Bluetooth headset.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response after completing the steps.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 1607 Hangs on Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ethar alali  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1607 Hangs on Update</h2>
                    <p>About a month ago, 1607 was downloaded to my machine through the update process, as it does by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update process sets a restart date and time for the update. Fine. Restarts and when it gets as far as 0% or 1% on the return (first screen after the reboot) with the white dots, it hangs and stays hanged. No disk movement. Nothing. The system has to
 be hard reset to regain control of the computer. It "restores" the previous version of Windows and then a minute or two of using it, it freezes completely. No mouse response, nothing. Again, this requires a hard reset. This time, without any restoration, it
 returns to a functioning state. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This means that I cannot install 1607. A screenshot of the frozen position is shown at the end of this message. This is not an intermittent fault, as it happens 100% of the time. Also, the freeze is definitely permanent. I've left it for more than 36 hours
 in the past and it's remained frozen. So it's definitely not me being impatient :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I have attempted:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Updated the BIOS </li><li>Updated the NVidia graphics driver to the latest version</li><li>Disconnected all peripheral devices</li><li>Wiped the "Previous Windows installation(s) files" folder</li><li>Built a DVD from ISO (media creation tool) - with and without a clean install</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>And this fault persists regardless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a problem when I first got Windows 10 through the Windows 8 update process. It also failed to install. It was only several builds later that it successfully installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The summary of my platform is:</p>
<ul>
<li>AMD FX-9590</li><li>GigaByte GA-970A-DSP3 motherboard</li><li>2x SSD (both Crucial disks)</li><li>NVidia GeForce 650 Video Card&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/575763a6-a337-45c7-8744-8797f5d608c2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/575763a6-a337-45c7-8744-8797f5d608c2" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get Windows 10 on this machine? What else should I remove to get the latest update?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've unplugged all peripherals and also even switched SATA channels, all with the same result when it comes to the first reboot. As it happens, a clean install only got as far as the "Getting Ready" screen then hung. So now I have a brick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help you can provide will be appreciated<br />

            <p>Right, so if anyone else needs it, there was no solution even with MS Tier 1 support. MS Tier 2 support were due to call, but were late and in any event, I had to back up my stuff, as they were heading down the route of just telling me to Clean Install is,
 so had to reschedule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, there wasn't a way past it but to back up and tank the lot. Plus, even that wasn't faultless. It didn't work from USB, it didn't work from UEFI either (the drives were not all UEFI compatible as they used a Master Boot Records. So it simply wouldn't
 install, even if I switched the BIOS over). So I had to burn a DVD and install clean. All my data and applications were lost as expected (hence why I always back up :) which given the size of the disks and the applications I had on there was a huge waste of
 time to restore. Days in fact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definitely not an ideal solution. It was either clean install or stick with 1511 which was potentially liable to not accept the update roadmap in the future. Had to bite the bullet.&nbsp;</p>
