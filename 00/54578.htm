<h3> usersunflower  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Comfort Keyboard 4000 not typing correct keys&#63;</h2>
                    Example typing the g key inputs the o. Not just some of the keys are off, all of them are wrong. Keyboard is unusable.<br />
Steps taken to resolve issue: <br />
Replaced batteries. <br />
Plugged USB into a different port.<br />
Tried reconnecting/re syncing keyboard to receiver.<br />
Tried keyboard on a different computer.<br />
Updated driver.<br />
Keyboard is over 3 years old so it is out of warranty. <br />
<br />

            The keyboard did not work on the other computer. The keyboard was working fine the last we used it. No changes were made to the computer that it was connected to. It is a keyboard/mouse combo and the mouse is working fine. So I know that there is no problems
 with the receiver.&nbsp;

I have tried all the steps on the support page more than once. <br />
I don't think there is anymore steps to take except to throw it out.<br />

At this point, I agree. I think it is safe to say that the keyboard itself is damaged.

<p>Since you have tried all the troubleshooting steps without any success and even the keyboard is not working when connected to other computer, I would suggest you to take the keyboard to some teckshop for any hardware issue.</p>

<h2>            Surface 4 Pro High CPU Usage</h2>
                    Last week I noticed that the fan on my Surface Pro 4 i5 is running constantly.&nbsp; This is something new.&nbsp; When I look at the CPU resource monitor, the CPU is running at 37-44% - very consistent, no peaks or valleys.&nbsp; However, when I look at the detailed
 process and service lists, the total of the CPU column is 4-5%, as I would expect for an idling machine. &nbsp; I have uninstalled the 9/14 update (KB3189866)&nbsp; and anti-malware programs.&nbsp; I've performed two-button reboot.&nbsp; It keeps coming right back to idling at
 40% CPU.&nbsp; Any ideas are appreciated.

You may not be aware that if you click on the CPU column in TaskManager the highest cpu processes will float to the top making it much easy to identify them.

            I installed Process Explorer and it revealed a process named "core.exe" which belongs to the Prey software.&nbsp; I checked my Prey account online, and the Surface hadn't reported in for two weeks.&nbsp; I uninstalled the Prey software, problem solved.&nbsp;

    <title>audio routing per application - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            audio routing per application</h2>
                    <p>This has been frustrating me for years but why is there still no way to rout individual applications to separate sound devices over the years there has been ways to trick the os to do it for things or 3rd party applications which are now abandoned (probably
 fed up of chasing updates that broke them.... and charging too much)&nbsp; but this all seems like too much effort for something that should be an OS function.. and looks like it could be fairly easily...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>for me I have my source from my pc (through HDMI) as me and my partner only really use netflix or youtube. though there are time where am wanting to play games or something through headphones and the other monitor. only to find this has gone from complicated
 but possible to as far as i can see its not impossible again.... this is BASIC audio routing for crying out loud(more frustrating as a sound engineer). best solution I can think of would involve me using a piece of kit I use for work and a DAW. which not only
 consumes a chunk of computing resources but also is a pain and shouldn't be necessary</p>

    <title>double characters when typing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrsteve77  say:</h3>
<h2>            double characters when  typing</h2>
                    My keyboard has begun to type double characters. I've changed keyboard setttings in control panel, but still have the problem.<br />
<br />
The keyboard is a USB keyboard, but in device manager the location is shown as "on Microsoft eHome Infrared Transceiver". I don't know if this is something to do with the problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

            Hi Tank,<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the reply.<br />
<br />
Well, I tried reinstalling the drivers but it didn't make any difference.<br />
<br />
Then I found the sound on the PC had disappeared, and I couldn't turn it up. So I unplugged my USB headphones, and found I could turn sound up, and the sound came from the speakers.<br />
<br />
I plugged in the headphones again, and ran a sound test in control panel, and the sound came back.<br />
<br />
And, you've guessed it, the keyboard started to work as well.<br />
<br />
All I can think is it must have been some kind of temporary conflict with the USB headphones. Don't you love the way computers think.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for taking the time to help me out.<br />
<br />
Best,<br />
<br />
Steve<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Rewards&#47;Points, feedback hub and &#39;sweepstakes&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Is it just me or is there only one prize in these competitions that millions of people spend hours earning points for just so they can achieve a couple of entries?</p>
<p>What are the actual odds of winning?</p>
<p>Seems a bit harsh if that's the case - I'm sure MS could at least have say 500 winners for an Xbox bundle or something, maybe I've overlooked something and they actually do give away a fair amount but it's not very clear what/how many prizes are available
 and that's quite an important issue considering the millions of people participating.</p>
<p>Also, if you're providing loads of feedback and completing 'quests' do you get any reward points or rewards in general for that? We are taking time out of our own lives to help MS better their products and research and development employees get paid a very
 good salary for using information and ideas that we provide!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Xbox as the category because it seemed like the closest possible thing,</p>

<p>Hi there SamuelBarnes</p>
<p>
</p><p>They do actually mention how many are up for grabs and do mention the winners on a page called winners, Each sweepstake is of course different. But there is always a chance to get something instead of sweepstakes, example xbox live or game pass or credit
 on your account ect :)&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can use System Restore from the System Recovery Options menu. It's just like running System Restore normally, with one exception: System Restore can't create new restore points in this mode, so you can't undo a restore operation. However, you can run
 System Restore again and choose a different restore point, if one exists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>To run System Restore using preinstalled recovery options<br />

<div>1.Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer using the computer's power button.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2.Do one of the following: </div>
<div>•If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon
 prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer. </div>
<div>•If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to repair, and then press and hold F8.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3.On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight Repair your computer, and then press Enter. (If Repair your computer isn't listed as an option, then your computer doesn't include preinstalled recovery options, or your network administrator
 has turned them off.) </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>4.Select a keyboard layout, and then click Next. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>5.On the System Recovery Options menu, click System Restore, and then follow the instructions.

<div>If your computer's system is severely damaged and you cannot access the System Recovery Options menu on your computer, you can access it using the Windows 7 installation disc or a USB flash drive, or using a system repair disc if you created one earlier.
<div>To use this method, you need to restart (boot) your computer using the disc.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1.Insert the Windows 7 installation disc or USB flash drive, or a system repair disc, and then shut down your computer.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2.Restart your computer using the computer's power button. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>3.If prompted, press any key and then follow the instructions that appear.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>4.On the Install Windows page, or on the System Recovery Options page, choose your language and other preferences, and then click Next.
<div>•If neither the Install Windows page nor the System Recovery Options page appear, and you're not asked to press any key, you might need to change some system settings. To learn how to do this, see Start your computer from a Windows 7 installation disc
 or USB flash drive. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>5.If you're using the Windows installation disc, click Repair your computer.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>6.Select the Windows installation you want to repair, and then click Next. </div>

<h3> david164  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Fall Creators Update failed due to MIGRATE_DATA error. Is there any fix to this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to update to Windows 10 Fall Creators Update recently, both through Windows Update and Update Assistant, but at around 30% - 45% mark, it restarted only then to put up a "Restoring your previous version of Windows" screen. It restored
 and restarted my laptop back like nothing has happened. And there's no log files nor error codes provided for the issue. Yet, after I tried to install through Media Creation Tool by downloading and extracting Windows.iso to USB for the update installation,
 the same thing happened again. However, it put up an error code provided in the picture below. Any ideas what that is and how can I fix it? Please note that my laptop was just recently bought brand new a couple of months ago and didn't do anything to mess
 up the files in it.</p>
<p>

                    When I try to safely remove my usb or hard drive it says:<br />

"The application \Device\HarddiskVolume4\Windows\System32\svchost.exe is preventing this device from being stopped. Close the application and then try to stop the device again."<br />
<br />
I don't have anything open, I just turned on my laptop. Also when I try to shut down it says: "Task host is stopping background tasks." from there I can cancel or "shut down anyway". I've already restarted my laptop a few times and it's still showing me these
 messages. Also it keeps showing "maintenance in progress" on my task-bar and when I press stop maintenance nothing happens.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are unable to remove usb drive safely and while performing shut down you are getting error "Task host is stopping background
 tasks."</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This error usually occurs if some third party applications are interfering with system files or
</span><span>if your anti-virus is actively monitoring/scanning the USB drive. Normally, when you remove a flash drive from a USB port, Windows should stop all the read-write operations on the drive
 so that it can be safely removed. If not, the flash drive can be damaged or data may be lost or corrupted. However, if Windows determines a file is in use, then it may provide a message which indicates the volume cannot be stopped right now.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, before ejecting or disconnecting any storage device, make sure none of the above activities are performed on the storage device before ejecting. Most USB devices can be removed and unplugged. When
 unplugging storage devices, such as USB flash drives, make sure that the computer has finished saving any information to the device before removing it. If the device has an activity light, wait for a few seconds after the light has finished flashing before
 unplugging it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The manual way of bringing back the Safely Remove Hardware window is by running a command.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1) Press <strong><span>Windows key + R</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2) Type in or copy and paste the following line and click
<strong>OK</strong>. The command below is case sensitive.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>rundll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL hotplug.dll</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>That will bring up the <strong>
“Safely Remove Hardware”</strong> dialog which you can use to stop the USB device that you want to unplug. When you close the window, this often has the side effect of also restoring the icon.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please let us know the status of the issue so that we can help you further.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

    <title>WiFi&#47;Networking issue when connected to docking station - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alpha1-786  say:</h3>
<h2>            WiFi&#47;Networking issue when connected to docking station</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought the new Surface Pro 4 (i7, 512 GB SSD) along with the new docking station. I've experienced some of the general issues that various other people have mentioned (such as the power management/sleep issue) but I'm also seeing an issue that
 does not yet seem reported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have the new docking station connected, if it's connected to a monitor, the network connectivity sometimes drops. I have been using it without any issues for about 2 weeks, but today I had a lot of trouble connecting to the office WiFi network. The
 network itself was definitely working properly as it was quick and reliable for several other users, including my own phone. Nonetheless, I rebooted the router to make sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows simply would not connect to the WiFi network (even though it has always been a saved connection). Trying to connect caused it to sometimes fail and sometimes ask for the network password (and entering it correctly would still fail - but that's another
 long-standing Windows bug!). Connecting to alternative networks did exactly the same; it would attempt to connect to my phone's portable hotspot, connect and disconnect in a few seconds, retry, and then stop (in a disconnected state). Intermittently it would
 connect to the network, but sometimes with 'No Internet' and clearly lots of DNS issues in trying to resolve google.com. It sometimes took 30-60 seconds to load google.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Troubleshooting steps</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>Tried disabling and re-enabling the WiFi adapter</li><li>Tried restarting Windows 10</li><li>Tried disabling all other network adapters (the Ethernet port from the dock and two created by VirtualBox)</li><li>Tried removing dock connection
<ul>
<li>This is the first time the connection issues were resolved and google.com was loaded (and could be reloaded) within milliseconds</li></ul>
</li><li>Re-attached dock and tried removing Logitech unifying receiver (the only USB device plugged in)</li><li>Tried removing monitor
<ul>
<li>Everything back to normal, was able to browse very quickly again</li></ul>
</li><li>Tried re-attaching monitor
<ul>
<li>Network issues again where loading google.com would take around 20 seconds and refreshing the page would also take several seconds</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Clearly there is an issue with the external display. The display is a 1080p monitor which is connected via a HDMI cable and a Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adapter. The strange part is that this problem has never come up before, though in hindsight I would say
 that browsing at the office has been generally a little bit slower than at home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this issue? I might try to get an older pre-1.4 spec HDMI cable to see if this has an effect.</p>

            <p>I can get my LAN working through the Docking station, but when I unplug, the wifi doesn't work.... seems to be specific to Surface 4 (i7, 500GB SSD, 16 GB). My Surface Pro 1 is fine and so is my 2008 MacBook.</p>

            <p>I have the dock connected via display port adapter to hdmi port&nbsp;on an Acer 27" touch&nbsp;monitor. I have&nbsp;EXACTLY the same symptoms and issues as above. In the beginning it was more temporary issues, but now it is so bad I cannot use the network when using the
 dock at all. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have&nbsp;numerous other surface pro 4 issues, like pen sometimes not working, keyboard disconnect issues etc. I come from a Macbook, and am not sure if these issues are "normal" Windows issues, or specific to the surface pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a note: To get the needed custom resolution for my 27" monitor, I had to manually&nbsp;install the Intel display drivers(!)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Surface Dock Ethernet port problems.&nbsp; Sounds like you're experiencing identical Surface Dock Ethernet misbehavior as I did.&nbsp; Performed similar steps to yours with my router, had similar findings.&nbsp;&nbsp;See this thread:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfacc-surfpower/surface-pro-4-dock-ethernet-connectivity-problems/cea55eb9-db31-464e-b737-1253fa7ff757">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfacc-surfpower/surface-pro-4-dock-ethernet-connectivity-problems/cea55eb9-db31-464e-b737-1253fa7ff757</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As best I can tell, your choices today are:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Power-cycle the Surface Dock (unplug AC power and re-plug) every time you use it, or at least once daily.&nbsp; This may help somewhat, although some Surface Dock lots will not even respond to this approach.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Wait for Microsoft to acknowledge the problem and issue software and/or firmware updates that stabilize the behavior of the Ethernet on the Surface Dock when paired with SP4s.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Vote with your feet and return your Surface Dock, get your money back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regrettably, after my 2nd Surface Dock with same problem over past 2 months and no acknowledgement or help from Microsoft, I finally was forced to opt for #3</p>

            Wow, I wish I had known that this was an issue before. &nbsp;I'm not even using my ethernet cable, but wifi instead. &nbsp;I don't really want to run a cable to where my desk is. &nbsp;What is the point of the dock if it disables my internet? &nbsp;I suppose I'll be contemplating
 returning it. &nbsp;Sometimes I just need extra screen real estate space when I'm doing certain kinds of projects while being connected to my external hard drives and other devices. &nbsp;It would be great to have a video on the big screen playing with One Note open
 on the Surface it self. &nbsp;If I can't get internet, what's the point? &nbsp;Maybe there is a third party product that can fill my needs.

            I have a surface pro 4.&nbsp; I purchased 2 docking stations, one for work and one for home.&nbsp; At work the docking station is perfect&nbsp;and uses an&nbsp;Ethernet cable.&nbsp; At home I only have WIFI, when I plug in the docking station the WIFI no longer works, it says
 it is (i.e. it is connected) but won't transmit data.&nbsp; As soon as I unplug the docking station, wifi works perfectly again.&nbsp; Some reason I think it is trying to use the Ethernet adapter on the docking station.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; I like the docking station
 as I can power 2 monitors and plug in several USB devices.

<p>
</p><p>Same problem of no internet on WIFI connection. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I disconnect the docking station cable. I do get my internet back on wifi, i.e. wifi connection is established between surface and router and internet is fine. But when I reconnect the dock, the issue is back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tired reporting it to Windows support guys on chat, they asked me to contact Surface support.</p>

            <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem and found the SOLUTION.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I plug in the Surface Dock I need to plug it in so that the wire is hanging on top (so plug the cable with the head of the cable facing down). This way the Wi-Fi works when connected to the new surface dock. If plugged differently it does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This solution works for me - please try and see if it solves the problem.</p>

            <p>I tried this, does not help. Only thing that works is to unplug the mini displayport cable. Microsoft sent me another dock, same issue. So maybe the SP4 has a defect? Maybe driver? Frustrating that Microsoft cannot fix this.</p>
<p>A tech from Microsoft has requested me for a troubleshooting session, with remote access. However I will need to take a day off from work to do this.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Some solution proposed are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&gt; Windows Update for All device.</p>
<p>Go to settings--&gt;Update and security--&gt;Windowsupdate--&gt;Advance options--&gt; select the check box "Give me updates for other Microsoft product when i update"</p>
<p>
</p><p>2&gt; Update WIFI driver</p>
<p>Do to device manage --&gt; Network adapter--&gt; right click "Marvell AVASTAR wireless-AC Network Controller" to Uninstall.</p>
<p><strong>*Do not tick the option "delete the driver software for this device "</strong></p>
<p>click OK and restart the device.</p>
<p>after doing above two options. it seems to work for me. but I am not 100% sure. I will test it for a week and let you know the problem is solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3&gt; Last option was enable Recovery in windows and reinstall windows.&nbsp;<br />
(this i have not tried)</strong></p>

    <title>Connectivity and crash issues with new Xbox One X - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> soulayxe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connectivity and crash issues with new Xbox One X</h2>
                    Hi everyone.<br />
<br />
I purchased a X a month ago.<br />
<br />
I first had a problem during the first startup and update process when my internet router just crashed (rarely happened before but anyway). It eventually went through and I was able to use the Xbox normally.<br />
<br />
It runs like a charm and I am in awe with Tomb Raider in 4K.<br />
<br />
Now to the issues I am facing:<br />
<br />
30% of the time, the X crashes on startup during the X animation loop (where the 4K chip is displayed). Bam, it just stops and either keeps being turned off or restarts... It then boots normally. I am using the power saving mode BTW. I got in touch with Xbox
 support. They made clear the cache and reset my mac address. Seemed to have fixed the issue then but it reappeared two days ago. This is quite frightening...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But the worst thing is that my X manages to connect to Xbox Live only 30% of the time on startup. I turn on the console and the "connect to Xbox Live" prompt on the homescreen appears. In the network settings, it says that "all services are available" but nothing
 happens. Sometimes it gives me error messages like toledo. I am wired and the issue happens on WiFi too (although less frequently on WiFi for some reasons). I have reserved an ip address for my X and forward the ports in the router settings with no impact.
 All my other devices (Samsung TV, denon amp, isp TV, phones, computers) either wired or wireless work like a charm... When the X eventually connects on its own (usually 3 to 5 minutes after booting up), it works normally and I have no issue with Xbox Live:
 90 mega bits dl, low ping.<br />
<br />
So here I am. RDR 2 is coming and I am annoyed as hell with these issues. I may do an advanced exchange if possible in France.<br />
<br />
Any idea or people facing the same issues? Thanks :)

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>since you mentioned that the console sometimes crashes on boot up I suggest trying to do a factory reset to see how it behaves afterwards.</p>
<p>The console can be reset with keeping games and apps installed, you will however need to Download your profile again, which does require knowing the account credentials.</p>
<p>See this link for more information and the steps on how to perform the Factory reset:

<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results</p>

<p>Hi wpak,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply. I did a factory reboot this morning. First boot following it and it crashed...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connectivity issues persist. The xbox support in France told me to switch to ipv6 but my router is not compatible. Anyway, I think it should work properly in ipv4...&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>I would assume that the console works fine with ipv4 too.</p>
<p>You might want to contact Support again since Ipv6 isn't an option and also explain the issue of the boot crash too since that might trigger them to suggest a replacement.</p>
<p>I'm not sure Advanced exchange is possible in France, but Xbox Support should be able to tell.</p>

<p>Interestingly enough, people facing the boot issue happen to have a Samsung smart TV. see here for instance:&nbsp;https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/7cft8v/xbox_onex_shutdown_during_new_boot_animation/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the xbox live issue:&nbsp;https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxone/comments/8lxclc</p>
<p>
</p><p>I forgot to mention my xbox one fat faces the same connectivity issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try an exchange but I am afraid my x may not be the culprit: maybe a software / incompatibility.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>32Bit or 64Bit issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daveemsley  say:</h3>
<h2>            32Bit or 64Bit issues</h2>
                    <p>I ran the upgrade assistant which told me I needed to 32bit version - which is what I purchased, downloaded and install (and I am now using)<br />
<br />
HOWEVER if I go to the Windows Experience Index I get:<br />
</p>
<table>

<p>Yes</p>

</td>

This seems to imply I bought the wrong version - ON THE DIRECT ADVICE OF THE MICROSOFT UPGRADE ASSISTANT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I change the version to 64 bit?</p>

            <p>The download on MS wesite will only down load whatever bit rate OS system that was previously installed on your PC.</p>
<p>What your WEI is telling you is that your system is capable of running a 64bit OS, but you have 32 bit installed. (same as previously installed)</p>
<p>Read thru the link below and it will advise what to do if you wish to install W8 64 bit OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><u>Can I upgrade from a 32 bit version Windows&nbsp; to Windows 8 64 bit version</u></em></p>
<p>Yes, but you can't do this using Upgrade Assistant. If your PC has a 64-bit capable processor (CPU) but is currently running a 32-bit version of
<span>Windows</span>, you can install a 64-bit version of <span>Windows&nbsp;8 Pro</span>, but you'll need to buy it as a DVD and perform a custom installation. If available in your country or region, you can buy
<span>Windows&nbsp;8 Pro</span> from a participating retail store. You can also buy it online from the
<span>Microsoft</span> Store in Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States.</p>
<p>Please note that the <span>Windows 8 Pro</span> Pack is used to upgrade from <span>
Windows 8</span> to <span>Windows 8 Pro</span>, and is not for cross-architecture installs and does not include any media. If you want to change architectures, purchase
<span>Windows 8 Pro</span>. </p>
<p>You won't be able to keep any files, settings, or apps when you upgrade from a 32-bit to a 64-bit version.</p>

            <p>The upgrade advisor will suggest 32-bit if that is the bit version of the incumbent operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, you must have been running a 32-bit operating system before, and it caused you no issues. Also, as you have only 3gb RAM, you don't really need to run a 64-bit operating system..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In fact, your machine will run better on the 32-bit OS because you only have 3gb RAM..

            <p>When performing the upgrade process the upgrade assistant determines your existing architecture, downloads the same architecture and installs.</p>
<p>To change from 32bit Windows to 64bit Windows a clean install will be performed (will have to reinstall applications etc…) and it will be necessary to purchase Windows 8 as a DVD.</p>
<p>Below is a web page that has additional information regarding Windows 8 </p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/upgrade-to-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>Upgrade to Windows 8</u></a></p>
<p>You can go to a computer running a 64 bit version (Vista or Windows 7) and do the download there and create a bootable copy.</p>
<p>32 vs 64 bit</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions</u></a>
</p>
<p>Windows 8 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 8 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 8 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 8.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 8 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers.</p>
<p>If you need to upgrade to the 64 bit version, you will need to do a custom over your 32 bit installed. You said you ordered the backup DVD with your order, so you will have the 64 bit disc.</p>
<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit. Lauch the Windows Easy Transfer utility in Windows 7 and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can
 have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 8 64 bit disk.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/</u></a></p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 8 64 bit disk. In Windows 8 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

            <p>I only have 3Gb RAM as that's what the machine was originally supplied with - along with Windows 7 32Bit version.&nbsp; I want to upgrade to the maximum as I want to do some serious graphics and video editing.</p>
<p>If machine is capable&nbsp;of running Windows 8 at 64 bit then I can upgrade the RAM and use it.&nbsp; AND I can use Adobe CS6 to the maximum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if I can summarise the Microsoft Upgrade Assistant told me what I **WAS*** running not what I could run.<br />
In order to run what I want to run I now have to buy the other version as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@Andrea "You said you ordered the backup DVD with your order, so you will have the 64 bit disc."&nbsp; No I didn't order the backup DVD.&nbsp; Can I now do this retrospectively?&nbsp; Will that give me the 64bit version?&nbsp;

            <p>If you want to go from 32-bit to 64-bit, here is how&nbsp;I did it (see below):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get a refund or credit for the 32-bit purchase (if you can).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Buy the Windows 8 upgrade DVDs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll get two DVDs- one 32-bit and one 64-bit.&nbsp; The computer has to start up from the 64-bit DVD&nbsp;to install Windows 8 64-bit.&nbsp; Put it in the tray and restart your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be a clean install- you'll lose all your user files and programs, so back them up first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upgrade assistant will only install the 32-bit version.&nbsp; If you try to run the 64-bit DVD while Windows is running you'll&nbsp;get an error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went straight from 32-bit Windows 7 to 64-bit Windows 8, so I didn't deal with the refund issue.&nbsp; I also&nbsp;think you may have to reinstall your older version of Windows if you get a refund or credit for your 32-bit version.&nbsp; Call Microsoft support to see
 what they say you should do about that situation.</p>

<h2>            Forza 4 Demo. Why bother&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I was looking forward to trying the new kinect features, (head tracking in particular) just to see if they were any good. Sadly these don't seem to be in the demo!</p>
<p>From the demo FMS4 looks a lot like FMS3 to be honest. The countdown to race start has slightly better graphics, then when the race starts the jaggies are back!</p>
<p>Guess I will have to play the full game to see any difference, so why bother with a demo?</p>
<p>Anyone else disappointed with the demo?</p>

<p>I think with most games coming out now that they aren't much better than their previous installments. And I doubt we will see much improvement until the next generation consoles are here. the 360 and ps3 have pretty much gone as far as they can now, so the
 new games are just tweaked a bit here and there, sometimes for the better sometimes for the worse.fortunately forza's tweaks are for the better.</p>

<p>I personally loved the demo, everything about it that I see was better than previous games, the handling/feel of the cars, the graphics,sound.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try the game with Kinect but to be honest I can't see myself using it with the full game that much but agree it would have been nice to see how it works in the demo but developers these days never seem to give away too much before the full release.</p>

<p>Not that it bothers me but I was a bit suprised they didn't put kinect into the demo too, being Microsoft's baby at the moment you would have thought they would have tried to push it even more, especially trying to drag in some casual people to the game.
 Makes me think it doesn't perform too well............<br />
<br />
Re the actual demo, I can't see any jaggies at all, tbh the graphics are not really what I was that interested in though so I haven't been scanning it that much to pick up on it.<br />
<br />
For me the demo shows a vast improvement in the car handling and also the AI seem a little more racey if not a little annoying on some apex's.</p>

<p>i thought the demo was quite good. It looks amazing the background is really sharp, the cars do feel a bit better and the sound, especially going through the tunnel, is great! Iam dissapointed a bit with the demo but im not exactly sure why! Maybe i was
 expecting a bit more from the demo. It wont stop me buying it tho, I have my copy pre-ordered!!</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />I recommend you check Windows to see if there are any errors
<br />
<br />If your computer begins to feel buggy and you notice problems during boot, you can use the System File Checker (SFC) command-line utility to check the integrity and replace any corrupted or missing protected system files with a known good version.
<br />
<br />When SFC is unable to fix the problem, chances are the utility was unable to get the necessary files from the Windows image, which might have become broken. In this situation, you can use DISM to repair the Windows image (.wim), which then it will allow you to use the System File Checker to fix any issue with your Windows 10 installation.
<br />

<h2>            A separate wallpaper for each virtual desktop in Windows 10</h2>
                    Is it possible that in future Windows updates, developers add such feature as the ability to install a separate wallpaper for each virtual desktop?<br />
I think this would be a useful property that helps to divide virtual desktops into categories and at the same time helps quickly navigate - which desktop I'm currently in.

<p>i have tried every solution, it works when i plug it directly into the router using a ethernet cable, but on wireless i get the same old dump MTU error and i cant play any online games. Please help, i have a linksys WRT160N router with the latest firmware.</p>
<p>things i have tried: changed MTU amounts to auto, 1500, 1364, 1400, and 1500 - no luck same error</p>
<p>open ports - nothing happens</p>
<p>i narrowed it down to my routers configuration/hardware or my Xbox 360 wireless "N" adaptor.</p>

<p>I have a couple questions/suggestions as the MTU in this case is not related to the actual MTU setting but fragmentation due to wireless interference.</p>
<p>First, do you have any other wireless devices you use with the Xbox 360? Things like the Turtle Beach X31 headset will cause MTU thanks to the transmitter being too close to the console. You can solve this by moving the transmitter away.</p>
<p>Also, are you on Wireless N for your network? If so, try switching to Wireless G. G runs in 2.4Ghz and is a lot more stable then N which runs in 5Ghz.
</p>
<p>The WRT160N should not inherently cause MTU nor should there be an issue with the signal coming from it, so it's most likely due to a bad setting. Since it's a Linksys it does have the option for WPS or WiFi Protected Setup. Make sure that WPS is DISABLED
 as it will cause problems. </p>
<p>To do this, log into the router and click on Wireless.</p>
<p>It should bring you to the default page which will offer Manual or WiFi Protected Setup and you want to make sure you have it all manually configured.</p>
<p>Go with Mixed mode, Channel 1 OR 11, SSID set to broadcast, and lastly keep the SSID the same (Network name).

<p>I just had the same problem with my Xbox 360 after updating last night. &nbsp;I couldn't connect to Netflix, ESPN, or even Xbox live. &nbsp;I am on a Belkin N router with the current firmware for the router as well. &nbsp;I had my 360 setup on a manual IP address due to
 having the NAT settings problem a while back. &nbsp;Belkin has what is called a DMZ (DE-Militarized Zone) which basically takes it out from behind the router's firewall. &nbsp;Before the update the manual IP address was in my DMZ. &nbsp;After the update I had the MTU problems.
 &nbsp;Well after troubleshooting everything else, I reset my 360's network configuration from the console back to factory defaults. &nbsp;That has my console back to using "Automatic" settings when connecting to my wireless router. Everything seems to be working fine
 now, hopefully it will stay that way. I would try that on your console and see if it helps. &nbsp;

<p>Well, it was good while it lasted...the entire hour and a half. &nbsp;After about 2 hours, I now keep getting kicked off live and them the "mtu error" every 10 minutes or so. Resetting my console's network settings doesn't help anymore. &nbsp;And anything and everything
 else that connects to my router works fine. &nbsp;In the only place in my router's settings that I can find to adjust my mtu settings, that amount is already over the 1364 that the console is telling me that I need. &nbsp;Nothing is working
</p>
<p>The thing that has me the most baffled is why would it work perfectly for a year and a half and then stop after the May 19, 2011 update? &nbsp;The only thing on my network that is any different from 2 days ago all the way back to me first getting Live is the
 update from the 19th. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            save data overwritten help&#58;&#40;</h2>
                    
<p>okay so my brother was playing his dying light and i walked past his kinect his xbox signed me in and signed him out while he was playing it then restarted the game on my save<br />
<br />
116 legend levels behind him and 48 hour+ behind&nbsp;<br />
<br />
when he signed back into his account my save had somehow overwritten his save so now we both have duplicate save games...<br />
<br />
when he re-synced his game save from cloud it still brought back my save to his account<br />
<br />
he recorded a clip about 20 minutes before this happened&nbsp;<br />
<br />
so basically the save on my account has overwritten the save on my brothers account&nbsp;<br />
<br />
can anyone from xbox support restore his save to where he was before this happened<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Hello</p>
<p>Unfortunately if your save has been overwritten there's nothing you can do to get it back. The save on the cloud automatically updates once the local save changes.</p>

            I actually had an issue with the driver for my video card. I had to find a new driver for the video card and then start the whole process over. Once I did it didn't take very long at all. Make sure all your drivers are updated for windows 10 before you
 start the process. I really like the new product.

            Hi Billy, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting.
<br /> 
<br />Are you running a computer setup by an IT/Computer Dept. such as at work? If so you definitely need to check with them.
<br />
<br />That error likely was generated by Aspera so if not the above check with their support. It could have been SQL Server or any other software which Aspera is monitoring.
<br />
<br />I think this is them.
<br /><a href="https://www.aspera.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.aspera.com/en/</a>
<br />
<br />Not a whole lot I can suggest since it is an asset issue and not a Windows error,
<br />
<br />Please let us know the results and if you need further assistance.       
        </p>

            Thank you for the advice. After troubleshooting with the SQL Server Managers, it seems we've narrowed it down to a group account configuration issue.&nbsp;
