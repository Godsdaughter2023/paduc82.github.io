<h2>            How to configure project so date fields don&#39;t display NA</h2>
                    
<p>Hi - I am using MS Project 2003 to manage a project schedule.&nbsp; I would like to take information from the project schedule and manually cut and paste it into a SharePoint list to create a reflective Gantt chart.&nbsp; However, some of the dates in project are
 blank and are displaying 'NA'.&nbsp; When I cur and paste the these dates into the sharepoint list I get an expected error that 'NA' is not in a date format so cant be pasted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I change the date field in MS Project not to show NA so when I cut and paste into the Sharepoint list there are no 'NA' values for what should be a blank field.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>As such, you can't, but there is a simple workaround. Customize a text field with the formula (for instance for the Actual Start field):</p>
<p>IIf([Actual Start]=projdatevalue("NA");"";[Actual Start])</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>

<h2>            call from Spain to US</h2>
                    How do I call from Spain to a phone in the USA using my android phone and the hotel WiFi in Spain. I understand the WiFi part. How do I set up to get the call paid for? It was very easy to get a subscription and pay to make phone calls to a USA while in
 the USA which usually isn't necessary if you have a phone and a phone carrier

</p><p>If you already have a Skype calling subscription that covers call to USA, all you need to do is dial the number. Make sure you have&nbsp;a strong Internet connection, if Skype detects a weak connection it will reduce the quality and drop the call altogether.
 Make sure as well that you are using the latest version of Skype.</p>

            <p>Hi dragonspectrum,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Let me see if I have this right. You are saying that previously on Hotmail, you were able to save your email messages to your PC, but now on the new Outlook.com, you are unable to. In this case, we would like to inform you
 that even in the old Hotmail.com, you will not be able to do the "save as file" to save the entire email to your PC. However, if what you are referring to is saving an attachment from an email message, then you may just click the
<font color="#0072c6"><strong>Download as zip</strong></font> link just below the attachment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, you may save the emails on Hotmail/Outlook.com to your PC by usung Windows Live Mail. To accomplish that, please refer to the link below then look under&nbsp;<span><font color="#1570a6">&nbsp;To import email messages into
 Windows Live Mail:</font></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
If you have some questions regarding to the web based Hotmail/Outlook.com, don't hesitate to post it here in Microsoft Community or you may try to search for an answer via the search function.

<h2>            Nokia C5 - 00   audio input&#47;output are very low even after turning on the speaker</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have Nokia C5-00 mobile bought 5 months back. My phone's audio input and audio output are really bad. I have the latest software update i.e. 062.001. And recently I have given for service&nbsp;in a Nokia service station. But&nbsp; the problem is still the same.
 So how could I improve the audio of my phone. Or else is it the problem with&nbsp; Nokia&nbsp; C5-00 .</p>

<p>I also had the same problem it's due to the new software update launched by nokia for c5.00 5mp. When you play music through media player it warns by saying the high volumes may lead to ear damage when this shows up dont press ok button press the midlle
 button in between navigation button the sound will start slowly and pick up to the highest pace available rest if fine<br />

            Hi there,<br />
<br />
I'm experience the same issue and am using the latest version of Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome and have cleared my cache. I'm able to sign in but not able to open my folders or read my emails. In addition, some of the functions within Outlook are not working
 like more mail settings, etc. It appears that when they upgrade my Hotmail to Outlook, they didn't do it properly. I'm unable to revert back to Hotmail as this was an automatic upgrade sometime between last Thursday 28/03/2013 and today Tuesday 02/04/2013.
 Is there anyway of rectifying this issue or do I need to close this account and open a new email account with another provider like Gmail or Yahoo ?<br />
<br />
I have tried calling Microsoft technical support numerous times but they are very unhelpful.<br />
<br />
Kind regards,<br />
<br />
Charles<br />

                    <p>my insider build suddenly (on 2 aug 2016) started giving me this activation error ;&nbsp;<br />
"we can't activate windows on this device because the previous version of windows was not activated prior to upgrading to windows 10".<br />
go to the store to buy genuine windows. error code 0x803f7001"<br />
&nbsp;however this machine was never upgraded and has been running windows 10 from the pre release days in (oct 2014).
</p>
<p>machine has had absolutely no activation issue and has been kept up to date (on the insider fast stream). is this some issue with 29 july 2016 ??</p>
<p>no hardware changes. only "change" was installing preview version 14343.</p>
<p>Is there an "explanation" for this "deactivation" ??</p>

amipathak</a>. If the phone has any kind of protective film or tape that covers the top of the screen that may cause the screen to remain black, try removing it. You may also try rebooting the phone by pressing and holding the volume down and the power keys
 at the same time for 10-15 seconds. We'll appreciate letting us know the outcome.</p>

            <p>Hi Katie425,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This could be caused by the cache of the OneDrive for business. I'd like to know which library you are syncing. If you only sync OneDrive library, I would suggest you use
 our OneDrive Next Generation Sync Client. You can get is via </span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/get-started-with-the-onedrive-for-business-next-generation-sync-client-in-windows-615391c4-2bd3-4aae-a42a-858262e42a49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>get
 started with the OneDrive for business next generation sync client in windows</span></a><span>.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you also sync SharePoint library or want to use legacy OneDrive for business (groove.exe), you can try the following steps to clear OneDrive cache to check the outcome:</p>
<p>1. Stop syncing all OneDrive for Business folders (right click OneDrive icon on task bar &gt; stop syncing a folder &gt; choose all the folders and stop sync)</p>
<p>2. Exit all Office applications including the OneDrive for business sync client.</p>
<p><span>3. Clear the OneDrive cache with fix it tool. Please refer to
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/kb/3038627" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to remove the OneDrive for Business cache by using the "Easy fix" tool</span></a><span>.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Caution</span>: This tool requires you to resync all data that you synced previously to OneDrive for Business which would takes a long
 time and lots of bandwidth. </p>
<p>4. Browse to the following folder and delete all the files in them:</p>
<p>"<span style="font-weight: bold">C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\Spw</span>"
</p>
<p>"<span style="font-weight: bold">C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\OfficeFileCache</span>"</p>
<p>5. Restart your computer and re-sync your library.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue remains, please let us know the following information for further troubleshooting:</p>
<p>1. The screenshot of the error message.</p>
<p>2. Your problematic OneDrive version (Task manager &gt; Details &gt; right click groove.exe/onedrive.exe &gt; properties &gt; screenshot of the
<p>3. Your computer system, Office 365 subscription and Office apps version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 - opening DOCX files </h2>
                    I downloaded the Compatibility Pack for Word, which enable me to open DOCX files. Then about 2 weeks ago, when I try to open DOCX messages I get the following message, "This is a pre-release version of the Compatibility Pack and can open pre-release Office
 1007 files only." Then asks me to whether I want to check for a newer version. I click "YES" and it sends me to a site that asks me to download "FileFormatConverters.exe&nbsp;

When I attempt to do so, I receive a message telling me it is already installed. I removed the former version and reinstalled this one, but I receive the same message to install a newer version. Any ideas?

            <p>Ok this issue is now resolved - turns out that the certificate generated when setting up ADFS for the "Token-decrypting" and Token-Signing" is set by default to -&nbsp;CertificateDuration: 36500, within the ADFS management console. So as a result the certificates
 it generated had an expiration date of 2116. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So we needed to set this back to only 3 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get-AdfsProperties</p>
<p>Set-AdfsProperties -CertificateDuration 1095</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once this was set i then logged back into the Office 365 using PS<br />
Enable-PSRemoting&nbsp;<br />
Connect-MsolService<br />
Update-MsolFederatedDomain -DomainName [domain name] -SupportMultipleDomain<br />
</p>
<p>Certificates now have an expiration date of 2019 and that should fix the issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am in the same predicament as others as when I downloaded the latest Skype I lost all my contacts. &nbsp; Although there are others on this site I am unable to open any of their messages. &nbsp; I note that in the top right hand corner of this page it says Last
 Update December 19, 2017. &nbsp; Applies to: Skype/Skype for Windows 10/ Getting Started/Contacts. &nbsp; Back in July I switched over to Windows 7 to Apple Mac and had no trouble transferring SKYPE over or updating it when required I also made sure that the new download
 was comparable with Apple Mac but for some reason this update removed all my contacts. &nbsp; I have gone back and tried to load an old SKYPE from my Backups but I still have the same problem. &nbsp; How do I get my contacts back and if this is not able to be done I
 cannot see the point of having SKYPE and will look for something else that does not have the same problems.</p>
<p>

<p>Here is what i ended up doing.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; I logged out of the new version</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; I have a Skype icon on my desktop so i clicked on that to get a clean load and noticed that the older version came up</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; So i went to the &lt;Start&gt; menu and decided to load it up that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; It turned out I had two Skype icons.&nbsp; So once I had a clean logout, I loaded the second icon and the new version loaded along with my contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very odd....</p>

<p>I had at one stage 5 Skype icons and all of them were the new version about 3 of these were from my back up files so I would have thought that these would come up with the old version but when I checked them even those had changed to the newer version. &nbsp;
 I removed all the new version icons for Skype and tried to load another back up version from July but once I got them onto the main programs they reverted to the new version. &nbsp; I am a loss what to do now I still have my back ups but cannot see the point in
 trying to move one of these into my main programs as they may act like the ones I have already tried. &nbsp; I have no idea what Skype has done but I hope someone tells them to fix it up. &nbsp; In relation to your contacts coming up this did not happen with mine so
 they are floating in the black space of the internet somewhere.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0f8f59b4-f977-4f80-a460-ec83bb00aa29" title="RobertDankanics">
<p>
</p><p>At Skype, we take security very seriously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was an issue with an older version of the Skype for Windows desktop installer specifically version 7.40 and lower.</p>
<p>The issue was in the program that installs the Skype software and not in the Skype software itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users that have already installed this version of Skype for Windows desktop are not affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have removed this older version of Skype for Windows desktop from our website
<a href="http://www.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.skype.com</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is highly recommended to install the New Skype for desktop while the option to download classic Skype is unavailable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since your concern is regarding those contacts that are missing, please logout from Skype and make sure to login using the correct account.
</p>
<p>If you are have a specific Skype Name/Username, please login using that instead of your email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have other concerns.</p>

<p>Fine what further information would you like Marites I have signed into this post via my Microsoft Account so you have that info. &nbsp; I thought I had informed you that I moved from Microsoft to Apple mid to late last year but Skype went across fine I still
 had SKYPE and my contacts it is only since Microsoft decided to do an update on SKYPE that my contacts have disappeared so the problem appears to be with the update and it appears that I am not the only one with this problem (no wonder I went to Apple) is
 there a fix for this or is it just since Microsoft took over SKYPE the boffinsons at Microsoft don't have a clue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Don't take some of my comments as insults but this has been going on for some time with no end in sight and before SKYPE was taken over by Microsoft I and no doubt the majority of people had no worries with the programme&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p>Regardless of the Skype version you are using, your Skype contacts should appear if you are signed in to the correct account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most likely reason is that a new Skype account was created via your Microsoft information after the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that this is what happened, all you need to do is to logout from the app then login using your Skype Name/username instead of your Microsoft email. Please take note that logging in to Skype using your Skype username and Email is different. These
 are 2 separate accounts. Regardless if they are linked, the information you'll see when you login using your specific Skype name and email will be different specially the contacts and messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unsure, please go to this link, enter your email, and check which Skype accounts are linked to it.</p>

<h2>            Emails bouncing back</h2>
                    Some emails that are being sent to me are being returned to the sender in Australia as &nbsp;undeliverable. Now this is to my hotmail address and I've had emails from them on the same email address for years. My partner is also having the same problems. Also
 sometimes emails are getting through. Unable to contact pt hit nail to find out why.

<p>these emails are coming to us from an au account. They are bouncing back to them saying email is undeliverable. Although saying that this is intermittent as we received a testing email from them this morning. That would have been early evening in Sydney.</p>

            <p>Hi Zigzag. The bounce back message will be in Australia. It's from an au email address as hotmail doesn't work over there. Or should I say theirs doesn't work. They say the message says that the email is undeliverable. Although saying that they sent us a
 testing email which came through this morning. They sent six yesterday which bounced back. It's so frustrating to not know if you are having emails or not.</p>

<p>5.1.0 - Unknown address error 550-"SC-004 (BAY004-MC2F22) Unfortunately, messages from 203.59.1.221 weren't sent. We recommend that you contact your Internet service provider. The problem is that too many unwanted messages have been sent from the following

            Apparently this is happening in Australia as well. Although Zigzag says he's having no problems with Australia. My sister in law lives in Sydney. Their internet provider says that Hotmail and Live addresses have a block on them. Sounds like time to change
 folks.

<h2>            Lumia 640 LTE Messenger App</h2>
                    Hello all. I have a 640 LTE on the UK EE Network. A couple of weeks ago the Gif insert button disappeared from the Messenger screen. I have tried uninstalling Messenger and re-installing but still no joy. This is driving me mad now so if anyone could point
 me in the direction of a fix it would be most appreciated. Thank you in advance of any suggestions.

<p>Hi Torbjörn,</p>
<p>Since Exchange Online, Skype for Business Online, SharePoint Online and Yammer services are not included in Office 365 ProPlus plan, if you switch from Office 365 Business Premium to Office 365 ProPlus, the data (such as email data) from these services won’t
 remain in place for the user.<br />
You can refer to the following article to back up data:<br />
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Back-up-data-before-switching-O365-for-business-plans-a1da52c9-2167-4973-9e6d-492314a79b87?ui=en-US&amp;amp;rs=en-US&amp;amp;ad=US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Back-up-data-before-switching-O365-for-business-plans-a1da52c9-2167-4973-9e6d-492314a79b87?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US</a></p>
<p>About OneDrive for Business, since both Office 365 Business Premium and Office 365 ProPlus plan have this service, the data will remain in place if you switch from Office 365 Business Premium to Office 365 ProPlus.</p>

    <title>Has anyone noticed that Outlook.com email is slow&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jan kovarik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Has anyone noticed that Outlook.com email is slow&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After a major update a month or so ago, my Outlook.com email has been really boggy. If I click on an email to move it to another folder, the screen just sits there, often for more than 15 seconds, before the email gets moved. If I click on "Show message"
 (to include the original message in my reply---which is something that I had been able to set as a preferred option, but now after the major update, that option no longer exists), the screen just sits there, often for 15 seconds or more before the message
 is included in my reply email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This same thing happens when I click on an email to delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue I'm having is that if I copy text from an email, it pastes into Word as "subscript" and often in a font color that I can barely see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these issues have cropped up since that major update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this same problem on different devices, all of which use a different browser (IE, Mozilla Firefox, Bing, Chrome).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else experiencing this?</p>

<p>Me, too.&nbsp; Outlook.com is painfully slow when sending, and slow in general after the updates a month or two ago.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have actually lost some emails on trying to send, because I didn't notice the progress bar saying "Sending...." in the upper right-hand part of the browser page and navigated away from the page.&nbsp; I never saw this progress bar before, so either it is new
 or sending was so fast previously that it never showed up long enough for me to notice it.&nbsp; After waiting a couple of days for replies, I went into my sent folder to re-send, and realized that my emails had never gone.</p>

<p>I agree. I dislike the notion of changing emails, and I'm not thrilled with gmail's online dashboard. For now, I'm going to limp along with Outlook.com...and hope that a future "major update" resolves the slow response issue.</p>

                    I would like to upgrade my home and student office 2010 to include Outlook 2010. I currently have a trial version that is soon to expire. Since I already paid for the home and student office 2010 as part of my computer purchase from Costco, I would like
 to upgrade to the next level of office that includes Outlook 2010 without paying the full retail price for Outlook 2010

            Sorry, price wise that is not possible, but on the positive side starting with Office 2010, MS is offering the "Anytime Upgrade" process. This allows you to "upgrade" from one Office bundle to another by paying approximately the difference in retail list
 prices. So at a guesstimate&nbsp; it'll cost approx US$130-140 to upgrade to Office Home and Business. Unfortunately that is about the same price you pay for the standalone copy.&nbsp; The thing is, you are MUCH better off buying Office in a bundle rather than standalone.
 It turns out that while standalone Outlook will work "beside" Home and Student, the copy of Word used by Outlook won't integrate with settings in the Office bundled Word.<br />
<br />
<span>I have Office Home and Student. I Need Outlook. Now What? – Anytime Upgrade</span>
<p><i>You will have to buy Office 2010 Home and Business to get Outlook.</i></p>
<p><span>If you start with Office Home and Student and realize that you need Outlook, you have 3 options:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Buy standalone Outlook to add to Home and student</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Buy Home and Business full bundle</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Use Office Anytime Upgrade offer</span></p>
<p><span>Pros and Cons:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The standalone Outlook does not integrate with Word in Home and Student, and it is the most expensive combination.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Buying Home and Business is better price wise, especially since you can resell the Home and Student to someone else.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Apparently MS provides a discounted price to using Anytime Upgrade to a full Home and Student bundle</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the new and improved solution (much better than our previous advice) to your problem, direct from MS Customer Service.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Anytime Upgrade offers you a discounted upgrade between Office 2010 bundles.

<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Made payment for Office Home &amp; Student &gt;&gt; Home &amp; Business upgrade ($120)</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>After payment, a box with an "Install" button came up. I wasn't given the opportunity to save the download. I was given a new Product key.</p>

</span></span></span>I clicked Install &amp; it installed (or upgraded?) to Office 2010 Home &amp; Business</p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>I ran Excel &amp; Word, and the "non-commercial use" was no longer there</p>
<p>
<span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>However, under my Control Panel / Uninstall Programs, there is only 1 office installation - Microsoft Office Home &amp; Student 2010; there isn't any Home &amp; Business.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span>My main intention in upgrading was to get rid of the "non-commercial use", so it turned out ok. But is there anything wrong that I did? Why does Control Panel show Home &amp; Student? &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;/snip&gt;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the “old” advice as an alternative.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Consider it based on the upgrade price they present you.</span></p>
<p><span>You have to buy a product key that is valid for Outlook.
</span></p>
<p><span>The simplest apparent solution is to buy Outlook standalone for roughly USD$140. However, I have been told that this may not be the best overall approach for a couple of reasons. The obvious reason is that
 you'll have to manage 2 separate Office installations: separate install files/CD's and separate product keys. The other reason I've been told about is that when you install a standalone Outlook it does NOT fully integrate with the existing H&amp;S. Apparently
 spell checking dictionaries are maintained separately and a few other things.</span></p>
<p><span>If you do the math, retail H&amp;S has list price USD$150. Standalone Outlook has list price USD$140. Home and Business is USD$280. So, if you have the option, buying H&amp;B makes best sense all around.</span></p>
<p><span>If you bought the Retail/"FPP" license for H&amp;S, you have the option of uninstalling it and reselling it to someone else. If you have an OEM or Product Key Card license transferring the license to someone else
 is NOT an option.</span></p>
<p><span>PS: prices assume Retail/"FPP" license (my only recommendation). The product key card name "equivalents" are slightly cheaper on the surface. But if you understand the implication of license terms, you instantly
 realize that for most people the PKC is effectively a s*c*a*m IMO (because most people are not aware of the downsides of the the PKC when they buy it)</span></p>

<h2>            How to &#39;Pin a Peek&#39; in Outlook 2016 on an iMac</h2>
                    <p>Hi, We have an Office 365 subscription and I have just started using Outlook 2016. I was previously using Entourage and found the 'My Day' feature essential when organising my day.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't seem to be able to pin the task list to my main mail screen. Colleagues on PCs simply hover, but as I am using a Mac I am not getting the same option to pin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be much appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note: I am using an iMac OS X but as there is not an appropriate drop down 'System and device' option I have had to select 'Office for Windows 10 Desktop' - apologies for any confusion!</p>

                    <p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">Hi,</span></p>
<p>

</p><div style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
<p>Hope someone can help. I use Microsoft Outlook for my email on my IPhone, IPad and the outlook website on my laptop. I've been having various problems which I'll set out below:</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">1. I've been getting lots of suspicious/spam emails. I'm not opening these emails and I am deleting them as soon as they enter my mailbox but they keep on coming! These are things
 like:</div>
<div style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">" Doorstep loans - Up to 1000 loans straight to your door"</div>
<div style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">" LifeInsuranceExpert - Life insurance from only £10 a month"</div>
<div style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">"Gemini2 - Hi ........,, Commissions waiting for you"</div>
<div style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">"Accident Compensation Advice - your recovery matters..."</div>
<div style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">"Life insurance+ - &nbsp;a message for ...."</div>

<div style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
<p>And the list goes on. These aren't just going into my junk - I've had a lot go into my normal inbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">2. Problems with outlook on my iPhone: like many iPhone users I use the mail service on my iPhone (and iPad) and link my outlook account. 2 problems keep on occurring:</div>
<div style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">A) "Cannot Get Mail- The connection to the server failed" - this happens even when my wifi signal at home is perfectly working and then it asks me to resign in to my account. This
 happens all the time and I have to re-enter my details so my phone can access my inbox.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">B) When i open my mail app instead of inbox the top bar reads "70FB9178-576E-4CAA-A0..."</div>
<div style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
<p>It then doesn't display any recent emails and just shows ones from months and months ago that are in my inbox.</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">
<p>I would really appreciate some help getting my account back to normal! I'm a bit unsure what to do and worried there might be some sort of virus or something (I don't have a clue how these things work)!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<div style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">Thanks very much</div>

<p />

                    <p>Towards the end of last year I found that Outlook.com had become Outlook Mail, since then most emails I send, which have never had a problem,&nbsp;are finding there way into the recipients&nbsp;spam folders.&nbsp; I have been with Outlook for many years and would like

            <p>Hi Katrina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, yes I have, some have gone into inboxes but others into spam, if I don't get a reply after a few days&nbsp;I send a Jacquie Lawson note asking them to check their spam folders, this works but it's a crazy way of emailing people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being that this only started last year when Outlook.com became Outlook Mail with quite a few changes in the format, could there be something in the system that makes my emails appear like spam? my emails are mostly domestic personal emails, I connect with
 online shopping without any problems and have no problems receiving.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it at all possible that there are some settings my end that could be the problem, settings I try a steer clear off for fear of ticking something I shouldn't!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know wear we go from here so if you could wave your magic wand it would make my day.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Katrina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using IMAP, I really don't know if my recipients have added my email address to their trusted email list but being that we have sent and received emails&nbsp;to and&nbsp;from each other for many years and I know I'm in their contacts lists, if that's the same
 thing, I'm assuming&nbsp;they have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a matter of interest I have found, Via the TalkTalk Help Line, and sending two emails using TalkTalks Webmail,&nbsp;that that recipients received them in their Inbox and not Spam!</p>
<p>
</p><p>TalkTalk seemed to think that my settings in Outlook might need adjusting but I'm not sure how to do that, what do you think about that as I would like to stay with Outlook?</p>
<p>

            <p>Since you are using an IMAP account, we suggest unlinking it from Outlook then relinking it. You can also ask your recipients to add your email to their trusted email list which is different from their contact list. They can find this in their settings.</p>
