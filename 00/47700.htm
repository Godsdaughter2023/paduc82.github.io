<h2>            Screen Saver is showing on my secondary monitor not my Primary monitor.</h2>
                    <p>I have two monitors, my primary is 1920X1080 and the secondary is 1280X720.&nbsp; When the photo slide show, or other screen savers that only run on a single monitor are running, they appear on the secondary monitor and not the primary monitor (part of the photo
 in the photo slide show will over lap onto the primary monitor).&nbsp; I would like to have the screen saver be shown on the primary monitor which is what I though that windows did by default, but I cannot find any settings to change this.&nbsp; I am running Windows
 7 Home Premium X64, and it did this with both my ATI Radeon 3870 and 5870.&nbsp; Here are some screen shots so that you can see what I mean.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is always recommended to run a single antivirus/security application in a computer. Running more than one antivirus application mostly results in software conflicts and can sometimes even damage the computer. Because of these software conflicts most of
 the third party antivirus applications that you install might disable the built in Windows defender to avoid conflicts.
</p>
<p>I would recommend uninstalling the free PANDA antivirus version and then check if you are able to enable the Windows defender. You can refer to these steps to uninstall the any other third party security application that you might have installed:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, select ‘<strong><em>Programs and Features’</em></strong>.</li><li>Locate the third party security applications, right click on them and select ‘<strong><em>Uninstall’</em></strong>.</li><li>Restart the computer for the changes to take effect.</li></ol>
<p>Now, try accessing Windows defender. If you are still unable to launch the Windows defender, then I would suggest you to check if the Windows defender service is running. Refer to these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong><em>Windows key + R</em></strong> to open the run command window.</li><li>Type ‘<strong><em>services.msc’</em></strong> and press enter.</li><li>In the services window, locate the services ‘<strong><em>Windows defender service’</em></strong> and ‘<strong><em>Windows defender network Inspection service’</em></strong>.</li><li>If the service status is not displayed as ‘<strong><em>Running’</em></strong>, then I would suggest you to right click on each service and select ‘<strong><em>Start’</em></strong>.</li><li>Now check if you able to launch Windows defender.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps. Keep us updated for further assistance. </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail Error Code 0x80072746</h2>
                    In Windows 10 Mail, I have multiple email addresses set up on it. The only problem is, is that one of my Yahoo! Mail email addresses are not working. Whenever I try to sync it, it comes up with error code 0x80072746. It has successfully synced in the past,
 but it doesn't work anymore. I tried looking at multiple help forums on this, and multiple websites, but they don't work for me. Can you help? Thanks.

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you done any updates to your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>If Yahoo mail is the only one having an issue, have you tried un-syncing the account before re-syncing it?

<p>If you haven't done the latter, we suggest that you do that and check how it goes,</p>

            If it was a one-off BSOD, do not bother much. Nevertheless,
<br />
<br />We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to crash.
<br />Please share them with us for a better analysis of the problem. Instructions can be found here:

            Hi Raquel, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            When I connect to a TV via HDMI, the proportions are off. I've tried adjusting them using the remote and even adjusting the Window 8 PC's screen resolution. And in the best cases, I loose the 90% of the edges and can't access the start menu. Very frustrating.
 This never happened with my Window 7 PC. <br />

    <title>Windows 7 Home Premium for commercial purposes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theprinceofrock  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Home Premium for commercial purposes</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently purchased an IdeaCentre K300 that came with Windows 7 Home Premium already installed. I have also purchased a copy of Adobe Photoshop CS5.</p>
<p>I am a freelance illustrator. I will be painting and rendering images in Photoshop CS5, which can be used for commercial use. I want to know if the copy of Windows 7 Home Premium that came with the computer can be used for the commercial work I have described.</p>
<p>From reading the Microsoft EULA&nbsp;I don’t believe it addresses this specific issue.</p>
<p>It’s my understanding that the different versions of Windows 7 do no indicate where it can be used (home, office, etc.), and just serve as title-inferences to what software comes with the operating system.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, then I suppose a more concise version of the question would be can I use Windows 7 for the commercial purpose of doing freelance illustration without doing anything other than installing Photoshop CS5 on the K300 I just bought? If this
 is the case, can someone post the official source documentation as to where they have found the answer?</p>
<p>Sorry for the lengthy question and thanks to all for any help you can provide!</p>

You can use any version of Windows 7 for commercial purposes - many business use Windows in their business. You can read every version of the EULA's (HP, Pro, Ult.) from the link below if you want. I don't believe it has any limit related to your question,
 and if it doesn't say you're prohibited from doing it then you can do it.

<h2>            How do you disable voice chat in XBOX live games&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm currently playing Battlefield 1943 and I'm trying to figure out how to stop getting spam voice messages over my XBox Live connection</p>
<p>I have no interest in them anyway, since it is just some 10 yr old farting and burping into his microphone and they are wrecking my bandwidth,</p>
<p>so I'd like to set the game server to not even send the packets to me, not just turn the volume down</p>
<p>is there a way to do that? a setting to select that completely blocks the voice process?</p>
<p>it's very annoying to have to listen to while trying to immerse yourself in an FPS</p>
<p>you'd think there would be some kind of lobby where people who WANT to communicate with each other can select that function and leave the rest</p>
<p>of us the heck alone....grrr</p>

<div>Millions of "Solutions" out there?!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hi! I have posted this on several forums in the hope that someone might have a working solution to this problem? I have given a fairly detailed description of things I have tried, but have not found a solution to the issue with.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is not a new problem! If you search on MS forums/Website (and many others), etc., you find this has been going on for years and the worst part about the problem is so many people have the problem and no solution! The online help techies seem polite
 but definitely puzzled that Win 7 and 8 computers should be doing this?! They give a typical response (This is, by no means, and exhaustive list of every suggested solution):</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. System Reset: Resets the computer by switching off, removing battery, hold down power button for 10 seconds. Re-install battery, switch on and you should be ready to go...?!?!?! This is actually a good solution to some quirky problems, but does not
 resolve this particular issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. Drivers: A second suggestion that techies and others suggest is that the problem is due to drivers?! Corrupted drivers, outdated drivers - like update your drivers using Win Update?! I (and a good number of others) have tried this "solution" by updating
 drivers, uninstalling and re-installing drivers in a number of different ways, deleting drivers and installing older drivers such as using a Vista driver on compatibility mode for video which actually worked resolving this problem on my own computer (see procedure
 below). BUT, this still has not provided a working solution for the Touch pad pointer freezing problem after many frustrated attempts with this or that solution - like I said, millions of them out there!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For such a fix to work, it would be necessary to uninstall the Windows OS default mouse driver in case it is corrupted, but that only seems to be possible re-installing the OS which I did and the problem remains. Besides which, finding an HID compliant
 mouse driver out there without it turning out to be a virus is, at the very least, difficult.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I found someone else on the internet that mentioned finding "extra" drivers in places they shouldn't be in Device Manager? However, my drivers seem to be all there with no extras.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There seems to be a common link between this problem and people whose touch pad uses Synaptic's touch pad driver. However, although the Synaptic's driver can complicate the problem even more it certainly is not the problem because the touch pad pointer
 freezes even when this driver is uninstalled, deleted, etc. It even freezes on a "clean installation" of Win OS without installing anything except the OS, as we shall see later.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3. Function key: Another typical "solution" from many is Fn key + ??? Some say Fn+F1, others Fn+f5, others Fn+F7, etc. (depending on system and computer) This is supposed to be a shortcut for switching on and off the Touch pad. I tried every Fn+F? button
 combination and none of them switched both on and off my touch pad. However, my Touch pad pointer did freeze when I tried Fn+F7-F10. Click as I might, none of these buttons could unfreeze it, but a 10 second wait did and also sometimes Alt-Tab (which some
 suggest, but is not a solution, although it is a very common factor), hitting B repeatedly and some other keys. I did find a key that works 100% of the time to cause my mouse to freeze: Try the letter "O" to see if it works on your computer. However, the letter
 "O" only causes it to freeze and does not unfreeze the Touch pad pointer no matter how much you hit the button?!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>4. Touch pad Config: Another suggestion was from some guy who did a video on You Tube: (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV0EgrMxbOU) This guy's idea was to switch off the Synaptic's Touch pad config for accidental palm touching. I don't have the same version
 of Synaptic's driver that he has although mine is up-to-date! I disabled TouchCheck on touch pad settings which did seem to help some for a short period, i.e. reduced frequency of freezes, but my touch pad still freezes!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>5. USB: Someone else suggests switching off the option "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" on the USB Root Hubs located on Device Manager. Go to Device Manager, scroll down the list of Devices to Universal Serial Bus Controllers,
 open it and locate the USB Root Hub entries, right-click each one in turn (around 6-8 of them) and select the Properties option, then select the Power Management Tab, then uncheck the check-box for the allowing your computer to turn off this device to save
 power option. This really has nothing to do with the touch pad as it controls externally connected USB devices. Needless to say, the "solution" doesn't work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>6. Boot: I have also tried doing a "clean boot" as suggested by an online techie, but this did not resolve anything. I also tried starting up in Diagnostic mode, nothing! I tried starting up in Safe Mode but was able to cause the touch pad pointer to freeze
 in Safe Mode hitting the "O" key?!?!?!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>7. Operating System: There are many other "solutions" out there and I have tried many of them without any success including Linux live USB, etc. The next thing I'm going to try is to install Win 7 on another partition and see if the problem occurs without
 installing any further drivers or programs, i.e. just using the basic default Windows OS drivers installed with the OS plus nothing and see if the problem still exists?! Nope, this one doesn't work either?!?!?!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Would you believe that I even had the touch pad pointer freeze during the Setup/installation process of Win 7. Not only that but I could even make the touch pad pointer freeze by hitting the "O" key which is 100% successful in causing a freeze both with
 Win 7 up and running or during Setup/installation?!?!?! Just in case some techie thinks my touch pad or keyboard may be the problem, why are so many people on so many different brands of computer, both old and new systems, having the same problem and why do
 they all report touch pad/mouse freezing related to keyboard use?!?!?! What's next?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After formatting the partition, I installed Windows Vista, the original system OS. But, with just the "bare bones" Vista installation, i.e. no drivers, software, etc., the freezing problem remains!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Back to drivers syndrome: My last resort is to flash the BIOS with an updated version (my BIOS already is the latest-A15) just in case this might prove to be a "BIOS virus"?!?!?! Maybe doing a system reset first, removing the battery, etc. Done and no
 solution! Using the keyboard in Notepad (very light on resources) with or without touching the "O" key causes freezing! Memory is obviously not the problem nor heavy system load as freezing occurs at 27%!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My next "last resort" was to try other operating systems and Ubuntu seemed a good option as it can be installed on a thumb drive/flash drive and run in a similar way to a live Cd, i.e. without installation. This cuts out a number of possible sources for
 the freezing problem, i.e. it's probably not located on the HD or any system partition unless communication between memory and HD managed to infect some part of the HD? Running directly off the thumb/flash drive means that all that's probably being used is
 BIOS and memory(???). Things looked promising until I was able to cause freezing again inside Ubuntu using the, by now, famous "O" key on the keyboard?!?!?! Unless there is a virus hiding (i.e. resident) somewhere in hardware such as keyboard or touch pad
 related, I really don't know what else to try? But this does seem to eliminate a lot of possible causes like HD resident virus, etc. So, even formatting the HD, shredding, etc., will not resolve the problem. I can live with the problem, but it would be nice
 to get it fixed!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried PC-BSD which can also be burned to a thumb/flash drive and is supposed to be very stable and not require so much attention as regards viruses? However, unlike Ubuntu, this one needs to be installed. I ran the OS from the thumb/flash drive, but
 have not as yet managed to get to a point, during the boot, where I can install it. I think I've given up on that one. I did, however, try Linux Mint 16 on thumb/flash drive and although the OS is attractive and seems fairly stable, the freezing problem could
 be recreated using, guess what, the "O" button!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also did the test installing my son's Win 8 (and subsequently uninstalled) just to see if there would be any joy on that system, but all to no gain!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(See also Hardware section below).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>8. Freeze Factors: So far, buttons or combinations that definitely cause freezing are "O" and Fn+F7-F10. The buttons which "seem" to help to unfreeze are B repeatedly, Alt-Tab sometimes, left touch pad button repeatedly OR just wait (the buttons do not
 always unfreeze)! Someone suggested Log off and log on again. I tried this and the touch pad pointer froze on the log off screen (ironic :-) - count to 10! However, even without touching the keyboard the touch pad pointer freezes randomly just using the touch
 pad itself, i.e. navigating on internet. Browsers are also not the problem because, obviously, the many thousands who face this problem use a great variety of browsers and I have used several myself!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>9. Touch pad/Keyboard link: After so many years of obvious problems linking drivers, touch pad and keyboard, it seems strange that online techies seem bewildered! The touch pad/keyboard link is very definitely a MAJOR factor (indicating the cause and not
 the problem itself) as almost everyone (forums included) who has the problem finds some link between using the keyboard and touch pad pointer freezing!!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>10. Obsolete system syndrome: I was beginning to think that installing Win 7 on a Dell xps M1330, upgraded to 4Gb RAM, 1.5 Ghz, which originally came with that problem (sorry program ;-) called Vista, might be causing the problem (tech-noia?). But, then
 I found people with new PC's that are having the same problem with both Win 7 and 8 OS systems!!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>11. Flickering/flashing screen: I was also having the flickering/flashing screen problem which one online techie said was a screen refresh rate problem. Change the refresh rate and "you're ready to go, right?!" Wrong!? You navigate to do so and find that
 the refresh rate is a fixed value of 60mhz?!?!?! Funnily enough, I tried something different which has definitely fixed this problem. I force-installed my older Vista video driver using compatibility mode on Win 7 (right-click driver and select troubleshoot
 compatibility and &nbsp;follow onscreen instructions, i.e. Start Program Using recommended settings).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only negative is that you then can't update that driver because after the newer driver installs the problem returns! So you need to remember that when doing automatic driver updates. I really wonder if this isn't a case of a newer driver that "overclocks"
 hardware and causes problems, but this shouldn't be the case for those who have brand new systems? I just wish I could find a solution like this one for this freezing cold Touch pad pointer problem!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Another similar problem is the "audio bug" which raises or lowers, maintains volume on full or switches off or even gets you chasing the volume control up and down the scale - must be very amusing for whoever created it. Solution - download a clean copy
 of driver (or use driver disk supplied with system), uninstall driver in Device Manager and manually re-install the clean version, i.e. Click Update on driver properties, then instead of automatically updating the driver use the option to manually search for
 a driver and install your clean version. This has resolved the same problem a couple of times for me. I recently found out that the O and L keys seem to be responsible for causing the audio to gradually lower or switch off. However, I have had a bug in the
 past that used to do it automatically!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>12. No solution syndrome: Going back to the REAL PROBLEM, this problem with the touch pad pointer freezing issue is not new (at least since 2009)!!! It would really be great if somebody could DO SOMETHING like come up with this SOLUTION (I prefer the term
 FIX) because it really is not limited to just a few isolated cases! These are OLD bugs and yet are affecting even the latest innovation, YES Windows 8 users are also looking for a solution to the same touch pad freezing issue even on systems only a few weeks
 old!!!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>13. Windows Fix: Tweaking.com has a nice little program with all kinds of automatic fixes to restore Windows OS to original factory condition without re-installing (at least the author is working towards that dream). It has a helpful tabbed interface taking
 you through pre-fix procedures. I used both Malwarebytes and SuperAntispyware (updated) to scan in safe mode, no malware, viruses, nothing! I went through the whole thing finally using the fixes which are done automatically after you create a restore point
 and backup Win registry, nice! The program really does restore Windows files to original state! BUT, the problem is more stubborn than than the solutions I have found so far! Oh well! Take a breather after that!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>14. Hardware (conflicts, resident virus, etc.): One last thing I forgot. Most people seem to find that using an external mouse resolves the problem. And, it does resolve the problem whilst using the external mouse (you may want to activate/check the option
 for the touch pad to be switched off when external mouse is detected which helps when typing. This is available in Symantec config), BUT, it doesn't fix the issue! SO, until someone comes up with the real culprit and a real fix...waiting...please don't switch
 off...zzzz!!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Under this section heading, I decided to try at least one hardware possibility (i.e. resident virus). I remembered that I still had the original memory cards after upgrading to 4GB. So, I switched off, did a system reset, switched the memory cards and
 booted off the Linux Mint thumb/flash drive...WAITING...Sorry, this one didn't work either! Outside switching the HD, the mother board, etc. (rather ironic) I really can't think of much else to try?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For resident viruses, as already mentioned, I have scanned with a number of different antivirus/anti-malware programs and have come up with zero infections?!?!?! Doing this in safe mode has not detected anything either.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If those online techies are bewildered (imagine us!!!) that &nbsp;this is happening or can even be happening with the latest and greatest, it would be very informative to try searching solutions for touch pad freezing and they will also see that there are thousands
 of people out there asking the same question, how to fix Windows 7 and 8 touch pad freezing!!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is not an "outdated hardware problem" because people with BRAND NEW COMPUTERS running Win 8 are having the same problem! The particular brand of computer is not to blame either because the same problem happens on DELL, Toshiba, etc. It is not a driver
 problem (unless there is some conflict between MS default drivers installed with OS) because no matter what you do with the drivers or hardware (I admit I haven't yet substituted all hardware to check where the problem resides) the problem stubbornly remains.
 It is neither the computer nor the user that is the problem! The problem may be some hardware resident virus or some other bug??? Solutions anybody???</div>

            Hi GSchmidty,
<div><br />
<div>I just updated the post with a few corrections, deletions, etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Although I had a brand new computer delivered in 2007 (present computer) with a&nbsp;touch pad&nbsp;that didn't even work and Dell authorized a&nbsp;technician&nbsp;to replace it (he said it had not been connected correctly), I find it difficult to imagine that this problem
 is caused by hardware faults/failures. As I said in the post, there are so many people with the same kind of problem that have both old and brand new systems! That is, if it were a hardware related problem then there shouldn't be so many people with the same
 or similar symptoms happening on both old, new, and even different brands of computer. If the computers were all Dell, then there would probably be reason to recall or fix the hardware problem?!</div>
<div><br />
<div>The driver issue seems more probable, but then again, in the post I described having installed just the "bare bones" Vista OS (I also tried Win 7 and 8), i.e. with no other installations of third party drivers, software, etc., and I still was having the
 same problem?! Even during OS installation I was able to recreate the problem?! This also eliminates the Synaptics software conflict possibility because in this test, this software was not even installed yet?!</div>
<div><br />
<div>The OS problem doesn't seem very likely either because I have had a Win 7 and previously a Vista instalation on this same computer without the problem. In fact, I even had a Win 7 dual boot set up with the primary installation presenting the problem and
 the secondary (also Win 7) having no problems. I uninstalled the secondary installation to install Vista under dual boot and it presented problems. Then, I uninstalled that, formatted the drive partition and re-installed Win 7 which also presented the same
 problem?!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am presently using a USB mouse which resolves the problem as long as you use it and not the touch pad. As mentioned previously, I configured Synaptics to switch the&nbsp;touch pad&nbsp;off when external mouse is detected. This seems to indicate that there is definitely
 something related to the touch pad that is causing the issue. Whether it is a software or driver conflict or a virus related issue has yet to be discovered!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards,</div>
<div><br />

            <p>John,</p>
<p>I returned the DELL laptops to Amazon and purchased an ASUS X102BA. The touchpad works perfectly on the ASUS.
</p>
<p>So I think that this&nbsp;was a DELL hardware and driver issue. I posted this issue on DELLs website
</p>
<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/t/19540430.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/t/19540430.aspx</a></p>
<p>And it appears I am not the only one having this issue with this model. Looks like DELL needs to do some more testing on this to get it right.

            Hi&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/8e16aa32-4a71-4ca7-81df-9945fc40309f">GSchmidty</a>,
<div><br />
<div>Seems like you resolved your problem! However, I think there are many Dell computers out there that don't have this problem. I personally have had this computer for about 6 years and most of that time without the touch pad problem. The fact that it just
 began recently made me think it was a virus. However, I just remembered today a simple test that I had not tried yet. You may be interested to see the results below:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>1. Touch pad and built-in keyboard: Check the touch pad to see if this freezes it? YES, using the keyboard freezes the touch pad pointer!</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Touch pad and USB keyboard: Check to see if the same problem with touch pad freezing exists when using an external USB keyboard? No, the touch pad pointer does not freeze even when using the "O" key. Does it freeze with the USB keyboard plugged in and
 using the built-in keyboard? Yes, using the "O" key.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. USB mouse: With the Synaptics config to disable touch pad when external mouse is detected, the touch pad is disabled, but the external USB mouse is not affected by any amount of keyboarding - i.e. the external mouse does not freeze. Test with touch
 pad activated at the same time as external mouse (Synaptics config): Using the external mouse has no influence on the touch pad - i.e. touch pad does not freeze. However, using built-in keyboard with USB mouse connected causes touch pad pointer to freeze which
 indicates that the something between the built-in keyboard and touch pad is causing the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. USB mouse and keyboard: Test to check for freezing using external mouse and keyboard? No freezing! Test built-in keyboard and touch pad with external USB mouse and keyboard connected? The letter "O" test freezes the touch pad when pressing the key repeatedly,
 but not when the key is held down for a few moments and released?! Test built-in keyboard to check other keys which cause freezing:</div>
<div><br />
<div>- yjbm all cause freezing when pressed repeatedly but not when held down.</div>
<div><br />
<div>- uikl all cause freezing both pressing repeatedly and holding the key down</div>
<div><br />
<div>- n causes freezing sometimes when pressing repeatedly but not when holding down</div>
<div><br />
<div>- qwertopasdfghzxcv cause no effect whatsoever.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The probable conclusion of this test is that the keyboard is starting to have problems and is causing the touch pad freezing problem. Why there would be any connection whatsoever between the keyboard and touch pad pointer freezing remains a mystery.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>But, when the external USB keyboard is used, the touch pad pointer functions normally! Using the external USB mouse also presents no problems. Using the external USB (or PS/2) keyboard with no problems indicates that the built-in keyboard is faulty especially
 because there are several keys which cause the problem. This test indicates the same result as changing the built-in keyboard, i.e. substitution. Using the external USB mouse indicates the same in relation to the built-in touch pad.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>But, while using the external USB keyboard the touch pad presented no problems. Therefore, it is safe to conclude that the problem is not software related (i.e. drivers, etc.) a nor is it a problem related to hardware such as the motherboard or any keyboard/touch
 pad related hardware, because when the external keyboard or mouse are used the touch pad presents no problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, the use of an external keyboard uses the same hardware as the built-in keyboard, but did not present any problem. It would probably be safe to say that substituting the built-in keyboard would resolve its problem and probably the touch pad freezing
 problem as well!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards,</div>
<div><br />

            <p>I've had two laptops with this symptom. An old Acer Aspire and my current Dell Vostro 1700.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the Acer, all I had to do was change my a/c adapter. I had been using a third party replacement adapter and I don't think it was fully compatible with the motherboards circuitry. Once I changed the adapter I never experienced the freeze ever again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With my Dell, I'm starting to pull my hair out. I'm convinced it is the power adapter again. Well, the laptop came with a Dell Studio charger, rated to 130 watts. Upon startup, the bios reported that the adapter could not be identified, so the computer would
 be placed into a power conserving reduced performance mode. Basically the machine was throttled down and was very slow to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I plugged in a 90 watt Dell adapter, borrowed from my Inspiron 8600, everything ran faster. the bios didn't give me a warning message and the laptop seemed fine. Then I noticed the touchpad freezing issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I looked on Dell website for recommended chargers for my model and ordered one to suit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The touchpad is still acting badly. so I don't think the charger I've just bought is still suitable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I cannot keep buying chargers until one matches my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is so frustrating. </p>

<p>
<span>This can help with some (but not all) programs/drivers:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next window click "Start the Program" to install it.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in Windows 7.

<h2>            DPC Watchdog Violation because of videos&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the last few days, I've been getting the DPC watchdog violation, where my screen will freeze, then after awhile it will reboot my system. The only two times I've gotten this error was from editing video projects in Windows media maker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running windows 8.1 with an Intel i-7-2600k @ 3.40 ghz, 16 GB of RAM, and a GeForce GTX 470 graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read a few other threads, so I tried a few things such as:</p>
<p>-Running windows defender offline as a cd ... no threats were found.</p>
<p>-Ran malware bytes and no problems as well.</p>
<p>-Some kind of file scan command (forgot the exact kind) .. said no files needed to be repaired</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uploaded my two files from the mini dump in hopes of getting some help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=2863BCC8B5392D75%211770</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

 for the drive. When the drive is not receiving enough power from the adapter, it may be trying to draw power from the USB. when the drive draws too much error, windows disconnects it and gives you the error code. try finding another 12v adapter that fits.<br />

<h3> megamike2021  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows live mail error 0x800CCC78</h2>
                    Attempts to send e-mail result in the above error message.&nbsp; I have reviewed the suggested solutions from all the various forums and have applied the following suggestions:<br />
Changed port to 587;<br />
Checked my server requires authorization;<br />
The problem is not with the e-mail server of my ISP because it's possible to send messages from my second computer with the same settings;<br />
installed Microsoft Outlook 2003 which results in the same error message:<br />
<br />
The message could not be sent because the server rejected the sender's email address. The sender's email address was *** Email address is removed for privacy ***'.<br />
<br />
Server Error: 530<br />
Server Response: 530 5.7.0 Must issue a STARTTLS command first<br />
Server: 'out.alice.nl'<br />
Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800CCC78<br />
Protocol: SMTP<br />
Port: 587<br />
Secure(SSL): No<br />
<br />
I am now beginning to think that the problem lies with my computer itself.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions??

            <p>This error message indicates two different errors:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are not authenticating yourself to the SMTP server. Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select
<em>Properties</em>. On the <em>Servers </em>tab, ensure that <em>My server requires authentication
</em>is selected. If it wasn't, please try sending a different test message (with a different subject) now, and then post any resulting error message here.</li><li>Your server is expecting credentials via a secure connection. On the <em>Advanced
</em>tab of the account's properties sheet, select <em>This server requires a secure connection (SSL)</em>. Close down WLMail and wait a few minutes before relaunching and sending a different test message (with a different subject). Then post any resulting
 error message here.</li></ul>
<p>You have changed the outgoing (SMTP) port to 587. I can't make a connection to that server on that port, so I wonder why you have done this. If you can't make a connection using the standard port 25, you should ask your provider whether others are available.
 Port 465 appears to be open, so long as you apply SSL.</p>
<p>Which anti-virus program are you using? If it's configured to scan mail, tell it not to. Mail scanning is unnecessary and can cause problems.</p>

Running into the exact same issue. Can you clarify a bit more on what was actually needed to resolve the problem? Did you reinstall the graphic driver via DISM? Was it because of a corrupted source initially? I'm surprised a lot more people haven't come across
 this issue already.<br />

            <p>Nothing has worked for me.&nbsp; DISM Version 10.0.10240.16384 goes to 100% completion and gives me the message Error: 0x800f08if (The source files could not be found.)&nbsp; I have a Win 10&nbsp;install iso and repair disk but there is no way to make them into a *.dim

<p>

            <p>The correct fix will be to remove wrongly installed and activated by Microsoft wow64_microsoft-windows-r..xwddmdriver-wow64-c_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.10586.0_none_3dae054b56911c22 directory (Microsoft RemoteFX Display driver, 32bit part, which contains opencl.dll
 with reduced functionality, which overwrites correct Nvidia/ATI/Intel \SysWoW64\opencl.dll on upgrade or attempt of DISM recover from install.wim) from WinSxS (64bit counterpart is in amd64_rdvgwddmdx11.inf_31bf3856ad364e35_10.0.10586 .0_none_5fcf2a87752df0d7
 directory, but is inactive and does no harm). But I know no tool for correct selective remove or deactivate of specific directory from WinSxS. Since&nbsp;\SysWoW64\opencl.dll is hardlink to WinSxS one, attempt to install Nvidia/ATI/Intel driver corrupts two Microsoft
 opencl.dlls at once (so sfc /scannow fails to recover), and attempt to recover WinSxS one from install.wim damages Nvidia/ATI/Intel display driver's opencl.dll from other hand.

    <title>Change InstallShield Update Manager&#39;s schedule to check for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rt_hawk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change InstallShield Update Manager&#39;s schedule to check for updates</h2>
                    From what I understand, InstallShield Update Manager checks for software updates in a similar way that the MS Updates program works. I am not really sure what it checks for.<br />
<br />
I have two questions:<br />
<br />
1. What programs on my computer does InstallShield Update Manager check for?<br />
<br />
2. My InstallShield Update Manager checks for updates on Thursday evenings. It is set to check for updates weekly. How can I change the time of day it checks for updates? The Update Settings window does not give any options for this. It only allows options
 to check Monthly, Weekly or Daily.<br />
I use public WiFi for my Internet connections on my laptop during the day. I am not connected to the Internet in the evening. I am worried that something is not being updated on my computer. My laptop does seem to be running just fine. I do the regular MS updates.<br />
<br />

<p>InstallShield is not a Microsoft product. I would suggest that you contact the PC OEM support site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another option would be to uninstall InstallShield.</p>

    <title>IEEE 1394 performance issue Windows XP SP3 Adobe Premiere 6.0 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnwilliamszz  say:</h3>
<h2>            IEEE 1394 performance issue Windows XP SP3 Adobe Premiere 6.0</h2>
                    I'm trying to capture video using Adobe Premiere 6.0.&nbsp; When I had Win2K installed it worked fine.&nbsp; I upgraded to Windows XP SP3 and Premiere stopped working correctly.&nbsp; Did a clean install of Matrox RT2500 - this is the capture/video card I purchased with
 the Adobe Premiere kit - according to instructions, as well as Premiere - including update to 6.01.&nbsp; Now when I connect my Sony DCRTRV520 camcorder via IEEE1394 firewire and try to capture video from Hi8 I've recorded, it will only record a few frames and
 then stops.&nbsp; Matrox video tools say the IEEE 1394 device has stopped working.&nbsp; Premiere's capture options indicate the camcorder is not recognized.<br />
<br />
I found a forum which indicated that the issue was with XP sp3 drivers for the Texas Instrument OHCI 1394 device - indicating that sp2 and sp3 downgraded the performance of the 1394 device to a speed of S100.&nbsp; I found a knowledge base article saying MS was
 aware of the issue and finally got that download to work (KB885222)<br />
<br />
http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/0/6/906f2f67-39c4-48bc-8558-86833d4cbc16/WindowsXP-KB885222-v2-x86-ENU.exe<br />
<br />
it won't actually install on the PC as I'm running SP3 not SP2.&nbsp; This is really frustrating since the entire system worked great in windows 2000. Even worse since I have a lot of old video - not stored on DVD or made into movies which I was hoping to work on
 for presents for family members this Christmas.<br />
<br />
Anyone know of another download - hotfix - or the like which will fix this issue?<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 10 rollback stuck in loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rankin4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 rollback stuck in loop</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft kept telling me to update to windows 10. confirmed that my laptop and components of were compatiable with the upgrade from my current os (windows 7 home edition sp1). &nbsp;Long story short , 1 day into the upgrade I knew it was not for me. &nbsp;I followed
 the instructions for the rollback in the settings menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is now stuck in the loop. &nbsp;All I get is windows is restoring your previous version.....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>windows will not open. power up... I can manually hit the function keys but without knowing what to do without killing my system I do not want to push any buttons. &nbsp;Please help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have my recovery start disc for windows 7 which I made when I purchased the computer. My product key I do have from the sticker on the bottom of my laptop but.. its a little worn out so some of the numbers may be questionable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did somehow get a peak at the c/drive in pushing buttons and I did see the "windowsold" file in there. &nbsp; I would like to recover my system without whipping it out totally if possible. but if I have to restore to factory then so be it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check to see if you can restore your PC to factory settings. This will reinstall the version of Windows that came with your PC and remove personal files, apps and drivers you installed, and any changes you made to settings. Go to

<span>Recovery</span> &gt; <span>Reset this PC</span> &gt; <span>

Info for Windows Insiders 
<div>
<p>If you’re an Insider and the current preview build isn’t working for you, go to
<span>Settings</span> &gt; <span>Update &amp; security</span> &gt;
<span>Recovery</span> &gt; <span>Go back to an earlier build</span>. This won’t remove your personal files, but it’ll remove recently installed apps and drivers, and change settings back to their defaults.
</p>
<p>Going back to an earlier build won’t remove you from the Insider Program. When the next preview build is ready, it'll be installed on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned "product key I do have from the sticker on the bottom of my laptop but.. its a little worn out so some of the numbers may be questionable", I suggest you to get in touch with the Manufacturer for the product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps, let us know the status of the issue to assist you further.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>ok, let me try again-</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the Settings&gt;update and security&gt;go back to previous version</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine went through the screens to tell me it will take me back to windows 7...etc....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>but its now stuck in a restore loop.- Windows will not open, I get a flash of the window, then a flash of my toshiba screen, and a message saying restoring your previous version.... but its a constant loop. over and over. &nbsp;I can turn the machine off and
 it does the same thing. &nbsp;hours long. &nbsp;its not restoring to windows 7. its stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can access f12, f2, f8 and get into the system that way but I need to know from you what to do so I can try and recover the old windows another way. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instructions that tell me to go to "settings, etc... is not going to work since I can not access windows. I need to know how to do it either with the command prompt or some other way. thank you.</p>
