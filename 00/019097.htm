<h2>            Favourites missing, unable to set Spartan as default and unable to open last session in Spartan</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: favourites</p>
<p>Hi Spartan people, I still miss my favourites pages in Spartan (I still have them in IE), still miss chance to open the last session. And still miss choice of default browser, Bing is really useless for us, whatever good it may be for US. Mainly except for
 this I really like it, good job. </p>

<h2>            Active Directory Rename &#40;On Premise&#41; &#124; ADConnect</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>
<p>I am going to be renaming my domain from company.lan to something new. We currently have the most up to date ADConnect syncing users and passwords. I was hoping you could provide a proper procedure for the Office 365 side of things. I know that my local
 objects will retain the GUID's and once synced backup the objects should match up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a standard or recommended procedure?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read that you should disable password sync and uninstall ADConnect. Make the domain name change, Install ADConnect on a new Server and setup sync again. Any information will be helpful. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi sgarvie,</p>
<p>No official article lists the recommended procedure.</p>
<p>From my opinion, you can first disable/deactivate directory Sync, so that any local change will not affect Office 365 users. Once local renaming is done, you can re-enable directory sync, the users will be matched.</p>
<p>Moreover, as far as I know, we do not need to uninstall and re-install AAD connect tool. Did you read this information from any official article?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Young</p>

<p>Hi sgarvie,</p>
<p>Thanks for update.</p>
<p>1. For your plan, based on my experience, this is feasible.</p>
<p>2. What do you mean by saying “<strong>turn back on</strong>”?</p>
<p>Yes. If we disable Directory Sync, it will take some time (might up to several hours) to take effect (become fully deactivated).</p>
<p>Later, you can re-enable Directory Sync at any time.</p>
<p>Anything unclear, please let us know.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>On a general level, strongly suggest you incorporate some error-handling in all your code - specifically after each &lt;Set&gt; statement in this example which assumes that there is no outstanding error that was triggered prior to this routine&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is supposed to be generic code, then, at a very minimum, you should be checking to see if an instance of Outlook is already running. The use of &lt;GetObject&gt; should be used if Outlook is running and will throw error 429 if it's not at which point you
 would use &lt;CreateObject&gt; to invoke a new instance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a thread in the Access forum specifically for this Error ID which may answer your questions. Access VBA code is outside the bounds of this forum's focus. While the thread below is for Access '2007, have no doubt that it would equally apply to Access
 '2010</p>

    <title>Use Pivot Table Name in a formula - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smgoma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Use Pivot Table Name in a formula</h2>
                    I have a VLOOKUP that uses a Pivot Table as the array.&nbsp; The Pivot Table is created directly from a Microsoft Query to an ODBC data source.&nbsp; I want the ARRAY reference in the VLOOKUP to be the entire Pivot Table, however many rows and columns it turns out
 to be upon refreshing the Query.&nbsp; The Pivot Table Name does not appear to function as a Table Name does in a VLOOKUP.&nbsp; Is there a way to reference the Pivot Table as the ARRAY in a VLOOKUP in this way?

    <title>vba to stop all macros - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lonely in ivory tower_y  say:</h3>
<h2>            vba to stop all macros</h2>
                    <p>I have a macro that does steps 1-3, step 4 is RunCode GetStuffAndDoStuff()</p>
<p>Steps 5 and 6 are more macro commands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is an error in step 4, the part that is VBA code, on error exit function just continues the flow with steps 5 and 6.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I stop all macros if step 4 errors so that steps 5 and 6 don't execute?</p>
<p>Something like on error DoCmd.StopAllMacros</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Since the MsgBox "4"&nbsp;line is below&nbsp;the FileCopy line, it won't be executed if FileCopy fails - the code will jump from the FileCopy line immediately to the Out: label.</p>

            Examined the macro commands and added msgboxes throughout preceeding macro commands. Sure can't find the culprit. But thank you for all your help. Have a great weekend.

            <p>Hi Taran Dhingra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have understood correctly you want to change the country setting of the child account that you created since it's been accidentally set to United States instead of India. In that case, it would be best to get in touch with
<strong>Microsoft account support </strong>by submitting a <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/id-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">private&nbsp;support request</a></strong> since they are experts in your field of inquiry and they have the appropriate resources
 to resolve the issue. This would allow them to&nbsp;assist you directly and securely.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to access your primary account, you can use an alternate account (if you have one) or create a new one
<strong><a href="https://signup.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will now lock this thread since your inquiry will be answered by a Microsoft account agent in the support case that you'll create. Your cooperation and understanding in this matter will be highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>950 &#38; 950xl Bluetooth not Staying Connected and&#47;or Taking Over - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pcbpcb  say:</h3>
<h2>            950 &#38; 950xl Bluetooth not Staying Connected and&#47;or Taking Over My Phone</h2>
                    <p>Had a 950, and now a&nbsp;950xl, same problem. First, my Bluetooth headset (Plantronics, Legend and Edge) periodically disconnect from the phone for no apparent reason.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much worse, when they reconnect, often times when I call, and the Bluetooth icon on the call screen is lit up saying Bluetooth is connected, I cannot hear the other party, and sometimes they cannot hear me. Sometimes I can push speaker phone and they can
 hear me and me them, but sometimes it won't release the Bluetooth and so I have to hang up and call back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea on how to fix and/or work around this? It happens about 1 in 5 calls, which is a lot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.s. to any Microsoft Lumia person who sees this: of all the things a smart phone can and should do, making phone call reliably should be at the top of the list. I have had Bluetooth since it came out and have never seen a situation as bad as this with it.
 In fact, simply had any Bluetooth problems for 5 years of more, including your Lumia 928. Please, please, please address this quickly. This is the kind of thing that is driving many Microsoft people away from the Lumia's to other manufacturers - you know what
 I mean. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, I know about the suggestion app on the phone, but it doesn't work right either.
</p>

<p>I have a 535, 820 and 950 Xl, all of which have problems with bluetooth amongst others. As an IT &amp; Telecoms consultant, having worked in depth technically in the mobile arena, I thought I might be able to help with problems that users see and with microsoft
 getting them resolved</p>
<p>. Since you suggest Windows Feedback is not working, or worse still MS ignore it, then maybe I am flogging a dead horse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will say though it is about time markets prevented such manufacturers introducing products that are not fit for purpose and don't work as they are described, prior to a manufacturer resolving all such issues prior to release. In my opinion they are breaking
 trading laws of that country by releasing products with know problems, many of them basic to a products operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No s/w release or update thus far have resolved the bluetooth issue!!!!</p>

<p>I am about this discussion board here, Microsoft Answers. However, it is still a good idea to post your findings. Perhaps the user community—we—are able to gather enough information to workaround that Bluetooth issue. Nevertheless, Microsoft offers that
 app within your phone, Windows Feedback. Microsoft wants you to feed that with a
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting/using-bug-reporter/problem-detail/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
qualified bug report</a>. Did say much about that here in this thread. However, to be honest, I have no idea how that can be used professionally by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, just for a community-power example, in another thread (in the German section), the Bluetooth issue might be related with VoLTE or HD voice (AMR). Therefore, what happens when you go for All Apps » Settings » Network » Cellular &amp; SIM » SIM settings
 » Highest connection speed: 2G – is Bluetooth more stable now? By the way, which Bluetooth device are you using? More information might help to find the cause or even a workaround.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Microsoft does not leverage Microsoft Answers as feedback channel, either. Why ever. Therefore your comments drown in the Internet swarm. From my point of view, I am astonished that Windows 10 Mobile is such a black box. If there were logging tools publicly
 available or if the OS talked to us, we could debug/report our personal findings much better. Even more, that experiences combined could lead to workarounds, at least. We all want solutions. Nobody wants software bugs. Nevertheless, the situation is as it
 is. However, if Windows 10 Mobile had been a transparent box, we could empower the community power.</p>

 and the Zune service. Groove isn't great, but at least its stable on all other platforms. But here's my problem...</span></p>
<p><span>I got a Lumia 950xl last week with great anticipation after it was out of stock. Now&nbsp;extremely frustrated. It's going to go back before long as the following is unacceptable.</span></p>
<p><span>Having 2 problems with windows 10 mobile on this new </span><span>Lumia 950xl:&nbsp;h</span><span>orrible Bluetooth connectivity, and the Groove music phone app tile frequently stops working (if you open an audio file directly from its stored location it
 will restore the tile functionality, but that eventually stops and needs to be reset again).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have tried the phone with several Bluetooth devices and they all pair with the phone but have terrible connectivity. They drop connections or the connections are lousy, unusable or unstable.</span></p>
<p><span>Same problem with a headset, tabletop speakers, car phone/music, and MS Band 2. Unacceptable.</span></p>
<p><span>I have re-paired the devices repeatedly, soft reset the phone over and over, did factory reset, and have done all software updates, even most recent insider update, fast track. Still garbage.</span></p>
<p><span>All those devices work perfectly with several other phones&nbsp;(all&nbsp;Lumias&nbsp;with Windows Phone&nbsp;8)&nbsp;and tablets over several kinds. Never seen anything like this, certainly not for a $650 device. My kids' android tablet works fine with all of our Bluetooth
 devices, even.</span></p>
<p><span>1) A web search seems to indicate that others have had Bluetooth problems from day one. Are others still having these problems?</span></p>
<p><span>2) Does anyone know of a solution?</span></p>
<p><span>3) Does anyone know if MS is working on a solution?</span></p>
<p><span>4) When's a solution coming, because it better be before the return period is up on this thing because I'm going to go back to my Lumia 830 and give up and get my money back?</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you, Joseph</span></p>

<h2>            connection problems</h2>
                    When I try to Sync my Motorola Q to my computer now, it won't find a connection. It worked many times before this and now i don't know what the problem is. It comes up with an error message saying that i need to set outlook as my default mail client. I
 use at least three different email accounts a day and outlook express is set as the default. Plus when i plug it into the USB port it searches for a new network address and never finds one. Please help. Any suggestions?<br />

            <p>Hi uzzie(2),<br />
<br />
Welcome to the Microsoft Community forum. I understand how inconvenient it is for you to use your account on your iPad with such small fonts. I'd be needing more information from you for investigation. Please answer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do you access your account on your phone? Is it on a phone browser or an email app?
</li><li>If email app, is it the built-in email app or the Hotmail app? </li><li>Do you encounter the same problem if you access a different account? </li><li>What is the refresh button you're looking for? Where do you find this previously?
</li><li>What are the detailed steps you're doing on your settings to try and change the font?</li></ul>
<p>Your answers will facilitate with our investigation. We look forward to your reply.<br />
<br />
Thank you!</p>

    <title>Project 2013 Master Schedule sub-project file management and bulk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tombehrmann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Project 2013 Master Schedule sub-project file management and bulk resource reidentification</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>A Program (multiple sub-projects) initiated scheduling in Project 2013 with 3 sub-project schedules, not resource-loaded, on different drives (via/through SharePoint, sometimes).&nbsp; It was then decided to integrate these into a Master Schedule.&nbsp; Subsequently,
 I joined the program.&nbsp; Then resource loading was mandated (without an established resource pool).&nbsp; I purchased/read
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Microsoft Project 2013: Microsoft Official Academic Course
</span>and started to convince the team to remove the schedules from SharePoint, put them on the same drive, and created a resource pool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; The <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Microsoft Project 2013: Microsoft Official Academic Course</span> doesn't address the sub-project file management (completely for our intended methodology).</p>
<p>
</p><p>We intended to link certain sub-project tasks between sub-projects (such as delivery of product from one scheduled purchase order to another purchase order that needs that furnished product to complete their scope).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Master Schedule's sub-project schedules would be baselined versions and we desired to have another sub-project schedule with a revised file name appended with "-working" (such as proj1-working.mpp) for the sub-project Project Manager to play around with
 for schedule risk analysis and such.&nbsp; Should a risk become realized (an "issue") or a contract change occur (either requiring a revised schedule), this could/would effectively become a new baseline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to have a revised sub-project schedule (proj1-working.mpp, without renaming prior established tasks) be saved as proj1.mpp (overwriting the previous baselined file proj1.mpp) without losing the pre-existing links created in the Master Schedule
 (and the other sub-projects)?&nbsp; (Alternately, do we just have to accept that we will edit proj1.mpp by pasting in new tasks and make the other edits to pre-existing tasks?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; The <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Microsoft Project 2013: Microsoft Official Academic Course</span> doesn't address whether we can previously identified resources and, in bulk, replace the resources with the better resource pool names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found Internet blogs that essentially explained (I believe) that each existence of proj1's "Bob Smith" and proj2's "BSmith" that should now be "Smith, Robert" (consistent with Microsoft Outlook based/derived resource pool) would need to be individually
 changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't find it hard to believe.&nbsp; I find it impractical to individually do this (presuming the database designers would foresee that employees retire/leave or are replaced) and a command/"click" method could exist for such situations.&nbsp; If there isn't a command/"click"
 method sequence to make such a bulk edit/change, is there a way (possibly in the background using SQL or VBA) to accomplish bulk resource renaming?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternately, can the resource allocation and over-allocation method be made to group "like" resources (defined by the user)?</p>

            <p>Tom,</p>
<p>Wow, that's quite an expose. Let me just start by saying that if you are planning on having a complex linked structure in Project (i.e. dynamic master with subprojects, resource pool, and links between tasks in the subprojects), you are courting corruption.
 Files in a linked structure must never by renamed, moved, overwritten, or saved off to another location. All files should reside on a local drive in a single directory and not be operated over a network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to resources, you can always replace a resource that retired, left or is otherwise no longer on the program using the "Replace" feature of the Assign Resources window. Or, instead of specifically names resources, you could use generic resources
 (i.e. like skilled). You can also use group resources. For example, instead of Tom, **** and Harry as painters, create a "painters" group whose Max Unit level is 300% (i.e. 3 full-time painters).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>

            <p>Yes, "Wow, that's quite an expose. "</p>
<p>Be careful.</p>
<p>Run some testing at small scale.</p>
<p>Try out resource, assign resources, replace. See if that gets you close or on the way.</p>
<p>Watch out for replacing resources on tasks which have already accrued actual starts, actual durations, actual work and actual cost.</p>
<p>If you copy/move either tasks or resources from one file to another, make sure that the calendars get moved first.</p>
<p>Also, any custom fields, views, filters, tables, groups, before moving/copying resources and/or tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a lot of careful work to do if you are moving files from previously different drives onto one drive.</p>
<p>Having multiple files, preferably with no resources of their own, sharing or competing for resources from another file which is preferably only resources, carries the usual risks of linked files, ie the link fails for some reason, but not as much risk as
 having both a resource pool file as well as a master aggregated project file.</p>
<p>The consensus appears to be that a shared resource pool file is ok, low risk, but combined with master aggregated files with links between tasks in different sub-projects, although tempting, can be stretching it. Worst case, you might have to re-build it
 all again. </p>
<p>Master files should be expendable, and easy to rebuild, but this will be complicated by links between projects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As well as having a generic resource called "painters" with max units = 400%, you could also consider generic resources defined such as "Painter 01", "Painter 02", "Painter 03", "Painter 04", each at max units = 100%, but I know that not everyone agrees
 that this is necessary.</p>
<p>Be careful. When in doubt, test.</p>

            <p>Thank You.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can drill a little more into details because I consider this may narrow the response range.&nbsp; These are not addressed in the same order as the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do not have a need to use generic resources (resource pools).&nbsp; (Also, we don't desire to - we are all "professionals" for which the PMS and functional managers have a hard time forecasting specialists in multiple disciplines.)&nbsp; For a forecast I assigned
 an imaginary resource name, made a high level schedule, and looked at overallocation to estimate how many personnel would be needed without regard to those that are specialists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"With regard to resources, you can always replace a resource that retired, left or is otherwise no longer on the program using the "Replace" feature of the Assign Resources window. " - I'm trying to reduce the rework of doing these individually.&nbsp; There are
 thousands of tasks already.&nbsp; A small percentage of them have been completed.&nbsp; Very few had resources assigned.&nbsp; Those in the future do but are inconsistent with the resource pool.&nbsp; I just want to minimize the rework (if possible) of reassigning resources resulting
 from staring a Program without properly scoping out how to achieve the output needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"All files should reside on a local drive in a single directory and not be operated over a network."&nbsp; We are relocating files to a single drive.&nbsp; We operate over three sites through a common network.&nbsp; Two of those sites generate sub-project schedules used
 in the Master Schedule.&nbsp; By our business, we can't get around the LAN/WAN.&nbsp; (Physical) media transfers are too complicated due to our security practices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Files in a linked structure must never by renamed, moved, overwritten, or saved off to another location."&nbsp; That narrows the approach (such that I/we don't expend effort to trial different filenames and such).&nbsp; I will note, that on "sister" program, the
 PM has successfully taken working sub-project schedules (files named proj1-working.mpp) and resaved them as the currently linked schedule (filename proj1.mpp) and the links remained working, however, these files were not used over a LAN/WAN, just her computer.&nbsp;
 (She also maintains all the schedules and can readily identify when this or other issues develop.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, do you know of a way to batch change resource names?</p>

            <p>"Expose" - Some coworkers would use the word "diatribe", however, better facts usually provide better answers.&nbsp; (Starting a Program/project without clearly developed processes is a "Lesson Learned" that some of these responses will be used within.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried the suggestions, yet.&nbsp; I didn't have time (today) and wanted to clarify some things that you may find pertinent.&nbsp; (Some of my response to John might be useful or redundant.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Watch out for replacing resources on tasks which have already accrued actual starts, actual durations, actual work and actual cost." - I understand that.&nbsp; My response to John was this may be a small percentage of all the tasks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"If you copy/move either tasks or resources from one file to another, make sure that the calendars get moved first." - The resource pool is also being recommended as the "template".&nbsp; We do not have server and are all using Project 2013 Standard.&nbsp; When I
 created the resource pool, I established it with the calendar all schedules were supposed to use.&nbsp; Our draft process states to open the resource pool file and save to a new name that will essentially be proj#-working.mpp.&nbsp; (The resource pool file has no tasks.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Also, any custom fields, views, filters, tables, groups, before moving/copying resources and/or tasks." - Fortunately, we are not savvy enough to embed anything into the schedules and this is good also because of classification/security concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"You have a lot of careful work to do if you are moving files from previously different drives onto one drive." - As addressed to John, we are operating over multiple sites with a WAN/LAN.&nbsp; We have not discovered an issue (yet) but I do not believe the PMs
 at the other site have started to transfer schedules.&nbsp; (Those of us at this site have not reported an error.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Having multiple files, preferably with no resources of their own, sharing or competing for resources from another file which is preferably only resources, carries the usual risks of linked files, ie the link fails for some reason, but not as much risk as
 having both a resource pool file as well as a master aggregated project file." - I wasn't sure the intent of what was being addressed.&nbsp; The resource pool file is not linked to Microsoft Outlook.&nbsp; I preferred to manually update the resource pool with new employee
 names from Microsoft Outlook (but not by a link).&nbsp;&nbsp; We don't have physical resources in Microsoft Outlook to link to regardless.&nbsp; The sub-project schedules will have to rename existing resources consistently with those in the resource pool for resource allocation
 reviews - I wasn't sure this was so much a link as much as a resource pool database search criteria consistency issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The consensus appears to be that a shared resource pool file is ok, low risk, but combined with master aggregated files with links between tasks in different sub-projects, although tempting, can be stretching it. Worst case, you might have to re-build it
 all again.&nbsp; Master files should be expendable, and easy to rebuild, but this will be complicated by links between projects." - From the perspective of the Program Manager doing the integration, should I then be recommending that they when making a Master Schedule
 save them with a new file name (such as Master-date.mpp) everytime the Master File is opened?&nbsp; I wouldn't have thought Master Schedules were considered to be expendable - I believe the correct need for us is to have a consistently maintained Master schedule
 that is baselined when there are contract changes (affecting schedule).&nbsp; (Our Program may be likened to a multi-year 8 sub-contractors that sometimes deliver compoents to each other fitting a new building [built by another/external project team] and then a
 whole bunch of employer sub-projects to hard-wire and man that building.&nbsp; I wouldn't want to have to build a Master Schedule every month.)</p>
<p>

 that this is necessary." - Addresses with John, we do not need/desire pooled/generic resource groups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accept that renaming proj1-working to proj1.mpp is risky.&nbsp; (I won't recommend it.&nbsp; I'll bet someone will try it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accept that we might have risks across the WAN/LAN.&nbsp; (After one transfer, the file's errors can probably be corrected or we get "big IT" to move the files.)</p>

            <p>Tom,</p>
<p>A resource pool does not define "generic" resources. A resource pool is a convenient way to have a separate pool file with all the resources that will be assigned to multiple separate projects (sharer files). A generic resource is equivalent to your "imaginary
 resources". For example, a generic resource might be an "engineer" or "accountant" or "MTS" (member of technical staff). With generic resources you will not need to re-assign them, yet you will be able to see overallocations and do resource costing, assuming
 you can define a rate for each type of generic resource.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to operating a linked structure over a LAN/WAN, it has a chance or working okay if the LAN/WAN is in the same building where it is likely to be more stable. Attempting to operate a linked structure over a network that has nodes in different locations
 is inviting trouble. Any glitch in the network, and those do occur, can corrupt the structure in a heartbeat. If you haven't seen a problem at this point, you are lucky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you looked at Project Server or Project Online? Those are specifically structured for enterprise environments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to moving or re-saving existing linked files. The problem with moving or re-saving a linked file either creates link fragments or duplicate links (to the old structure and to the new structure). If you need to move a file that was part of a linked
 structure, first un-link it from the old structure, move it and then link it to the new structure. When links are broken, it is imperative that both files (i.e. source and destination) be saved in order to "capture" the change, otherwise a link fragment will
 remain in one of the files and that's a fragment you don't want to have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are going to use a linked structure it is prudent to have a single individual maintain all files because properly maintaining that structure requires considerable discipline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to answer your question, use generic resources and you won't need a way to "batch change resource names".</p>

            <p>Tom,</p>
<p>There was a lot of information presented in your original post and quite honestly I was more focused on the ideas presented that fly directly in the face of good (required) practices for working with linked structures. It's still not clear that those issues
 have been appropriately addressed. If not, then how resource names are "synced" won't matter because the whole structure will get corrupt in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that preface, as I understand it you have subproject files that were created by mulitple individuals who used various names for assigning a given resource (e.g. Bob Smith, Robert Smith, BSmith, etc.). Now you have a resource pool file whose resource
 names were taken from Outlook and you need to update all subproject files with the "official" name designations in the resource pool file. Does that about sum it up? If so, then to answer your latest question, no, there is no bulk process to sync up resource
 names. It could potentially be done with VBA but then that might not be wise because who's to say the Bob Smith, Robert Smith and BSmith, for example, are all the same person. Maybe BSmith is Barbara Smith. If you can define rules that an automated process
 can use for re-assignment then it might be feasible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How many resources are you talking about? If it's hundreds then maybe some automated resource name alignment process makes sense, but for only 3 subprojects I can't imagine there are that many such that a careful manual conversion might be the better approach.
 Yeah it might be a pain, but you should only have to do it once.</p>

<p>So it sounds like you have 15 resource names to "convert" to their official name as shown in the pool file. That might take all of 15 minutes, not something worth developing a macro to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are interested in learning Project VBA, I highly recommend Rod Gill's book on the subject (http://www.project-systems.co.nz/project-vba-book). And for specific help with VBA you can post to this forum and we'll be glad to help.</p>

    <title>How do I fix Third-party security Softwares &#40;like Norton symantec - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> izzycoco  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I fix Third-party security Softwares &#40;like Norton symantec antivirus&#41; that are incompatible with Windows 10 Insider Preview&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Please I would appreciate if anyone can give me a reasonable answer as to how I can resolve this issue of incompatible software on my windows 10 preview. My Norton Symantec Antivirus 2014 was up to date on my previous windows 8.1; but the instant I installed
 Windows 10 preview, my Norton antivirus immediately stopped working and couldn't perform my routine daily system scan. I wasn't even able to run the software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All attempts to access the antivirus software failed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted the Norton online Support and had a healthy chat with an online representative, only to be informed that I would need o revert back to my previous windows 8.1, as my current Windows 10 preview doesn't currently support the software. I tried reverting
 back using a DVD after I had created and downloaded an .ISO windows 8 media file&nbsp; from Microsoft online, but all attempts to revert back failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(PS: (1) I had read on Microsoft website in some articles that it was possible to revert back to windows 8.1 even if u forgot to create a recovery media before installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) I&nbsp;forgot to create a recovery windows 8.1 media before installing the windows 10 technical preview</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to get my Norton Antivirus working again as soon as possible? Because of the continuous risk of going online without online security protection and other forms of protection my Norton software affords me.</p>

<h2>            Active Sync vs Outlook Sync issues</h2>
                    
<p>I have been trying to sync a brand new Moto Q Smartphone&nbsp;to a Home PC&nbsp;(XP)&nbsp;with Outlook 2003 (no Exchange Server). All I'm trying to sync is the Contacts and Calendar. I keep getting a 85010014 Error code (Activesync
 encountered a problem with the desktop). No ones within Microsoft wants to assume responsibility without charging a fee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have followed the Microsoft online recomendations to upgrade to Activesync 4.5, but this has still not resolved the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I never used the video podcasts, well I just tried to use some nokia video podcasts and they were in MP4 format. To my surprise my phone says it can not play the format and so it just played it as the audio file. I was reading at GSMArena.com and looks like
 N85 does support MP4 files.</p>
<p>Can any one help me on this? How can I play MP4 files on my phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>even the n8 has poor support for mp4 codecs. I get around this problem by using ojosoft to convert the files to .avi. then it works great</p>

<p>Well, podcasts are mainly encoded in AVC@640x360 or 480x320. N85 plays AVC only at 320x240 resolution or lower. It has nothing to do with the container, in this case .mp4.</p>

<br />
This error occurs when Sender Policy Framework (SPF) validation for the sender's domain fails. If you're the sender's email admin, make sure the SPF records for your domain at your domain registrar are set up correctly. Office 365 supports only one SPF record
 (a TXT record that defines SPF) for your domain. Include the following domain name:
<strong>spf.protection.outlook.com</strong>. If you have a hybrid configuration (some mailboxes in the cloud, and some mailboxes on premises) or if you're an Exchange Online Protection standalone customer, add the outbound IP address of your on-premises servers
 to the TXT record.<br />
<br />

            <p><span>Hi Nancy,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I’ve checked the SPF record of the sender’s domain and found it is fine. So, I’d like to know if this issue happened only to the specific Gmail recipient. What if you send email to other Gmail recipients or other kind of recipient such as Hotmail.com,
 yahoo.com, etc.? Does the same issue persist?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue only happened to the specific Gmail recipient and you have no problem sending emails to other recipients, it probably means it’s the specific Gmail recipient who blocks the email sent from you. You need to contact the admin of the Gmail
 recipient to whitelist your email address or unblock you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks,<br />
Mouran</span></p>
