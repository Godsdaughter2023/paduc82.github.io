<h2>            DNS unavailable</h2>
                    <p>Hey, I have a windows 10 laptop and when I play the game called "ROBLOX" It says I lost connection every single time,(Started today) when I went to my troubleshooting setting it said DNS unavailable I even went on google to see if I can fix it but I can
 not...</p>
<p>So if there is anyway I can make my DNS available it would be awesome!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks ~ Anthony&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            COD GHOST - LISTEN SERVER &#61; PLAYER HOSTED MATCHES &#61; NOT DEDICATED SERVER &#61; HOST LAG</h2>
                    
<p>When I bought COD for xbox one I expected the online to be 100% dedicated servers.</p>
<p>Every match Ive played tonight on Call of Duty Ghost (xbox one) was NOT on a dedicated server. ALL LISTEN SERVERS = laggy host</p>
<p>The matches were noticeably laggier. With players teleporting at times AND host migrations.</p>
<p>I feel cheated. A massively successful franchise like should be able to support something as 100% dedicated server matches.</p>

<p>Are you serious? You were seeing host migration? I was under the impression that COD servers would be 100% hosted by Activision's claims in articles as well. I will be really disappointed if this is the truth.</p>
<p>So far, I have only heard of this on the PS4 version. I have not noticed anything as bad as the previous versions though.

<p><strong>KREEPLX360,</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>no one ever said anything about Ghosts being 100% on dedicated servers. I'm having no connectivity issues on Ghosts, however I can understand that you are angry about this. Just to read up, here's the official statement about servers from Infinity Ward:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p><span>I wanted to give a quick update on some of the work that has been done to improve everyone’s online experience. We’ve already mentioned dedicated servers as part of the overall plan to improve connectivity. Dedicated servers will be used on current
 gen, next gen and PC with Ghosts. And, in order to make sure that people have the best possible experience regardless of platform, location or connection, Ghosts will be using a hybrid system of dedicated servers and listen servers. So no matter where you
 are the game will always be trying to give you the best online performance possible. There is also some great new tech in the matchmaking system that will place players in matches that have the best combined overall connectivity performance. Again these are
 just some of the things that are going into Call of Duty: Ghosts to give players a great online experience. Can’t wait to see you all online.”</span></p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now if you don't get connected to dedicated servers, there might just be better hosts for your area. Once the host is better than the server (considering things like a ping check, packet loss and jitter) you will be connected to a listen server - the thing
 with these is obviously that a host is a person who may have network problems in his home or might just rage quit even though you generally have a better connection to him than to the nearest server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't be too angry though, Activision is still rolling out more and more servers, there might just be some places closer to you and you'll get on servers more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I hope this helped,</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the day, I don't believe that a Listen Server is ever better than a Dedicated Server. 7+ gaming on the 360 have clearly proven that.</p>
<p>Dedicated servers are just that "dedicated" While Listen servers are crappy home connections, with other people in those households using their ipods and laptops all on that same Listen Server Internet connection running on poor WiFi signals.</p>
<p>Side by side... a dedicated connection wins every time.</p>
<p>Infinity Ward is just using this as an excuse to save a buck.</p>

<p><strong>IXISTiCKYIXI,</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>you are right, I prefer dedicated servers too, but listen servers have advantages too, given there's certain requirements met.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I will give you an example:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a 100k, wired DSL connection to a very stable net using a very stable router, most people might not have the same speed, but they certainly have enough (for a CoD &nbsp;match 16k is well enough). Now given the connection the host uses is wired, he doesn't
 have a billion people watching videos in his home and doesn't rage quit - is it not better to connect to this host who lives about 100 miles away rather than to the nearest dedicated server that might be standing 1000 miles away?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now obviously most of the time all of these requirements might not be met, but when they are a listen server might still be better. Now Infinity Ward surely wants to save money by putting up less servers, but what I find worse is that they only do the old
 ping check to determine what you get rather than creating connection profiles of players and therefore making sure bad connections don't get hosts even though they have quick response times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A hybrid system is good, but it could have been done better.</p>

<p>The issue is not the server distance, because Im am pretty certain there is a dedicated somewhere near my location as when ever I play alone ... it automatically connects me to a dedicated server. But when I start playing in a party with people all over
 the country. It forces a garbage listen server (home connection) on us, which isn't nessasarily the best option for ALL the people in the party. SO IT DOES, indeed become the worst option possible for the person who 1) doesn't like close to this particular
 live server 2) Already has a a better dedicated server available, than any possible live server</p>
<p>if you have a party with people from all 4 corners of the country, only 1 person will have a good connection to the listen server and the rest will be lagging, because they have a dedicated server in their location, but forced to use some crappy listen server
 which is much farther away</p>

<p>aFreshMelon I'm not &nbsp;100 % &nbsp;OK with you , with xbox live we pay for dedicated server and not peer to peer . We have swallow power of the cloud for 6 month now , we have power of peer to peer now !
</p>
<p>If you are host of the games you always have advantages from other players, and call of is a competitve game we should have dedicated servers.
</p>
<p>Dedicated servers can be hosted in diffrents datacenter all over the world : at least in Europe and USA</p>

<p>I've had a few good matches but it's not a constant dedicated server setup. I did believe it was going to be, I didn't see myself backing out of matches but sadly it seems to be exactly the same as playing the 360 version for most matches.</p>

<p>I noticed tonight for the first time that in between matches it was saying "finding best host" which indicated dedicated servers were not being used. Up until tonight it's been running super smooth for me, but tonight was laggy and noticeably worse. Perhaps
 the severs were just down? I think we need something other than the status page with the defcon levels. We have a right to know whether or not the dedicated servers are up and running. I will say since launch on xbox one I haven't had an actual host migration,
 but I did quit after two matches tonight once I realized it was going to be a host advantage lag fest.

<p>just noticed it after the patch that it in fact i have been getting p2p (listen server as activision likes to codename it) if you notice it says 'finding best host' then it's definitely p2p, you don't even need to check for that in game you can tell you
 get the same old 2 seconds behind connection. </p>
<p>i paid for this 720p console for cod being on dedicated servers as promised and once again we are being lied to. if it continues to be this 'hybrid we hide if its dedicated' or not then i might as well sell this junk. i'm from the UK &amp; it was on dedicated
 servers when it released but since after patch i noticed instantly how bad it went. Sort it out MS</p>

            Hi Leonard
<br />
<br />What is the exact location of the folder you are trying to copy those photos to?
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to the SD Card, select the photos you want to import, press Ctrl + C top copy those
<br />
<br />Then navigate into your preferred folder and press Ctrl + V to paste those files
<br />
<br />Does that copy those photos over to your PC?       
        </p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>The location of the folder was on my hard drive called 'photos' and contained within in this folder are lots of different files. I normally just use the date that I am downloading.</p>
<p>It does work the way you have suggested but cannot understand why it doesn't work in the 'normal' method that I used before.</p>
<p>In the past I use to put my SD card in and then it read the number of photos and gave me the option to change the destination of where you wanted the photos stored. Once I had created a new file it then said 'Add to folder. Click yes then ok and the files
 were copied to that file.</p>
<p>Thanks Dave for trying to help. I appreciate your time and concern</p>

            I had a customer's machine that was infected and safe mode (only) was unbootable with the stop error you describe. Normal mode was fine (once I removed all the malware of course).
<br />
<br />
It turns out there was a problem with the SAFEBOOT branch in the registry. Possibly having something to do with the infections, though it may also have been from an XP migration issue previously.
<br />
<br />
Anyway, check out your registry. Your issue may lie somewhere in the SAFEBOOT area. Another person online was missing the entire CONTROL section, not just SAFEBOOT after an infection. If you have a registry backup from before the problem, you should have no
 trouble merging in that section to your current registry. Make sure you backup before doing this though. Either create a restore point or go download ERUNT and make a backup.<br />
<br />
Run regedit and check to make sure there is no problem (or missing keys) in this area:
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SafeBoot<br />
<br />
Here is the info I found online (quoted verbatim):<br />
Good Luck!<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
After further research on the web I<br />
found a "golden" hint WHY normal mode works and Safe Mode doesn't:<br />
<br />
The registry branch "SafeBoot" that should be located under<br />
HKEY_LM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ is completely missing!<br />
<br />
I imported this branch from another XP Pro installation and safe mode works<br />
now! Unfortunately completely importing the "SafeBoot" branch brings other<br />
problems with Windows themes, VGA drivers, audio drivers and so on... So I<br />
must somheow try to rebuild the SafeBoot branch based on the working normal<br />
mode.<br />
<br />

            "The registry branch "SafeBoot" that should be located under<br />
HKEY_LM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ is completely missing!"<br />
<br />
-That's usually how it works with that malware. It will delete the safeboot keys from all the control sets (current -&gt; 03) so you can't restore one of the backups either.<br />
I am starting to throw copies of the SAFEBOOT branch along with an ERUNT backup somewhere on the customer machines just in case it happens again to them. Then at least they have the right keys to restore.<br />
<br />
On another machine I had no choice other than to try my own safeboot branch on it. The machine was a desktop P4 and mine was from a Core Duo laptop. It worked, but the video and mouse were flaky. At least it's a temp solution until they can either find a similar
 machines keys, run an in-place restore, or (what I would do) install a separate XP instance and migrate the safeboot created there.<br />
<br />
Good luck!

    <title>Printer not working after upgrade to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spinneyhill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer not working after upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am starting a new thread because my observations are different to the others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our wireless Canon PIXMA MX860 works on the computers still on Win 7 but not this one on Win 10. It worked before the upgrade. I recently updated the driver for it from Canon's web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under Devices and Printers, the printer is shown. In the printer properties on the Advanced tab there is a "New Driver..." button so I did that and it went through the Install Printer Driver Wizard to install it. I selected the printer by maker and model
 and it said it would install the "Canon MX860 series Printer, x64, Type 3 - User Mode" driver. How do I tell if something was installed?</p>
<p>
Under the Device Manager, there are no "Printer Devices", only Print Queues. The queue for this printer is not there, nor is one for any of the other hardware printers I have installed. The printer is shown under "Imaging Devices". I asked Windows to check
 for Driver Update under Properties, Driver tab and it told me the best driver for the device was already installed.
</p><p>
</p><p>Also under Device Manager, I see an extra device that was not there before: Unknown Device under Other Devices. It has an exclamation in a yellow shield against it. It tells me there are no drivers installed for this device (Code 28) and that there are no
 compatible drivers for it. What is it? Maybe the weather station console data logger plugged into a USB port?</p>
<p>
What has happened and how can I rectify this mess? This is the third serious problem I am having with the Windows 10 downgrade. I am considering going back to Windows 7. At least it worked.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your response. The printer troubleshooter could not fix one instance of the printer, but it did for the other. So that works. Thank you. I'll remove the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The unknown device object name is \Device\00000010 and its hardware Ids is root\vdbus. Its device instance path is ROOT\SYSTEM\0001 and its status is 01802401. The problem code is 0000001C. I searched on vdbus and I find it is a Comodo thing, perhaps part
 of Comodo Backup I tried and it did not work. So I uninstalled it. It said an error occurred during the uninstall and it finished, removing the program from the Programs and Features list. There are a couple of .dlls in its directory under Program Files, in
 use somewhere but I can't find what is using them. Is there a way to see the lock on them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update, next day.</p>
<p>The computer froze again during the night, its usual Windows 10 behaviour. After the restart this morning I could delete the final Comodo directory. But the unknown device is still there. I have disabled it to see what happens.<br />

            <p>I solved this problem with my MX860 by following advice derived from these pages: http://community.usa.canon.com/t5/Office-Printers/MF-Toolbox-doesn-t-work-on-Windows-10/td-p/147893 .&nbsp; I did two things. 1)Uninstalled all Canon software and drivers and then
 reinstalled 8.1 versions from Canon website (no 10 versions available). Did multiple computer restarts during process. Left printer off during process. 2) I also went to services.msc&nbsp; and did this:
<br />
</p>
<p>Start&gt; in the run box type. Services.msc<br />
Scroll down to Windows Image Acquisition (WIA)<br />
Right click, select Properties<br />
Check that Startup type is set to Automatic<br />
Click Log On Tab<br />
Check that Local System account , and Allow service to interact with desktop is checked. Hit apply.<br />
Click Recovery...Click on window next to First Failure, Scroll to Restart the Service. Hit apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this 2nd step first and it did not resolve the problem, but after completing both the printer now works fine. Not sure if the services.msc changes necessary or not, but am leaving as everything now works fine.

<p>Great, no one can print in my house now after I spent 4 hours updating 4 computers to Windows 10, I should have known better, so now I guess I have to go out and buy another printer, I have purchased 7 printers in the last 10&nbsp;years just because I don't have
 10 freaking hours to download drivers and patches to get the old printers working every time Microsoft has an os upgrade.&nbsp; This infuriates me every time, when will I learn and buy a MAC, or for that matter, at least my Ubuntu workstation still prints.&nbsp; I have
 a 10 year old Windows xp computer that I have hooked up directly to the printer so I sneaker net the files over to pdf and print them.&nbsp; How low can we.</p>

    <title>WinXP stuck on splash &#40;logo&#41; screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cookymonzta  say:</h3>
<h2>            WinXP stuck on splash &#40;logo&#41; screen</h2>
                    I just recently rebuilt my machine with a new motherboard, new RAM and hybrid hard drives.&nbsp; With the exception of failing to install an AHCI driver (which forced me to replace my motherboard), I had little trouble installing Windows XP Pro the second time.<br />
<br />
There is one problem, and I'm not sure how major or minor it is.&nbsp; On relatively infrequent occasions, when booting to XP, the boot sequence reaches the splash screen (the Windows XP Pro logo screen with the side-scrolling blue bar), and stops there.&nbsp; I've noticed
 that, on some occasions, whenever I perform a Windows Update, the next reboot stops at the logo screen, and I have to go to Safe Mode (which has not yet failed me) to perform a disk check.<br />
<br />
Is there a possibility that, on some occasions, in accessing the programs or files necessary for a clean boot, the Windows boot sequence misses the program or file required to take the user from the logo screen to the interface screen itself?&nbsp; And by any chance
 would you know which file that is, and if it can be replaced without corrupting the whole boot process completely?&nbsp; Or perhaps there could be something in the MBR that doesn't belong there?&nbsp; Or better yet, could there be an update program that could cause
 this problem?<br />

            My suspicion is that, in one or more instances, a newly-installed program requiring a reboot might be causing a boot program to go offline momentarily, just enough for the boot process to skip that program and leave Windows XP stuck at the logo screen.&nbsp;
 The programs installed via Windows Update are not affected, and neither is Safe Mode, which I use to run a disk check if and whenever I get a logo screen freeze.<br />

<p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting&nbsp;my post: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When (exact date, preferably) did you do the clean install of WinXP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2a. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription </em>(if any) <em>expire?</em>&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2b. After you completed the clean install, how long was the computer connected to the internet before you got your anti-virus application or security suite installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. After you completed the clean install, in what order did you do the following?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Checked for &amp; installed Windows Updates (including Service Packs &amp; IE8);</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Got your anti-virus application or security suite installed;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Restored data backups to the HDD;&nbsp;or...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Downloaded necessary drivers for the new hardware?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it and if so, did you use the set of discs that came with the computer-in-question to do the clean install of WinXP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Open <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> &amp; make sure the <strong>Show Updates</strong> box at the top is checked (and leave it checked); then select the
<strong>Name</strong> option in the <strong>Sort by</strong> box on the right. Now scroll down &amp; tell me if ALL of the following updates are listed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows XP</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If IE8 is installed,&nbsp;one (1)&nbsp;will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 8</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7a.&nbsp;Assuming Java is installed, is Java&nbsp;Version 7 Update&nbsp;10 (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING&nbsp;INTERNET EXPLORER&nbsp;(<em>ONLY!</em>) =&gt;&nbsp;<a href="http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp</a></p>

            Sorry I'm late.&nbsp; I've been running several checks to see if I'm clear of anything that might cause Windows XP to stop at the logo screen upon boot or reboot.&nbsp; I think one of my disk check routines may have cleaned up whatever was causing the problem at
 the beginning of the update process, which I started on 12/28.&nbsp; I've had well over 2 dozen reboots since installation, and only 4 times it has frozen at the logo screen, the last one on Sunday 12/30.<br />
<br />
But just in case it reoccurs, here is the information you requested:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; My (latest) clean install of XP was midnight on Christmas.&nbsp; The last freeze at the logo screen was 12/30.<br />
<br />
2a.&nbsp; No antivirus software other than Microsoft Security Essentials installed.<br />
<br />
2b.&nbsp; I didn't reach the point of installing Security Essentials until 12/30.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; I installed all updates that came the sooner I connected to the Web.&nbsp; Then I installed Microsoft Update, along with more updates, including Security Essentials.&nbsp; I installed hardware drivers for my GeForce GTX 570 card.&nbsp; No backups as of yet.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; No pre-installed software of any kind.&nbsp; I built my machine myself.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp; Every file you have listed is accounted for, <b>EXCEPT KB2731847.</b>&nbsp; That one has not yet been downloaded.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp; I have no other browsers installed as of 1/1.<br />
<br />
7a.&nbsp; No Java installed as of 1/1.<br />
<br />
7b.&nbsp; Adobe Flash Player 11.5.502.135 installed.<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp; I have not done any registry cleanup since installing WinXP.<br />
<br />
As I said, I have not had a hangup at the Windows XP logo screen since my flurry of updates on 12/30.&nbsp; So far, the boot process is working normally.<br />

            1.&nbsp; I think I was downloading updates for 2 hours before MS Security Essentials came.<br />
2.&nbsp; IE8 was offered before Security Essentials.<br />
3.&nbsp; Microsoft Update offered it along with other supplementary software..&nbsp; I downloaded Silverlight and the Bing Bar before MSE.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; All the files you mentioned were installed on 12/30, before MSE.&nbsp; As I said before, so far, everything is normal.&nbsp; Has someone else had this kind of problem, for which a Windows Update file (KBXXXXXXX), or the
<i>absence</i> of one, was the culprit?<br />

            <p>Let me be brief.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A computer can&nbsp;become infected within <em>seconds</em> of being connected to the internet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After completing the clean install of WinXP&nbsp;at "midnight on Christmas," you <em>
should have</em> gotten your anti-virus application (MSE or otherwise)&nbsp;installed&nbsp;<em>within minutes</em> of first connecting the computer to the internet. Yes, before installing any Windows Updates and/or IE8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you didn't do so,&nbsp;you may be&nbsp;seeing the effects of an ongoing&nbsp;infection of some kind. Furthermore,&nbsp;MSE&nbsp;may not have&nbsp;installed properly&nbsp;and therefore&nbsp;it&nbsp;may not be&nbsp;<em>working</em> properly either. See...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Can I install Microsoft Security Essentials [or any other anti-virus/anti-spyware application] to clean up my already-infected computer?<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please bookmark this thread (i.e., add it to your IE Favorites). Since you haven't "had a hangup at the Windows XP logo screen since [the] flurry of updates on 12/30," we'll leave well enough alone for now. But if you run into
<em>any</em> more problems - Windows Update-related or otherwise, reply to this thread for further assistance.</p>

            If you are having to consistently run check disk to get the computer to boot, you may be experiencing problems due to an advanced format hard drive. &nbsp;To know for sure, I would need to know the exact model of your hard drive.

            I only had to run a check 4 times for this situation.&nbsp; Now the WinXP logo screen runs normally and proceeds straight to the WinXP desktop.&nbsp; If there
<i>was</i> a bug that was causing the problem in the first place, I imagine it was found and eliminated by either MSE or a program that was part of a long series of Security Updates that was presented and installed
<i>before</i> MSE.<br />
<br />
Bear:&nbsp; You have a point regarding installing MSE as one of the <i>very first</i> programs to install, but given my past experience with Windows (not necessarily on this build), I always considered it safer to install everything in the order of the series in
 which it was given.&nbsp; When you first connect to the Web in XP, a flurry of updates are presented, and I install them first, until no more are presented and I have to open the Web browser for the first time to install Microsoft Update to get more (including
 MSE).<br />
<br />
Then again, as Nate suggested, it may have something to do with the fact that I have WinXP on a hybrid drive; namely, a 500GB Seagate Momentus XT with 4GB SSD space.&nbsp; Here is a segment from the user's guide:<br />
<i><br />
"2.2.2 Solid State Hybrid feature <br />
The Solid State Hybrid feature utilizes the addition of NAND Flash memory to enhance the performance of the drive. Short random accesses to the NAND Flash are faster than disc accesses due to the elimination of seek and rotational latencies and therefore it
 is used to store more frequently accessed data. The Momentus XT uses a proprietary algorithm which monitors drive activity and determines the optimum data to maintain in the NAND Flash for peak responsiveness. The Solid State Hybrid feature is self contained
 in the drive firmware and functions independent of the host hardware or operating system. There are no special host system requirements. Momentus XT can be installed in any standard SATA environment and will automatically optimize."<br />
<br />
</i>Someone at TweakTown told me it would take 2 weeks for the hard drive algorithm to fully optimize.&nbsp; It may have taken only a day and a half.&nbsp; I didn't use my machine for 3 days after I installed XP, but when I started the update process, the boot sequence
 was as slow as I would expect from any typical hard drive.&nbsp; Now it is quite fast, and I notice the speed even more on Windows 7.&nbsp; Quite probably, it was during the course of the optimization process that on 4 occasions the boot process froze at the Windows
 XP boot logo.&nbsp; I don't have that problem now.<br />

            <blockquote>Bear:&nbsp; You have a point regarding installing MSE as one of the
<i>very first</i> programs to install, but given my past experience with Windows (not necessarily on this build), I always considered it safer to install everything in the order of the series in which it was given.&nbsp; When you first connect to the Web in XP,
 a flurry of updates are presented, and I install them first, until no more are presented and I have to open the Web browser for the first time to install Microsoft Update to get more (including MSE).<br />
</blockquote>
<p>While MSE&nbsp;may be offered as an Optional update via Windows Update, it's usually too late for MSE to "come to the rescue."&nbsp;Best to get MSE (or another AV app of your choice) installed within
<em>minutes </em>of first connecting the computer to the internet (i.e., before Automatic Updates "kicks into gear" and offers/installs
<em>any </em>updates.</p>

    <title>No setting to hide what game you are playing..... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No setting to hide what game you are playing.....</h2>
                    

<p>I'm currently using Games for Windows Live on the PC for games like Microsoft Flight and Age of Empires Online. I don't see an option anywhere to hide the game you are playing. The only setting that will hide what game you are playing is: Online Status,
 but it makes you appear offline. I want to appear online, but hide what game I'm currently playing. I feel it violates my privacy have what game I am playing showing as well as game history and what not. If there is not such an option would windows Live consider
 adding this option for privacy.</p>
<p>Thanks. </p>

<p>As I said the only way to accomplish what you want to do is to block your Online Status.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Currently there is no way to appear online and block what what you are playing. It is either all blocked or all showing.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I'm sorry that the answer isn't what you want but it is the only answer we can give. It's not as if we are hiding the way to do it, it doesn't exist because Microsoft haven't made that an option.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Is setting it to friends only not an option? That would block strangers from seeing you are online and what you are playing but the folk on your friends list could still do both. Surely you wouldn't mind your friends seeing what you are playing?</p>

<p>I would like to appear offline and I know that I can do this by setting "Online Status" to "Blocked". &nbsp;However, my friends can also see my game history and tell that I was online playing a game 5 minutes ago. &nbsp;This kinda defeats the purpose of "appearing"
 offline. &nbsp;I know I can set the "Game History" to be blocked but I don't want to do that all the time. &nbsp;I just want to truly "appear" offline sometimes as in completely not have any trace of me being on xbox live that my friends can see. &nbsp;Is this possible?</p>

<p>No, it's not possible. You have 2 combined options, one of which is appearing offline and two blocking games. This is not possible otherwise.<br />
<br />
In the future if you need help in any other topic just make a new forum post, bringing up old posts that have already been answered clutters the forums and sends e-mails to people about forum replies that are already answered.<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues with Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to try to boot the computer in safe mode and check, Please refer to the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or
 an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may
 temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the
 computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a
<strong>SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></span></span></p>

            <p>This is usually a temporary server fault (as indicated by <em>internal error</em>). Make sure your anti-virus isn't scanning mail - this can contribute to this kind of fault. If it doesn't come right within a few hours, contact AtlanticBB.</p>

            <span>Hi,<strong><br />
<br />
</strong></span><span>I'll be happy to help you with your issue that you are receiving error when&nbsp;sending emails&nbsp;on Windows Live Mail. It is possible that your receiving the error
 due to&nbsp;two (2)&nbsp;causes:<br />
<br />
1.Incorrect POP settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) – check with provider if it is required or not<br />
2.Firewall blocking ports (usually port 25) – could be 3rd party since Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to do so.<br />
<br />
For us to troubleshoot your issue, I suggest you to reconfigure your account. To do this you may refer to this

 the steps.<br />
<br />
For firewall issue you may disable the security software/ firewall to isolate the issue.&nbsp;Kindly go&nbsp;to this

    <title>Minimum programs required for Windows 10 OS to function - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rcortz1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minimum programs required for Windows 10 OS to function</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to configure a Software Restriction Policy in a user's GPO to "lock-down" a Windows 10 machine. The device will only run the programs essential to running the OS. I will then only allow the programs the end user needs to perform their tasks. So
 far I have identified the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>explorer.exe</p>
<p>csrss.exe</p>
<p>dwm.exe</p>
<p>rdclip.exe</p>
<p>taskhostw.exe</p>
<p>TSTheme.exe</p>
<p>userinit.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any I have missed or have included that shouldn't be there. I implemented the SRP and rebooted the test machine. It comes up but with a flickering desktop. Graphics issue possibly?? Any assistance would be appreciated. Regards.</p>

            Hello RCortz1, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />I suggest you follow the instructions down below.
<br />
<br />
<br />Start your PC in safe mode, then right-click the Start button and select Device Manager.
<br />Expand the Display adapters section, right-click the listed adapter, then select Uninstall device. Select the Delete the driver software for this device check box, then select Uninstall and restart your PC.
<br />After your PC restarts, press the Windows logo key  + I on your keyboard to open Settings. If that doesn't work, select the Start button and then select Settings.
<br />From Settings, select Update &amp; security  &gt; Windows Update  &gt; Check for updates

<h2>            Windows 7 suddenly sounds extremely muffled, soft and echo-ey</h2>
                    Hi !
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The sounds from my desktop suddenly sounds extremely muffeld (as if i am hearing the sounds through a tunnel). I am not sure what triggered it. It was working fine the day before. The problem started when i booted my com in the morning.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tested the sound using my USB headset and also 3.5mm earphones. Both of it sounds muffled, which leads me to believe its not a driver issue (since both devices use different drivers). Nevertheless i have reinstalled drivers for both devices (Realtek
 and Razer Megalodon).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have checked the "playback devices" for any abnormalities but could not find any (enhancements all disabled etc). I have disabled all "recording devices" just to make sure that wasn't the cause of the problem. I have tried running the windows troubleshooter
 for "playing audio" but it could not find anything wrong.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't figure out whats wrong! Please help!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

will be difficult to say what exactly is issue<br />
<br />
As it was working fine day before,Might be some win update causing the issue<br />
Try with system restore to 1 day before <br />

            Hi Santanu Nayak,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Forgot to mention that I already checked that. I suspected the same. The latest windows update was installed on Jan 16 which rules that out of the cause.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'll try system restore anyways. I wonder when the last restore point is..</div>
<div><br />
<div>Will update once done...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again</div>

            Hi DeepanE<br />
<br />
Using the Action Center looking in the maintenance and check for solutions there if found a problem with the sound drivers<u>
</u>and click for solution and it will sent you to the correct place to download the correct driver. I hope this helps out.<br />
<br />
OR <br />
<br />
Go to Control Panel.<br />
Open Sound.<br />
Click Speakers, and then Properties (at the lower right corner for my computer).<br />
At the top, click the Enhancements tab.<br />
There will be a window in the tab, with options like "Environment", "Voice Cancellation", "Pitch Shift", etc...<br />
If "Voice Cancellation" is checked, uncheck it.<br />

            Hi Santanu Nayak,
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately the system restore was unsuccessful. The system was restored to 4 Feb when the audio was still working fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Action Center does not detect a problem with the sound drivers as well. And i don't think its the drivers man. Because, my USB headset doesn't use the onboard realtek drivers but is also affected. It has to be a setting somewhere in windows.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, all the enhancements have been unchecked and also restored to defaults. Still the same.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Looks like i &nbsp;might have to do a reformat :-/</div>

            Check the Realtek Sound applet in control panel. Look for equalizer settings possibly with presets. Your description sound a little like the Auditorium or Concert Hall preset.

<h2>            Cheiro de queimado&#40;ME AJUDEM POR FAVOR&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Bem uns dias atras eu cheguei da escola e liguei o xbox e deixei meu controle carregando e fui dormir 1 da tarde e acordei umas 8 da noite, ai senti um cheiro de queimado e fui verificar daonde vinha aquele cheiro.... primeiramente pensei que fosse do frigobar
 do meu quarto mas não era, depois pensei q fosse o transformador, pois é bem velho.... Não descobri. Passaram algumas semanas vi na internet um assunto sobre ventilação e como evitar 3RL no xbox slim, e o meu ficava na vertical. Me recomendaram colocar na
 horizontal. Até ai blz, mas eu quando fui virar o xbox percebi um cheiro de queimado e quando cheirei mais de perto na saida de ar do cooler lá estava o cheiro de queimado q eu havia sentido anteriromente.E estou com medo de que aconteça algo com meu xbox.
 Pois a garantia dele acabou e ja faz 1 ano que comprei,nunca tinha acontecido algo parecido comigo, ja cheguei a deixar-lo mais de 12 horas ligado direto e nunca aconteceu nada assim.Sempre eu ligava ele e deixava ligado e o lugar é bem ventilado além de ter
 o ar condicionado ligado direto o quarto fica até frio.</p>
<p>Bem é isso se puder me ajudar agradeço, estou com mto medo de que aconteceça algo ao meu xbox, ele é &nbsp;um Arcade 4gb com kinect fabricado no brasil em 2012.</p>
<p>Eu estava jogando Forza Horizon quando vi esse cheiro de queimado que não sai dele.</p>

<p>cheiro de queimado as veses pode ser um circuito interno.</p>
<p>Má ventilação do seu VG.</p>
<p>Dica: coloque seu VG num lugar onde tenha 100% ventilação. Se poder colocar ele no chão e verificar este cheiro. Observe bem. Vê se não é a fonte também, pode ser que ela tenha essa cheiro de queimado. E mais, se você tiver um dindin, manda ele pra limpar
 as peças por dentro que é muito importante devido ao pó.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If you find that offline messaging isn't available in your Skype for Business client, it might be because:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>It's coming soon</span></strong><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The feature will be rolling out to your organization in an upcoming Office update for Skype for Business 2016 Click-to-Run client. Try installing Office 2016 from the portal.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>It hasn't been enabled yet</span></strong><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The offline messaging feature depends on the EnableIMAutoArchiving property to be set to True. If the setting is set to False, offline messaging will not be enabled. Contact your workplace
 technical support team for assistance, and send them a link to the admin help topic<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)"><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Turn-on-or-off-Offline-IM-for-admins-8967a77f-caa2-4680-aa22-8faa32c716e4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 120, 215, 1)">Turn

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, I have followed the steps for the enabling and it doesn't appear to be working, although the missed conversations are not appearing in the outlook client either now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will the feature only work with the 2016 Click to run client ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Monique</p>
<p>
</p><p>The change was to try and make the offline messages working but since this does not appear to work in the version of **** then will have to make the amendments to change back to the default **** 15 of the the box setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outlook and **** are downloaded from the portal, until the changes for the offline messages were made all the **** conversions were in the conversation history. I don't have a missed conversation folder in the conversation history. We are pure online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the replies, I'm not going to be working on this project for another week so I will be back in touch at the end of &nbsp;next week for any replies you may send.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            How do I get Documents Library to display files first, then folders</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hi - - in my My Documents folder, which is stored on a network drive in an adjoining room, I have a few thousand files, which I organize by date, followed by a couple hundred
 subfolders.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Obviously, I need to have the most recent files at the top, so I can access the documents I’m currently working on. The folders need to go at the bottom. This has worked
 fine in XP for many years.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>But in Windows 7 I can’t seem to get it to arrange things normally, ie with the files at the top and the folders at the bottom. No matter what I do, it displays the folders
 first.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Obviously I’m missing something, because I’m sure most people arrange their My Documents this way and few people want their folders appearing first. But I can’t seem to
 find the settings - - they work in all other (ie non-library) folders, but not here.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Any advice would be appreciated.</span></p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Make sure the Library is optimized for Documents (right click/Properties/Optimize settings).</p>
<p>Set the Arrange By menu to Modified. Set the View menu to Details.</p>
<p>This should show the files first by modified date and time.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Does Windows 7 have it&#39;s own encryption options for single files&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Just that, does Windows 7 have it's own encryption options for single files?<br />
<br />
I would like to encrypt specific files and not the entire drive and I prefer using Windows own options for this if Windows 7 has these options?<br />
<br />
Can anyone help em with this; where and how in Windows 7 I can do this. If Windows 7 doesn't offer any options like this then what is the next best thing to encrypt specific files? Thanks.<br />
<br />

            <p>How do you suppose that happened? &nbsp;Have you been doing some file compressing?</p>
<p>Hopefully your system has a working CD/DVD drive.</p>
<p>You can uncompress the ntldr file (or remove the compressed attribute) using a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD you make.</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come a store bought system. &nbsp;If&nbsp;you are not sure what kind of bootable CD you have, make a bootable XP Recovery Console CD&nbsp;and &nbsp;be sure.</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use this free and easy program to create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>RC allows basic file commands - copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>Change to the C:\ directory and then remove the "compressed" attribute from the C:\ntldr file as follows:</p>
<p>At the C:\WINDOWS prompt enter the following commands:</p>
<p><strong>cd \</strong></p>
<p><strong>attrib -c ntldr</strong></p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>
<p>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will&nbsp;not be present.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth Mouse keeps disconnecting</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got Microsoft Mobile 3600 Mouse last year and it worked flawlessly for a year until last month. It was freezing randomly so I went back to guarantee and they changed the mouse with a new one. But still, I have the same problems. So I went back to the internet
 for answers and tried changing device manager/power management settings, task manager/comp settings and installing drivers from Microsoft's own website but nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The driver of Microsoft says that no mouse detected when mouse freezes (actually laptops own work normally) so I think the problem is about Bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Is anyone have different solution for it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My drivers are up to date.</p>
