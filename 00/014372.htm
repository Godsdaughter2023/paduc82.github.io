<h2>            N81-3 RM223 without sd card slot&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>my brother bought a Nokia N81 on ebay. Today, it arrived and ,while configurating it, we wanted to insert the micro sd (2Gb) that came with it. But there is no microSD-card slot at the side of the phone. I checked the internal memory to make sure it is not
 the 8Gb model, it is not the 8Gb model. We are wondering how this can be possible since the phone is new. Or did Nokia "just" put the wrong cover on it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

<p>Have you considered the other option, that it may actually be a counterfeit model?&nbsp; At the moment ebay is full of counterfeits that they don't even remove when you report them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connect the phone to a PC using the supplied USB cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you see "web cam" or "com port" listed on the phones screen then it is a counterfeit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it turns out to be genuine then maybe the seller has modified it and put the wrong casing on it?</p>

<p>Thanks for your answer. It is genuine, I can choose what to do on the phone but when I select to transfer files it says it can't because there is no card inserted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already contacted the seller, I hope he knows what happened..&nbsp;</p>

<p>this is indeed a genuine N81 with the microSD expandability, and not the N81 8GB (which is RM-179). i updated the firmware on a friend's N81 last year, so from the photos it is indeed genuine. the product code also seems to match up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as far as i remember, there must be a microSD card slot on the left margin of the phone. i certainly know that the memory card is hot-swappable, however even if i was completely wrong and there was a microSD slot under the battery, that wouldn't be hot-swappable.
 so it looks like your phone is a 8GB version according to the pictures you've posted, as there is no microSD card slot on the left side. if it was the 8GB version, it would have 7600MB or so available in the free memory screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i'm even confused myself, so my best advice would be to take your phone to your local Nokia Care Centre and ask them about it. it definitely seems that you have a microSD model that seems like it is, but doesn't have the microSD card slot. actually, i just
 saw and the microSD card slot should be underneath the speaker on the left side of the phone. possibly someone ripped you off and ripped the 8gb memory out, slapped some stickers on to show its a 2gb model. that's all i can think of, no matter how absurd that
 sounds.</p>

<p>I was looking at the images posted, and I think you stated that the Memory Used is 7905MB and Memory Available is 17MB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So doesn't that imply that it is an 8G model, and the memory is full?</p>

            the photos show it is 7905KB, not 7905MB. the 8GB model is RM-179, and the normal microSD-slot model is RM-223.&nbsp;the issue arises is that though it appears very much so that his model is supposed to be and points to the microSD model, there is no microSD
 slot or markings on the left side.

<p>I agree with adrianhughes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the most logical reason is that the seller has sold you a phone with the wrong shell on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most likely reason for this is that at some stage of it's life it has been badly damaged, then repaired with the wrong casing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only options are to contact the seller and request a refund, or to get the correct part fitted to it.&nbsp; A nokia care point could source and fit the part but it will be expensive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We can't discuss opening the phone up or sourcing the parts from elsewhere on this forum.</p>

<p>Thanks for your replies guys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there is only one possibility left, the phone has the wrong casing. A reperation isn't very likely since the phone is still new, and there weren't any traces of usage. I asked the seller to send me another N81 (he has a few other on eBay) and I send this
 one back to him. We'll see...&nbsp;</p>

<p>If I was you I would seek a full refund from that seller.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chances of it being new are close to zero.&nbsp; What he/she is doing is buying up old phones, possibly damaged, ex demo or reconditioned then putting a new shell on them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sneaky tricks like this are common on ebay and you will find that these "new" phones do not have a valid warranty.</p>

<h2>            word 2013 opening compatibility mode with different file name</h2>
                    When I open Word 2013, with an older file format (2010, 2007,ect.) the file name will show up as "Wd000001" for example in compatibility mode. Whenever I convert the file or resave it to the newer version, it will still open with the file name Wd000002
 or something similar. The older versions used to open in compatibility mode, but would keep the same file names. Any ideas how to fix this? I just want it to keep the same file location and name.

            Where do you see these filenames? It is normal for Word to create temporary files when you are working with a document; to hide these in Windows Explorer/Computer and on the desktop, make sure Windows is set to hide hidden files and folders (in Folder
 Options).

            It will actually show up in the title area on top of the screen (See below). The title name should be "Document X" and it shows up with the Wd0000010.<br />

            Thanks for the response Guruprasad. Unfortunately this did not help. I did just realize this only happens when I try to open a file from a collaborative network like Dropbox. It seems to create a document in the temporary files folder.

OK, this often happens&nbsp;when downloading a file. Instead of opening the Word document directly from the link, download it and save it to your documents folder before you start reading or editing.

            <p>I am adding this alternate solution for any future readers of this posting. &nbsp;I had the same problem develop on my computer after modifying Add-Ins to word. &nbsp;For some reason, this process disassociates Word with the .docx file type for auto-open. &nbsp;So, when
 clicking on the file to be opened through explorer, a program called Microsoft XML opens instead. &nbsp;Then, the symptoms above occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this happens, then simply right click on a file through explorer and re-associate Word as the default program to open any .docx file with. &nbsp;Problem solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t connect my offline profile to Xbox Live - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect my offline profile to Xbox Live</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I've been trying to connect my offline Xbox 360 profile to Xbox Live for a very long time. It's my brother's console so that's why I didn't connect it at the very beginning. I have over 6000 gamerscore that I would not like to lose. I went to the Xbox 360
 support and found the topic about connecting the accounts. I created a Microsoft account like they said to do, and did not connect it to any gamertag. I then followed the next step and signed in to the offline profile I would like to convert on the 360, then
 went to settings. But the 'profile' button was greyed out and would not let me click on it. I called support two months ago and asked for their help connecting my offline profile but they didn't tell me about those steps, and when they couldn't connect me
 and had no answers they hung up on me. Our 360 is 6 years old and my brother recently bought an Xbox One to prepare for the inevitable 'red ring of death'. I don't want to lose all of my progress on the 360, and want to be able to switch my profile over to
 the Xbox One. Could someone please help me? I'm very frustrated and desperate. Thank you! (By the way, I am aware that you can't convert child accounts, I'm not a minor) Also, I know there is no category for Xbox Live on here and you're probably supposed to
 do it on their website, but they keep asking me to make an Xbox profile first, and that defeats the purpose of what I'm trying to do.</p>

    <title>Exchange Online &#47; Distribution Group member count discrepancy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michalnovak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Exchange Online &#47; Distribution Group member count discrepancy</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>We have an E4 plan and using Directory Synchronization services (AAD Connect version 1.0.8667) . I am seeing an interesting discrepancy and I would like an explanation/possible fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the local AD we have a Universal Distribution Group with 4163 members. This group is synced to O365 without any errors, and when I list member count through Powershell in Azure AD , I get correct sum of 4163 members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>HOWEVER, the Admin center shows this group as having only 1013 members. Also, Exchange Online PS command</p>

<p>(Get-DistributionGroupMember "All Users Group" -resultsize unlimited).count</p>
<p>Returns 1013 members.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seems to me that Exchange sees different number of users for some unknown reason. I would like to ask what is causing this and how to fix this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi MichalNovak,<br />
<br />
I’m glad to hear the issue is gone now. Thanks for your sharing.<br />
<br />
The root cause should be the internal synchronization between Office 365 Azure AD and Exchange Online I had mentioned above. Generally, it can synchronize very quickly, but sometimes delay will occur too. By re-synchronizing the group, you actually triggered
 an entirely new internal synchronization, and this time it just worked fine.<br />
<br />
Please always feel free to post new threads in our community forum if you encounter any question or issue when using Office 365.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Allen<br />
<br />

<p>hi,</p>
<p>i’m using office 365 business sharepoint online.</p>
<p>i’ve set up an employee directory on sharepoint and i’m using the ready-made template peopleresults.aspx page in the search site.</p>
<p>i’m filtering in the ‘people search core results’ web part using contentclass=spspeople to populate the directory.</p>
<p>everything works fine except that as well as the expected real users, there are some 'non-real' users – see screenshot below.</p>
<p>how do i filter out the non-real users?</p>
<p>i’ve read the post linked below which replicates my error (see screenshot near end of part 2), but it doesn't seem to include a solution

<h2>            Will Office be updated to support high-DPI displays&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made the switch to Surface Pro 4 from iPad Pro 12.9 in December, and so far it's been a really great experience. Without sacrificing portability I have gained much by way of processing power and general usability. My one gripe is that apps look terrible
 when scaled. In most cases, this does not bother me, but in the apps I use every day it works on my nerves. What's even more frustrating is that these are Microsoft apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question: Will Office and One Note 2016 (and beyond) be updated to properly scale on high-DPI displays?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not think employing a workaround like disabling scaling is an acceptable solution at all since the UI elements are all impossible to navigate. Nor do I feel that running at anything less than native resolution is acceptable either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Hugo</p>

            <p>Good question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there are a couple of issues with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, the problem is not "Office" being updated. Each program IN the "Office" bundle is developed by SEPARATE TEAMS!&nbsp; Each program uses different underlying display technology.&nbsp; So in part the question becomes when will EACH of the "Office" programs be
 updated for high-dpi display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, although this is an excellent question, you are extremely unlikely to get an answer from MS about it. They just don't do that. First they ignore the issue (hoping it will magically go away).&nbsp; Then when they eventually start working on it they rarely
 tell outsiders what is being done. Essentially never in this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, this has already been identified as an issue in several questions. For example there are known issues in Excel and PowerPoint with screen resolutions beyond HD (1080x1900).&nbsp; Some have been worked on, but some still remain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fourth, part of the problem is with Windoze / Intel built in video support / add on Video Cards / and drivers for those addon Video cards&nbsp; ... For example, I've had issues with my external 4K monitor on my brand new i7 laptop since day one. When I first
 bought it a year ago I had 3 errors identified as video problems and one video BSOD!&nbsp; Some of them went away when eventually the November 2015 update and later the August 2016 updates were applied.&nbsp; But it appears that the minor December 2016 Windows updates
 have introduced a new one.&nbsp; Since December only my 4K monitor goes black for a couple of seconds then restarts. Trying to figure out exactly who in the mix is causing problems can get very tricky!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fifth, this has become the 'wrong' place to ask the question. Few MS developers participate in this forum (some may lurk, but essentially never reply here).&nbsp; Instead, you should copy your original question from above and post it to the "appropriate" UserVoice
 forum.&nbsp; UserVoice is a site run by some other company that allows "users" to create subsites to voice their opinions.&nbsp; Various developer units in MS have set up 5-6 dozen different sites for specific topics. &nbsp; Users like us can post to the forum making "feature
 change requests" and "bug reports". Although I've said this is not an "Office" issue, the Office forum may be the place to ask the question/make the suggestion:</p>

<p><span>You can use the Office or Windows 10 "feedback" (*c*r*)applets but then your suggestions just fall into a black hole. You get no feedback from MS about your feedback.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A better place to submit this type of feedback the "UserVoice" forum. You can submit suggestions like this to the forum either by "voting" and commenting on a similar existing suggestion or by creating
 a new suggestion for others to vote and comment on.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>It is also a good idea to provide cross posted links.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Put a link back to this answers.com posting on UserVoice, and add a reply here with a link to your specific posting on UserVoice.

<p><span>Go to UserVoice, either through specific links I’ve provided below or create your own suggestions there. That is where MS is looking specifically for this type of user feedback to bring them back to reality
 from what-ever lala-land they are working in when they make these "<em>improvements</em>".&nbsp; Comments (and votes) like these in UserVoice helped to convince MS to roll back the "phat QAT" buttons in 2016
</span><span>and to at least partially undo the 2016 changes to the way the Pen input works</span><span>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Please do copy the comments you've made here and paste them into comments in UserVoice. Also include a link to this question. If you do make a suggestion,
<strong>copy the link to the UserVoice suggestion and post it back on this question so other people with the same problem can vote for it and comment on it.</strong> (You’ll get faster action that way.) Please get all of your friends and co-workers who use
 Office to vote for your issue!</span></p>

<p><span>This blog has a picture to show MS really is looking at UserVoice sites:</span></p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>Good question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there are a couple of issues with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, the problem is not "Office" being updated. Each program IN the "Office" bundle is developed by SEPARATE TEAMS!&nbsp; Each program uses different underlying display technology.&nbsp; So in part the question becomes when will EACH of the "Office" programs be
 updated for high-dpi display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, although this is an excellent question, you are extremely unlikely to get an answer from MS about it. They just don't do that. First they ignore the issue (hoping it will magically go away).&nbsp; Then when they eventually start working on it they rarely
 tell outsiders what is being done. Essentially never in this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, this has already been identified as an issue in several questions. For example there are known issues in Excel and PowerPoint with screen resolutions beyond HD (1080x1900).&nbsp; Some have been worked on, but some still remain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fourth, part of the problem is with Windoze / Intel built in video support / add on Video Cards / and drivers for those addon Video cards&nbsp; ... For example, I've had issues with my external 4K monitor on my brand new i7 laptop since day one. When I first
 bought it a year ago I had 3 errors identified as video problems and one video BSOD!&nbsp; Some of them went away when eventually the November 2015 update and later the August 2016 updates were applied.&nbsp; But it appears that the minor December 2016 Windows updates
 have introduced a new one.&nbsp; Since December only my 4K monitor goes black for a couple of seconds then restarts. Trying to figure out exactly who in the mix is causing problems can get very tricky!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fifth, this has become the 'wrong' place to ask the question. Few MS developers participate in this forum (some may lurk, but essentially never reply here).&nbsp; Instead, you should copy your original question from above and post it to the "appropriate" UserVoice
 forum.&nbsp; UserVoice is a site run by some other company that allows "users" to create subsites to voice their opinions.&nbsp; Various developer units in MS have set up 5-6 dozen different sites for specific topics. &nbsp; Users like us can post to the forum making "feature
 change requests" and "bug reports". Although I've said this is not an "Office" issue, the Office forum may be the place to ask the question/make the suggestion:</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>A better place to submit this type of feedback the "UserVoice" forum. You can submit suggestions like this to the forum either by "voting" and commenting on a similar existing suggestion or by creating a new suggestion for others to vote and comment

<p>
</p><p><span>Go to UserVoice, either through specific links I’ve provided below or create your own suggestions there. That is where MS is looking specifically for this type of user feedback to bring them back to reality from what-ever lala-land they are working
 in when they make these "<em>improvements</em>".&nbsp; Comments (and votes) like these in UserVoice helped to convince MS to roll back the "phat QAT" buttons in 2016
</span><span>and to at least partially undo the 2016 changes to the way the Pen input works</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please do copy the comments you've made here and paste them into comments in UserVoice. Also include a link to this question. If you do make a suggestion,
<strong>copy the link to the UserVoice suggestion and post it back on this question so other people with the same problem can vote for it and comment on it.</strong> (You’ll get faster action that way.) Please get all of your friends and co-workers who use

    <title>N800 application catalogue not updating - skype not installing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            N800 application catalogue not updating - skype not installing</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I have an n800. Installed latest firmware update. to install skype, the application manager tries to update the application catalogue but it hangs with a message "downloading 1kb", which it never does. So the catalogue is empty and there are no apps to download.<br />
<br />
I had this problem before the software update, but it didn't really matter because i didn't really use other apps.<br />
<br />
I checked the catalogue addresses and they seem fine, the same as the ones posted on maemo.<br />
<br />
Help please.<br />
<br />

            I have exactly the same problem: updated my N800 in order to install Skype, but can't do it. Switching connections (which was suggested as a solution here above) does not help. A bug? Will the Nokia people do something about this?

            How did you update the software, using the Windows update wizard or a Linux system? Did you have any other custom software installed before doing the update?<br />
<br />
I only got my N800 last Thursday and did the software update on a "clean" system as soon as the battery had charged. I used the Windows update method and didn't have any trouble at all.<br />
<br />
Good luck.

            That's very interesting. Does that mean that you had not done the OS2008 update before downloading Skype?<br />
The instructions I used, without success, were for the upgraded OS.<br />
<br />
Has anyone done it this way?<br />

<h2>            Internet explorer 11 very slow - but only for some users</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 7 installation which I have set up with 3 users - me, my wife and my son.&nbsp; When I log on I get normal service in terms of Internet response and email usage etc.&nbsp; However when my wife or my son log on to their accounts, Internet Explorer
 is dreadfully slow - 30 second response times.&nbsp; It's the same IE 11.0 that we're using so why am I enjoying normal virtually instant responses and they are having to wait 1/2 a minute to get a response?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking of deleting their accounts and re-creating them again but it may be something simple that I need to tweak so I thought I'd ask here first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks and regards</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Adrian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you make any significant hardware or software changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Do the other user accounts have <strong><em>administrative privileges </em></strong>too?</li><li>Do you get any error message while accessing Internet in the other user accounts? If YES, what is the complete and exact error message?</li></ol>
<p>I understand that the internet explorer is slow in response when accessed in different user accounts. So, to diagnose this issue, I would have you try the following methods and check if the issue is reproduced.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try to run the Internet Explorer with administrative privileges.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Right-click the&nbsp;<strong><span>Internet Explorer</span></strong>&nbsp;shortcut.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b.&nbsp;Click <strong><span>Run as administrator</span></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Refer to:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows7/how-do-i-run-an-application-once-with-a-full-administrator-access-token" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I run an application once with a full administrator access token?</a></span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If method 1 does not help, try method 2.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Set IE as default browser. To do so, try the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;a. Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>Default Programs</strong>, and hit ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;b. Click <strong>Default Programs </strong>in the search results.<br />
&nbsp;c. Click <strong>Set your Default Programs</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;d. Choose <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> from the list.<br />
&nbsp;e. Select Set this program as default, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, try to run the following fixit and check if the Internet Explorer starts responding quickly.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/ie_performance_and_safety/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix Internet Explorer issues to make IE fast, safe and stable</a></strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Method&nbsp;2 does not help, try Method 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Login to the&nbsp;corresponding user accounts in which the Internet explorer is responding slowly and reset low integrity level on the Low folder.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>All Programs</strong>, and then click
<strong>Accessories</strong>.</li><li>Right-click <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</li><li>Type following command and press ENTER:<br />
<strong>ICACLS&nbsp; "%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Temp\Low"&nbsp; /setintegritylevel&nbsp; (OI)(CI)low</strong></li><li>Restart the computer.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. If the issue still persists, please post back for further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t access my xbox account</h2>
                    I can't access my xbox account. I bought a used xbox one, created my own account and had no problem signing in until about a month ago. I was asked to put in my Microsoft password and after doing so I was asked "finish adding security info" "you haven't
 verified your security info. To finish, enter the code we send you." Well, I found a way around it &nbsp;but now its happen again and for some reason I am not receiving the code I need to access my account it also shows my email is spelled wrong. How do I fix this?

    <title>Excel &#58; Print preview and actual print is different - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jirisuda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel &#58; Print preview and actual print is different</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I create an excel file to print in a half-page form (OS Windows XP, MS Office 2010) so in 1 piece of paper there are 2 set of info. Normally I print all of them, about 20 pages, at once and then cut in half (printer Epson LQ-590). However recently I
 just change my OS to Windows 10 and MS Office 2016 and when I print, the info position in each page vary.&nbsp; So it does not fit in a paper form. I have to print 1 page at a time. It is pretty time consuming and I have to do it twice a month. Print preview look
 perfectly fine. Printer driver is the correct version. I have no idea where to fix.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
We would like to know more about your concern. Please provide the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you already tried updating the drivers?</li><li>What paper size are you using?</li><li>Were there any changes on Excel's printing orientation?</li><li>Were there any changes on print settings? Does it look like the screenshot below?</li></ul>

<p>1. Driver is an updated version.</p>
<p>2. Paper size : Letter fanfold 8 1/2 x 11 in</p>
<p>3. No orientation change</p>
<p>4. No print setting change</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try to test by printing excel table over and over with different version of OS and MS office and the result is not significantly different. So problem may involve printer itself, not software. Thank you for your help.</p>

<h2>            I need to handle a Javascript Out of Memory error from Google Web Toolkit but frankly it should not matter</h2>
                    <p>I have a webapp which should work fine in all browsers,however,&nbsp; the webapp runs out of Javascript Memory. The servlet side has no problems / no errors reported and Firefox 15 has no problems Google Chrome has no problems in production&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 9 Fails with a out of memory error. Everything renders fine for smaller data loads but&nbsp; larger data loads from thr RPC servlet method callls&nbsp; Fail.&nbsp; Google Web Toolkit forums mention Memory leak problems in IE 9 , however no mention of
<strong>Javascript memory configuration tools</strong></p>
<p>Yet this<strong> Internet Explorer Administrator kit&nbsp; IEAK 9&nbsp; </strong>for the latest IE 9 software. So does anyone know if this software tool can change a given</p>
<p>instsllstion of IE9 to include additional memory allocation for Javascript storage within the browser?</p>
<p>Is there a better way to measure or monitor the available space within a Javascript runtime environment?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are the questions I am looking to answer here and any&nbsp; help on this would be great. Are there any patches available to handle such rpc<br />
memory leaks?? </p>
<p>But more understanding of any issues would be good as well. Any good white papers available on this be good!</p>

    <title>How to bring Windows phones to TOP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anamitraburhagohain  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to bring Windows phones to TOP</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;The interface should need a change. The Windows 10 Destop version is being loved by every one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone version need interface change. The FOUR COLOURED START BUTTON should show up in the middle of the phone acting as a Menu button, bringing up the apps installed in the phone. There can be a X button in the bottom of the screen indicating close button
 and a cascade icon for recent apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Start tiles should be the home screen consisting of the main icons like Call Log, Message, Contacts, Email, Edge Browser and the loveable Cortana Assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The icons can have the same background accent with the white bordered icons, but if someone receives a message or call, the icon changes into a colourful icon, it would to nice to see a clean look interface.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The time should be in the middle on top of the Home Screen. Further swiping bottom from the top edge bringing up the Date in the Right corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The notification panel should pop up as we swipe down from the top, the notifications should be stacked in nice rounded boxes nicely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The top main priority is security. In PC version of windows, apps can access the only user defined access like location, camera, microphone, there should be added security to the Mobile Edition, as phone are always there with us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Defender is a plus point to Windows Mobile Edition. No need to install extra antivirus for the phone. All email, files securely safe. Loving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Setting App should be embedded in Windows Mobile Edition, and the display of the icons should be both in grid and list view. The Grid view will be a new look to a mobile OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Lock screen should have always clean interface with Spotlight just like Desktop version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Now the HARDWARE part, the phone screen is flat, the body casing of the older Window phones was like glass lid on a bath tub. The body casing should not be seen when seeing the screen. For reference Samsung Galaxy S9. The back should be
 nicely made, nice camera position, now dual cameras are in the competition. The Start Button can be craved nicely at the bottom. The Start button not always glows, it glows when touched. LED notification sensors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Andriod App are in million and Windows is not far behind. The Clash of Clash alternate WoRLD developed by Joy Bit is only available for Windows which will be a winner if compared side by side. The World game is far interesting having some taste of Age
 of Empire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created a project plan with over 1000 tasks in it. I would like to create a critical path plan for only a few milestones in the plan, to show what critically effects these tasks in particular. Is this possible? Would I need to create a new plan to
 do this?</p>

            <p>Hi Sophia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You totally surprise me. One does not "produce" a critical path, Project calculates it: it calculates the earlist start/finish dates based on predeessors and successors, and also by calculating back from the project finsh (or in this case, from the milestone
 finish) the latest start and finish. Where early and late are equal, the task is critical. Nothing to produce, it just&nbsp;is and will be shown as such in the Gantt Chart. Do your tasks have predecessors and successors?</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for sharing your query on Microsoft Community Forum!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In order to assist you better, please provide information on:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error message when you try to open PDF files?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this happen in both Modern UI Internet Explorer and desktop internet explorer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which version of Adobe reader is installed?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here are few methods you can try out:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: uninstall the Adobe Acrobat Reader and install the latest version.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Follow the link below to download the latest version:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/otherversions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://get.adobe.com/reader/otherversions/</a></span></p>
<p><span>Also, if you have multiple Adobe Readers installed, uninstall them all then install the latest version.</span></p>
<p><span>Adobe doesn't support multiple versions of Reader or Acrobat on the same computer. Multiple versions simultaneously installed can lead to software conflicts and errors.
 Uninstall all versions of Reader or Acrobat and then reinstall only one version of the product.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: steps to uninstall the IE from Programs and Features:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b><b><span>Press “Windows key + C”.</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b><span>Type in
<b>Programs and features</b> in the search box.</span></p>
<p>
<b><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b><span>Click on Programs and features which will be displayed on the left side of the window.</span></p>
<p>
<b><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b><span>Uncheck the Internet explorer 10.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It uninstalls the internet explorer and in future if you would like to get it back you follow the same steps and check
 the particular option.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: Internet Explorer 10 is by default in windows 8, you cannot revert back to IE9.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Give this a go; I’m confident you will find what you need here. But if you face any further issue please reply back
 to this post and we'll be happy to assist you further.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion. I already&nbsp;tried this. With the Windows 8 and English combination, there are only 2 versions of Adobe reader&nbsp;available, 11.0 and 10.1.4.&nbsp; I uninstalled and reinstalled both versions (one at a time of course) and still have the same
 problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A second post - I fixed the problem by removing the Dealcaddy app. I am not sure how it got there, but removing it fixed the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3> mcmaster student  say:</h3>
<h2>            Command Button Wizard does Not Populate left pane in Matching Fields window in Access 2007__</h2>
                    
<p>In design view, Access 2007 is not populating the left pane when creating a command button in a subform.</p>
<p>steps taken:</p>
<p>1. command button wizard draw command button</p>
<p>2. category: form operations</p>
<p>3. actions: open form</p>
<p>4. what form would you like the command button to open? select form_abc</p>
<p>5. Do you want the button to find specific information to display in the form? select open the form and find specific data to display (I'm linking them using individual ID numbers)</p>

<div>Firstly, what you're asking&nbsp;the wizard&nbsp;to do is create code to open a form - not display or filter&nbsp;a subform.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Secondly, the left-hand pane shows the fields in the form on which the button is being placed. If you don't have a list of fields, then my guess is your form is unbound. Open that form in design view, select the Data tab of
 the Properties dialog, and look at the RecordSource property. If it's blank or invalid, then your form is unbound. If you want the left pane to show&nbsp;a list, the form's RecordSource must be the name of a table or query, or be a valid SQL statement.</div>

<p>In design view, Access 2007 is not populating the left pane when creating a command button in a subform.</p>
<p>steps taken:</p>
<p>1. command button wizard draw command button</p>
<p>2. category: form operations</p>
<p>3. actions: open form</p>
<p>4. what form would you like the command button to open? select form_abc</p>
<p>5. Do you want the button to find specific information to display in the form? select open the form and find specific data to display (I'm linking them using individual ID numbers)</p>

<p>Everything is bound correctly. The exact same procedure works fine in Access 2003. It does not work in Access 2007. We built the database using Access 2003. Since upgrading to Access 2007 the procedure does not work.</p>

<div>The option&nbsp;to "Open the form and find specific data to display" is not available&nbsp;for Access 2007/2010 databases. It only exists&nbsp;in those versions for backwards compatibility with previous versions. So if you open a 2003 database
 in 2007, that option will be there, but it won't in a 2007/2010 database.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the left-pane is empty and the table is bound, are ALL the available fields already in the right-pane? If so, then Access has likely selected to include them all for you by default. If that's the case, then select a field
 you don't want included, and then click &lt;-&gt;. When you do that, the field should move to the left-pane.</div>

<div>Hi Mike,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>OK, I've examined your database, and your subform is corrupt. Recreate the subform<strong><em>from scratch</em></strong> and that'll fix the problem.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I removed the subform from the Members form,&nbsp;created a new form based on the Members table, and added it to the Members form, linked it using LinkMasterFields/LinkedChildFields, and all worked as expected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>By the way,&nbsp;I can't begin to tell you all the things that are wrong with this database, not the least of which is the fact that in roughly 140 tables, I couldn't find a&nbsp;one that had a primary or unique key. Ouch! There's more...so
 much more.</div>

<h2>            Multiple tenant Sharepoint</h2>

</p><p>I administer 2 different Office 365 tenant for the same company, one in Belgium and the other one in Luxembourg.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To achieve your requirement, you can create a site in your tenant and turn on the external sharing feature in Sharing in the SharePoint admin center. Then you can
 share the site with the users who are in another tenant after you navigate to the site.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more detailed steps, please refer to
