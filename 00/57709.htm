<h2>            How many days are actually in a Gold month trial&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>As the subject states, I'm curious as to how many days are in an Xbox Live Gold 1-Month trial.&nbsp; I saw it on the dashboard and was thinking about getting it, but since it's February, I was wondering how many days are actually included.&nbsp; I mean is it 30 or
 31 days after you start it? Or is it just the next month on the same number day?&nbsp; If it's on the same number day, does that mean if you start it in February, that you're getting shorted a couple days?&nbsp; Thanks for any insight on the matter, I appreciate and
 responses.&nbsp; ^,^</p>

<p>Well since I didn't get any definite answers, or many replies, I went ahead and used the chat with customer service feature. &nbsp;Apparently it's just until the same number day of the next month. &nbsp;So if you start a trial on February 14th, for example, it ends
 March 14th. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So you do in fact get shorted a couple days, which is kind of sad, even if it's only a few days. :P I guess I'll wait and use my trial in March, so I get a couple more days instead.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply though, Daft Badger!</p>

<h2>            Original xbox games not playing on xbox 360 s 4gb, and not wanting to purchase hard drive</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I just got Sonic Heroes, Thrillville, and Simpsons Road Rage second handed for the original xbox at bargain prices (boy oh boy, lucky me!). I put them in my xbox 360 (s, 4gb), and it said a hard drive was needed. I have no good mind to purchase a hard
 drive. I do have Sneak King, Big Bumping, and Pocketbike Racer (the games distributed by Burger King...), and on the label, it says it has both xbox and xbox 360 versions. When I put those 3 in a dvd player, I saw a message stating they were xbox (the original,
 not 360) games, not dvd movies. From that, I can assume that they have the xbox emulation software that I would need from a hard drive. Is there a way I can legally copy those files on a thumb drive and run the thumb drive into my xbox. This is ridiculous.
 Is there anyway I could download an update to a usb and run the games using my usb? I am sorry if I sounded angry, I understand you probably ain't a microsoft employee (but I'm mad bro)</p>

<p>Hi, &nbsp;</p>
<p>You must have a hard drive to play any original Xbox game. </p>
<p>As for copying the emulation software to a USB stick I'm afraid that's not possible.</p>

www.gamestop.com/.../memory</a> </p>
<p>I usually go there for my games, and I wondered if either of those could be used! Even if none works, I am always glad to go to my gamecube (best system, but I love 360 as well)</p>

<p>Hi BigDame21,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While this is the Xbox forums, I'd be happy to answer that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked it up and it&nbsp;seems you get&nbsp;XP by watching and streaming, 2XP/min for non-pro, 4XP/min for pro. Apparently you can also hover over your level to get an explanation of how the XP works. It takes longer to level up as you get higher in level since
 the total XP needed seems to jump fairly high.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can take a look at the Mixer subreddit for more information as I came across these two threads with helpful information:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mixer/comments/b17uvl/how_do_you_level_up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/mixer/comments/b17uvl/how_do_you_level_up/</a></li><li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mixer/comments/8keh3n/xp_needed_per_level_need_your_input_google_sheets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/mixer/comments/8keh3n/xp_needed_per_level_need_your_input_google_sheets/</a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The second thread contains a google doc with a table including each level and the XP required for each level inputted from different people.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 32-bit to 64-bit</h2>
                    I purchased a 32-bit edition of windows 7. I want my computer to work to its maximum capacity and at the time of purchase, I was unaware of the difference between the 32-bit and 64-bit editions of windows 7. I did not realize the difference until a few
 months after I installed the 32-bit edition. I want to change over to the 64-bit edition and I am trying to find the easiest and cheapest way to do this. I've read a few things that say you need to backup your computer, I've done this already. Is there any
 way to upgrade my current 32-bit edition of windows 7 to a 64-bit edition of windows 7? If possible, how would I go about doing this?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>it is impossible to upgrade the Windows 7 32bit into the Windows 7 64bit</strong>, you always have to<strong> do clean install
</strong>(and of course - backup the important files before ).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upgrade is possible only from 32bit into 32bit (Vista 32bit into Windows 7 32bit) or</p>
<p>from 64bit into 64bit (Vista 64bit into Windows 7 64bit) .</p>

    <title>Weird double login prompt in Windows RDP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Weird double login prompt in Windows RDP</h2>
                    So, recently the login prompt for RDP on my computer has turned weird - showing two copies of each logon option in the same window. I'm not aware of any system changes that may have caused this and to be honest, it doesn't actually stop the login process
 from working (the result is exactly the same whichever copy of the logon options you use, by the way), but it kind of looks odd and I'd like to get it back to normal if I can. Does anybody have any ideas as to what may be causing this?

<p>The only thing I can suggest is to make sure your graphics hardware drivers are up to date...</p>
<p>Another thing to try is using <strong>System Restore</strong> to restore back to a restore point made just prior to this problem first occuring...</p>

            Hi Robert
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Copy then paste the following in Notepad:
<br />
<br /> Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
<br />[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudStore\Store\Cache\DefaultAccount\$$windows.data.bluelightreduction.bluelightreductionstate]
<br />[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudStore\Store\Cache\DefaultAccount\$$windows.data.bluelightreduction.bluelightreductionstate\Current]
<br />"Data"=hex:02,00,00,00,54,83,08,4a,03,ba,d2,01,00,00,00,00,43,42,01,00,10,00,\
<br />  d0,0a,02,c6,14,b8,8e,9d,d0,b4,c0,ae,e9,01,00
<br />
<br />Save the file as nightlight.reg 
<br />
<br />Double click it
<br />
<br />

            Hi Robert.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) See fixes here working for night light: 
<br /><a href="http://m.majorgeeks.com/content/page/how_to_fix_windows_10_night_light_not_working_properly.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://m.majorgeeks.com/content/page/how_to_fix...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-10-night-light-not-working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-10-night...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/general-support/125236-night-light-not-working.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/general-support/12523...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Corrupt OS&#63;</h2>
                    I've been having issues with running Virtual Machines, my laptop supports VT-x and VT-d, and I can get most things too boot on Virtual Box, however it requires turning off VT-x and VT-d and then turning back on to get working and everytime I turn off my
 computer after running a VM, when I go and mess around again, my VM freezes after a single input. I figured it must be due to something not working right so I backed up my computer and used and Reset Windows. I haven't tested VirtualBox yet, even after a fresh
 reinstallation, I'm having issues where right clicking on my desktop takes the menu upwards of 5 minutes to appear, which is not how it's supposed to work, sfc scannow says everything is fine, I've never had any issues with malware. I've had this issue before
 and it went away, but I shouldn't be having any issues and I'd like to know why I do.

            Hi there,
<br />
<br />In order to assist you I'm going to need a little more information on this.
<br />Can you please advise me...
<br />
<br />The specs of your PC?
<br />How you reset Windows (keep files or delete everything?
<br />What VM's you're trying to run? How many and are they concurrent?

<p>My laptop is an ACER Nitro 5 with an i5-8300H, GeForce GTX 1050 and 8GB of RAM, as for updating my Graphics drivers I just did, and that fixed the menu issue, and now for whatever reason the Virtual Box isn't breaking after every time I turn on my computer
 (so I no longer have to reset VT-x and VT-d). So I guess problem solved, all I had to do was reset my computer? I'll transfer everything back and hopefully I have no more issues. Thank you. Also, does Microsoft have any way for me to create an ISO of Windows
 7 because I have Windows 10, if I can I would like to mess around with a Windows 7 VM.</p>

    <title>Microsoft sculpt comfort mouse offline - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft sculpt comfort mouse offline</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,<br />
<br />
I bought a new Microsoft sculpt comfort mouse weeks ago and it was working fine. After a week or so I started getting some problems when bluetooth started disappearing from the Device Manager but somehow I managed to solve it. Yesterday I was working on my
 laptop as usual and I wanted to take a break and I closed the lid and left. When I come back, I want to continue my work but my mouse wasn't working at all. When I check in "Devices and Printers" the mouse appears to be offline, the same on the bluetooth devices.
 In the other hand, my wireless headphones work fine. I tried to "remove" the device by deleting it from the bluetooth devices list but it says remove failed. Although I can delete it from the Device Manager, when I press "Scan for hardware changes" the drivers
 (or the device) is back again, preventing me from re-pairing the device. I tried to uninstall the bluetooth drivers but when I reinstalled it again, my mouse was still on the list of bluetooth devices. Somehow I can't get rid of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something that might raise a question is, that when I go to settings -&gt; wireless, bluetooth is off and its gray so I cannot switch it. I do not know why it says off when clearly my headphones work fine so it should be ON.<br />
<br />
I hope you can help me with this issue because till now, it was a heck of an experience for me. Thank you!<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Lumi</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time and effort.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run Hardware troubleshooter using keyboard.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps to run hardware troubleshooter.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press windows key + W and type troubleshooting and press Enter.<br />
b. Press the down arrow key to select view all and press Enter.<br />
c. Press the down arrow key to select Hardware and devices Troubleshooter and then press Enter.<br />
d. Press Enter once again and run the hardware and devices troubleshooter.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update mouse drivers using key board.<br />
a. Press Windows key + X and select Device Manager by pressing the down arrow key.<br />
b. Press tab key and then keep pressing the down arrow key to reach mice and other pointing devices.<br />
c. Then press the right arrow key to expand mice and other pointing devices.<br />
d. Select the HID Compliant mouse.<br />
e. Press the key between Ctrl key and Windows key.<br />
f. Select Update driver software using down arrow key and press Enter.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to boot your computer in safe mode and check if the mouse is working. Here is the link which says how to do it.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the mouse works fine in safe mode, then I would suggest you to perform clean boot check for the application that is causing the problem.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Clean boot:</strong> To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.
 Here is the link for your reference to perform clean boot.<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>

            Greetings Shubham,<br />
<br />
Thanks for you reply. Unfortunately, none of the above mentioned methods works for me. Maybe worth mentioning that I can use other mice like my touchpad (I am using a Lenovo Laptop) or any other mouse that can be plugged in the USB port. My mouse is connected
 using Bluetooth so it does not have any receiver. I tried deleting the device from the Device Manager in Safe Mode or with the Clean Boot method but after restarting, the device is still there. Even my headphones cannot be removed from the device manager.
 I installed Intel Bluetooth drivers but it says that "Bluetooth Device is not found".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there any method to delete drivers from their directory? Somehow Windows keep replacing the drivers whenever I delete them so I cannot make my laptop "forget" that my mouse was connected once. Thank you!

<p>
</p><p>I understand that your Laptop ran into issues after you had left it idle for some time. The issue could be occurring because of corrupt Power&nbsp;plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access the Control panel and review Power plan if you have any or create a new one and check.&nbsp;</p>

            Hey Vinod,<br />
<br />
I checked the power plan and I changed it, made a new one but the problem still persists. Something is wrong with the bluetooth itself because now we I use my wireless headphones, Google Chrome starts to freeze and if I am playing any videos, they start to
 freeze as well.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What&nbsp;is the make/model of the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the problem is with the Bluetooth and you have already tried to updating the drivers, let us try to install all the basic drivers from the computer manufacturer website. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Visit the&nbsp;computer manufacturer website, download the Chipset&nbsp;drivers and install. Check if the issue with Bluetooth reoccurs.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Vinod,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help! My laptop is Lenovo Ideapad z510. I downloaded the Chipset drivers, there were two of them. I installed them and restarted my laptop, still the problem exists. I can't remove the device on the Devices menu nor in the Devices and Printers.
 I delete them from Device Manager, click Scan for hardware changes, the mouse appears in Bluetooth section again. Worth mentioning that when I turn on my wireless headphones, my browser freezes and the sounds coming from the headphones is distorted and has
 less bass. I know that this issue will be solved if I re-install Windows but I've done that recently and I want to solve this problem entirely because after reinstalling Windows, this problem can still occur days after the re-installation. Regards, Lumi.

            For #6 have the users open the browser in private mode.   That way they can sign in with their own credentials.
<br />As for the nagging that is hard to stop. 
<br />But go to start - settings - notifications and actions  
<br />Turn of get tips, tricks, and suggestions as you use Windows.
<br />See if that helps at all.

Yes my windows is activated.&nbsp; when using media creation tool, make sure you have received the windows 10 reserve notification. Then it automatically picks up the key.

    <title>Why is Windows Turning My GPU Fans Off&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luke cypert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Windows Turning My GPU Fans Off&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I noticed a whine in my new computer the other day and thought maybe my PSU was going out. But it turns out that my GPU fans were not spinning (I think maybe the other system fans were running faster to try and cool it down?)<br />
<br />
Regardless of the whine, when I boot the PC the fans spin up no problem, but once Windows starts to load, the fans quit and do not restart even when a game is launched. This seems like some sort of driver issue because I installed MSI Afterburner and used it
 to turn the fans on, and they run no problem.<br />
<br />
Seems like either Nvidia set the fans to not spin on the card when it's not under load, or Windows is turning it off. Is there a power setting for this or something?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I had been having a few strange crashes which could easily be explained by the GPU over heating. I don't really want to have to run Afterburner all the time just to get my fans to spin. Any ideas?<br />
<br />
I'm on Windows 10 64-bit (updated)<br />
GTX 960</p>
<p>Ryzen 1600x<br />
Gigabyte Ab350m-hd3<br />
32GB of DDR4 RAM<br />
A Corsair SSD</p>

    <title>Display language installation pack stuck - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> victoriakm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display language installation pack stuck</h2>
                    Hello! I just got a new HP (that 2 in 1 convertible laptop) with Windows 10, and my display language used to be in English (US) with a Norwegian (NO) keyboard. Then out of the blue it suddenly switched to a Norwegian display language and a US keyboard.
 Now I can switch back to the NO keyboard, but I obviously don't want the display in Norwegian... I've been trying to install English back as a display language but it's just stuck, and it won't even start downloading after hours of waiting. I am an absolute
 klutz with this thing so this is my only resort, help?

<p>Wow! I hope they did get all this. Only problem will be that once again we'll probably have to start all over to realize any of it. I hope it doesn't totally break my present play.</p>

<p>Wow, looks like they've done quite a few fixes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is one thing that happened to me that was almost a 'game breaker' (just IMO) that I didn't see in the list. When asking Arngeir for new word wall quests, he would eventually send me to Arcwind Point, (usually very early on) but the quest&nbsp;waypoint wouldn't
 clear after I learned the word, so Arngeir wouldn't send me after any more words since the quest didn't clear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although I think I read somewhere in that list, that they fixed a bug which may be indirectly related? I guess we will see.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I both love and hate this... I love that they are still supporting the game and that they've fixed a lot of bugs.&nbsp; I hate the fact that I just restarted a complete playthrough of the Mass Effect series from the beginning and am fairly early in M.E. 1.&nbsp; I
 needed a break from Skyrim since I just played through from the beginning, completing quite a bit of the side quests, the main quests, HF, DG and DB DLC. So now the OCD in me won't let me switch back to Skyrim until I finish my Mass Effect playthrough! lol</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh Well, at least I'll be ready for a fresh start with a whole new character when I do feel the urge to play Skyrim again... and it won't be as much of a grind when I max the skills I choose for that character since I'll be able to reset them and continue
 leveling&nbsp;without having to use skills I really don't care to use.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's worst case scenario. I had corrupted ME 1 saves (lost them all) so I always had to start ME2 with the default choices. Long story short, I no longer had ME1 but still have 2 and 3. Well, until a few days ago when I got bitten by a nostalgia bug and
 D/L'd ME1 from On Demand... with full intent to play through ALL 3 games since I'll have the choices I make from ME1 carry over throughout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since there are so many little differences that your decisions can make, I planned on doing pretty much all of the side missions with the exception of the Firewalker DLC from ME2...&nbsp; quite a bit of playing indeed.&nbsp; &gt;-&lt;</p>

<p>I'm bitterly disappointed that they're 'fixing' the Ebony Blade's associated skill. Why change such a unique weapon?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I like the idea of re-leveling your skills (hey, if I have Mastered One Handed Weapons then why not reset it if that's all I plan on using?) but I think they've done it in an awkward way.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Legendary Difficulty?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I'm down with that... always down for a new challenge, especially since Master isn't that hard.</p>

            HI,  
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below:
<br />
<br />1, Try to run the Apps troubleshooter to fix issues that may prevent app from working properly in the link below:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Clear browsing history.
<br />
<br />3. Run the SFC scan 
<br />Run the Microsoft Windows Resource Checker tool, also know as "System File Checker" or "sfc". This tool scans and verifies the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct versions. Here's how: 
<br />1. Press Windows key + X, click Command Prompt (Admin). 
<br />2. In the Command Prompt, type the following command, sfc /scannow and then press Enter.  
<br />3. Wait until the process completes. This usually doesn’t take longer than 20 minutes with a regular hard disk 
<br />    and takes much shorter when you have a fast SSD drive.  
<br />4. Check to see if the issue is resolved. If not, restart the system. 
<br />
<br />4. Repair and reset the app: 
<br />Right-click on the Start menu button, and select Settings. 
<br />Select App, click on Microsoft Edge from the list, and select Advanced options. 
<br />Select Repair. 
<br />If the issue persists, repeat the steps and select Reset. 
<br />
<br />If, all the procedures above didn't work, please try to reset  Edge manually:
<br />
<br />Microsoft Edge doesn’t open, try resetting the browser manually.
<br />Press Windows key + R and type: C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Packages.
<br />
<br />Open the folder labeled Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe and delete all of its content.
<br />
<br />Then, 
<br />1. click Start and type: power shell and right-click Power Shell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />2. Run this command will reinstall Microsoft Edge: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose} 
<br />
<br />The command result will appear in the PowerShell window. Exit PowerShell, then try launching Edge again.
<br />
<br />I hope it works,
<br />
<br />Regards. 
<br />
<br />Diego R.

            Hi &nbsp;Bill
<br />
<br />The first option to try is Reset &amp; Repair Edge
<br />
<br />Windows Key + i 
<br /> Apps &gt; Go down, Select Microsoft Edge and click Reset&nbsp;
<br />If Reset doesn't work, press Repair
<br />
<br />You can check this article for more information
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023560/windows-10-what-to-do-when-microsoft-edge-not-working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402356...</a>
<br />
<br />If this option does not work, you can also try&nbsp;re-register&nbsp;Edge
<br />
<br />1. Open the&nbsp;Start Menu.
<br />2. Search for “powershell“.
<br />3. Right-click on the search result titled&nbsp;Windows PowerShell&nbsp;and click on&nbsp;Run as administrator&nbsp;in the resulting context menu. Doing so will launch an elevated instance of&nbsp;Windows PowerShell&nbsp;– an instance that has administrative privileges.&nbsp;
<br />4. Type the following into the elevated instance of&nbsp;Windows PowerShell&nbsp;and press&nbsp;Enter:
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose}
<br />
<br />5. The command specified above is designed to reinstall Microsoft Edge on a Windows 10 computer. Wait for the command to be successfully executed – you will see a message stating&nbsp;Operation completed&nbsp;within the&nbsp;elevated instance of&nbsp;Windows PowerShell&nbsp;once the command has been successfully executed.
<br />6. Close the elevated instance of&nbsp;Windows PowerShell&nbsp;and&nbsp;restart&nbsp;your computer.
<br />
<br />
<br />Please Keep me informed of your progress&nbsp;

<h2>            Get Rid of All Accounts</h2>
                    I have just installed Windows 7 on my laptop. I am the only person who uses my laptop, but somehow as I went through the install process I have ended up having 3 users - a master administrator, another account under my name, and the guest account. Probably
 my own fault, but I now have the riduculous situation where I end up having to give myself permission to access some of my files!<br />
<br />
Is there anyway to get rid of all this user-stuff and just let me go straight to my desktop with no sign ins and offs, and no users - which was how I was set up in XP?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

            Your users are actually set up correctly as long as your own account for your daily work is a Standard user. The Guest account is a special system account. It is disabled by default in Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, Linux, Unix, and OS X for a reason. You
 need to leave that alone.<br />
<br />
<span><span style="font-weight: bold">User accounts - Recommended Setup</span> (<span style="font-weight: bold">Vista</span> and
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista and Windows 7 are multi-user operating systems with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, and Guest. These accounts should be
 left alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista and Windows 7 because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily
 work and that account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it may require more work than you want to do. Best not to get into a bad situation to begin with.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).<br />
