            <p>I tried the K-Lite from 2 different sites.</p>
<p>1st as part of my initial setup as part of a ninite.com install</p>
<p>
</p><p>codecguide.com installing the standard version.</p>
<p>I see there is a new version released yesterday. I'll have to reconnect the&nbsp;</p>
<p>SSD I installed to, &nbsp;and reboot to test it so I'll do that later and reply&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Outlook folders move around when clicked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sunryzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook folders move around when clicked</h2>
                    <p>Recently my outlook folders have been moving around when I click on them. So, for example, if I click on Sent, the folder suddenly further down the list and a new one appears where I clicked. Sometimes I actually end up opening the one I wanted, but often
 it opens the new one that moved up when I clicked on it. Anyone ever had that problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I have the same problem, which just began occurring a few days ago. I have Outlook 2013 running&nbsp;with Office 365 Enterprise E1, on a Windows 7-64 desktop.</p>
<p>The problem is intermittent, but when I tried your suggestion and started Outlook in safe mode, the problem occurred immediately.</p>
<p>I have been able to work around the problem by going to Outlook Today and clicking on the Inbox link displayed there. Although that solution works, its primary effects are&nbsp;to remind me to get the problem fixed and to keep me bummed about how much worse Outlook
 2013 seems to be compared to Outlook 2010.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your interest and support. In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The issue occurs only in Outlook, never in Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I use Outlook on a desktop PC (as noted above) and, much less frequently, on a laptop running Win7-32. I have not had any trouble clicking on the Inbox folder on the laptop, although I have observed it moving up and down the folder list as Outlook synchronizes
 with Exchange. (As I was composing this message on my desktop, I saw my laptop receive an email, and watched the Inbox folder move up to the first position from the fifth position on the folder list. Unlike on my desktop, I had no problem clicking on the Inbox
 item and opening the Inbox, even though the folders position on the list changed by itself.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. The problem began only about a week ago. No hardware changes have been&nbsp;made for at least several months. The graphics card is an ATI Radeon HD 2400 XT, which should be&nbsp;more than adequate for running Office 2013 applications. I have not noticed any other
 similar issues.</p>

            <p>Thanks, Brian. I did as you suggested and watched the following behavior:</p>
<p>The Inbox folder jumped around as Outlook opened and synchronized. It ended up at fifth on the list of folders. When I clicked on it, the Inbox opened, and the folder jumped into the first position. I clicked on&nbsp;the other folders listed, which opened when
 I clicked on them. When I clicked on the Inbox folder (now in the first position), focus moved to the second folder listed (Drafts). I am unable to open the Inbox folder from the folder list. (To open the inbox, I go to Outlook Today and click on the Inbox
 link. When the Inbox folder opened via this link, the Inbox folder moved down to fifth position on the folder list.)</p>
<p>This behavior seems quirky. Is it a normal feature&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Outlook 2013 user interface?</p>

            I've never seen anything near that behavior.&nbsp; Are you looking on the Favorites section of the Nav Pane?&nbsp; Which Nav Pane view are you using?&nbsp; If you choose the Folder List view (Ctrl+6), does it happen?

            <p>I am using the folder list immediately below&nbsp;the Favorites section, which starts with my email address above a list of sub-folders (Drafts, Sent Items, Deleted Items, etc.). When I used Ctrl+6, and then restarted Outlook (the behavior, which is intermittent
 but frequent, wasn't happening at the time), I clicked on Inbox and Contacts opened. I could not open the Inbox from the folder list. I was going to ask you how to revert to the old list display, but it reverted by itself.</p>
<p>There has been a significant loss of functionality in the upgrade to Outlook 2010 to 2013. The other things -- inability to have a Signature added automatically to every email, contact cards not opening from a right click menu on the sender's email address,
 etc. -- are not as annoying as this folder issue.</p>
<p>Thanks for your attention and support. I am glad to hear that it's not just an issue of not knowing how to use Outlook.</p>

<p><br />
The behaviours your describing are not standard by any means. Like Brian, have never encountered the folder issue described using any email account type but it probably would be helpful to know what kind of email account this is occurring on (POP, Imap, Mapi(EAS)
 etc).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That aside, have multiple accounts using O'2013 with no issues related to different signatures being applied&nbsp;correctly (and automatically) to any new email message being created based on the account being selected. This may seem like an obvious question
 but needs to be asked nonetheless - have you confirmed that the signature is specifically confirmed for &lt;new messages&gt; for the email account(s) in question?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be worthwhile to create a new Outlook profile to see if all the problems you are encountering persist.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your thoughts, Karl.</p>
<p>I did recreate an Outlook profile several months ago (trying to fix the signature issue, among other things), but not since the folder issue surfaced. When I get back to the office, I'll give it a try. I will check whether signatures work correctly on one
 of my other accounts.</p>
<p>I am using Outlook 2013 on Exchange hosted by Microsoft Office 365 under its E1 product, and the other account I will look at the signatures on is also hosted by Office 365 Exchange.</p>
<p>On my laptop computer, the signature functions work as they should, allowing me to set a default signature for new emails and to add different signatures. Clicking the Signatures button on my desktop gets me to the one signature I had set up in the previous
 version of Outlook, but does not allow me to edit the signature file or to add signatures. The "Signatures..." list item is not enabled.</p>

    <title>Nokia Asha 303 connectivity problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> djceline  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Asha 303 connectivity problem</h2>
                    
<p>I recently bought this phone and I just can't make the FB application or any other application for that matter connect through WI-FI. Even if I'm asked whether I want to connect through wireless or packet data and I choose the wireless option, the application
 won't connect. Other applications don't even give me this option to choose (for example the ovi store application) and they try using the packet data connection (which doesn't work because my network provider sort of sucks). I really don't know that to do.
 I updated the phone's software to the newest version because I thought it was a software problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the only issue I have with this phone and I can't seem to figure it out. In other respects I just love it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could anyone please give me an idea??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Chat, mail and social are require cellular data or special data plan to use it (which suck). While nokia attemp to place this phone as high-end feature phone, they should allow all of applications that pre-installed to connect via Wi-Fi which will make
 this phone become more popular. Also, they should add abilitiy to allow this phone to perform multi-tasking or task switchable (suspend all minimized apps and active only app that running on the screen unless the minimized app is coded to run in background).

<p>oh, so this is a general problem with thie phone. damn...and i bought it because i thought i could use those damn applications. hope that nokia will...somehow fix this. i mean i don't get ANY application to connect via wireless and it's not fair. not even
 the nokia store. luckly i can connect using the browser. but anyhow, there are lots of stuff i practically can't use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>could this be an issue just for the phones that are designed for certain regions? i mean the software could be different or this applies to all of them? i've read on this forum that in&nbsp;<span>Thailand some phone operators have some sort of contract with nokia
 to make users pay extra if they want to activate data packages so the apps could work.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi, i'm Hikari from Philippines, i bought the same phone too nokia asha 303 thinking that its a good phone based from specs and really affordable.I never thought that i would have problem with the phone since i've been using Nokia handsets for quite sometime
 now, Back to the issue, i was browsing facebook at the time when i receive a connection error 006 or something, i thought its just a glicth on my wireless at home so i powercycled the modem then tried to browse again after a few moments i have the same issue
 again. I thought its just a weak signal on my wireless so i move about 2 meters away from my modem/router and still the same. I checked the internet on my laptop an another handset(nokia n82) and its working perfectly fine. I tried everything i could on my
 end and still the same even updating the nokia browser and trying Opera mini i installed, but still no good.I don't think that its a compatibility issue since i was able to browse then it just stops. A bigger issue with this is that i can't even connect to
 the wireless using my phone when im very close to my laptop, which i find odd since my other phone works just fine...i hope nokia could find a way to fix this problem or give our money back....this stinks...</p>

            I'm in the Philippines as well, make sure you have your time zone correct with the time and date correct as well. This will cause huge connectivity problems with the phone. I suffered with the same problem, Sun Cell couldn't solve the issue. Once I updated
 the time zone to UTC +8, set the time and date - Bam! Works like a charm. You also need a surf plan for most of the funtions of the phone except talk and text.

 and I had zero credits left. I figured I was browsing using my prepaid credits not through my cousin s wifi. I could not figure what was going on please help.</span></p>

<p>CapnJackSparrow, I haven't seen FlashPlayer for S40, so perhaps you have downloaded it to some another OS, like Symbian ? Don't have 303, but in other S40 phones youtube has worked for me always.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>JelloCon00, are you sure the wifi has access to Internet ? I have seen that on my x3-02 when connected to wifi that does not provide internet access (or require proxy)</p>

 and it said there's a problem with my Network Adapter. I tried restarting my Router (I'm connected using an Ethernet Connection) but it still doesn't work. Device Manager shows the Network Adapter is fine, but I can't really update the Driver without Internet.
 I'm attaching a picture of the Network Connections Troubleshooting Page. I'm sending this from the same PC on the Windows 10 Partition and the Internet works fine. Please respond with how to connect to the Internet. Thanks

<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.<br />
<br />
I would require additional information for better assistance:<br />
<br />
1) From where are you changing the settings to print in color? It is from within the Excel file or printer settings from
<font><b>Control Panel</b> &gt; <b>Devices and Printers</b> &gt; right click on the
<b>Printer Driver</b> &gt; <b>Printer Properties</b>?<br />
<br />
2) Is the printer driver updated with all the latest updates? <br />
<br />
3) Does this issue occur if you close and re-open Excel and then try printing with default settings?<br />
<br />
Try the following and verify the result: <br />
<br />
1) Change the default printer settings to print in color.<br />
<br />
2) Try printing the Excel file in black and white.<br />
<br />
3) Now close and re-open Excel and try printing in default settings and verify the result.<br />
<br />
Reply with necessary information and the result for further assistance.<br />
<br />
Thank You.</font></span>

<strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>1.5 If I close all documents, and open it again. it turn to default color(black/white)</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<h2>            Cannot remove add-in</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone help me to uninstall the 'ReferenceChecker' add-in please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears when I open Word, but is not (under that name, at least) in my list of apps. However, the file 'EditAB.dot' does appear in WordOptions&gt;Add-ins, and this seems to be something to do with the program. (I say this because all my macros have stopped
 working and, when I created a new normal.dotm to try to deal with that, a number of files appeared in this 'new' file that linked 'EditAB.dot' to ReferenceChecker). I've tried to follow the uninstall path from the company's
<a href="http://www.goodcitations.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">website</a> but the uninstall file does not appear in my templates folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>I've enabled 'show hidden files and folders' but this doesn't help. Have also searched my computer for the uninst_RC.bat file, but it cannot be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not been able to get any help from the software supplier and will be so grateful for any advice from the forum.</p>
<p>

<h3> mlapse  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive for Business and Outlook 2016 - how to share files with people that do not have a Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>We are in the process of migrating to OneDrive for Business and Office 2016.&nbsp; I would like to have all files saved to either ODfB or our Sharepoint site, but this is causing a lot of difficulties when it comes to sharing files outside of the organization.&nbsp;
 Previously the default behavior was to attach a file as a copy, which admittedly is inefficient, but has the big upside that everyone can easily open the file whenever, without needing to be signed into a Microsoft account, or even be connected to the internet
 at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The new behavior seems to default to sending a link.&nbsp; That's great for efficiency, but the problem is that very few of our clients have or want a Microsoft account, and are certainly not going to take the time to sign into an account every time they want
 to view a file.&nbsp; The other problem is that even if they are signed into an account, the file opens in a browser, not the desktop Office.&nbsp; There also appears to be no way to save a bunch of attachments directly, without opening and downloading each one separately,
 which takes a lot of time.&nbsp; The sign in problem could be solved by allowing the ability to default to sending guest links from within Outlook 2016, but I've read this feature is only available in OWA?&nbsp; It was supposed to be coming to Outlook 2016, but as far
 as I can tell it is not there yet.&nbsp; I do not see a solution for the other issues short of sending every file as a traditional attachment, which would be fine if that could be switched to the default, but is not OK if it has to be selected manually each time.&nbsp;
 Is there something I am missing with the integration?&nbsp; Things seem to work much better with older versions of Office or if you use a new version of Office but with a 3rd party cloud service provider like Dropbox.</p>

<p>Hi mlapse,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the late reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following are the answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How do I make the "anyone can edit" permission the default for attachments from Outlook?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my test, whenever I attached the document as a link, the default permission was
<strong>Anyone can edit, </strong>may be because this permission is on the top of the permission list, as shown in the following screenshot. You can test this on your end and see the behavior.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30f7ba21-034c-410e-bebf-5f0ebfa0d0fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30f7ba21-034c-410e-bebf-5f0ebfa0d0fb" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to change the default to some other permission such as <strong>Recipient can edit</strong> or
<strong>Organization can edit</strong> etc., it can’t be changed. You have to select the permission from the drop-down list.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is there a way to have the link open the file in Office instead of the browser? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>No, there isn’t</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How do I "save all" attachments when they are sent as a link?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To save the attachments, you can right click on the attached link and select <strong>
Save all Attachment. </strong>It will ask you to choose the document which you wish to save, once you select the document, click OK, as shown in the following screenshot</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a812c75-c7f1-4f20-a066-e18038c19c6d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a812c75-c7f1-4f20-a066-e18038c19c6d" /></a></p>
<p>Since, we are saving the links not the actual document, it will save as Internet Shortcuts. After we click on these Internet shortcuts, it will open in your default browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5bdb56e-af34-4f64-a4b9-4eae2422e884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5bdb56e-af34-4f64-a4b9-4eae2422e884" /></a></p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I delete a whole folder without having to go into each subfolder and delete all files within each subfolder on ONEDRIVE &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within One Drive for business, I am encountering a notice saying "you have to delete all the items in this folder before you can delete this folder".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The capacity to delete files is a basic functionality in every digital storage product.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is this feature not enabled yet in Feb 2018?&nbsp; Is there a simple way in which I can delete these files, without having to delete all files within all folders in that folder?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am attempting to delete my personal files from my one drive for business which I inadvertently added from my USB stick.&nbsp; My concern pertains to the capacity of the business admin or similar being able to access my files which I believe is permitted under
 business licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you<br />

<p><span>Hi TM_072,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Normally, we don’t have to firstly delete files in a folder and then delete the folder in OneDrive for Business. Given your description, it seems your organization has
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn790612.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">enabled holds</a> for users’ OneDrive for Business libraries. In this situation, you need to firstly delete files in a folder and then delete the folder. You could confirm with your IT or tenant
 admin. Check if similar policy is enabled for users’ OneDrive for Business libraries.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are not in this scenario (your tenant haven’t enabled any similar policy), please feel free to let us know. We can discuss further.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Best regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Tim &nbsp;</span></p>

<h3> m44sheehan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Presentation Translator Questions</h2>
                    <p>Hello, was just wondering if anybody could me with some questions that I have about presentation translator for Microsoft PowerPoint. At our business, we are trying to use this feature so that clients can follow along in their own language to subtitles if
 they speak a different language than english, and also translating entire presentations into another language. Was just wondering if there are solutions to any of these problems:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. The subtitles at the top when talking during presentation cut off headings and words, is there any way to fix this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Is there a way to control the subtitle speed, as sometimes it is too fast and people may not be able to keep up with the subtitles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Are there more language options available than the ones given? If so, how do you get these language options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Is there a way to print off the powerpoint with the subtitles already on them? I'm assuming no, but was wondering.&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Can you save the subtitles/verbal parts into the notes section of the PowerPoint?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for your expertise as always, that indeed deserves the highest ranking which I've always cordially given.</p>
<p>I used to have Microsoft Wordpad, and Microsoft paint, these were uninstalled long ago, Upon insert&gt;object, those do occupy the list albeit as blank entries (when selected and inserted an error dialog launches that gives clue what they originally have been).</p>
<p>Are there any ways to customize that list? Such as AddOLEObject Classes ?</p>

Thanks a lot, but would you please let me how could I find those entries such as "Equation.3", unfortunately there are many somehow equivalent entries in the regedit (USER and LOCAL)<br />

I express my deepest appreciations for your prompt, informative answer. <br />

            I'm not that knowledgeable aboutt he details: if I were doing this, I would look for each "Equation" key (not just the version-specific keys such as Equation.3", and look at how they are interrelated, then start removing subtrees and check what happens
 in Word. You willtypically find entries under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. I would make the assumption that everything installed on the machine (or at least, everything made available to all users on the machine) would be in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, and that each user might
 also have HKEY_CURRENT_USER keys, which would also be mirrored per-user in HKEY_USERS and in HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG.
<div><br />
<div>So if all I needed to so was remove the entries related to a single user (me), I'd probably start with HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT and HKEY_CURRENT_USER (HKEY_USERS and HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG should automatically reflect what you do in HKEY_CURRENT_USER.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another approach, if you can backup your system and be confident that you can restore it fairly quickly and easily, might be to run the Office setup program and see if you can find the options to remove the components that you do not want. It is always
 possible that the Setup will fail if the components have already been partially removed, but I would hope that Setup would succeed and remove any remaining traces.<br />

    <title>SharePoint Calendar App End Date Quick Edit Bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flashitcompany  say:</h3>
<h2>            SharePoint Calendar App End Date Quick Edit Bug</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<div>
<p>I've been trying to solve a problem with the Calendar App in our own&nbsp;SharePoint 2013&nbsp;environment (this is not in SharePoint Online but I need an answer to this as well), you can't edit the End Date in Quick Edit mode as&nbsp;we get:</p>
<p><em>"Invalid data has been used to update the list item. The field you are trying to update may be read only."</em><br />
<br />
In 365 SharePoint Online&nbsp;when you change the Start Date in Quick&nbsp;edit&nbsp;and click Stop editing the End Date just vanishes... this can't be&nbsp;how it was intended&nbsp;to function and as it is I can't trust the Calendar App&nbsp;to anyone, so I would really appreciate if someone
 know a solid way to fix this, I don't want to add extra list content types to the calendar that won't work for numerous reasons.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>hi tim,</p>
<p>yes i've posted my other problem to ms tec and i hope i get get an answer there.</p>
<p>regarding sharepoint online:</p>
<p>those are the correct steps, tired in ie 11 and ff.</p>
<p>bellow are screenshot as requested on the steps to reproduce.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(192, 192, 192, 1)">profit</span></p>
<p>if this has been asked before please provide a link or a fix for it, atm i'm a bit to frustrated to search for basic function that i was almost crystal clear with that they would function.</p>
<p>while i'm at it, why can't you sort by specific date with the event type? (see screenshot bellow) i don't want to add my own custom list types that will corrupt recurring events when there is a column that is made for the app.</p>
<p><strong>sorting date</strong></p>

<p>the function are essential for our customers when they use the calendar app, in our own or in sharepoint online.</p>

<p>Hi PanosMitsikis,<br />
<br />
My test is in a new Calender App in an account we haven't touched yet.<br />
<br />
Try this:</p>
<p>Add <strong>Start Time</strong> and <strong>End Time</strong></p>
<p>Now edit<strong> Start Time <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Only</span>
</strong>don't touch the <strong>End Time </strong>column in<strong> Quick Edit</strong> and save it with the
<strong>Stop link</strong> and see if you can reproduce it.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>@PanosMitsikis: yes that’s the special need feature :)</p>
<p>In all seriousness tho guys and from my experience the only way to circumvent scenarios like this is to test your own product continuously and a lot more. If there aren’t enough resources for it then don’t do it, fact is I can’t sell or use any SharePoint
 Online environment for our business clients for just exactly these type of reasons, they would go bonkers.</p>

    <title>Nokia 6300 Power Up Without the Button - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim2kn2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia 6300 Power Up Without the Button</h2>
                    I have recently bought a faulty nokia 6300...on purpose. It has a faulty power button. But other than that works fine. The only problem is i cannot get it to turn on as the button is almost non existant now. I know there is a way as when i had it in pieces
 to try and resolve the problem it turned on somehow. I have seen a new replacement button that i can buy and fit, but from looking inside the phone there doesnt seem to be a inner button that would get pressed by the outer. I dont know if this phone works
 in that way though..<br />
<br />
Can anyone help?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
<br />

            Its a really stupid design and nokia have make a big mistake, The outer button does push down&nbsp;on an inner button but the inner button isn't directly under it&nbsp;thats the problem,its a&nbsp;couple of mm towards the front of the phone.&nbsp;If you remove the front cover
 of the phone you will see a tiny black button at the top of the phone, this is the power button. Instead of replacing the&nbsp;OUTER&nbsp;button which is the problem. you could just remove the front cover&nbsp;each time, Hope this helps someone..&nbsp;cheers matt&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>If the messages are gone your only option may be to contact your sim provider and see if they have records, unless of course you have backed up your phone on Nokia Suite in which case they would all be on your computer. As for crashes , the N97 Mini is very
 old in technology terms, but you may be able to prolong its life by doing a hard reset and installing/reinstalling the latest available software. Whatever you do , back up the phone on a computer and at least you can save whatever data is on &nbsp;it at the moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good Luck</p>

<h2>            Trouble with SMTP email reception</h2>
                    First of all, I apologize, but I do not speak tech very well, so hopefully I'm using the right terms below.<br />
<br />
We purchased a new computer several months ago, and Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business 2013 to go with it.&nbsp; I installed Outlook and set it up to receive emails from my email account provided through my ISP.&nbsp; We are running Windows 8.1 on a Samsung computer with
 Intel Core i3-3227U CPU @ 1.90 GHz, 4.0 GB RAM (3.71 usable), 64 bit operating system<br />
<br />
Questions are twofold:<br />
1.&nbsp; On my previous computer, somehow I had Outlook set up so that when messages were retrieved from my SMTP account, they were removed from that server and stored only in Outlook.&nbsp; I cannot figure out how to do that again.&nbsp; My email messages stay in my SMTP
 account unless I go in there and delete them, even if I've read them, stored them in folders or deleted them in Outlook.&nbsp; This is a problem for two reasons: first, my SMTP account usage keeps going over the limit and I can't receive emails and also because
 Outlook keeps trying to sync all the folders with what's on the SMTP site.&nbsp; So if I create a folder in Outlook and file emails in it, if it doesn't exist on the SMTP site then Outlook tries to sync for hours at a time, and sometimes the folders I've created
 (and therefore the emails I was trying to save) are deleted.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; I'm having access issues.&nbsp; I'm receiving this error when logging into Outlook:&nbsp;
<br />
Task 'Synchronizing subscribed folders for *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.' reported error (0x800CCC0E) : 'Outlook cannot synchronize subscribed folders for *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Error: Cannot connect to the server. If you continue to receive this message, contact
 your server administrator or Internet service provider (ISP).'<br />
I can still log into my SMTP account via web browser though, so I know it's not an internet or email account issue.&nbsp; This error message started out of the blue yesterday.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any assistance you can give.<br />

            <p>Sounds like you had your email account configured as a POP account on the old computer and is now configured as Imap on the new computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To check your email account type</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>From O'2013 menu --&gt; File --&gt; Account Settings --&gt; the first tab on the displayed window (E-mail) will show your email account(s) along with its type.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Outlook wouldn't attempt to synchronize with a POP account but would with an Imap account. Also, the option for automatically deleting email from the server when downloaded by Outlook is a POP account setting.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What you'll need to do is add your email account as a POP account and delete the Imap version of that account.</p>

<h2>            MS Access 2013 - Page numbers</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to do a course with the course instructions for MS Access 2003, I have MS Access 2013k, it's been a nightmare! I need to add page numbers to my form, I go into Design, then Controls, but I do not see an icon for #s, can anyone help me with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Carol</p>

            <p>Forms don't have page numbers. Did you mean asking about report page numbers?</p>

            <div>Well, that explains it! Sorry, the section of the course that I am taking in MS Access is called&nbsp;“Creating Forms with the Wizard”, using the database that I created. Part of the instructions says&nbsp;“From the Insert menu, select the
 Page Numbers option”. As I said, the course is based on MS Access 2003 so I am not sure if you were able to put page numbers in that version, but I guess you can’t in 2013 version. Thank you for your reply it has been most helpful.</div>

            <p>Multi-Page forms went out of favor with the addition of the Tab control. I'm surprised even a course on Access 2003 would reference them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would not worry about it, since its not something you would ever use, even if available. I don't think I've create a multi-page form in over 15 years.&nbsp;</p>
