<h2>            Adding hotmail account to Nokia 5230 email</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. Ive tried to sync my hotmail account with Nokia email, the 1st time it did it but didnt have my messages on it or recieve them (so i removed it to restart), and the same things happened again. Any ideas?? Ive managed to successfully set up my Yahoo email
 account though, so im not sure why its not working, or can it take quite a long time to sync?</p>

<p>Are you sure the Password that you are using for your hotmail account is correct? Are you able to log into your hotmail account from your browser on your PC? Are the messages in your hotmail account read or unread, try sync'ing with an unread email in the
 hotmail account.</p>

            <p>Geoffrey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did some further testing with another BlackBerry Z10 device and&nbsp;another Outlook.com account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I am able to replicate the issue of Outlook.com not syncing changes (additions/deletions)&nbsp;on that other device as well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I submitted my email account details to you,&nbsp;it appears that in any given 12 hour period (approximately), if I add a contact to "People" on Outlook.com, the contact will sync to the device.&nbsp; However, further additions&nbsp;additions or deletions on People
 thereafter will not be synced at all to the device.&nbsp; This is not the ActiveSync behaviour I am accustomed to.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adding/removing the email account on either device&nbsp;doesn't seem to help.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tested my Outlook.com on my PlayBook, which uses ActiveSync as well.&nbsp; That appears to be fine and everything sync both ways, almost immediately.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I reconfigured my account by removing it and then re-adding it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then added a new&nbsp;contact on Outlook.com.&nbsp; That synced to my device.&nbsp; </p>

<p>I then added another new contact on Outlook.com.&nbsp; That did not sync to my device.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Raymond,<br />
<br />
I did the following:&nbsp; <br />
<br />
A. I configured two different Outlook.com accounts on my device.&nbsp; I confirm the behaviour is still the same as noted above, for both accounts:
<br />
<br />
<p>1. The first new contact I add on Outlook.com will sync to the device.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>2. Contacts added on Outlook.com after that will not sync to the device.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>3. Contacts deleted from Outlook.com after that will not sync to the device.<br />
</p>
<br />
This behaviour will remain like this (i.e. no changes on Outlook.com will be synced to the device) until the next day (approximately 12 hours or so).&nbsp; After that, the problem will start back at #1.<br />
<br />
B. I can also also replicate this issue on <u>another</u> BlackBerry Z10 device, using a different Outlook.com account.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
C. I have also formatted and entirely reloaded the operating system on my device and the other device and reconfigured the various Outlook.com accounts on both.&nbsp; The same issue seems to persist.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
D.&nbsp; Yes, all changes made <u>on the device</u> (both mine and the other) sync immediately to Outlook.com<br />
<br />
Best regards,<br />
<br />
A<br />
<br />

            Hello Ralph,
<div>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum.<br />
<div>1. Which security software is installed in your system?<br />
2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>3. Is the issue specific to the ebay website?</div>
<div>4. Are you using Internet Explorer 9 or higher version? (Refer: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/internet-explorer/which-version-am-i-using" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/internet-explorer/which-version-am-i-using</a>)</div>
<div>5. When you say "shut down", do you mean Internet Explorer closes or freezes?</div>
<div>6. What is the KB number of the failing updates? (Refer: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/which-windows-updates-installed#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/which-windows-updates-installed#1TC=windows-7</a>)<br />
I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists:</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1.<br />
</strong></div>
<div>Try booting your computer in the safe mode and check if the issue persists:</div>
<div><strong>Start your computer in safe mode </strong></div>

<div>If the system works fine in the safe mode, try to clean boot the system:</div>

<p>Before I begin&nbsp; with your suggestions&nbsp; here are the answers to the questions you asked me (as best as I can answer them)</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Security software is McAfee</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tried Mozilla Firefox then went back to IE</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; From this laptop I cannot access ebay sign in, my account or links from emails I receive from ebay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On my desktop (upstairs) your messages came in but not on this laptop!</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; IE closes when I try to access ebay and attempts to restart but it is a continuous loop.&nbsp; It says something like "due to a problem on the page IE will close."&nbsp; Can't remember the exact words.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Haven't found the KB number yet - don't know what it is or where it is.&nbsp; I'll try your link IF the computer will work on the link.&nbsp; All links on emails do not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try to make them work are report my success or not.</p>
<p>Thank you again for your help.</p>

            <p>Hello again Harkanwar - I am sorry that I am not providing you timely, accurate information.&nbsp; It appears that I actually have IE 10 on Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried safe mode with networking and the problem still exists.&nbsp;&nbsp; IE says there is a problem and shuts down - into a continuous loop of closures. This occurs when I attempt to sign in directly from the site or when I open an email and attempt other actions
 from the email.&nbsp; </p>
<p>As you can tell I am not very smart about computers but could it be that when I uninstalled Firefox and reinstalled IE that some of the security settings or firewall settings&nbsp; went wrong?&nbsp;&nbsp;All other websites seems to react normally.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does ebay have unique
 security settings?&nbsp; Could it be problems with my firewall?&nbsp; I am still receiving Micrsoft updates every single day when I shutdown for the night.</p>
<p>I don't even understand why that is happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Too many questions I know. But I am getting very discouraged and frustrated.&nbsp; Thank you for your help.&nbsp; Ralph&nbsp;</p>

            Hello Ralph,
<div>1. Which were the updates that were offered after restart when you state, "I am still receiving Micrsoft updates every single day when I shutdown for the night" ?(Refer:
<span><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/which-windows-updates-installed#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">See which Windows updates are installed</a></strong></span>)&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Do you have any third party security software?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I appreciate your continuous efforts on your issue. Lets give a try to some more steps to diagnose the actual cause of the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The problem may arise due to some add-ons that are enabled for the website. I would suggest you run Internet Explorer (IE) with no add-ons and then login into ebay:</div>
<div>1. Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>Run</strong> and hit ENTER.</div>
<div>2. In the <em>Run</em> Window, type <strong>iexplore -extoff</strong> and hit ENTER.</div>
<div>The Internet Explorer will open up without add-ons. Please try logging in the website.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, please clarify if you have tried resetting your Internet Explorer as mentioned in my previous post.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If method 1 does not help, try opening the website in the compatibility mode:</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-10-win-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/internet-explorer/use-compatibility-view#ie=ie-10-win-7</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If still the issue persists, try uninstalling Internet Explorer 10 and check if the issue persists in the pre-installed Internet Explorer 9.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please refer to the section: <strong>Uninstall Internet Explorer </strong>in the following article:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/internet-explorer/install-ie#ie=ie-10-win-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Install or uninstall Internet Explorer</a></strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try opening the Internet Explorer 9 and opening the websites.</div>

            <p>Hello Harkanwar - </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you again for trying to help me out of my problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer your questions;</p>
<p>.&nbsp; I did reset IE as you requested.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; There is a very long list of updates but I can tell you that there were failures each day between December 9 - and December 16.&nbsp; They are noted failure and labeled as IE 11 for Windows 7 for x64 based systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are many other updates with different topics that were successfully installed during this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; My third party security software is McAfee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I attempted Method 1 but it did not work.&nbsp; When I typed in iexplore-extoff and enterd - I got an error response saying the computer could not locate the file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not attempt Method 2 because I am worried about uninstalling IE no knowing&nbsp;if I actually have IE 9; 10; or 11.&nbsp; If I do not have "rep-installed" (?) IE 9 how do I resinstall IE and then which one?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried the Compatibility mode previously but it didn't change anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to be such a problem child.&nbsp; I hope I have answered all of your questions thus far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your continued assistance and support.</p>
<p>Ralph</p>

<p>I went back and look at the Windows updates again and noticed that those failures date back as far as December 4 - with multiple failures on some dates.&nbsp; It probably doesn't make much difference but that's about when my problems started.</p>

            <p>Hello Ralph,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for following up with all the steps. However, I would like to make few rectifications in the way you followed method 1. The command that you typed in was:
</p>
<div><strong>iexplore-extoff</strong>, but there is a space between <em>iexplore</em> and
<em>-extoff</em>, you need to type <strong>iexplore</strong>&lt;space&gt;<strong>-extoff
</strong>i.e.,<strong> iexplore -extoff</strong> and hit ENTER in the RUN Window, as described in Method 1.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now, about uninstalling Internet Explorer 10 on your system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You need not to worry about uninstalling the current version of Internet Explorer, unless it is Internet Explorer 8 (the default version for Windows 7), because if you uninstall any higher version of Internet Explorer, it will itself revert back to the
 previous version that was ever installed, or to the default version. So, you can definitely uninstall Internet Explorer 10 or 9 installed in your system and check with the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, you may try restoring your system back to any date prior to December 4, 2013. To do so, please refer to the following link:</div>

    <title>Transferring my files, contacts, calendar, tasks from Dell Axim X5 to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dubs2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transferring my files, contacts, calendar, tasks from Dell Axim X5 to HP iPAQ 210</h2>
                    How can I get all my data from my outdated PDA that synchronizes with ActiveSync 3.5 and Outlook 2000&nbsp;to the iPAQ 210 that uses ActiveSync 4.5 that doesn't support 3.5.<br />
For the last year I have been using a PC with XP SP2. I was eventually&nbsp;able to "downgrade" the Outlook to Otulook&nbsp;2000 to synchronize and&nbsp;to open it, although most features don't work.&nbsp;<br />
Can I upgrade the Outlook without losing the data in it?&nbsp;<br />
My files are converted to Windows Word&nbsp;1997-2003 files. <br />
Would it be easier to get a used iPAQ HX4705 that uses Windows Mobile 2003 and can be upgraded to Windows Mobile 5?<br />
Any help would be appreciated. <br />
Thank you.

            Hey dubs2, <br />
<br />
Good to hear that. Working with legacy equipment and files is very challenging and you are very modest in your assessment of your computer skills. You know EXACTLY what is going on. I'm glad it went as "well" as it did for you. There are alot of horror stories
 about upgrading from lower versions of Activesync. And your "downgraded" installation of Outlook 2007 is not giving you too much problem. I would still recommend that PIM Backup program to you for the iPAQ. At some point there is a requirement for that dreaded
 hard reset as you probably know. Although probably not at critical for a PDA to have that info right at hand, it still is nice to know you have them somewhere in case your PC happens to go out at the same time. Haha. Good luck and enjoy the iPAQ. When the
 devices are working right, they are fun to use, but when they act up you want to throw them against the wall and smash 'em! Don't hesitate to post back with any questions.

            Hi fiat-lux,<br />
After several hours and some frustration I managed last night to get my PIM data and the Word files on the new iPAQ.<br />
I first uninstalled the Outlook 2000 and "activated" the Outlook 2007 on my PC. Since I am not familiar with the Outlook, I had some trouble setting up a new profile that was a prerequisite. It was a little confusing that the Outlook folder did not contain
 my latest backup .pst file, but I was able to import it from the My Documents folder. Fortunately, I accidentally had noticed that the Personal Folders File came in two different formats: the default woul not have worked for my Word 1997-2002 files.<br />
I then removed ActiveSync 3.5 from my PC to install 4.5. The synchronization of my PIM data was successful.<br />
It took me a while to figure out that I had to copy the Word files from the Axim folder to the newly created iPAQ folder. After synchronizing the files there was an error message on the PC - I didn't write down the code - but it was gone after reconnecting
 the device. I synchronized again today to check: there was no error code. Hopefully, everything is ok. The files on the iPAQ seem to be fine.<br />
I don't know yet how to use the iPAQ beyond the most basic operations. I was able to get a WIFI connection and access a web site without understanding how it works.<br />
I might have more questions later on.<br />
For now I am very happy and grateful to the Forum for the ongoing help that allowed me to finally resolve this issue that had been a stumbling block for a long time.<br />
Many thanks especially to you, fiat_lux!

            Despite its location, that text is in a text box that's part of the page footer. Put your cursor in the area at the bottom of the page, below the border, and right-click; then click the Edit Footer menu item. That will make the text box editable.<br />

<h2>            Outlook search results screen doesn&#39;t show the whole subject of the mails</h2>
                    <p><span>When I go to inbox or any other screen I can see the whole subject of the mails. But on search results screen outlook crops subjects.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example the whole subject is this:&nbsp;<b>RE: Microsoft Office Outlook 2010</b></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On search results screen the subject is either of the following:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b><span>RE: Microsoft</span></b><span>,&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is disturbing especially when you are trying to decide according to the subject of the mail.</span></p>

<p>Hi SFWA_ITA,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you said the Outlook reminders randomly set to None, my understanding is that some meetings are showing the default reminder time – 15 minutes in your outlook client.<span>&nbsp;
</span>And concerned you are using Outlook 1803 build 9126.2282, first please try to upgrade your outlook client to the latest version and then see if it can make any difference.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Please click File &gt; Office Account &gt; Update Options &gt; Update Now and have a try, thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, as you said the reminders of the meetings you created or accepted were set to None randomly.<span>&nbsp;
</span>As far as <span>&nbsp;</span>I know if you clicked Dismiss or Dismiss All Button after you received the meeting reminders in the Outlook Client, the reminders time of that meeting will be set to None, and you will not receive reminders later, please
 double check this scenario on your side, thanks.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can try to upgrade the outlook to the latest version and then create some new test meetings in the
<strong>future days</strong>, after that please check if you could see the reminder time set to 15 minutes in the outlook ribbon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, for the meetings/appointments happened in the past time, the reminder time will be set to None.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example today is 3/14<sup>th</sup>, the meetings created before 3/14<sup>th</sup> and the reminder of that meeting will be set to None, please double check if the meeting time is in the past, thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you got any updates on your side, please feel free to let me know, thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Oliver</p>

            hi guys,<br />
<br />
i pressume that you are talking about the active standby where the todo or the appointments are being shown, well, AFAIK if you have made new appointments it will show, and also the latest txt, however there are no other things that can be added to it like
 plug-ins that you are talking about...

                    After updating my Lumia 800 to windows phone 7.8 it won't start up Internet Explorer. When I click it, it just flickers one time and nothing else happens. It's a bit of af problem as some apps and a lot of links uses IE as default explorer. Any ideas about
 what I can do?

            <p>My wife &amp; I both have HTC Trophy's from the same shop.&nbsp;We both have updated to 7.8 and it worked fine. After three weeks she&nbsp;now has the same issue with I.E. not opening, while my HTC works just fine. I suspect one the apps is affecting the behavior?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyhow here is the fix: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to&nbsp;Settings / Internet Explorer</p>
<p>Change "Open links from other applications"&nbsp; to&nbsp; "The Current Tab"<br />

            <p>Had the same problem. Today,&nbsp;it stopped working totally. Undoing the update didn't work. I just restored factory settings and that seems to have solved the IE&nbsp;problem for now. Note that restoring to factory settings doesn't revert the phone software back
 to WP 7.5 but leaves it as 7.8.</p>

<h2>            microsoft document image writer says I don&#39;t have permission to write to folder.  I am administrator for the entire computer</h2>
                    I installed microsoft image writer per instructions on this website but everytime I try to print and save to a folder that I have complete access to, it tells me that I don't have permission to that (ANY) folder to save the tif file.&nbsp; I had Windows XP
 with Office 2003 and it always worked fine.&nbsp; Now, after building a new system with Windows XP and Office 2010, it didn't have image writer so I had to install it and I can't get it to save tif files at all in any folder.&nbsp; I can access and do anything I want
 in all folders but I can't get image writer to save a file when I use the print command.

            It sounds like a windows access rights problem. Find out what authority the program is running under and confirm the folders have appropriate rights.<br />

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<b>How to fix Access Rights problem</b>
<p>Sometimes the problem has been that Windows has had problems granting the right access to files, folders and the registry. The following tips provide some workarounds.</p>
<p>As you go from XP to Vista to Win7 certain operations require higher access rights to perform. These access rights are “higher” than even those granted to the Administrator ID by default. These “elevated” rights are accessed by way of
 the UAC confirmation dialog which is invoked when you select to “Run As Administrator”.</p>
<p>In theory, any one of the following tips should work.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The process is: run one of the fixes, run each affected Office app, reboot TWICE (sorry, I don’t know why, but there appears to be some “Voodoo” at play here. We do it because it works!) TWICE (sorry, I don’t know why, but there appears to be some “Voodoo”
 at play here. We do it because it works!), try the office apps again to confirm the fix worked.</p>
<p>If you want to first confirm that access rights are a problem this article describes how:

            <p>This is becoming VERY perplexing.&nbsp; I did what was described above and can go in and see that I have all rights to everything on the computer.&nbsp; So, I checked the microsoft document image writer Printer properties and did a Print Test Page and it worked perfectly
 and displayed a copy of what the Test Page was in the viewer.&nbsp; I went to the folder and deleted the test page from the folder and logged on here to thank you.&nbsp; But then, I thought I ought to check with a REAl print job to the folder first.&nbsp; When I clicked
 on Print, selected the Image Writer printer and told it what folder to save it in, it came back with the same stinking message it keeps giving me.&nbsp; "you don't have permission to save in this location.&nbsp; Contact the administrator to obtain permission".&nbsp; It won't
 let me print to ANY folder anywhere on the computer, but I went back and verified, it will print a Test Page to any folder I pick.&nbsp; All I can do with this Image writer is save a test page but nothing else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>More info.&nbsp; I went into Outlook and told it to print one of my messages.&nbsp; Selected Image Writer and told it to save in the folder I've been trying to save to.&nbsp; Microsoft Outlook save the message to the folder without any trouble.&nbsp; What I use (when it worked
 with XP) the Image Writer for, is to open Webpages of my accounting data and save those pages to a folder instead of printing them out and scanning them into my computer in that folder.&nbsp; For some unknown reason, I can get Outlook to save a file using Image
 Writer but I can't get&nbsp;Image Writer&nbsp;to work from any other application like Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just did another test.&nbsp; It looks like Image Writer works with the Office applications.&nbsp; I just saved a Word document to the folder using Image Writer.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to get it to work with Internet Explorer?&nbsp; I just tried to print this page with
 Image Writer and it told me I don't have permission to save to the same folder that I can save a Print Test Page, or and Outlook message, or a Word document.&nbsp; It appears to be strictly associated with Explorer.</p>

            <p>I know this is an old thread, but has anyone found a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very frustrating being able to generate a tif file using the image writer from any application except Internet Explorer.&nbsp; The error message is nonsense as the image writer will save the file to the required location provided it is not being printed
 from Internet Explorer; from IE it will not save it anywhere, including to the 'Photos' folder which is the option the error message suggests.</p>

    <title>&#34;From&#34; name field incorrect when sending from Gmail accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alext_yyc  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;From&#34; name field incorrect when sending from Gmail accounts within Outlook</h2>
                    <p>Okay, I feel like I should mention upfront that I've tried absolutely everything I can think of. I also apologize for the length of this, but I'd like to be thorough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that I'm having concerns the name that would appear to a recipient who does
<strong>not have me in his or her address book. </strong>All of what I'm about to explain assumes the recipient of my email does not have me in their address book, and therefore the name that is displayed in their inbox comes from me/the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Outlook for Mac (part of Office 365). Up until recently, I had my Gmail accounts within Outlook configured manually: I set up the server info, and was able to define parameters such as "Full Name" which obviously controlled how my emails appeared
 to the recipient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't remember why I did this, but I deleted my accounts and re-added them, except this time all the configuration was done automatically. All I had to do was confirm my Google login info through an auto-launched page that came from Outlook. Nice and easy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After setting the accounts up again, the Full Name field under Outlook &gt; Preferences &gt; Accounts is now greyed out. The name in there appears exactly as I have defined it on my actual Google account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While inconvenient (I like to be able to control how my name appears), this alone isn't why I'm here. Initially I had only my first name and last initial as my "Full Name" on my Google account, so this is what Outlook brought over into that greyed-out field.
 But when I send emails, I want my actual full first and last name to appear. So I went back to my Google account (in web browser), changed my name at the account level, deleted the Gmail account from Outlook, and then set it up again in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first and last name now appear correctly in the "Full Name" field, but recipients of my emails still only see my first name and last initial on the emails! It's been weeks, and I've tried everything. I'm 99% sure it's an issue at the Outlook side because
 everything shows up correctly on my Google account, and emails sent from every other device display perfectly (they also allow me to configure the send-from name independently of what is on my Google account, mind you...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm probably butchering the terminology here, but is it possible that data is still left over after I delete an account from Outlook, and therefore when I set that same account up again, it's still using certain fields that were present when I set up the
 account for the very first time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of ideas at this point... I'd like to avoid uninstalling everything, but I'm beginning to wonder if this is the only option? One workaround is for me to set up the account manually, which allows me to define my Full Name (which then displays correctly
 on emails). But then I lose out on some of the functionality that comes along with the auto-configured setup of my account. Grr.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance. And very sorry again about the massively sprawling post!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can provide screenshots if needed!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Full Name and Displayed Name are two different fields. They are not strictly consistent, especially when you have just changed the Full Name. You may check if you can send messages with the new Full Name displayed from the webmail of Gmail. If not you may
 wait for &nbsp;24-48 hours to have the change take effect. After that you make re-add your account and see if it works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above suggestion doesn’t help, it’s recommended to contact the Outlook for Mac in-app support where our experts will provide you with dedicated suggestions. Simply go to
<strong>Help </strong>&gt;<strong> Contact Support</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your understanding is much appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Header 1 not aligned across two columns</h2>
                    <p>I am editing a newsletter and am concerned about it not looking professional due to misaligned columns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two columns per page.&nbsp;At the head of each column is a Heading 1 header. Whilst they are the same, they have managed to format themselves differently. When showing paragraph marks, there is a small square mark above and to the left of the first
 rows's. That mark pushes the header down slightly. The second row does not have the mark and so is not pushed down and so they two rows are not vertically aligned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double-clicking on the ruler for each column shows the page vertical alignment to be
<strong>Top</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other two-column instances are correctly aligned as they all have the mark.<br />

            The difference is probably in the treatment of Spacing Before in the heading style, which varies with version and depending on whether or not you have used a manual column break. The easiest way to align the two headings is to remove the Spacing Before
 from the one that is lower.

<h3> tofishteacher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2007 - gradient page color printing incorrectly - prints as a repeating gradient stripe rather than WYSIWYG of one single dark-light-dark gradient on page</h2>
                    The gradient "page color" I am using (2-color white+beige horizontal dark-light-dark) isn't printing correctly.&nbsp; Instead of printing 1/3 page dark then gradually 1/3 page white then gradually the last 3rd dark again, it prints 20 gradient "stripes" dark-light-dark-light-dark-etc
 horizontally all the way down the page.&nbsp; This problem exists even when I print to a PDF file.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can't imagine that it is something I'm doing wrong as it seems like my printouts should come out WYSIWYG and my document looks exactly like I want it when I look
 at it in Word 2007.&nbsp; But maybe there is a workaround?

            <p>You should upgrade normally instead of running the installer. Start by going to the MS web site for windows 10.

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>

</p><p>Make sure your computer meets the requirements for windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
