<h2>            Help - I can&#39;t see video picture but I can hear audio when playing video in any program....</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>A strange scenario.&nbsp; My Windows 8.1 laptop was working perfectly fine and displaying video in all programs.&nbsp; While sitting on the couch and watching live TV in windows Media Center, I was moving my wireless Windows Keyboard and accidently dropped it a few
 inches onto my lap.&nbsp; While catching it, I inadvertently touched some of the keys (No idea which ones as the keyboard was upside down).&nbsp; However, now I am unable to view video in any application (I can hear it, but can't see anything).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an example,&nbsp;I can still hear the sound and see the time proceeding forward, can pause, rewind, forward, etc.&nbsp;but I still only have a black screen (or green screen in youtube inside of Explorer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am thinking I might have some sort of quick key, function key or some other sort that disabled the video picture from displaying while it is playing.&nbsp; Does anyone have any ideas on what I might have hit and what button(s) on the keyboard I could hit to
 fix it?&nbsp; Or does anyone have any ideas on where I can look in the computer settings to reset the overall video playing functionality?&nbsp; I am pretty sure this is definitely not an issue with just one program&nbsp;or software&nbsp;application as it seems to be overall
 system related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any ideas or insights anyone might have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kevin</p>

            <p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that the issue occurred after the little accident that you had with your keyboard, I would suggest to restore your PC to an earlier point in time when everything was running fine. Refer to the article given below and expand '<strong>Restore
 your PC to an earlier point in time</strong>'</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How to refresh, reset, or restore your PC </strong></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state, programs and updates you installed are removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>

            Hi Pathally
<br />
<br />Have you been experiencing blue screens or system crashes?
<br />
<br />If not, this is nothing to worry about, Windows will generate errors all the time and is designed to recover from these errors automatically.
<br />
<br />This happens on all Windows systems and unless you are experiencing system crashes, is best not to worry about this, Windows is very clever at recovery without any user intervention . ..

            Hi  IrBlueSky
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />It depends on the make and model of the computer, not all computers will include support. Some computers might only support legacy BIOS.
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of the computer and how old is it?
<br />
<br />Have you booting directly into the firmware interface to see if its visible there? 
<br />
<br />See steps:

            Hi IrBlueSky 
<br />
<br />Some manufacturers add the UEFI Firmware settings to the Recovery Environment settings page, some just leave that option in BIOS
<br />
<br />Since that does not appear on that page, boot your PC into BIOS (Usually the F2 Key on the manufacturers screen as it boots)
<br />
<br />In BIOS, you should find the UEFI options . . .

            Hi YF.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you all possible steps to troubleshoot installation failure which work in about 90% of cases.  If not we'll go from there:
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI:   <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />Create the latest new Windows 10 Installation Media by installing Media Creation Tool and following the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Would like to look at Rollback logs.
<br />
<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />
<br />and 
<br />
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing the path in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.

            Hi YFLAI 
<br />
<br />At what point in the process did you get that error, was that when you were creating the installation Flash Drive or during the re-installation. If that was during the re-installation, how far into the process did that error happen?
<br />
<br />Have you thought about resetting Windows, the end result would be the same and it is a lot easier to do . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

<p>We have a new laptop with Windows 10.</p>
<p>Wish to transfer photos and videos from IPod to laptop.</p>
<p>Have opened Photos App and all photos 'seen' and selected, but what then??</p>
<p>I cannot find any command/prompt/icon to indicate how to start the transfer/copy process.</p>
<p>Do I need I-Tunes for Windows 10, or should a simple file copy/transfer work here?</p>
<p>Are there are any REAL GUIDES on how to use the Photo App?</p>

            <p>Hello Heulwen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your requirement in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually Photos app help you to import photos or videos without the need of third-party software. However due to some restrictions with the source device you might experience some problems while importing them to Windows 10. This is as per the design of that
 particular Phone or&nbsp;a Cam. To overcome this, device manufacturer provide you a PC suite, which actually acts a graphical interface to accomplish this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're the one who has same issues, then use iTunes for importing images to your PC. Make sure you have the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/HT201352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">latest version of
 iTunes</span></a>. Use the same to import photos and videos from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch to your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</p>

            <p>While helpful the response referred to phones, not an IPod. However I did manage to copy the photographs across using File Explorer.</p>
<p>I also tried to download ITunes for Windows but kept getting a incomplete web page; none of the download options worked, among 'other things'.</p>
<p>Still trying for the download though; it seems our internet connection is a little unreliable!!!</p>

<h2>            I need help please&#33; Can&#39;t get sound to come out of my Speakers</h2>
                    
<p>Ihave a ViewSonic VCT2430 LCD TV and up until about a month ago the speakers worked perfectly, just like everything else about the monitor. They just stopped all sound from coming out about&nbsp; a month ago. The sound still works for when I have it set as a
 tv or my xbox, the very same HDMI cable I run to my computer works for my Xbox. I have been using cheap 3$ headphones since and they work. I just tryed using driver genius to get a fix, and while I downloaded and installed the driver, nothing new came of it
 except a distorted crackling sound for .5 seconds after it installed after the restart of the computer.&nbsp; I also have used anoher monitor connected by VGA and the speakers work there. I have tryed so many things and the only hing that seems to have happened
 was the crackling sound I made it happen for .5 seconds. This is literally driving me insane. Can somebody please please help me?</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><strong><span>You may also perform a system restore to an earlier point when the issue was not present.</span></strong><span><span>The
 System Restore tool uses restore points to return system files and settings to an earlier point in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in which you did not experience the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Note: When you use System restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>To do this, there must be a System Restore point at which the logon was successful.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer to the below links for assistance on performing a system restore -<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-is-System-Restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-is-System-Restore</span></a><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><strong><span>You can also use the audio troubleshooter and check if it lists any issues -</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter</span></span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to check if the drivers are properly installed. Try uninstall and then reinstalling the drivers –</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>, and then click &nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Click &nbsp;<strong>System and Maintenance</strong>, click&nbsp;<strong>System</strong>, and then click&nbsp;
<strong>Device Manager</strong>. <br />
<strong>Note</strong> If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click &nbsp;<strong>System</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click&nbsp;<strong>Allow</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. In Device Manager, expand the category for the device, and then click&nbsp;<strong>properties
</strong>and under the&nbsp; <strong>driver</strong> tab click on&nbsp;<strong>Uninstall</strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. When you are prompted to confirm that you want to remove the device, click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. Restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After the computer restarts, the drivers will be automatically installed. Check after this procedure.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Check if you have any exclamation mark or cross marks alongside the display devices listed in device manager. If you do have then there
 is issue with the driver installed.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks,<br />

<h2>            Vista won&#39;t start, Startup repair fails saying the operating system version is incompatible with startup repair</h2>
                    
<p>I am using a Dell XPS M1330 laptop, running Vista Home Premium 32Bit. The laptop was freezing, I attempted to do a System Restore, which did not work. Now the laptop goes into Startup Repair whenever turned on. A message window appears saying "Startup Repair
 cannot repair the computer automatically". The startup repair window says "Startup Repair could not detect a problem". The diagnostic details say: Root cause found: The operating system version is incompatible with Startup Repair.</p>
<p>I have tried to use the Dell Factory Image Restore to restore the system, but it doesn't finish. I get an error message instead. There are no details, it is just a small window with an X and the word error.</p>
<p>I have also tried using the Dell reinstallation DVD, but that does not seem to work either.</p>
<p>Vista will not start at all- not in safe mode either.</p>
<p>I just ran the Dell Diagnostics tool and it is saying that the Memory integrity test failed.. Any idea how to fix this?</p>
<p>I am at a loss and any help woukld be appreciated.</p>

<p><span>Hi James,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are you using
 the correct version of the Vista disc to run the start up repair?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run the Memory diagnostic tool from WINRE mode and check if the Memory (RAM)
 installed on the computer is working fine. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps below to boot the computer in WINRE mode and run Memory diagnostic tool.</span></p>
<p><span>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Insert the Windows Vista installation disc.</span></p>
<p><span>B.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Restart your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>C.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer.
 You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For more information, see BIOS: frequently asked questions.</span></p>
<p><span>D.<span>&nbsp;</span>Choose your language settings, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>E.<span>&nbsp;</span>Click Repair your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>F.<span>&nbsp;</span>Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>G.<span>&nbsp;</span>On the System Recovery Options menu, Select<span>Memory diagnostic tool</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once the scan is complete, check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>

<p><span>If you have multiple RAM sticks installed on the computer, you may try to remove one of the RAM stick
 and check if it works fine. Also you may try to swap the RAM sticks and check if any one of the RAM is causing this issue and if it needs to be replaced.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: If you are unaware of changing and swaping the RAM stick on the computer, it would be better
 to contact the Computer manufacturer to help you on this and you may do it with your own risk.</span></p>

<h2>            Direct x 10 and 11&#63; Motherboard, or graphics card&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. I don't know if this is the right forum for my question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a bit confused about Direct x 10 and 11. I understand Vista&nbsp;uses 10, and Win7&nbsp;uses 11. My question is: Does DirectX 10 or 11 or 9, etc have to do with the OS, The motherboard or a graphics card?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have looked at motherboards and they said DirectX 10. But they were Windows 7 ready. These motherboards also had onboard graphics. If someone purchased or had one of these motherboards: Can they install a certain kind of graphics card and windows 7, then
 utilize DirectX 11? Or is it up to the hardware of the mobo?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p><span><span><strong>Hi Brian V V,<br />
</strong>Direct X has to do with graphics card. If the graphics card is integrated, then it has to do with motherboard.<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>You can install additional graphics card only if the system meets the requirements. You may check with the documentation came with your system before installing graphics card.<br />

<div>I would like to know, how many partitions are there on your system? And do you store your data on any such partition (other than windows partition)?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Because, If you have other partitions, you can simply place all the data you don't want to lose on one such partition (say partition X) and while upgrading, install the new version of windows to the partition on which the old one was installed. But don't
 forget to transfer all your personal data from even your user folder to the X partition, lest you might lose it after the upgrade.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And I believe windows upgrade also provides ways to upgrade without losing any of your personal data.</div>

<div>Good luck!</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 causing sudden hard drive death</h2>
                    Hi, here's the issue. I build PC's all the time, since 1996. I've done several Windows 10 installs both retail &amp; upgrade, which destroyed the hard drive on one brand new build, &amp; upon upgrade on my own PC, wasted my entire 4TB RAID array (worked fine under
 windows 7). Testing the drives using Tuff Test Pro, they all come up with total failure, while the SMART function passes. These are 2 examples recently, like in 2 months. I'ld say 5 jobs so far killed the hard drives on various PC's after upgrading. These
 hard drives are no more than a year old in each case &amp; brand new in one. This is far from coincidence at this point. It does seem to depend on the PC but not age or anything else related to the hard drive. It actually damages the platters, rendering the drive
 useless, even in the case of a new drive. I'm currently using a back up PC to write this as my very expensive custom I built is down. The latest failure is a brand new build, put together last week &amp; the customer

<p>It does not fix this issue ever. As I said in my post, after upgrading a Windows 7 PC, sudden HDD death has occurred on several units. Also in 1 new build so far &amp; in my custom PC I built that cost about $3k my cost to build. Lost $450 in drives only a year
 old. I still need to verify each drive in the array is shot, I'm sure they are &amp; it won't take Windows 7 back from a fresh install. Now I just got done installing 10 on this brand new HDD in the unit I was repairing today that failed after the 1st install.
 So far it went ok. I need to boot it back up in a few. I did notice that it occurs more often if you power the unit down &amp; unplug it, then plug it back in &amp; turn it back on. That's when it will have a corrupt boot camp screen &amp; just freeze. I then test the
 HDD &amp; it's bad. My customer's high end unit I just built is coming back to me tomorrow for the Bad_Pool_Header problem. All his screen shows is a start up screen with a "sad" face, "Windows could not start"&nbsp;&amp; that error at the bottom. He tried restarting so
 many times that his issue is pretty bad. I'll know more about his issue when I diagnose it. Everyone who posts about this issue gets the same response from Microsoft that you gave. It simply does not work, period. Since 1996 I've been building PC's. I know
 all the work arounds, tricks, etc., none work on this issue in 10. I'll reply again if this drive I just put in this unit I have here now works or fails in a bit. In the mean time, why don't you guys grab some older PC's, like 2010 or so &amp; you'll see what
 I mean. Also try a clean install on a PC that was upgraded. Wipe the drive, clean install on it &amp; you'll see the same result over &amp; over. I even had an issue upgrading a Dell laptop from 2013 that had Windows 8.1 on it. It's a weird issue that I've never seen
 before.</p>

            I've only installed Windows 10 4 times and so far had 3 dead hard drives, each one ticking after a few days of running Windows 10. Never had trouble with these drives in the past running Win7 or Ubuntu - Win10 seems to be at fault. Had the BSOD relating
 to Memory Management on the last dead drive - possible memory caching problem?...

            <p>Nope. Has nothing to do with memory. I think I narrowed this issue down to hardware at this point. If you look at "task mgr." in Windows 10, notice how disk intensive it is as opposed to Windows 7. Age of the drive doesn't seem to be a problem as indicated
 by myself &amp;&nbsp; "MI" above. I have found that using a mechanical drive is just not a good idea for Windows 10 as a main drive. I've built several new units &amp; every one with just a mechanical drive was too slow for the customer &amp; me, due to lag &amp; general slowness.
 While appearing to be at "full boot", there's still 80% of the programs needed for Windows to run right loading even though you can see all your icons&nbsp;&amp; even go online. What I have done&nbsp;&amp; continue to do is run a SSD "boot" drive to keep cost down, then add
 a 1TB or larger for storing data like games, pictures, documents, etc. I personally run a 240gb SSD &amp; a 3TB 64mb cache, 7200rpm, 6G SATA hard drive with zero issues with my machine running an AMD 8150 @ 4.6GHZ 24/7. I mention the O.C. to prove it doesn't matter
 with this problem as many of my clients are gamers. </p>
<p>I also addressed the "upgrade" slowness in a separate post, see that as well. Says almost the same thing, except applies strictly to the "upgrade" process. This is a "hotrod" operating system, not as bad as people think. I don't think Microsoft anticipated
 nor tested the number of read/writes &amp; general stress this OS places on a mechanical drive. Not just the moving parts, the controller card on back is what "fries" causing the "clicking" &amp; lack access to data. Those drives are shot but the data can be retrieved,
 so don't toss it unless you don't care. Another issue with disk access relates to the "improved" search including Cortana, searching online &amp; off unless you tell it not to. All these BSOD's not related to a video driver is caused by the hard drive not being
 able to keep up with the number of read/writes &amp; amount of data that Windows 10 can handle. So your controller card, which has a memory base of 8MB or more can "fail" or "miss a beat" &amp; you BSOD.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;So if you insist on&nbsp; using mechanical hard drives or just can't afford to step up to the new standard of using SSD type drives, keep your over clocking down, &amp; turn off any unused Windows component that boots with the OS. Turn off all the extras like Cortana
 &amp; keep searches to "your stuff", not the web as well. Make sure to use a new high quality hard drive. If using an old drive, same applies as far as turning off a lot&nbsp; of Windows **** not needed by home users. I have found that if running a mechanical drive,
 Windows 7 is the best OS choice of all. The PC's &amp; laptops built today still have mechanical drives &amp; continue to come into my shop for SSD replacements. People come to me specifically for that after they buy their laptop new! They toss factory warranty to
 the wind &amp; have me clone a SSD for them, they even let me keep the new mechanical drive. That's nice, but no one wants them! I just use them for storage drives.
</p>
<p>Sorry for the long version but wanted to be thorough. Microsoft's problem is their new OS is too good for the utter **** being built today. We were used to OS's that were "forgiving" to loose hardware specs &amp; cheap components. Windows 10 is tight &amp; fast,
 so if your stuff can't keep up, then boom BSOD or some other crash. With all OEM's , replace the hard drive with a better one or an SSD. OEM drives are made to last only 2 years as per HP. I don't care what&nbsp;make or how hard you use your computer, if your OEM&nbsp;hard
 drive is mechanical &amp; 3 years old, replace it. The "aftermarket" version of the same hard drive is a million times better than that batch purchased OEM drive. Same goes for buying "new" hard drives. I stopped using "blister pack" drives &amp; only use retail boxed
 due to better quality. </p>
<p>&nbsp;SP, try some of the things I said like turning off a lot of windows stuff that boots with the OS &amp; if possible always put the OS on an SSD. Mechanical is fine for games, larger programs, files, etc., since Windows 10 isn't running on those. I tried loading
 maps using a game loaded on my SSD vs. my 3TB mechanical &amp; there was no time able difference &amp; zero decrease in frame rate. My disk speed numbers are way up with a 450mb/s, R/W combined using this combo. I don't even know what a BSOD is anymore on mine. Everyone
 wants faster but forgets that the hard drive &amp; that data bus is the slowest part of the computer, the main "bottle neck" in all systems. Microsoft will refute this saying mechanical drives are fine but not for Windows 10. Not for the long haul or for speed.
 They "work" would be a correct statement. If they told us we all needed to upgrade to SSD's &amp; change our video cards to run Windows 10, no one would be running out to get it.

            <p>OK I'm not a developer or professional. but it's now getting ridiculous. &nbsp;I've had 4 hard drives physically fail after a windows 10 update on 4 different computers over the last 3 months. 2 were on Asus models and 2 on Toshibas.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In each case none of the provided recovery and repair solutions provided work. Independent 3rd party software assessments are also unable to recover. In each case any attempt to repair, reformat the drive has failed, Fortunately in each case I've managed
 to go in a back door (i.e. pull the drive and use 3rd party software) to recover the data but the drive unit itself is rendered useless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>in each case the ONLY action that has remedied the problem is a new hard drive with a new install of windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've owned dozens of computers and laptops since the advent of the Apple 2e. Until last September I've Never had a hard drive failure. &nbsp;(understanding they do happen on occasion) but then having 4 in quick succession, (the two Asus laptops in September,
 and the 2 Toshiba's this weekend) I'm sorry that is statistically so improbable that there is something going on. The only common factor is a Windows 10 update was underway when all 4 failures occurred. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please I understand for liability reasons no-one will admit this as an issue but I suspect there is enough anecdotal evidence out there that there is an issue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I just recently ask this question on Microsoft forums too. Had two notebooks fail one after only six months from new with Windows 10 running and the other ran fine until I upgraded to Windows 10 from 8.1. My past experience was zero with hard drive failures
 previous to this. Had probably a dozen or more notebooks without a single drive failure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I seriously began to correlate Windows 10 with these failures when I researched other forums and found many with hard drive failures either after upgrading to Win 10 or with a recently purchased PC with Win 10 installed. These were PC's with hard drives
 that had very low failure rates according to stats I could access online. I completely agree that Windows 10 is doing a lot in the background and the drive appears very busy at times, besides the fact that every six months or so, the PC cycles through a very
 intensive upgrade cycle to the next Win 10 release. This has to place a burden on the drive. Maybe the fact that notebooks have become smaller, thinner and provide less air flow on some models could also contribute to failures? Because I see much less failures
 with desktop PC's then notebooks. I think its something to consider and investigate further. I had not indication of failure either, SMART monitoring gave no indication of failure, and until I began to see signs of failure such a freezing, apps not loading
 and errors, did I even begin to test for failure. With one notebook a HP Pavilion 15 the tests actually finished off the drive for good and gave a early failure indicator result. This did not even provide me with a time frame to back up data on the drive.
 Word of caution the SMART system is not something to depend on for drive failure indicators.&nbsp;</p>

            At present, we use a computer with no separate accounts, and individual teen children have their own computers of which they are administrators. They may want filtering, as I do, so as not to have to have inappropriate content in the home. and being teens
 filtering also helps. They have not indicated that they don't want filtering, however, perhaps the wording could be something other than &nbsp;'child' account, for adults and teens. Also do I need to get admin status on their personal computers?&nbsp;

    <title>Cannot remove Read-Only property on files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot remove Read-Only property on files</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm facing an issue about my files, they had all turned into read-only, I'm not sure if this caused by the win10 update or the virus as I notice after the win 10 update in these few days.</p>
<p>Currently, I can still delete my files(even if the files with read-only property), but the read-only property keeps on the folders and some document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What it affect me the most is that I cannot my changes cannot apply to the files if I edit it by opening them from another program.<br />
</p>
<p>I tried several ways to solve it, but mow the situation become strange. I tried to remove the property by "<strong>right click&gt; property&gt; cancel the tick on the read-only option&gt; apply</strong>", this will show you it removed the property , but if you close
 the property windows and reopen again, you'll see the read-only label is still exist.</p>
<p>I tried to solve it from cmd using command "<strong>attrib -r (file name)</strong>", the cmd will then tell you the property is removed even if you close it and reopen it to check, but it is still the same situation outside the cmd, &nbsp;"<strong>right click&gt;
 property</strong>" show you the same read-only label.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using&nbsp;kaspersky 2019, it didn't report me any virus about this.</p>
<p>Can anyone give me some suggestions please?</p>
<p>Many thanks for all your help.</p>

<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center 
<br />
<br />Go to Virus &amp; threat protection - Virus &amp; threat protection settings 
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access 
<br />
<br />Temporarily turn off Controlled Folder Access
<br />
<br />Then check if you have full access to those files
<br />
<br />From there, you can add any app to the list of safe or allowed apps to prevent them from being blocked
<br />
<br />Please Note: do not leave Controlled Folder Access disabled, you would leave your PC open to a ransomware attack . ..

            Hi,
<br />seems you are talking about read-only attribute of folders not files.
<br />For folders such behavior is absolutely normal, folder's read-only attribute has no physical sense and does not affect file access so Windows use it for internal purposes since Windows 98.

<p>The gray square that appears in the Read-only checkbox in a folder's Properties dialog is not a status indicator.&nbsp; Additionally, the read-only attribute on folders doesn't prevent writing to those folders.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Error Code 8194, Volume Shadow Copy Service error</h2>
                    
<p>For the past few months, my system restore points on Windows 7 have been vanishing after rebooting. I am running a Windows 7/Vista dualboot. I was checking the Event Viewer for VSS, and I see a bunch of "8194" errors. Here's what they all say:</p>

<p><span><span><span>Hi,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Are
 there any third party backup programs installed or other file management programs?</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>What
 security software is installed?</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you make any changes on your computer before this issue occurred?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Try temporarily disabling any anti-virus / anti-malware and test if the errors persist.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>To do so refer to the link provided below:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong></span><span><span>: Make sure to enable the
 antivirus once the issue is fixed.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Check the</span><span>Reliability monitor</span><span><span>for
 any changes (installs, updates, etc) made prior to the errors first starting. Refer to the link provided below:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-to-use-Reliability-Monitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/How-to-use-Reliability-Monitor</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>To perform this procedure, you must have membership in<strong>Administrators</strong>, or you must have
 been delegated the appropriate authority.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>To verify that the Volume Shadow Copy Service is started:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>a)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click<strong>Start</strong>,
 point to <strong>Administrative</strong> <strong>Tools</strong>, and then click<strong>Services</strong>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>b)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>In
 the results pane, double-click<strong>Volume Shadow Copy</strong>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>c)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>In
 Service status, make sure that the status is<strong>Started</strong>. If the status is
<strong>not</strong> <strong>Started</strong>, click<strong>Start</strong>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>d)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Make
 sure Startup type is set to<strong>Manual</strong>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>e)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Click<strong>OK</strong>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I would suggest you to try performing<strong>SFC (System File Checker)</strong> scan on your computer and check
 if the issue still persists. To view how to perform the<strong>SFC Scan</strong> click on the link provided below and follow the Microsoft Kb article steps.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>I tried all the methods you listed. None of them work. It's odd, I disabled my anti-virus software (AVG Internet Security), and I created a restore point manually, and I check my HDD, and it clearly showed that the restore point took up 2GB. Now, when I
 restart to see if it's still there, the HDD GAINED the 2GB back, and System Restore says I have no restore points. I also checked the Reliability Monitor, it doesn't show any errors on the first day I got the 8194 error. It doesn't even list it there. Any
 other ideas? SFC didn't find any problems, either. I also increased the maximum System Restore space to 26GB, and it still deletes it upon reboot.</p>

<p>Hi Dimms,</p>
<p>I found this information that might pertain to your issue:</p>
<p>"In this version of <span>Windows</span> , restore points are created differently and are not recognized by earlier versions of<span>Windows</span> . If you have a dual-boot configuration and you start an earlier version of<span>Windows</span> , the earlier
 version will delete any restore points created by this version of<span>Windows</span> . If you start this version of
<span>Windows</span> , restore points will resume being created automatically."</p>

            Thanks for the info Chris. Is there any way to make it so my Vista partition stops deleting my Windows 7 restore points? To be honest, I haven't booted Windows Vista in a while. Like around 2 months or so. I mean, can the restore points automatically be
 deleted at the boot-selection screen?

<h2>            One Game Cannot connect to Xbox Live &#40;on PC&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My Alto's Adventure cannot connect to Xbox Live since the day before yesterday and the error code is 0x8015DC12. I tried other games on my computer like the Solitaire Collection, and it connected successfully. I reinstalled the game but still did not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could you please help me with this. Thank you a lot.</p>

                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Please Help! My HP laptop has been frequently shutting down or frozen by its own throughout of all this week.
 Every time I start to boot it up, it always goes into automatic repair loop. I used to have this problem before but I fix it last time with command prompt. When automatic repair failed it is normal for a blue screen to pop up with the options: continue to
 windows 10, troubleshoot and turn off your PC. Now it doesn't display the option to continue to windows 10. It only has two options: troubleshoot and turn off your PC. I've tried everything. Now after the failure of automatic repair, it loads me to a choose
 your keyboard screen then to advanced options. So weird. Again I don't have the option to continue to windows 10 normally. My laptop is stuck in this loop, I tried to system restore and command prompt but it didn't work. Is there any other way to fix this?</span>

<p>Hi Ruby,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern regarding the boot loop issue that you encountered can be caused by a sudden change on the device configuration or corrupted system files. If you still get the same issue after performing the startup repair, our next step is to perform a system
 restore using an installation media. To do this, use another <strong><em>PC</em></strong> and download the installation media provided on this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Alternatively, you can follow the steps on this
<em><strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">Forum Article</a></strong></em> created by
<em><strong>Andre Da Costa</strong></em> for a detailed guide on how to create and properly boot using a USB installation media.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're done, follow the steps provided on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong>. Click the
<strong><em>Use installation media to restore or reset your PC</em> </strong>drop-down arrow to view the appropriate step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you may also perform the startup repair using the installation media to repair or replace any corrupted system files. To do this, boot from the USB installation media by repeating the steps provided in the article, then proceed with the steps
 below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select <strong><em>Repair</em></strong> your computer.</li><li>Select <strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong> to open the <em><strong>Windows Recovery</strong></em> environment.</li><li>Select <strong><em>Advanced</em></strong> options, then select <em><strong>Startup repair</strong></em>.</li><li>Allow the repair to complete.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once the repair is complete, check if the device will boot properly.</p>

    <title>Family Safety is blocking Facebook and Twitter when it should allow it - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Family Safety is blocking Facebook and Twitter when it should allow it</h2>
                    <p>I have setup Family Safety on my laptop running Windows 8.1 Pro. I have created my boys' accounts on the laptop as Child Accounts so that they will be covered by Family Safety. They are both 16&nbsp; years old and have Windows Accounts, which are what they are
 using to login to my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have setup Web Filtering on the Family Safety Website to allow "Online Communication (basic)", which is supposed to allow social networking. Since they are 16 years old, all I really want to block is&nbsp;adult websites.&nbsp;I have also (since it wasn't working
 properly) added <strong>*facebook.com/*</strong> to the Allowed Websites&nbsp;list. I have logged their accounts off, and then logged them back on after setting this up on the Family Safety website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I login to one of their accounts and bring up a web browser (doesn't matter if it's IE11, Firefox, or Chrome), it will not go to
<a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.facebook.com</a>. It returns a "This page cannot be displayed" message. I can NOT get Family Safety to allow them to get to Facebook or Twitter!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even went into the Family Safety website and turned Web Filtering complete OFF, logged them out and logged them back on, and it still will NOT let me get to Facebook. The only way I can allow them to get to Facebook and Twitter is to change their account
 type to Standard User on the laptop, effectively turning Family Safety completely off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really unacceptable. I will have to find a different filter software to protect my boys from adult websites if this will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Hi <span>Cindy,</span><br />
</p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>I appreciate the efforts which you have put to try to resolve the issue. Some times you will not be able to access the website which you have added to allowed list due to wrong settings. I therefore suggest you to check the settings as per the
 screenshot given below.</span> These settings has to made on your computer after to s<span>ign in to the Microsoft Account which you have used to set up the Child Account and then click on Restriction Level under Web Filtering and then make sure that seeker
 is in front of the option O</span>nline Communication.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Check the radio button in from of Online Communication. This is similar to the setting which you have already tried but this is on your computer and the setting which you have tried is on your online account.

            <p>Still not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After making sure my son's account was logged off, I went into the Control Panel-&gt;User Accounts and Family Safety-&gt;Family Safety. I clicked on the link to change Family Safety settings on this computer and not on the website. I setup the settings as you
 said, specifying Online Communication as the Web Filtering level. I did NOT check "Block file downloads" as I want to allow&nbsp;him to be able to get files.&nbsp;I also checked the Allow of Block Websites settings and have a list of sites in the Allowed list (including
 Facebook but not Twitter) and NO sites listed in the Blocked list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I switched users and logged in as my son. I tried browsing to Facebook.com and Twitter.com and neither site will come up. After a long delay, I get the "This page cannot be displayed" message instead of the requested website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the next step? How do I get this to work for my older teen boys?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>I'm seeing the same problem with my computer.&nbsp; Family Safety was working great until I refreshed Windows 8.1.&nbsp; After the refresh and some Windows updates, I noticed that my child accounts were changed to standard accounts.&nbsp; I changed them back to child accounts.&nbsp;
 From that point on, I couldn't access certain sites with the child accounts.&nbsp; I get the "This page can't be displayed message" when I try to visit Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube.&nbsp; If I change an account back to a standard account, then the user can access all
 web pages again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly, my child accounts can access gmail.google.com, but not calendar.google.com.&nbsp; And they can get to
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com</a>, but not familysafety.microsoft.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd love to get this working correctly again.</p>

            <p>I wish it was a simple configuration issue, but there's a bigger problem here. &nbsp;I currently have Family Safety configured to get the settings from the Family Safety website. &nbsp;It was previously set to use local settings, but that didn't work any better. &nbsp;Here's
 a test I ran a few minutes ago:</p>
<ol>
<li>I made a list of URLs to test. &nbsp;These are sites that had problems with Family Safety in the past:<br />
https://calendar.google.com<br />
http://google.com<br />
http://youtube.com<br />
https://facebook.com<br />
http://twitter.com<br />
https://familysafety.microsoft.com/</li><li>I verified that I can visit all of these sites when my account type is Standard User. &nbsp;They all worked.</li><li>I set my account type to Child. &nbsp;I turned off Family Safety web filtering for my user.</li><li>I rebooted to ensure that the computer had the latest settings from the Family Safety website.</li><li>I tried all of the URLs in step 1 in IE and again in Chrome. &nbsp;IE couldn't access any of them ("This page can't be displayed" message). &nbsp;Chrome could access http://youtube.com and https://familysafety.microsoft.com/, but none of the others (Error code: ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED).</li><li>I turned on web filtering with allow and block lists both empty, then rebooted.</li><li>I tried the sites again in IE and Chrome and got almost the same results as in step 5. &nbsp;The only difference is that https://familysafety.microsoft.com/ produced a "Server Error in '/' Application." error in Chrome instead of the ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED error.
 &nbsp;I refreshed the page and got the "Server Error in '/' Application." error again.</li><li>I added these to the allowed sites list:<br />
*.google.com/*<br />
*.youtube.com/*<br />
*.facebook.com/*<br />
*.twitter.com/*<br />
*.microsoft.com/*</li><li>I rebooted and tried the URLs again in both browsers. &nbsp;The results were exactly the same as in step 5.</li><li>I changed the account type back to Standard User and rebooted. &nbsp;All websites work in both browsers again.</li></ol>
<p>As you can see, Family Safety is broken. &nbsp;I'd really like to get it working again.</p>

            <p>I have added <strong>*</strong><strong>facebook.com/*</strong> to the Allowed Websites list, as stated in my original post. I have NO websites listed in the Blocked Websites list. I have these listed in conjunction with the Web Restrictions setting of
<strong>Online Communication</strong>, which is supposed to allow social networking sites, including Facebook, Twitter, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to access <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.facebook.com</a> or
<a href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.twitter.com</a> from my son's account using Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 8.1, where it is setup as stated, it searches for a long time and eventually comes up with a page that says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> This page can't be displayed.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to access the same site from Firefox, I get a warning about a certificate with an unknown issuer. I viewed the certificate, and it is showing that the issuer is Microsoft Family Safety. If I click to continue, adding the website to the Exceptions
 list, it then DOES go to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.facebook.com</a> home page! So I can get into it with Firefox, but only after adding the certificate to the Exceptions list. Even though I don't have Twitter explicitly on the Allowed
 List, I also tried to go to Twitter using Firefox since it should be allowed by the Online Communication setting in the Web Restrictions. It ALSO wants me to accept a certificate that is not trusted because "no issuer chain was provided." (Same message as
 I got for Facebook.) I am sure that if I add the site to the Exceptions list, it will let me in just like Facebook. IE11 will not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, when I switch over to my account on the same system and use Firefox to browse to the Facebook site, I do not get any certificate error/warning. Here is a copy of the certificate that Firefox wants me to accept, and then Facebook works as it
 should with Microsoft Family Safety. Maybe this will help troubleshoot the issues we are having.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>There is almost no limit to the ways in which you can view, organize, and change things in the library. You can view media by artist, album, genre, playlist, and other ways. If
 you want to add other properties to your Navigation pane, click Organize O Customize Navigation Pane to show the Customize Navigation Pane dialog box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;•<b>Rating</b>: Shows songs organized by rating (one to five stars). The songs are separated into those you have rated and those that are rated automatically based on your listening
 habits. Songs that are unrated appear under the Unrated category.</p>
<p>•<b>Contributing Artist</b>: Shows songs organized by contributing artists, if any.</p>
<p>•<b>Composer</b>: Shows songs organized by composer.</p>
<p>•<b>Parental Rating</b>: Shows songs organized by parental rating.</p>
<p>•<b>Online Stores</b>: Shows songs based on the store from which it was obtained.</p>
<p>•<b>Folder</b>: Shows songs organized by the folder in which they are stored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;You’ll be better able to appreciate the library if you have at least 30 or 40 songs in your library before reading this section. Or better yet, several hundred songs. As you explore
 your library, keep in mind that you can right-click any icon, stack, category name, or whatever to view, edit, or play items.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Use the
<b>View Options button</b> to choose how you want to view things. Depending on where you are at the moment, some View options will be disabled (dimmed) because they’re not applicable to the current way of looking at things. But in general, you can choose from
 the following views:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>•<b>Tile</b>: Similar to the icon view, but with some additional information about each item or stack to the right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;•<b>Expanded Tile</b>: Shows the album cover and a list of songs on each album. Available in the Recently Added and Songs categories only.</p>
<p>•<b>Details:</b> Shows detailed textual information about each item in a tabular format.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s no right way or wrong way to view icons. Just choose whichever view works best at the moment. Feel free to try things out. You can’t do any harm by checking
 out different ways to view things. And nothing you choose is set in stone. You can change your view at any time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How you use a view depends on what you’re viewing. For example, if you’re viewing Genres, you’ll see an icon or stack for each genre in your library. Double-clicking an icon or
 stack shows you all the songs in that genre. Double-clicking an icon that represents a single album displays songs on that album. To play all the items that an icon represents, right-click the icon and choose Play. Again, doing some exploring on your own is
 your best bet. You’re not permanently changing anything as you explore, so there’s no need to be worried.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note even this options will arrange the files in alphabetical order, in the view option as this is bydesign.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Also note the first image shows that the images are sorted alphabetically, you may follow these below steps to arrange the files accordingly.</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on organize.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select sortby .</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select one of the options (title, album artist, album,&nbsp;release date, date taken, rating, file name)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this was helpful.</p>

<h2>            Xbox live enforcement team is a JOKE they are stupid</h2>
                    <p>enforcement team is a joke. I have this guy cheating RIGHT NOW. He has the game pause glitches and there's nothing I can do. I have reported him over 100 times in the past 6 months and nothing is being done. The enforcement team is a bunch of *******(starts with a B) although I will probably get in trouble for this because your a bunch of lazy **** suckers who do nothing good for the community.
