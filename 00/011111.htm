<h2>            nokia 520 warranty</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody<br />
I own a lumia 520 smartphone. Few days back i went to nokia care to extend warranty of my phone. Everything was going okay. They said that they wanted to check if all parts are okay before upgrading warranty and i alllowed them. I paid money for warranty and
 they extended it. But when i went with my phone there was no network acess on my phone. I showed them and they said it will be okay after sometime. I again went to nokia care as there was no network access for three continuous days. They checked phone and
 i was shocked to listed that the phone antenna was damaged and they refused to repair it. I told them this problem started only after they checked my phone before extending warranty. They finally listened and repaired it. But at the end they said my warranty
 is void now...... I want to know how is this possible to void my warranty without any fault of mine?<br />
They dameged the antenna. They repaired it and they say the warrany is void when i have paid for full next year in warranty?<br />
I want light on this topic</p>

            hi mate, unfortunately we are only a user to user forum for Nokia products and services, so cannot assist you on these matters. you will need to persist with your Nokia Care outlet, and if they continue to be unreasonable, take the matter to Nokia head
 office in your region

            HelloDear friend,<br />
i bought my phone from my hometown near delhi, but repaired it at Sonepat in haryana. Actually friend nokia care person broke my phone's antenna while checking everything internal. When i went after 3 days in non working condition of my phone , they first checked
 my phone and said that my phone had internal damage and it might be due to fall of my phone, and since this was physical damage they had nothing to do with it. But believe me dude my phone did not fell at all. The problem started only after they opened my
 phone. When i resisted they changed my phone's antenna. But while giving it to me they said that the warranty has been void now. I want to know "Is this possible" or can i do something?

            <p>I am very close to doing what I want to do. I am trying to keep an accurate running total of the column of negative numbers for individual vendors. I am using this formula EXAMPLE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=SUMIF(C1844:C9998,"7-ELEVEN", F1844:F9998)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The &nbsp;7-ELEVEN Vendor name is mixed in with other vendor names in column "C" the actual7-ELEVEN dollar entries are in column "F" along with other vendor entries..</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For instance, What I want to do is have a running total of all of the individual vendors automatically calculated in another table. It seems to work ONLY is i use a "-" every time I make an entry. Even with your formula it does not translate to the "TOTALS"
 table unless I use "-".</p>

<h2>            A lite&#47;simple Outlook Calendar app for mobile devices</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that many organizations are requiring employees to install MDM softwares for getting access to Outlook on mobile devices, I am wondering if there is a way to just sync the Outlook Calendar alone without having to install any MDM software.</p>
<p>I understand companies are worried about data loss/theft so they want employees to&nbsp;use managed versions rather than using unmanaged versions of the same app. For example, our company mandates using Intune for getting access to any Office apps on mobile devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't really use email on my mobile but I have configured the email and have been using it so far using Outlook app available in Google Play on my android device. Main reason for me&nbsp;doing it is to be able to see the Calendar so I can dial in to meetings
 on-the-go or at least I get reminders for the meetings that are scheduled for outside office hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to continue to have access to the Calendar I must go through MDM route which I don't like and many other employees around me are also not really happy with&nbsp;it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be good if there is a different, a simple calendar app that just shows the calendar and sends reminders. If it could just sync the calendar events and the meeting information like dial-in numbers or the links then that would be sufficient. It can
 block the attachments so it won't be easy to steal the data from such an app, I think. I certainly do not know the complete picture of security but I imagine it is not easy to transfer the data using Calendar so&nbsp;the app&nbsp;would be helpful for many people who
 just wants Calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on having some app like that on both android and iOS platforms ? Calendar sharing is not working because sharing is not allowed to the email addresses outside our&nbsp;organization.</p>

<p>Hi W:Nanda_Kumar,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your posting here, based on your description, if you want to sync the Outlook Calendar alone without having to install other software in Outlook for phone. Since it’s related to protocol
 and Exchange protocol support sync calendar, if your account as POP or IMAP account, it's infeasible to get this goal, if your account is Exchange account, you can directly add this Exchange account to Outlook for phone and enable sync calendar, the calendar
 will sync directly.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply.&nbsp; I have seen this already and does not apply in my case.&nbsp; I have a computer bought in Japan with Japanese keyboard but prefer to use Win 10 in English so I have changed the language already into English and its working great with
 a Japanese keyboard.</p>
<p>Problem is that Skype is running in Japanese for some odd reason.&nbsp; The older Skype was always easy to change languages.&nbsp; Do I need to delete and reinstall an older version?&nbsp; Not ideal but if thats the only way...</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the classic version is&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;be downloaded due to an issue with its installer. We have removed this older version of Skype for Windows desktop from our Downloads page.</p>

            I uninstalled Skype but when I go to re-install it, MS Store in the browser is in English (Perfect) but clicking on "Get the app" it always insists on running the Japanese version of the MS Store app (Terrible)!&nbsp; How can I delete or bypass the the MS Store
 app???&nbsp; It is not possible to change the language in the app so Skype comes back in Japanese.&nbsp; So now I need uninstall and reinstall English MS Store.&nbsp; How can I do this?&nbsp; This is a really dumb issue.&nbsp; Please stop changing languages.&nbsp; One setting should be
 more than enough.

    <title>office home and student 2010 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lmaxwell5  say:</h3>
<h2>            office home and student 2010</h2>
                    <p>Please help. I am very frustrated. I have been trying to install Office Home and Student 2010 on my home computer. I installed it on my daughters computer in 2011 and now I want to install it on our family computer. I am running Vista. This has been all
 day. I've tried to download it 3 times but when it completes I don't see it anywhere on my computer. I've called tech support but only after giving all my personal information to someone in a foreign country that I can barely understand and doing it again
 after they transfer me and give me a case # etc, etc, etc does someone tell me he can help me for a fee! I really would have appreciated I NOT loose more valueable times and hours just to be transfered to a high pressured salesman to help me download a program
 I've already paid good money for. So here I am again trying to resolve this issue myself again. I've been reading all kinds of things to do to no avail. I really need help&nbsp;to figure out how to do this.
</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            Lets clarify some terminology, so we are on the same page.<br />
<br />
<p><b>Download: </b>copy file from an outside source, like the internet or USB drive, to your local computer, typically saving to your hard drive. But a “download” could also be simply viewed. For example, your browser “downloads”
 all of the files/websites you view.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Install: </b>make a program usable on a computer. Most Windows programs require a special setup program / file that copies the program files to various locations, creates registry entries and creates shortcuts in the start
 menu or desktop.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">Activation / Registration : Activations</span></b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">
</span><b>is a </b>MS process that proves to MS that you have a legal license which is called a
<b>"Product Key".&nbsp;</b> Many other companies call this "Registration". Actually, MS also uses the term Registration for the old MS Works suite.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">Product Key</span>:</b> is a UNIQUE 25 character, written in 5 groups of 5, code. The PK is your “proof of purchase”. Protect your PK! Keep records of it If you “lose” your PK, you have lost your
 copy of Office!&nbsp; Note: for MS Works, they call it the “Product ID”. Other makers often call it the “Registration Number”</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">Registration: </span>
</b>MS Registration gives you no real additional benefit. Is a source of propaganda / sales e-mail from MS.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">Product ID</span></b>: In Office applications you can see the Product ID in the Help About dialog. The unique Product ID is “one-way” generated during the Activation process.
</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>So the Office installation process is: </b></p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You "download" the "installation" file from the online store.</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>During the “download” you “Save to HD”. <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OR<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; insert the installation disk into the CD player<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>then you run the "installation" / Setup.exe file to setup Office on your computer.
</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Depending on your version of Windows, you may have to use “Run As Administrator” to start the installation process to get all of the required access rights.</p>
<p><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Part of the installation process includes the option to "Activate" the Office installation using the "Product Key". If you do not “Activate” during the install, your Office installation will be in a time limited “trial mode” until it is activated</p>
<p>After the installation is done, save the installation file to someplace safe: external HD(s), CD/DVD(s) (more than one copy is a good idea) You want to keep the installation file safe so you don’t have to depend downloads in
 future. For example, people with Office 2003 can’t download now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
******************************<br />
<br />
First thing to try is in the start menu search window type "winword.exe" without the quotes. Does Word start?<br />
<br />
Exactly how did you buy Office 2010, as an online download or in the big yellow plastic boxed CD.<br />

            <p>I am a little confused but I do appreciate you taking the time to respond. I purchased Office Home and Student 2010 from Best Buy. I followed the download instructions when I put it on my daughters laptop in 2011. Now I am trying to put it on my laptop by
 Downloading it from the microsoft website as instructed. After Downloading it I can't find it on my computer to install it. I already had to put in my product Key to download it. Thats where I'm at. After many attempts to locate it on my computer and several
 attempts to re-download it I decided to look online for a solution. </p>

            OK, you bought an online download. That means you most LIKELY have a "Product Key Card" / "PKC" type license. It would have probably cost around US$100-120.&nbsp; There is a small chance you got a "Retail" / "FPP" type license that would have cost around US$150-160.<br />
<br />
The point is if you have a PKC type license you cannot transfer it to a new computer. PKC licenses are "disposable". They are permanently tied to the first hardware they are installed on.&nbsp; When the hardware dies, so does the license. When you sell the computer,
 Office has to go with it.<br />
<br />
If you don't remember how much you spent, or are not completely sure which type of license you have (if it is not explicitly stated on your confirmation email), you should call the phone activation center.&nbsp; Have your Office Product ID from the installed computer
 as well as the Product Key handy. When you call in, don't reply to the initial prompts, wait until you are offered the option of talking to a live "service" rep. Ask them to tell you what type of license the key is associated with.<br />
<br />
Once you confirm you have a retail license, we can continue with the steps you have to take. In short form the steps are:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>check your browser downloads. CTL J works in IE and FireFox</li><li>the end of the file name may look SOMETHING like this&nbsp; <span>X17-75161.exe or you recognize the download site<br />
</span></li><li><span>If you find it, Run it to start the installation<br />
</span></li></ul>

            The mobile version of IE that runs on a pocket pc is limited.&nbsp; Try acessing that website with a different browser you'll probably get a better result.&nbsp; I use
<a href="http://www.opera.com/products/mobile/products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Opera</a> and am quite satisfied with it - there has been quite a ot of development lately in the area of mobile browsers so there are more options than just Opera, bit Opera is the only one I have used.<br />

<p>Save sound files as embedded files so that I can send a powerpoint show by email.&nbsp; I have read the article mentioned in another answer but it only tells you how to save them as linked files and I need to send a powerpoint show with sound files (not music
 but voice that I have recorded, i.e. .wav files).&nbsp;&nbsp;I would appreciate any help you can give me.&nbsp; The sound files are larger than the 100Kb that is embedded by default and I don't mind if it makes the file size larger as long as it works!!&nbsp; The Help talks about
 an Options tab which I don't see on my ribbon in PowerPoint.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

 were not added. &nbsp;This is a vital process for my organization and I need to know how to resolve this. &nbsp;Adding them one by one is not feasible. &nbsp;Refreshing and logging out and back in didn't make a difference. &nbsp;The email addresses all appear to be properly formatted.

            <p>Let me guess AT&amp;T? Interesting that your usage is so different. At least you have two devices to compare. Look at e-mail accounts, does she have more? are they set up for push (when new items arrive). Are they set up to check quite often. How about other
 applications that check things periodically, Live Tiles. Does she leave the device with Twitter or Facebook as the front app, or windo back to the home screen before letting it go to sleep. What do you guys do differently?</p>
<p>Are you both on the latest release? </p>
<p>Are you on the 200M plan or the 2G? I guess the 200M or you wouldn't be concerned. I actually had the same issue, unexplained data use when I should have had WiFi. I can only imagine that the WiFi is not always on when asleep, and possibly it doesn't wake
 up fast enough when the carrier is pulling data. I'm told they journal usage data on the phone, and download it in batch. Not sure I believe that. My solution was go to the 2G plan and not worry about it. If I were you I would call AT&amp;T and have them explain
 to you the reason your wife's phone is accessing data in the middle of the night, over the cell network, while yours isn't....assuming yours isn't.</p>

    <title>Another N97 or HTC Touch Pro2 &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> asandino  say:</h3>
<h2>            Another N97 or HTC Touch Pro2 &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This might not be the forum to ask this question but anyway here it is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will have to return my N97 in the next days, the decision is pretty much final the combination of SW problems plus the issues with my Network around my area are simply not good, missing calls and not being able to make calls is unacceptable. So I will
 have to return it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really like the N97 don't get me wrong and now that I have learnt so much about it even more. But sadly I will be taking it back in a few days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to get your opinions guys on whether I should go for another N97 in a different network, I am thinking Vodafone as they have very good coverage in the areas that I need and also they let you use BBC iPlayer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Or maybe I should go for a SIM free version. I think Carphone Warehouse always give you one like this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other option that I was looking is to go for the HTC Touch Pro 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know what do you recommend guys?&nbsp; The nokia has so many features but at the same time so many bugs. So I am thinking whether I should stay away from it for some time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What would I lose if I go for the HTC instead?&nbsp;&nbsp; I am only buying the HTC Touch Pro2 because is as close as it gets to the Nokia 97.&nbsp; Or do you know any other?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Leaving 3 is really the last thing that I wanted to do, I enjoyed the free SKYPE calls and free LIVE MSN, but with the 3G reception being so poor on my area added with the problems that the N97 has in swapping between 3G and 2G does not really help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if I could get a N97 with excellent 3G coverage in my area then this won't be an issue, and I could keep the N97. Otherwise I would make the move to the HTC Touch Pro2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advice for your help.</p>

<p>Correct, not the correct forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only replies you are likely to get here are people with problems which instantly gives a negative opinion, trolls and fanboys.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any genuine reply is likely to be viewed as trolling or fanboyism by people on the opposite sides of the fence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally all I can say that my N97 has been very good with no major issues.&nbsp; The only problems I have has been with my network (3UK) but mine is unbranded so I can move networks whenever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I wouldn't touch the HTC as I think winmo is a very poor OS compared to symbian.&nbsp; Only HTCs UI makes it tolerable.&nbsp; That is just my opinion though and obviously you would here the opposite on a HTC or winmo forum.</p>

<p>Thanks psychomania for your honest opinion that is what I am after.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a big fan of the N97 but in my case it has not worked well. I had two N97 so far and I am tempted to go for a third one, which is why I thought to check in here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;It is a bit sad having to look for another mobile when I already had made my mind on the N97, It looks like I might have to end up with a Blackberry then if the HTC is not that good. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Happy to help :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I honestly think your best bet would be to ditch the 3UK crippled N97 and get yourself an unbranded one.</p>

<p>Nearly all N97's from CPW are unbranded, just ask before you buy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With my unbranded N97 I can manage 3UK's issues with settings that aren't available on the 3UK version.&nbsp; I'm only with their sim only tariff cos they are cheap :D</p>

<p>Any ideas where can I get the cheapest SIm free?&nbsp;&nbsp; I found that play are doing it for £449. But I am thinking I rather get it from a shop with a contract as it will work out a lot cheaper.</p>

<p>Thats is quite cheap, not seen them less than that anywhere reputable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are happy to use voda the phones on the link below should be unbranded and the contract price seems very reasonable too.</p>

<p>They are a reputable firm and I have bought from them in the past.&nbsp; They are also the company that run most of the nokia stores (not London) across the country, under license from nokia.</p>

            The more i read in this forum the more Im beginnig to understand that almost all the bugs and issues that people complaines about comes from branded or network locked handsets. Ive had my n95 for over two years, its generic and has worked like a charm
 from the first time. Could it be that the branded handsets has more bugs?

            It's well-known that network operators are totally inept at modifying firmware and consistently introduce bugs when they do so. They're more interested in getting their branding in your face than actually supplying something that works as it is meant to.

<p>I just don't know that but it could well be true.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks I had a lot of issues with Windows Live MSN in my 3 N97 such a pain everytime that I get home and used the WIFI, and press the MSN icon the Windows Live MSN will no longer work.&nbsp; It was so annoying and frustrating it would just stay in the loading
 screen.&nbsp; Is it so hard to give a error meesage saying "MSN only works in the 3 Network"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same thing with SKYPE it just does not work via the WIFI, only on the 3 network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason for these two things is because they are both free&nbsp; (they do not charge for data sent or received through this). But is so annoying specially as I have an unlimited package anyway and if so the WIFI is a lot better than their network anyway, so
 I should have the option to use whatever I want. But no in their phone you just can't do it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end I decided to use a different messenger "Palringo" which I can use via wifi or network,&nbsp; Not sure if these two services (MSN and SKYPE) would work in the 3 Network for free with an unbranded phone, maybe phsyco mania can tell us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;So there you go these are bugs that only affect 3 phones.</p>

<p>I've used windows messenger via the fring and nimbuzz programs over the 3UK nework without problems.&nbsp; You can also use skype through these programs over the network or wifi.&nbsp; They should work on any network, as long as you've got a good data tariff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When using skype through fring or nimbuzz on 3UK it isn't free, it comes out of your data bundle instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On an unbranded phone you can get hold of 3's own skype app and use it for free, but again only on the 3 network.</p>

<p>Thanks for your prompt answer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't mind me asking one final thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you have both SKYPE installed on your phone at the same time?&nbsp; like the "SKYPE 3" which is free and&nbsp; "SKYPE" which you could use via your WIFI and/or via the network using data allowance.</p>

<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Deleted contacts can not be restored on their own. You will need to search for those contacts again and add them manually one by one.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

    <title>Windows 8.1 How to Remove DW6VB36 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clscribe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 How to Remove DW6VB36</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am helping someone with their Windows 8.1 screen. Today, all of a sudden there is a permanent pop-up that indicates Error#DW6VB36. The message indicated to call "Microsoft" within 5 minutes otherwise the computer would be infected and all of their passwords
 would be accessible. The number given was "1-855-474-7067."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, they called and were told that their computer was infected with a virus and that their passwords were accessible. In addition they were asked to pay $300.00 with a charge card.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The good thing is that my friend refused to give a charge card number.&nbsp; Initially they spoke to woman and later were passed on to the Billing Department where a man insisted on the payment.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question: </strong>What steps can be taken to get rid of the permanent windows screen with the message "Error #DW6VB36 Computer has altered that it has been infected with a virus and spyware"?</p>

<h2>            MS Word 2016 won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>I can't open Microsoft Word 2016 on my Mac Pro. I installed the program in August 2017 and have never had a problem until today. When I try to open the program, it opens for a few seconds and then closes and gives me the following error message</p>
<p>"There was a problem and Microsoft Word was closed. We apologize for the inconvenience."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message opens in a dialog box that is titled Microsoft Error Reporting. I can click on more information and it opens another window that has the error reporting log and says EXC_BAD_ACCESS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched all over the internet but can't find an answer. PLEASE HELP!</p>

            Update to Word can be done manually also. But I am surprised you are not able to update your Mac OS.
<br />
<br />To update Word, download manually from here -

<br />
<br />Before that try following -

<h2>            Nokia E71 battery problems</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I´ve been searching in the forum for this problem im having but cant seem to find any solution so here is my issue, if anyone can help or advise im more than glad to hear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My E71-2 battery wont last more than 10 hours with a normal usage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main problem is that i think battery indicator is not functioning well...after i connect the charger when the battery&nbsp;is almost empty (low battery sign appears), a sign of battery full charged appears ONLY 1:30 hs later..!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I updated my firmware to the last one available: 500.21.009/501.21.001 .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing is that i dont thing this issue is because of cell usage since the main fact is that battery is fully charged in 1:30 hs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dont use GPS, i have dissable WIFI detection and clossed almost all apps ( only whats app open). I have also dissabled the dual mode as i have seen as suggested in this forum.</p>
<p>Im only missing doing a soft reset which ill do tonight but dont think it will change anything since y did the firmware flash some days ago (should be about the same..)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

    <title>PowerPoint slide sort showing blank slides - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jora99  say:</h3>
<h2>            PowerPoint slide sort showing blank slides</h2>
                    Most of the slides in the slide sorter (list of slides on the left pane) show as blank slides even though they contain information. &nbsp;The full edit window of the slides show correctly. &nbsp;It's only on the slide list they show blank. &nbsp;This just started to
 happen. &nbsp;I use W7 64 bit, Office 2010. Graphics card drivers and settings have not changed. Rebooting does not resolve this.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>T<span>hank you for contacting Microsoft community and we will be glad to assist you with your concern.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand you are not able to use the slide sort view in PowerPoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does it happen also with the new slides you create?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a new test slides and check if this shows in the sort view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also repair the Office as described in this link and verify the results:</p>

            Hello and t hank you for the response to my issue. &nbsp;New slide decks do not appear to have this issue unless I paste slides from one deck to another. &nbsp;That appears to be the problem. &nbsp;If I paste a slide from one deck into another, especially with sections
 created in the deck, this issue happens. &nbsp;I don't know how to work around this issue because I can't just recreate all the slides. &nbsp;Any ideas? &nbsp;Thanks.

<p>I am aware of the Windows Phone 8.1 Dev Program containing bugs and issues, but will this upcoming official release solve it? Would i need to roll back to Windows Phone 8 and then reinstall the WP8.1 again?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I reside in the UK and the official release date for me is the 24th of June.</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First at all, thank you for contributing to the Microsoft Support Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I understand you have some issues regarding your calls on your Nokia Lumia 625. I strongly advise you to wait for the official release of Windows Phone 8.1.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If it persists after the installation of Windows Phone 8.1, the developers of the apps with which you have some issues, would be the persons to be in contact with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us informed ConorMayling,</p>

<h2>            WEEKDAY function and a blank cell</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I encountered a problem that might need a bug fix in Excel. When the WEEKDAY function gets its input from a blank cell or is 0 (zero), the result is Saturday. The formula was written =WEEKDAY(0), the result is 7. Shouldn't it provide #NUM! as a result?
 For me it created trouble in array entered formula used to calculate conditional averages.</p>

<p>While I don't have all the details here, I would recommend opening the form in design view and looking at the both the form recordsource property and any controls (ControlSource property) that reference the IDNumber field.&nbsp; My guess is that a small adjustment
 to either will correct the issue.</p>

<h2>            Outlook 365 - Calendar Problem</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone help regarding Outlook 365 Calendar?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use Outlook 365 to make an appointment on my PC (Windows 10), I can only delete that appointment from Outlook 365 (on any PC); I cannot then delete it from my Outlook app on my iPhone or from Outlook.com. If I make an appointment using the Outlook app
 on my iPhone or using Outlook.com on the internet, I can delete the appointment. This makes using Outlook very difficult. Interestingly, if I use the iPhone Calendar app, rather than the Outlook app, I can delete (and edit) all Outlook appointments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attach an image showing the right-click menus and bow they are different according to the source of the initial appointment. I spent 30 minutes speaking to Microsoft help desk this afternoon and got nowhere, although they are phoning me back on Saturday
 to try to help again (an "escalated" response).</p>

<p>Hi - thanks for replying. I’ve done that on my iphone, and reinstalled the Outlook app; I’ve also made a different Outlook 365 profile on my PC. All to no avail. It is my own PC, account and software - no one else involved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be with Outlook 365, creating appointments that I don’t “own”, so cannot “delete”. Weird and very frustrating.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Nokia Belle FP1 Pros and Bugs. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> srikanthsd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nokia Belle FP1 Pros and Bugs.</h2>
                    
<p>I have FP1 installed &nbsp;on my 701.<br />
I must say this update is significant improvement from the old belle in terms of features and functionality.<br />
<br />
I'm happy that Nokia solved most of the problems that I have mentioned earlier:cathappy:.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/Thread/64061CD1-5B5A-4C70-88E0-9F6AE87430C9">/t5/Nseries-and-Symbian-Smartphones/All-about-Symbian-Belle-Problems/m-p/1269175#M283885<br />
</a><br />
Highlights:-</p>
<p><br />
Menu scrolls pretty fast.</p>
<p>Menu search is much better.<br />
Apps and games open much faster.</p>
<p>Installation of apps is fast too.</p>
<p>Faster startup.</p>
<p>Nice transition effects than before.</p>
<p>Dolby digital plus seem to be a major highlight.</p>
<p>New widgets.</p>
<p>New Multitasking view.</p>
<p>New message conversation view.</p>
<p>Improved dropdown bar.</p>
<p>Improved music player.</p>
<p>New web browser.</p>
<p>Improved camera interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bugs/Drawbacks:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Menu scroller is absent.</p>
<p>It is not even present in&nbsp;shortcut list (Homescreen-add shortcut),&nbsp;installations, File manager, add-new-contact and widget list!!</p>
<p>2. While pinch to zoom,&nbsp;Image shakes.</p>
<p>3. Battery backup seem to be adversely affected.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;I opened the old maps application (maps from 111.030.0609) and tried to download maps from maps loader,&nbsp;It shows list of available continents and when I try to download the maps, &nbsp;the wifi disconnects immediately, everytime.</p>
<p>5. Connecting phone in mass storage mode makes the phone hang sometimes.</p>
<p>6. Opening multiple qt applications and some other normal applications causes the new qt application to not to launch. Maybe this is due to use of close all in multitasking view?</p>
<p>7. E mail seem to be not notifying new mail arrival even after setting retrieval frequency to soonest.</p>
<p>8. Switching between open apps in multitasking view is not so occurate or fast. Sometimes it doesn't switch at all, we need to be more precise.</p>
<p>9. Some menu icons become black colored sometimes and normal when you use menu(See PIc).</p>
<p>10. Adding a new contact and its details is still a problem once the keypad(board) pops up, we need to close keypad to scroll to add further details!</p>
<p>11. Stereo video recording is missing as I was misguided by the specification page of Nokia.</p>
<p>*2 Microphones for stereo recording! (Is that possible to provide that in the next update?)</p>
<p>12. The graphic of volume up and down when we press volume rocker is more ugly now. Not seem to be alligned in place.</p>
<p>13. My phone is getting heated up if I use maps, and multiple applications. This never happened before.</p>
<p>14. No exit option for file manager. Only way is to press End key.</p>
<p>15. Calender is missing week view.</p>
<p><span>16. Long pressing on the song while in portrait mode with small cover flow in the music player seem to be not working, maybe while connected with PC.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank You.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Thanks for your reply.<br />
I don't use nfc.<br />
<br />
One more serious bug in FP1 is camera settings,<br />
no settings gets saved while capturing image.<br />
Ex:<br />
On setting exposure, sharpness etc to your desired settings and take an image, the image gets captured in the default settings neglecting all your custom settings.<br />
<br />
What you see on screen is not the same after capturing.<br />
<br />
Please solve this immediately.

            Another problem.<br />
If I want to see the time, I would just press the menu key, the display shows an analog clock unlock button at the bottom, at this time when I press menu again the display should turn off immediately but doing so doesn't turn off the display.<br />

<p>I have a Nokia 603..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problems which i faced with FP1 is menu scrollbar missing in certain areas, the video aspect ration option was pretty good in earlier belle with 3 forms but in this version it has only 2 changes which affects the prescence of 16:9 screen in our mobile.
 Also, the map and the weather application is not that much effective..The application gets hanged most of the times and we need to use a app stop program to close it. Also, the recently updated weather widget is not getting updated ...its idle all the time...everytime
 i need to close the widget and open it freshly..that too most of the times the widget doesnt appear properly.i dnt what was the update they gave in weather widget..only after that its not working properly for me..Also, the Support of Xplore file manager is
 out...its mandatory thing for outr device...Let me know whether these can be rectified in near future..</p>

            It was really bad experienced with my 701.<br />
There was a dance program.<br />
I started to recording the dance of my friend.<br />
I was standing near the huge speaker and the sound was very high.<br />
<br />
I set the storage location to memory card(I have recorded many videos before in the same location) as the mass memory was full.<br />
<br />
I had 1.1 GB free space.<br />
After recording for about 3 minutes, it started hanging.<br />
It was hanging after 5 or 7 seconds and continuing normal and the audio recorded good. At the end at about 3 minutes 45 seconds, it stopped recording audio and video recording was good. :( :( :(<br />
<br />
I have checked it in the computer too.<br />
<br />
Micro SD card is class 4 transcend 8 GB.<br />
<br />
:(

<p>Display turns always on my 701 &nbsp;after locking using side lock key. I think this happens after connecting to PC in Nokia suite mode. :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also in the gallery we cannot goto last picture(Image at bottom of gallery) by scrolling first picture(Image at the begining of gallery) by swiping left to right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connecting to PC causes problems in the device, no problem working with PC.</p>
<p>FP1 is Very poor software for connecting to PC in Mass storage as well as in Nokia suite mode, Device hangs and display won't turn off after lock respectively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nokia solve all these immediately.</p>
<p>Hope 808 comes with updated FP1.</p>

<h2>            Synchronizing with Exchange Server &#40;SBS 2003&#41;</h2>
                    I have attempted to sychronize with my Exchange Server with my PPC running WM 5.0 without success.&nbsp; Can anyone provide me with step by step detailed instructions (in "layman's" English please) that will allow me to do this.&nbsp; I am able to configure the
 Server (me thinks) but can never successfully synchronize.&nbsp; Any words of wisdom would be appreciated.

<p>Greetings WDPC!&nbsp; Welcome to the Windows 
Mobile forums!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the steps that I use to setup corporate clients.&nbsp; This assumes that the Exchange Server is setup correctly:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>On your PocketPC, please&nbsp;go to Start &gt; ActiveSync.
</li><li>On the Tools menu, please&nbsp;select Options.
</li><li>On the <strong>Server</strong> Tab, 
<ul>
<li>place your cursor in the "Sync with this server" box,
</li><li>then enter the correct FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) or IP address&nbsp;for your Exchange Server.
</li><li>If the server uses SSL, please make sure you select the SSL check-box.
</li><li>Click on the <strong>Options </strong>
button.
<ul>
<li>Enter your credentials (username, password, domain name), and select Save Password.
</li><li>In the Rules tab, please&nbsp;make your selections as to:
<ul>
<li>the frequency of ActiveSync sessions, 
</li><li>what process to observe in case of a item conflict,
</li><li>the level of logging.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li>In the "Sync these items box, select the items you wish to synchronize with the server:
<ul>
<li>Calendar </li><li>Contacts </li><li>Inbox </li><li>NOTE: The Calendar and Inbox choices have additional Settings which can be set:&nbsp;the size of e-mails to download, whether to download the whole body or just headers, etc).</li></ul>
</li><li>In the Mobile Schedule tab make your selections as to the frequency of the ActiveSync operations, and select which days and what hours are considered as "Peak Times". When done click Ok.
</li><li>Now press the Sync button on the main ActiveSync page on your PPC.
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>If you programmed everything else correctly, you should get a confirmation that your PocketPC is actually synchronizing with your Exchange Server.</p>
        </p>

            Personally, I was able to get through these steps and every thing works well except for one thing:<br />
<br />
My activesync settings keep defaulting back to "plain text" for emails. I would like to be able to recieve html. When I access the server directly the message is there in all it's glorious html detail.&nbsp; But when activesync downloads it to my HTC/Sprint ppc-6800
 it's in text only. Is this a default for "direct push"?<br />
<br />
What am I missing?<br />
