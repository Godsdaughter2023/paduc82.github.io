    <title>SupraExpress 56K USB modem stopped working in upgrade from 8.1 to 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SupraExpress 56K USB modem stopped working in upgrade from 8.1 to 10 windows</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>My modem, &nbsp;SupraExpress 56K USB (SUP2780) no longer works.</p>
<p>&nbsp; It was using a driver in Windows 8.1 from Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp; In windows 10 it is identified in the Device manager as Diamond SupraExpress 56k v.90 and has</p>
<p>&nbsp; device status of "This device cannot start (Code 10.)". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the Troubleshooting for devices in Windows 10 to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked for a driver on the web and can only find one from 2000 and on sights that I do not necessarily &nbsp;trust.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a suggestion.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>XBOX Live suspension for 24 hours - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the legend 3001  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX Live suspension for 24 hours</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have been a loyal XBL&nbsp;customer for 15+ years. Yesterday after a game of NBA 2k18 I received a message from a player called&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>&nbsp;calling me garbage(that was the first message of this whole exchange). The whole exchange is still
 in my messages, but and I told&nbsp;him to &nbsp;grow up and stop acting like a **** over one game. At the of the day, I got banned for 24 hours and he was the one who messaged me first.
</p>
<p>So now I have a rep complaint and no one form Microsoft is explaining to me why that is. All I want is for someone to tell me why I was banned when he messaged me first. Then to give me a ban, someone who has been with Microsoft and have no history of being
 abusive, quitting or any negative behaviors in the 15 years of me being online, is ridiculous and disrespectful to a loyal customer. All I want is form someone&nbsp;form Microsoft to explain this to me and I cannot get in touch with no one from Microsoft Enforcement
 team. I am more than happy to have them contact me via email phone or text. I just need an explanation. I cannot even dispute it on the enforcement website. I don't care if its for 24 hrs. its the principle of someone attacking me first and I get banned, My
 7 year old son also plays Fortnite on my account and now he cant play today and I have to explain to him why,
<br />

<h2>            Can Windows 8 be installed on a 2007 Compaq Presario C700 notebook&#63;</h2>
                    I have a 6-yr-old Compaq Presario C700 notebook PC with a 1.6 GHz Intel(R) Pentium(R) Dual CPU T2330 processor, 1 GB of RAM, 180 GB disk space, and a 32-bit operating system. Over the past couple of years, my computer has become extremely slow and I was
 wondering if upgrading to the Windows 8 system would improve performance on my computer. Would it even be possible to upgrade to Windows 8 on my current system? Or is my computer too old? Thanks!!

            <p>Generally you meet the minimum requirements for installing W8;</p>
<p><span>Processor:</span> 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster</p>

</p>
<p><span>Additional requirements to use certain features:</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To use touch, you need a tablet or a monitor that supports multitouch.</p>
</li><li>
<p>To access the <span>Windows</span> Store and to download and run apps, you need an active Internet connection and a screen resolution of at least 1024 x 768.

<p>Your screen resolution maybe a problem.</p>
<p>Also you may have problems with drivers for various devices being compatible with W8.</p>
<p>Save the Upgrade Assistant at link below. and then run it and it will advise you which devices, etc. are compatible or not and what actions are required.</p>

            <p>Generally speaking, upgrading to a newer OS while having problems of any sort with the current one is <strong>never</strong> a good idea, nor a fix for the current problems. I would research the reasons for the slowness, fix that, and stick with what you have (Vista?).</p><p>You laptop has no drivers listed for anything newer than Vista, so even though you (barely) meet the minimum requirements, you would have a heck of a time finding drivers for your hardware, or getting Win8 to run smoothly enough for it to be useful.</p><p>To address your slowness, have you scanned for malware lately? How much free disk space do you have? Have you loaded any software recently that may have contributed to the slowness (noticed a difference shortly after installing it)?</p><p>You can run Disk Clean-up to clear a lot of unnecessary stuff from the drive. Uninstall any programs that you no longer use (after 6 years, I'm sure there are some; there certainly were on mine after 5 years :-)&nbsp; ). If possible, bump

<br />HOW TO FIX WIN10 STORE APP / METRO / UNIVERSAL APPLICATIONS – WINDOWS STORE RESET
<br />
<br />2016 07 19- 5 TIPS TO FIX WINDOWS STORE AND APP ISSUES IN WINDOWS 10
<br /><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-tips-fix-windows-store-app-issues-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-tips-fix-window...</a> 
<br />
<br />..0. Restart the computer
<br />  1. Win Store Trouble Shooter
<br />  2. Clear store Cache (WSReset.exe)
<br />  3. Reset Windows update (use the tool in the following link)
<br />  4. Reg hack for Connection errors
<br />  5. Re-Register the Store
<br />
<br />Here are some additional instructions for the 5 tips defined in the article above 
<br />
<br />Remember to test the problem applet between each of the steps.
<br />
<br />#0 RESTART THE COMPUTER
<br />Simply restarting the computer is one of the simplest trouble fixes we have. But it is all too often forgotten or skipped.  Too often programs get “confused”. While restarting the program may clear the confusion, sometimes they have an unseen compenent constantly running in the background.  The easiest way to reset them is to restart the computer. 
<br />
<br />#1 MS DOWNLOADABLE WIN10 STORE APP TROUBLE SHOOTER
<br /><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_apps10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_apps10</a> 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-run-the-trouble" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749...</a> shooter-for-windows-apps 
<br />
<br />Note: both of these links above should take you to download the same diagnosis “CAB” file. 
<br />
<br />Use the built in Trouble shooter
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot 
<br />Scroll down to the bottom 
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />#2 WSRESET.EXE – CLEAR AND RESET STORE CACHE
<br /><a href="http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-clear-reset-windows-store-cache-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-clear-reset-w...</a> 
<br />
<br />Run as Admin.
<br />
<br />Be sure to run the WSReset (Windows Store Reset) program AT LEAST 5 times. It appears to fix one problem per run, SLOWLY working thorough multiple problems in subsequent runs. Unfortunately the tool is poorly written so it gives the user no indication of what it is doing or if it was successful or not. All you can do is run it several times in the hope that you run it often enough for it to clear all of the problems.
<br />
<br />#3 MANUAL RESET WINDOWS UPDATE SUBSYSTEM
<br />the problems remain, you have to revert to a manual process to reset Windows Update
<br />Check that System Restore is turned on and configured 
<br />

<br />
<br />After doing the process in the above link, including restarting the computer Check for outstanding updates:
<br />. – in start menu search for Windows Update
<br />. - click on “Check for Updates”
<br />. – updates are often sequention, they require an earlier one to be present before being installed. So you should repeat checking for updates until you get no more updates

<br />RE-INSTALL ALL STORE APPS USING POWERSHELL
<br />
<br />…*  In the Start Menu, search for PowerShell 
<br />…*  right click and select "Run as Administrator" option.
<br />…*  Enter the following commands one by one in the PowerShell window:
<br />
<br />………  reg delete “HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\TileDataModel\Migration\TileStore” /va /f
<br />
<br />………  get-appxpackage -packageType bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + "\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml")}
<br />
<br />………  $bundlefamilies = (get-appxpackage -packagetype Bundle).packagefamilyname
<br />
<br />………  get-appxpackage -packagetype main |? {-not ($bundlefamilies -contains $_.packagefamilyname)} |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + "\appxmanifest.xml")}
<br />
<br />RESET ALL STORE APPS / REREGISTER / APPS MISSING FROM WIN START MENU
<br />Re-register all store apps, so they appear again in start menu.  For that, open a PowerShell window as Administrator. Copy and paste the following line into the PowerShell window and press Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose } 
<br />
<br />Note:	if you re-register all applications, all your apps are back, however all your pinned apps will be reset (the right panel will be empty) so you need to re-pin everything that you want. Personnaly I did a screen capture before, to remember what I pinned and where (use the “snipping tool” in startmenu/windows accessories, with a delay to be able to open the start menu before the capture)

            Hi Hazel, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />Firstly, see if it shows up in Device Manager:
<br />
<br />- Press Windows Key+X and choose Device Manager.
<br />- Find your MP3 player in the list.
<br />- Right-click it and choose Update Driver.
<br />- If that doesn't work, try uninstalling it and then scan for hardware changes to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Secondly, you may be able to assign a drive letter to it in Disk Management, which should help it show up in File Explorer:
<br />
<br />- Go into Disk Management by clicking Start and typing "Disk Management". Choose the first result.
<br />- Hopefully your HDD appears here, and if it does, right-click it and click Change Drive Letter and Path(s).
<br />- After setting the drive letter to an unused letter of your choice, it should show up in File Explorer. 
<br />
<br />If it doesn't, please let me know and I'll see what else we can try! Thanks!

            <p>Sorry to hear it. &nbsp;I too do not have Hexic on my Xbox One. &nbsp;This is because some consoles came preloaded with the Hexic game. &nbsp;If you did not originally purchase the game it would not be linked to your gamertag and would therefore not be available for backwards compatibility until you purchased it.</p>

<p>Hi RoY,</p>
<p>this is probably because Hexic was on your drive when you bought your xbox.... which means its not tied to your account and therefore doesn't appear on your xbox one.</p>
<p>To fix it head to <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/Product/Hexic-HD/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d802584107d1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a>, sign in and 'buy it' - its free - it will then be tied to your account and should appear on your xbox one.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

            Hey Aussie.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Trace processes that are running up CPU using these guides:
<br /><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-high-cpu-usage-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-high-cpu-usag...</a>

<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>Coming from a regular mouse, this is driving me nuts. </p>
<p>I've read through the forum and owners have been posting the same issue, and there was no solution, except someone pointing to a bluetooth mouse troubleshooting faq. The threads are now locked for any further input. This is a design/ hardware problem which
 needs to be fixed. My <strong>right click</strong> would not register 50% of the time because I did not lift my index finger high enough. This is totally insane.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To those who are looking to purchase this mouse, God bless my warning reaches you before buying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To those who owns one, please share how do you overcome this problem.</p>

<p>If I saw this early, I never buy this mouse device. Im sufferring the same problem and asked China Microsoft support for some solution. However, they replied me they can do nothing for this as this is a design flaw. They didn't have any plan to recall this
 product or upgrade the software to fix it either. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I really feel disappointed for Microsoft product and service. :-(</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t boot into Windows. Won&#39;t reset.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an acer aspire e15 (Model: E5-571G-35GA) with an i3-4030U and 4GB RAM. A few months ago a replaced the HDD with a kingston SSD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thing is, at some point after that, my Pc refused to shut down or go to sleep for some reason and i got into a habit of force closing the system whenever i was done with using it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning, the windows started acting all buggy and glitchy (unable to maximize minimized icons, et al), so i resorted to force shutting the system and reopening it. The problems began thereafter, with the log in screen requiring my password even when
 i had changed the login method to pin Verification method a long time back. I couldnt connect to my home network, and windows refused to let me in even after i'd entered the correct password displaying a blue screen with an error message that read 'Profsvc
 service failed to sign up, the profile couldnt be loaded' or something to that effect. All the while random error messages popped up over the login screen stating some programs couldnt start up owing to the lack of a certain Version.dll or something. Even
 though i had vital files in the drive, i decided to reset the pc as i need to use it ASAP. to no avail. Even the reset didnt work, showing me another blue screen that read 'there was a problem while resetting this pc. No changes were made.' &nbsp;i cant access
 safe mode either, as i keep getting rejected with the same error while trying to log in.</p>
<p>Ive been frantically repeating the process since morning and im stuck. I need to salvage a few files from the drive at least and i MUST use this laptop tomorrow!</p>
<p>This is an urgent issue. Help!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Andrew,<br />
<br />
<br />
Since resetting your laptop and booting into safe mode failed to work at this point in the issue you're experiencing, we suggest that you do a repair install of Windows 10 by performing an in-place upgrade without losing anything. Here's how:</p>

○ Step 6: Do a repair install of Windows 10 with Media Creation Tool.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">

<br />
3. Go to step 7.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>6. To do a repair install of Windows 10 with Media Creation Tool <em>(<strong>Note:</strong> Do not use the Media Creation Tool to do a repair install with if you have an older build of Windows 10 installed and wish to retain it since the Media Creation
 Tool will not include support for older builds. You will be upgraded to the latest build provided by the Media Creation Tool.)</em>:&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">1. Click on the <strong>Download tool now</strong> button on this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.

<p>
</p><p>11. Windows 10 Setup will now check for and install any available updates, and make sure you're ready to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>12. When ready, click <strong>Install</strong> to start the repair install of Windows 10. (<strong>Note:</strong> If you only have
<strong>Nothing</strong> available to select, then the installation media is not the same as what you have currently installed. If you would like to change what you keep, then click on the
<strong>Change what to keep</strong> link, choose what to keep, click on <strong>
Next</strong>, and go to step 11. If you don't have <strong>Keep personal files and apps</strong> selected, you will not keep everything.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>13. Windows 10 Setup will now start the in-place upgrade to repair install Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>14. When it's ready, click Next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>15. Click on <strong>Use Express settings</strong> or <strong>Customize settings</strong>, and go to step 19 (Use express settings) or step 16 (Customize settings).</p>

<p>
</p><p>19. You can now sign in to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>20. When each user signs in for the first time, they will see the first sign-in animation before reaching their desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>21. Make sure that you have the correct time zone, date, and time set. If you like, you can use
<strong>Disk Cleanup</strong> to delete the Windows upgrade log files, previous Windows installation(s), and temporary Windows installation files items to free up the large amount of space that they take on your hard drive.
<em>(<strong>Note:</strong> This step will delete the <strong>C:\$Windows.~BT and C:\Windows.old</strong> folders. If you delete the Windows.old folder, you will no longer be able to go back to a previous version of Windows.)</em><br />
<br />
Let us know the outcome.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as recovering data goes... There is a 3rd party bootable program called Parted Magic that has a Linux based "File Explorer" that can copy your files you want to recover.. Provided your old SSD isn't junk, of course...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It works similar to windows, but identifies the drives differently on the left of the screen...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once you select a drive, the files and folders appear on the right in a manner you will recognize... You can then copy and paste what you want to save..</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I will include a link to a older version... This was a free program, but the newer ones are paid... This is a ISO that when properly burned to a CD, is bootable... It can also be put on a Flash Drive, but requires another 3rd party tool to do so...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/parted_magic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/parted_magic.html</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is most likely your SSD is corrupted beyond repair, and will need windows reinstalled, or possibly a Repair Install... A Repair Install may keep your personal files, but I wouldn't trust what it says... Plus I'm pretty sure you need to do a Repair Install

            <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wilco... i'll try out the linus software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Btw at this point Im fine about deleting everything in the ssd... I just need the OS to get working again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like mentioned before, the first step towards a repair install requires me to sign in, which i can't at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you guys help me out with this issue? Forget the data salvaging. I just need windows to work again and a factory reset is fine if that's what it takes. Only i can't seem to be able to reset the thing, and i cannot log in to the account.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any type of bootable recovery media ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, you can create a bootable flash drive of the latest Win 10 version from here...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just run the download tool and it will guide you through the process...</p>
<p>Be sure to check\uncheck the box to indicate you are creating this for another machine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will overwrite everything on your machine with the possible exception of your Recovery partition... if you still have one...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a quick check at Acer, and you should be able to download whatever other preinstalled stuff you may want...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it is possible to do a factory reset for reasons I have mentioned, but you could try obtaining the media from Acer to put on a bootable Flash Drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean install is probably all that will work if you can't login... But the factory media "might" work if you boot with it..</p>

<h2>            Xbox One telling me MW3 is no longer backwards compatible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a day ago, I spent a whole £15 (lol) on MW3 for Xbox 360 (obviously) and upon it arriving today I was somewhat dumbfounded to have my console tell me that “This game is not playable here” and to be given a link “For a list of Xbox 360 games playable
 on Xbox One.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this an isolated issue or is Microsoft being sneaky and removing titles from Backwards Compatibility without telling people? I searched for any news about it but nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In brackets there is (0x8082000c) which I presume is an error code, if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your time and any help.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not been removed from backwards compatibility.&nbsp; I would say the reason why your console is displaying this error is because it can't read this particular disc.&nbsp; Do you have any other Xbox 360 game discs to test on your Xbox One?&nbsp; If you do, are they
 working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you insert a backwards compatible Xbox 360 game disc into your Xbox One, the console will read the disc to see what's there.&nbsp; If your console can't read the disc it will display this message.&nbsp; For disc based games you must be connected to Xbox Live
 as the game will need to be downloaded for you to play it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things to try</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Verify your console can still read Xbox 360 discs.&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>If you don't have any other BC 360 games on disc, try a DVD movie.&nbsp; Make sure the disc you try is a DVD movie disc not a Blu-ray disc.&nbsp; If other Xbox 360 games disc work or a DVD movie, it's likely the fault lies with the disc and not the console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the discs for scratches or dirty smudges.&nbsp; Try cleaning the disc with some water and soft towel</p>

                    I have a homebuild computer, and I have xp sp3 installed. I have two hard drives, a 20gb sata and a 250 gb sata. I have xp installed on a partition on the 250gb drive. however, the partition doesn't take up all the space on the drive and is not located
 as far "left" as possible. the rest of the space on both hdds is unpartitioned. For some unknown reason, the bootloader got corrupted. I used my the recovery console and the command fixmbr to overwrite the old, bad bootloader and bootcfg to make sure it's
 set up right. however, the boot loader attempts to load from the unpartitioned space on the 250 gb drive. so I used a copy of UBCD4Win (ultimate boot cd for windows) and one of the programs there that's supposed to custom configure the bootloader. I thought
 I set it up correctly, but now whenever I attempt to boot, I get an error message saying &nbsp;"NTLDR is missing / Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart" I've run chkdsk and it returned no errors. Is there a way to custom configure the bootlo

            I couldn't find my boot.ini, I ran the recovery console and bootcfg /list, it said there were no entries to display. so I ran bootcfg /rebuild, and it failed. I then ran bootcfg /scan and that failed too. both the /rebuild and /scan commands returned an

            You have two hard drives. Perhaps it might be best to physically remove the hard drive that does not contain your installed OS. It seems as if the wrong drive is being scanned!

            already did that, still didn't work... I think the issue is the windows partition isn't to the leftmost area of the drive. the rest of the space on said drive is unpartitioned. I tried using gparted to move it left. it successfully moved it. chkdsk returned
 no errors again, and i tried fixmbr and then bootcfg /scan. no luck

            If you have two SATA drives and are booting on an XP installation CD or a Recovery Console CD you made, those do not have the innards necessary to understand SATA drives natively.<br />
<br />
(Daavee knows all this stuff too):<br />
<br />
If you boot on your CD and end up with a C:\ prompt (that is not right) and not a C:\WINDOWS prompt (that is what you hope to see), when you run bootcfg /list you may see:<br />
<br />
There are currently no boot entries available to display.<br />
<br />
When you run bootcfg /list you may see:<br />
<br />
Scanning all drives for Window installations<br />
Please wait, since this may take a while...&nbsp; (and it did...)<br />
Error:&nbsp; Failed to successfully scan...&nbsp; <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yada_Yada" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">yada, yada, yada</a></i><br />
<br />
When you run bootcfg /rebuild you may see:<br />
<br />
Error:&nbsp; Failed to successfully scan...<br />
<br />
If you run the dir command you may get an enumeration error and you won't find your boot.ini file either (I did not do more experimenting - I just wanted to get those few error messages).<br />
<br />
I just did all this on my system...&nbsp; booted on a Recovery Console CD I made and I was at the C:\ prompt, but it was really my external USB E drive (so all the bootcfg commands fail of course since even though it says C:\, it is really my E drive), the D drive
 is really by C drive and the E drive is really the CD I used to boot.&nbsp; It is sometimes all screwy for SATA!<br />
<br />
Not that if you install the Recovery Console as a boot option (like me and Daavee), you will not have these problems either.<br />
<br />
So, you can poke around in your BIOS and find the HDD Interface mode to something the Recovery Console can understand...&nbsp; or you can create a Hiren's boot CD which does not seem to have these issues and use it instead.&nbsp; You can use Hiren's to run chkdsk, fix
 your boot.ini, copy in a NTLDR if you need it, etc.&nbsp; It is very nice.<br />
<br />
If you go the BIOS route, here are some example adjustments I have accumulated:<br />
<br />
Before making any adjustments, you should make a note of what the current BIOS settings are so you can change them back when you are finished.<br />
<br />
The adjustment varies so here are some examples I have accumulated:<br />
<br />
The adjustment is made in the BIOS and could be under Integrated Peripherals, SATA Device Configuration, SATA Mode or something similar.<br />
<br />
Make a note of what the current settings are before making any changes so you can change them back when you get done or if things get worse (I am so confident).<br />
<br />
After you make the changes, save them and see how things look.&nbsp; You may have to try a few things to get it to behave.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to RAID/SATA mode, change the mode to IDE.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to SATA, change the mode to IDE.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to SATA, disable SATA mode.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to AHCI, change the mode to ATA.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to AHCI Emulation Mode, change the mode to IDE Emulation.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to SATA, disable SATA mode and/or change the mode to ATA.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to SATA Native Mode, disable SATA Native Mode.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to RAID/Autodetect AHCI, change the mode to Combination.<br />
<br />
If you find the mode is set to RAID Auto/AHCI, change it to RAID Auto/ATA (this was a Dell XPS 420)<br />
<br />

            can't download hiren's due to network issues. (unrelated). I do get a C:\WINDOWS prompt in the recovery console, however bootcfg seems to be unable to find the windows installation. I am still attempting to download hirens.

            I know Hiren's has some fix NTLDR stuff but I have never tried it.&nbsp; Someday I will try it, but not today.<br />
<br />
If your original problem was NTLDR is missing, using Hiren's you can browse the root drive C: and if you do not see ntldr out there (I think 245KB) , you can download one from my SkyDrive, copy it to a floppy or USB thumbdrive and
<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">sneakernet</a></i> it over to your afflicted system and use Hiren's to copy it to C:\ where it belongs.<br />
<br />
Even if you see one, I don't know what one Hiren's might have copied in to download it from my SkyDrive and carry it to the afflicted system by hand anyway to be sure.<br />
<br />
I uploaded a copy of the XP Pro SP3 file you need to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).<br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in this folder (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
C:\<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />

            I did that, and dropped ntldr into the root drive, and now it will access the advanced boot options (f8) and but will simply restart when it attempts to boot.&nbsp;

            That could be some progress then.<br />
<br />
I am getting ready to check out, but will leave you with this and if Daavee or somebody else can help out...&nbsp; I have to get some Zzzzzzs!<br />
<br />
Why are all my contributions here copy/paste?<br />
<br />
<br />
If there is a problem booting, XP is configured to automatically try to boot again and you can get stuck in a loop of just being unable to get past the boot options screen or none of the boot options you choose will work.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when XP has a problem starting or crashes and tries to start again, it will give you a "short" menu of boot options and none of them will seem to be the right ones to get your system going again.&nbsp; Something like this:<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
<br />
You've tried them all!<br />
<br />
The options resemble the XP Advanced Boot Options menu, but the one option you need (Disable automatic restart on system failure) is not offered because XP has gone too far along in the boot process and offers you a limited number of boot options.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, you must manually invoke the Advanced Boot Options menu yourself until you do see the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong><br />
<br />
When you do get to the correct XP Advanced Options Boot menu you want to see, it has options on it like these:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
<br />
Enable Boot Logging<br />
Enable VGA mode<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Directory Services Restore Mode (Windows domain controllers only)<br />
Debugging Mode<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong> <br />
<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
Reboot<br />
Return to OS Choices Menu<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What you need to choose from that menu is the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
</strong><br />
Then if XP fails to boot normally, you will see an error screen with information and clues regarding the problem and then you can decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
If you do not see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option, you need to reset your system and start tapping the F8 key on the keyboard until you do see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you miss the F8 window of opportunity, you need to try again and start tapping the F8 key with more urgency (sooner and more frequently) until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure, then select it.<br />
<br />
You need to keep trying the F8 menu until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure option, and select it.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your system is experiencing a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), we need to know what the screen says:</p>
<p>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</p>
<p><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></p>
<p>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</p>
<p>If it looks like there is some kind of file name listed under the STOP message, send that line too.</p>
<p>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</p>
<p>Respond to the queries and report back the results from the Disable automatic restart on system failure screen and you can decide what to do next.</p>

            <p>Check the error message very carefully as the insufficient space message can be generated by the disk you are trying to back up not necessarily the destination drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows backup uses the volume shadow copy service which needs some free space on the drive to work. The common cause is a lack of space on the System Reserved partition and is generated by the VSS Writer service.</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently started using Skype on an Android phone. I've just received some calls from someone who isn't a contact. Isn't there any way of preventing this, like there is in the Windows desktop version (Privacy -&gt; Allow calls from ... -&gt; People in my contact
 list only)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realise I can block people afterwards, but I don't want to get calls from them in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(N.B. I chose 'Calling' as the sub-topic, and 'Audio and Video' as the subject, because there wasn't really any other choice - they're not relevant.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help ...</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/b232ae29-b377-4d09-acd5-5f794b02dd94" title="GrahamHughes">
<p>
</p><p>Oh, that's unusual. I suggest that you refresh your privacy settings by setting your "Allow calls from" to "Anyone", and&nbsp;click Save. Once saved, please restart the application and revert&nbsp;your call privacy&nbsp;settings back&nbsp;to "people in my contact list only".</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, this setting&nbsp;will also block incoming calls (from people who are not in your contact list)&nbsp;to the Skype app on your phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the information above answers your query.</p>
<p>
