<h2>            &#34;The Microsoft Exchange Administrator has made a change that has now totally hosed your profile.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been an Exchange administrator and Outlook corporate user since Office 97 came out, so a minimum of 15 years. I know exactly what to do to repair or replace the OST, migrate, repair and recreate profiles. I am using Office 2013 with corporate Office365
 mailbox. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Got a message this morning: "<em>The Microsoft Exchange Administrator has made a change that requires you to quit and restart Outlook</em>".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I closed it... and I then got the message that Microsoft Office 2013 exited without properly closing the OST. Outlook didn't restart properly, it just hung.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened before on numerous occasions and has done ever since we switched from inhouse Exchange servers where we never ever hit this problem.
</p>
<p>Up till now I've always been able to fix it but today's different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what, I still get this dialog. </p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>Cannot start Microsoft Outlook. Cannot open the Outlook window. The set of folders cannot be opened. The operation cannot be performed because the connection to the server is offline</em>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, it's been hosed. Recreating the profile doesn't work. Recreating the OST doesn't work. Starting Outlook in any safe mode doesn't work. Even tried the shot-to-nothing of disabling hardware acceleration and add-ins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what's going on? Why can a change on the server totally hose the ability of Outlook to start up offline?</p>
<p />

    <title>Sending PDF to OneNote 2013&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarawofford  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sending PDF to OneNote 2013&#63;</h2>
                    I saw someone who works in the Microsoft store use a Surface Pro 2 to send a PDF to One Note by swiping from the right while the PDF was open, selecting Share &gt; OneNote. But when I try it on my own Surface Pro 2, OneNote isn't shown as an option.<br />
<br />
Extra info:<br />
I have Adobe Reader Touch and the desktop version installed, neither of them allow me to send it to OneNote from the Share dialogue. I can send it as a screenshot using Touch but that's obviously completely useless<br />
I bought the University package of Microsoft Office and am using the full version of OneNote, as far as I can tell.<br />
OneNote tells me when I try to insert a PDF as a printout to use the 'Send to OneNote 2013 Printer" but I can find no such thing in the Print dialogue of either Adobe Reader program. The only printers it lists are the ones in my house.<br />
Edit: OK, now it's telling me that the send to onenote printer driver was installed incorrectly and that i need to repair microsoft word from the control panel. I did that, restarted OneNote, and it's still giving me the same message about needing to repair
 it. Do I have to uninstall and reinstall microsoft office?<br />
<br />

            This is really more of a question about Microsoft Office. I've dug around and I think the problem is that Office was installed with some problems and when I try to Repair it, the printer driver is still nonfunctional. What I need to know is what to do
 now. Reinstall Office?<br />

                    Decided to upgrade my Surface Pro 2 to Windows 10 today (got the Pro 3 so this is kind of a test toy now) and after the upgrade I have no network connections.<br />
<br />
Device manager shows it is installed and working properly however there are no network adapters listed in Network Connections.
<br />
<br />
I tried plugging my Cat5 Dongle in and it seemed to recognize and install drivers etc... but again, its listed as working properly in device manager but its not showing up in Network connections.<br />
<br />
Ive tried everything I can think of, any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />

            <p>As mentioned in the previous post, did you try logging in using a different Live ID?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it works with a different Live ID, it may be the problem with a particular Live ID itself. For more help with issues on Windows Live ID, you may post your query

<p>That cannot be done using Mail Merge "out of the box"</p>
<p>It may be possible with the Mapilabs Toolkit.&nbsp; Google for it.</p>

    <title>Hotmail&#47;Outlook Passing More Junk Through - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kingray45  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotmail&#47;Outlook Passing More Junk Through</h2>
                    <p>For about the last 3 months, more and more junkmail is being passed through to us users.&nbsp; Problem with this is that Outlook 365, and probably Outlook.com, has terrible filters that put legitimate emails in the junkmail folder.&nbsp; Making me have to wade through
 at least 70 emails everyday to UNjunk emails that aren't supposed to be in that folder.&nbsp; Why did this start and how does it stop?&nbsp; I got sent to some page that sends an email to the Outlook/Hotmail team, but in my experience, they rarely take this seriously
 or in a timely manner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, before someone says it is because I visited some site that opened the door, think again!&nbsp; I've been using Outlook since its inception (both business &amp; personal use), and I know these trends; happens at least once a year without me doing anything.&nbsp; Bots
 and/or people get a hold of our email addresses, then bombard them.&nbsp; How are they even finding our email addresses if Microsoft isn't allowing it to happen?&nbsp; One of my emails it an Outlook email, and the other is an MSN email.&nbsp; Some of the same junk is going
 to both emails, and I don't use my secondary one when surfing the internet for things.&nbsp; These junk mails have nothing to do with things I shop for, look at, research, etc.&nbsp; Just random nonsense.&nbsp; My eyes are not well, and this is causing additional strain
 on them to find emails that weren't supposed to be in the junk mail folder, and move them before I delete the real junk ...
<em><strong>daily</strong></em>!</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, Hotmail/Outlook is just allowing outsiders to get our addresses, and then just go to town with no end in sight.&nbsp; I swear there should be a server-monitor on this sort of thing, because I've been complaining about this for decades.&nbsp; I'm overwhelmed already.&nbsp;
<em><strong>HELP!!!</strong></em></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Outlook allows you to manage junk emails that you receive in your inbox by using its features available like the Junk Email Filter. It is designed to keep junk email messages, also known as spam, from cluttering your Inbox. Regarding your concern, have you
 checked the level of junk email protection under the Junk E-mail Options? Also, do you access your account online through Outlook.com or do you use the Outlook app?

<p>I know Outlook very well ... been using it in business settings &amp; for personal use, and there are no settings to stop outside bots/people from obtaining email addresses from Outlook/Hotmail and bombarding them with junk.&nbsp; All of the legitimate email domains
 are in my <strong>Safe Senders</strong> list, but the Outlook junkmail filter isn't efficient at all and misses them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because it's putting good emails in the junkmail folder, I have to go through all of that junk to put the legitimate ones in my inbox by marking them as
<strong>Not Junk</strong>, and check my Safe Senders list again.&nbsp; I do not use Outlook.com ... I use Outlook 365 on a computer, not an app.&nbsp; Problem is that Hotmail/Outlook server opened the door to both my emails, and is passing through way more junk emails
 than it used to.&nbsp; To Outlook.com first, then on to Outlook 365.&nbsp; Having to go through over 70-100 per day is ridiculous!&nbsp; Whatever door that server opened, a few months ago, needs to be closed.&nbsp; I have brought up this issue before, through decades of using
 this product, and Microsoft got it to stop without me doing anything on my end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to be a software consultant, and I know what I'm seeing.&nbsp; It isn't anything with the programs themselves ... it's happening on Microsoft's server.&nbsp; Nothing to stop bots, hackers, phishers, etc., from obtaining email addresses through that server,
 and decide to start sending them crap.&nbsp; So, I'm seeking a Microsoft Web Developer to address this, and not ask me about things that don't pertain to what their server is allowing to happen ... dot period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only setting that pertains to this is below, and I can't use the other ones without having to cause myself even more work.</p>

<p>You obviously don't know how it works despite your claim.</p>
<p>Spammers obtain your email addresses from many places. However one of them isn't Microsoft's servers as they don't sell that information. Depending on your email address spammers could just as easily be doing a dictionary attack.</p>
<p>These things are completely out of Microsoft's control. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't like how Outlook.com functions then leave your suggestions through the Feedback mechanism in the ? menu when logged into Outlook.com.</p>
<p>Also, no real Microsoft employee is going to contact you based on your suggestions or your posts here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

            No, obviously YOU don't know how this works, and I don't use Outlook.com.&nbsp; Just don't respond, if you don't know what you're talking about.&nbsp; I don't need additional aggravation from those who don't know what they're truly saying.&nbsp; It's why I really do

<p>Oh yes, let me bow down to your great knowledge! LOL Just because you have a little knowledge in one small area of the vast tech field doesn't make you an expert in all things tech. I've worked many many years in tech and I would never claim to be an expert
 like you.</p>
<p>If you aren't using Outlook.com then why are you posting in the Outlook.com forum? Why aren't you posting in the Office 365 forum? Yeah, thought so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, done listening to your insults and trolling behavior. I've politely told you what you need to do to help fix the situation but you refuse. So be it. I too am done wasting my time with your "issue."</p>

Hi Ahmed... just so you know, this is a peer-to-peer USER support forum.&nbsp; We're just guys like you helping each other out.&nbsp; This isn't a direct pipeline to Microsoft...</p>
<p>But, to answer your question, yes, WP7.x doesn't support Arabic.&nbsp; We know that the WP developers are looking to provide additional language support in WP8, but we don't know which languages yet.&nbsp; Hopefully, we'll start seeing WP8 phones in real peoples'
 hands soon and we can determine if Arabic has been finally included.</p>

    <title>Managing Shared Documents for To-Be-Deleted Users - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Managing Shared Documents for To-Be-Deleted Users</h2>
                    
<p>I asked about deleting a user who has shared documents in this topic:&nbsp;https://community.office365.com/en-us/f/154/t/408031</p>
<p>The thing is that it is incredibly hard to take ownership of their shared documents when you have so many special permissions with your documents. We share a couple of folders, and in those folders are many more folders, and inside even more folders. Certain
 users have access to certain bottom-level folders, and place documents in them.</p>
<p>In addition, unsharing ANYTHING without taking ownership (dragging out of onedrive, syncing, then dragging back in for example) will cause the files to be deleted when we delete the user, so unsharing is not ideal in this situation, but our organization
 requires it.</p>
<p>So in order to prevent documents from deleted, you basically have to not unshare anything, and don't delete the users.</p>
<p><strong>Is there no way to access all the documents that user owns, including documents in folders that were unshared?</strong></p>

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>If you delete the user, all the files and folders in Documents library will be deleted. Because the files are stored in the user’s personal site and it will be removed. However, when other users share a folder with the user and the user put some files in
 the folder, these files will not be deleted. Because these files are stored in other user’s personal site.</p>
<p>If there is anything unclear, please let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>I’d like to explain that documents the user placed in the folders other people shared with him will not be deleted when the user’s account is deleted. The Shared with me is only a view to access the files or folders other people shared with you. The files
 and folders will still be stored in other people’s personal site. Site administrators are not able to access these files from the user’s OneDrive for Business library.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Ran</p>

<h2>            How to throttle OneDrive&#47;Sharepoint sync on startup</h2>
                    <p>Good morning</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have been running Sharepoint and OneDrive on O365 for about a year now. We all sync our content from the cloud to our local workstations/laptops using the current version of the OneDrive client. We have OneDrive set to start up automatically with Windows
 and in terms of keeping us in sync, that is fine. However what we have also noticed is that it takes very long time for other applications to start on boot up in the morning as they are competing with the OneDrive process for resources. Outlook in particular
 seems to not open until the sync is complete. Is there any way to throttle OneDrive sync so that it does not use all system resources as soon as Windows starts up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi
</span><span>Paul</span><span>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, you want to throttle OneDrive sync when you start your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>OneDrive sync process is automatic. when you start OneDrive, f</span><span>iles will be automatically synchronized to the cloud</span><span> through OneDrive.

<p><span>If you do not want to sync your files when you start your computer, you could disable your OneDrive when you turn on your computer: Left click the OneDrive on the lower right

<p>Many thanks for your reply Jonk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we disable OneDrive starting up automatically with Windows I am pretty sure people won't start it up themselves and then everything will soon be out of sync.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess what we need is some kind of scheduling that automatically starts the OneDrive process 30 minutes after full boot up so that people can get into Outlook to check their mail before the sync starts (which seems to block Outlook from starting fully).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this is possible...</p>

    <title>Excel 2010 Compatibility Checker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ed9213  say:</h3>
<h2>            Excel 2010 Compatibility Checker</h2>
                    <p>I have seen many questions regarding this topic, but no definitive answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excel 2010's Compatibility Checker, whether automatically or manually engaged, will show, for example, a "Minor loss of fidelity" warning when saving a file.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The dialog box will show a reason, for example, "Some cells or styles in this workbook contain formatting that is not supported by the selected file format. These formats will be converted to the closest format available."</p>
<p>The "Copy to New Sheet" button will copy this warning to a new sheet and add the number of occurrences, but will not specify which cells, or range of cells, is causing the flag(s).</p>
<p>Is there another layer of Compatibility Checker, an add-in, or a VB script, that will report the
<u>specific</u> cells/ranges that are incompatible?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

This is another example of a poorly implemented feature. It tells you there is a potential problem, but does not tell you exactly where. You see the same sort of thing in Word when there are changes to the NORMAL.DOT(M) template. You can set Word to display
 a warning that it sees changes, but it is too stupid to tell you what the changes are.<br />
<br />
I hope someone else has better news, I would like to learn the answer to your question too.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;edit&gt;<br />
Correction. I just tried it and there may be a PARTIAL answer.<br />
<br />
The sheet I tried it on indicated 2 possible errors.&nbsp; One has a blue hyperlink to "FIND" the problem. But the Find in my case wasn't very useful.<br />

    <title>Onedrive sync problems&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulgreisen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onedrive sync problems&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I was having sync problems with onedrive in the past, which I put down to a&nbsp;slow internet connection. I was only getting 5mb/s&nbsp;at the time. I therefore abandoned cloud computing and took all files off onedrive and held them on my PC. The only exceptions
 are&nbsp;a normal word template and normal email template, which I do not seem to be able to remove.</p>
<p>Despite having no files on OneDrive, I keep getting the following message:</p>
<p>"OneDrive for Business needs to close because there is not enough memory available. Please close down programmes and restart."</p>
<p>This occurs even when I have no, or few, other programs open. I have 16gb of RAM.</p>
<p>Also&nbsp;frequently when I reveal hidden icons on the right hand task bar it is flooded with synchronising symbols, which close one by one as I keep the hidden icon panel open.</p>
<p>When I try right clicking the onedrive icon in the right hand task bar, it often has no effect, although sometimes it does.</p>
<p>When I can access it, I have run the "view sync problems" app. This shows a number of problems back before May this year, always unsynced files. I have deleted the unsynced files after checking them.
</p>
<p>I have recently tried running repair, but this just seems to hang with a message "pausing - sync in progress".</p>
<p>When I hover over the ONeDrive icon it tells me it is syncing 17,522 files - but this cannot be correct as I have deleted most files from OneDrive a few months ago, and have deleted the unsynced files today.</p>
<p>I have reinstalled the OneDrive sync app, as suggested in the trouble shooting guide,&nbsp;but this has made no difference.</p>
<p>I now have access to better broadband connectivity, although as I live in a rural area that is only 17mb/s. Nonetheless I am keen to take advantage of OneDrive again, but am reluctant to do so until this problem is sorted. I hope someone can help.</p>

<p>Hi James</p>
<p>Many thanks for your help. What you suggested helped me to understand better how OneDrive works (ie files in two locations - cloud and computer - which are kept in sync which I had not really understood before) led me to a solution.
</p>
<p>Because what you suggested led me to look at the online files through the Web viewer, I realised there was a big difference between what was in the cloud (several thousand files) and &nbsp;on my hard drive (nothing) because I had moved all the files from my OneDrive
 directory on my hard drive to another directory on my hard drive. I therefore physically deleted all the files from the online directories, which seems to have solved the problem.</p>
<p>I am now uploading files again to the OneDrive directory, but this is a slow process because my connection is just slow. However, this time I am moving files in smaller groups - Fingers crossed the problem will not arise again.</p>
<p>Paul</p>

    <title>Extra line break above table after column break - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> corriancrooks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extra line break above table after column break</h2>
                    <p>WORD 2013, PC...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 columns on my page, the second page starts with a table.</p>
<p>If I use a column break to move the table to the second column, Word inserts an extra line break which means that the top of the table is not in line with the 1st column.</p>
<p>I think older versions of Word allowed this to be 'Suppressed' but this feature doesn't seem to be available in Word 2013. Is there any way to remove this extra line?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Background - I can repeat the issue creating a new document. The extra line break also appears if I do a page break. The line does not appear if there is no column or page break before the table)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I urgently need to get this resolved to any help would be grately appreciated</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>This is likely Space Before formatting rather than a line break. You can tell by&nbsp;<a href="http://addbalance.com/word/nonprinting.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Showing non-printing formatting marks in Microsoft Word</a> where a line break will show as a character.</p>

            That option unfortunately doesn't apply to column breaks. Instead of inserting a manual column break, use "Keep with next" formatting to force content into the next column.

            <p>What I had hoped to achieve (worked around using a 3x1 table to encapsulate the smaller tables):
<a href="http://puu.sh/dpJPF.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://puu.sh/dpJPF.png</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps I took:<br />
&nbsp;- Make 3 Excel tables (<a href="http://puu.sh/dpKeP.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://puu.sh/dpKeP.png</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Paste as RTF, add header row to each, minimize column width</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Show formatting characters</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Add column break before second and third tables to get them across the page (<a href="http://puu.sh/dpKHT.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://puu.sh/dpKHT.png</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;- For posterity's sake, let's remove the after spacing and set line spacing to 1.0 (<a href="http://puu.sh/dpKSq.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://puu.sh/dpKSq.png</a>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that there is a line break before the second and third tables despite the column break. Now, what happens if I delete the ¶s?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://puu.sh/dpL4d.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://puu.sh/dpL4d.png</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The tables are automatically merged and the column breaks just disappear. I tried this for hours yesterday and am sure that I have only highlighted the ¶ and not the column break. It seems to me that Word uses the ¶ to define the end of the table, but this
 has the side effect of putting a text line in between them. Column breaks apparently aren't programmed to perform the same function.</p>

            <p>OK, I see what you mean. What you can do is apply a style to the blank paragraph mark at the beginning of the column (after the break). Format the style as follows: font size 1 pt, line spacing exactly 1 pt, spacing before/after zero.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, perhaps you could use a single newspaper column and make use of a three column table for all data instead?</p>

            I ended up using a three-column table in a standard word page. I will have to keep the shrinking the ¶s method in mind for future reference. Thanks for the tip!<br />

            <p>Select the paragraph mark at the top of the second column, format the font and apply Effects "Hidden". That should do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The paragraph mark only disappear once you stop showing paragraph and formatting marks. This is the same with any hidden content.</li><li>If you save as XML and inspect the document, you will see that the column break is in a run and belongs to a paragraph, this is why a column break is always within a paragraph</li><li>Unfortunately, column breaks within tables are ignored, therefore you really need to do what you did and split tables and put your column break between the 2 tables</li><li>The ability to break a table, insert a column break and hide the paragraph mark at the top of the second column before the table is important in particular on the last page of a 2 column section followed by a Continuous break, this is one of the few ways
 you can control how Word re-balances the content at the end of a multi-column section.</li></ul>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Music player should have much space than having all commands on it..</h2>
                    <p>why so complicated music player? why dont make an simple music player having just 3-4 objects while you are playing a favorite song why all options are showing insteand of hiding them? why so hard to fiind the song while youre playing it. where is the "delete"
 key when i need it? why the words so big instead of having them smaller and why you dont try to make to looks something similar to this:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/beff080f-e4f3-42fe-96c2-bd3bfa36a0b0" />Here just an ex: just moving all the options keys and any other annoying button.in to that bar.</p>
<p>And letting only "graphic equalizer; song indicator,the name of the song and the last one the keys for prew/play/pause/next and if is possibile adding stop button as well. if i had a program to develop or creating a music player by my self... i should have
 lot's of ideas making improving the music player from windows phone.</p>
<p>Here is another idea not exactly but similar with this one too..but i recommend the frist one having clear screen on music player.bet many of us like it.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cc05933c-bd2f-4ad8-9829-0caf7c63b16a" /></p>
<p>an headphones notify would be nice to be shown when i m using it.</p>
<p>another think...</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/006dd954-98e3-4102-a386-9832632c279d" /></p>
<p>this one looks much better than original one...</p>
<p>keys for prew/pause/stop/next and that traverse song will be much better than original</p>
<p>and if is possibile to make them smaller not huge...the one who is having big phones should have more space in his big screen than 1 word having more than 50% display eaten.</p>
<p>This is the original one...except "graphic equalizer" Just look at it..the words so big</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58069296-e773-40d1-beda-30757e77a4e0" /></p>
<p>Really there is no way to make them smaller? i wish to make by my self an music player special for windows phone.</p>

    <title>Team Site Documents Library Not Displayed in OneDrive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iamtheari  say:</h3>
<h2>            Team Site Documents Library Not Displayed in OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>We are new to OneDrive for Business. We have the Office 365&nbsp;Enterprise E3 subscription and have paid for a year in advance. We are trying to migrate our documents but are running into some problems. All of the guidance we can find online appears to be out-of-date
 or inapplicable to Office 365 Enterprise. Our primary use case is for storing all of our small business's documents in a shared document library that will be easy for all our users to access using the desktop and mobile versions of the Office 365 applications,
 predominantly Word. We do not have separate teams in our company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default setup when we created our account appears to include a global Team Site for our organization. I am able to put files into the documents library that is part of that team site and synchronize them to my desktop. However, there is no link to the
 team site in the OneDrive for Business online interface. There are the links for Files, Recent, etc. for the individual OneDrive storage and then the organization name with a plus sign next to it to create groups, followed by "Groups bring teams together.
 Join one or create your own." But there are no groups listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to create a group using that plus sign, and it does not appear even after 12 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then to top it off, I am no longer able to log in using Chrome and had to use Internet Explorer to post this question. Chrome just gets an error screen saying that there was an error issuing a token. That problem just began this morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that we can get some guidance on setting up Office 365 Enterprise E3 to match our use case without requiring users to jump through too many hoops every time they want to access or create documents. We are migrating from an on-premises server and so
 far the Office 365 experience has been very frustrating.</p>
<p>

            Thank you for responding. Deleting cookies fixed the Chrome login problem. I had followed the team site and it did not show up in the list. Neither did any new groups that I created. So there was just nothing but a short text about what groups are useful
 for beneath our organization name. But the team site became visible there an hour or two after I posted this question. I had waited about 24 hours already but maybe the additional time was the trick to everything synchronizing.

    <title>UAC notice on startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ray lashley  say:</h3>
<h2>            UAC notice on startup</h2>
                    <p>Each and every time I open OneNote, I am asked if I want to allow OneNote to make changes to my computer. This is annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've set my account and the executable to run as administrator, yet I still get the warning. I realise that I can turn off such warnings, but I'd like them in other instances. Is there a way to stop the warnings for OneNote only? Can anyone even just explain
 to me why this happens for OneNote and not the rest of the suite (Word, Excel etc.)? Imight feel less annoyed if I just understood why it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<br />
This issue occurs when you run any <strong>*.exe</strong> file as administrator.<br />
<br />
I’d like to ask a question before we proceed.<br />
<br />
How did you set </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">the executable files to ‘<strong>Run as administrator</strong>’?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<br />
Let’s try the following steps and verify the result:<br />
<br />
1) Go to the following location:<br />
<em>C:\Program Files(x86)\Microsoft Office 15\Office 15</em> or <em>C:\Program Files(x86)\Microsoft Office 15\ClentX86 or ClientX64\Root\Office15<br />
</em><br />
2) Right click on <strong>OneNote</strong> (.exe) &gt; select ‘<strong>Troubleshooting Compatibility</strong>’ &gt;
<strong>Troubleshooting program</strong> &gt; uncheck ‘<strong>The program requires additional permissions</strong>’.<br />
<br />
3) Now select ‘<strong>No, I am done investigating the problem</strong>’ option &gt;
<strong>Next</strong> &gt; <strong>Close the troubleshooter</strong> and then try starting OneNote and verify the result.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps. Reply with the result and I'll be glad to assist you further.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</span>

            <p>Some developments and a possible cause of the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I started OneNote this morning, the UAC notice was back (boo!) but so was the missing notebook (hooray!). Checking the location of the notebook, I realised it was created by my other account on the laptop (I like separate setups for work and personal
 use). I've moved the notebook to the correct account/folder tree (C:/Users/etc.) and can still access it okay. I still get the UAC when I start OneNote though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through the previous steps and once again, OneNote starts without UAC, but without the notebook open. Wen I open the notebook and shut down OneNote, on reopening OneNote I don't get UAC and the notebook opens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I restart my laptop and open OneNote I don't get UAC and the notebook remains open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems a little unusual but I think the bottom line is; don't use a notebook from another windows account!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plan to use OneDrive and SharePoint now we've finally got the upgrades in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<h2>            VZaccess Manager bluetooth disconnects when over air ActiveSync tries to sync</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently paired my i760 with my laptop.&nbsp; I was able to get VZaccess (Verizon Access) Manager to recognize my phone as a modem via bluetooth.&nbsp; This setup is great because I can keep my phone charger plugged into my phone.</p>
<p>However.... I also have ActiveSync connected to my corporate email account which checks emails every 15 minutes.&nbsp; It checks email with my phone's data connection, not through my laptop connection.&nbsp; Everytime activeSync tries to check email,
 it kills my bluetooth connection with VZAccess Manager.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Any suggestions besides manually turning off Active Sync???? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm a bit confused because when I tether my phone with a USB cable, activesync doesn't affect VZAccess Manager.&nbsp;</p>

</p><blockquote>I turned on the unknown sources settings but cannot still get it to work am getting the error code still despite uninstalling and installing one note again.&nbsp; Great to hear you got it working though and
 it's another interesting clue in this drawn out puzzle! </blockquote>
<p>SouthernRose&nbsp; today is Dec 2 2018. I found this thread after trying to fix this issue for months. Here is the way it has to work. You have to leave the onenote that is not working and giving you the error code installed on your tablet (i have a fire hdx)
 then I did what meme suggested and went downloaded es file explorer from amazon app store. Then through Silk I used the&nbsp;<span>https://onenote.en.uptodown.com/android/download/671623 address and hit download it took a few times
 to get it to finally download for me then I went thru ES file explorer and found it under their downloads tab and then choose to install it**it asked if i wanted to install this newer version over the older version but I would not lose any data(I don't know
 if this was necessary but I had already done this part I cleared out all data from onenote and the cleared the cache before I did any of this) I tapped OK install newer version over older version and it installed brought me to a fresh version of onenote that
 had new notebooks on the side *its like if i had not signed in or used one note before, on the right it gave me the option to add my own note book with my own account and I signed and it WORKED all my notebooks synced and showed up and it working great. I
 hope this helps as I know the frustration and the need all my recipes are on one note so this time of year I need it! lol. Hope this works for you and anyone else and you enjoy your coming Holidays. Gratefully AppleCrumble</span></p>

<h2>            Word&#47;Equations Large Files</h2>
                    The new equation capabilities of Word 2010 (and perhaps 2007?) are greatly improved.&nbsp; However, I've noticed that the resulting documents are enormous.&nbsp; Even when saved as a pdf file, which typically compresses the file, the file is large.&nbsp; e.g., 3 pages
 of equations produces an approximately 8 mb file with no graphics!&nbsp; A similar latex file would be may a 100 kb.&nbsp; Is there a reason for this?&nbsp; Is there a way to compress the file?
                </div>

            This appears to be a Mac vs PC issue.&nbsp; I go between both.&nbsp; On the Mac side, the .docx file is 96 kb and the pdf (created natively using the save function in Word 2010) is 8.6 mb.&nbsp; I opened the .docx file on Windows 7, resaved it without making any changes
 and it became only 28 kb.&nbsp; I then saved it as a .pdf using the save function in Word 2010, and the pdf was 399 kb.&nbsp; I have uploaded both sets of files (mac and pc, .docx and .pdf) to my SkyDrive at the following link:<br />

<br />
It's pretty clear what is happening, and the main cause (Mac vs PC), but it would be great if this inconsistency between how Office interacts with the files on the two OSs could be fixed in the future.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.<br />
