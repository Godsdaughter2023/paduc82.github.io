            Hello Brandon, hope this message finds you well.
<br />
<br />Usually, such kind of an error is caused by a bad hard drive or a failure of hard drive partition. However, sometimes the OS is a troublemaker. So, my recommendation is to follow the steps outlined in this thread in order to diagnose the troublemaker. <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance-winpc/windows-10-boot-failure-boot-device-not-found/b27cc0ec-6838-429f-bd6f-48562c7889c8">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

            Hi Brandon.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1803 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Same junk mail everyday&#59; how can I make it stop&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Original Title:&nbsp;</strong>"junk mail"</p>
<p>The same unsolicited advertising emails reappear in my inbox everyday, even after I've told the junk button to block sender, every day. Mostly these are messages from legitmate businesses, but I send them to junk mail and they show up again the next day.</p>
<p>I have tried sending the domain to junk mail, but that does not block the sender either.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 pro won&#39;t start.</h2>
                    I think it has to do with update&nbsp;1803.&nbsp; I boot to the windows logo and spinning dots.&nbsp; I downloaded&nbsp;Windows 10 installation media and boot from the usb&nbsp;drive.&nbsp; Selected safe mode and it boot to a black screen that says Safe Mode on it and has a cursor
 and nothing else.&nbsp; I was never asked to login&nbsp;it just went directly to this screen

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />Once you are able to boot into safe mode, check the integrity of the system
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Last option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            You should do a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10.
<br />

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<h2>            Windows7SP1&#58; Cannot start Event log&#58; Error 4201 instance name not recognized as valid by a WMI data provider</h2>
                    <p>I've tried every solution I can think of <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">including
</span></em>doing a re-update-install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sfc shows no integrity violations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I find out *what* instance name is being passed, and how can I know what instance</p>
<p>name I should be using?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I.e. what instance names should some WMI data provider recognize.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What types of problems would doing an in-place update NOT fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has been following me for over a year now and I wasn't able to restore</p>
<p>to a previous state (they all fail saying they got an error in trying to restore the registry).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am running Security Home Essentials and its turned up nothing either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A large number of application crashes are showing up as happening in KernelBase.dll</p>

did the upgrade-in-place and reinstalled, it replaced IE11 w/with the<br />

8a+b -- N/A, It gives an error when I try to install it.<br />
Neither 10 nor 11 install since last 'repair install'.&nbsp; I had them installed<br />
before, but getting them installed was a royal pain -- and then I almost never<br />
used it, so haven't tried to track down install problem again this time, as<br />
it really wasn't a very "cost effective use of my time" ;-)<br />
<br />
8c) My googl is way old, I'm sure, but I don't really want to start it (one<br />
reason why it is so old), since it bogs down my machine when it starts<br />
up (mouse gets unresponsive etc).&nbsp; Once it is up, it was ok, but <br />
didn't have the extensions I was used to under FF(PM), and didn't like them<br />
installing their own update service like everyone and their mom...)<br />
<br />
Don't think I have any working FF... if I do, its happenstance.&nbsp; Ever since<br />
they went to the version of the month-club, I stopped updating.<br />
<br />
Used the last of the 3.6.xx series... ah, it still is installed, just don't<br />
have it on any of my menus.<br />

10. 1st one is likely the same issue (and same computer, but since then I ran the re-inst/upgrade (repair install?) which didn't fix the problem.&nbsp; If you notice, the last entry on the 1st one was me asking how to find out what the invalid WMI name was and what
 should it be...never heard back ....<br />
<br />
As for the 2nd one -- the low integrity level -- I figured out a way to check<br />
it regularly (hourly) via a linux machine script that logs in and checks <br />
the level.&nbsp; If it not what it should be, it fixes it, and sends me email telling<br />
me it had to fix it.&nbsp; After a while, the problem sorta 'went away'.&nbsp; Though not sure it had anything to do with what I did, since all I did was get more 'aggressive' in fixing the problem (by running the script hourly).<br />
<br />
Why didn't I schedule my job on Win?&nbsp; Have tried too many times.&nbsp; All of the timed jobs I've tried to install would eventually stop being run -- and I wouldn't notice it -- because I get no email notice when something goes wrong,<br />
vs. linux will send me email if the script doesn't run, can't log in, or if <br />
the integrity had to be fixed.&nbsp; <br />

Are you including those because of that integrity issue?&nbsp; I think I mentioned in<br />
all the verbiage there, that given further tests, I wasn't able to definitively pin it on MS SE, (or it's possible it was a bug in the client that did get fixed!)<br />
<br />
Did I answer all the Q's?&nbsp; Did I get them right? ;-)&nbsp; Do I get an 'A'? ;-)<br />
<br />
FWIW, several, if not all of my probs seem to occur after&nbsp; MS-patching sessions,<br />
so I stopped doing "Windows updates" and only install the 'security-only' updates, which you have to find and install manually.&nbsp; What a pain.<br />
<br />
If MS would just let me have my Win7 desktop on Win10 and let me buy<br />
the business ed. like I have in the past, I might consider upgrading,<br />
but having them axe the pinnacle of their desktop releases.&nbsp; Was so looking<br />
forward to Bill's forward looking 3D-mappings of data -- too bad he retired.<br />

2) Running?&nbsp; I rarely used it except for testing purposes, however, as I said in the last note "I **used** to have it installed, but the upgrade/repair<br />

4) Both IE10 and IE11 are offered on updates.&nbsp; When I had IE11 installed<br />

3. What do you mean by "connected to the internet"?<br />
In some sense, it's never been connected to the internet, though<br />
in another sense, it's been connected 24/7 since I got it.<br />
<br />
But likely from your perspective, it's actually connected.<br />
It's on an internal network and needs to go out through a<br />
proxy to access the internet.&nbsp; It can't (usually) address<br />
the internet directly, nor can anything outside access my<br />
winbox directly.&nbsp; The internal net is behind another Dell<br />
computer of the same age that acts as a server and runs<br />
linux.<br />

1) I know with 100% certainty my computer didn't come w/McAfee or norton<br />
or any other SW preinstalled.&nbsp; <br />
First reason,&nbsp; I bought it through the the small-business <br />
department as I've bought all my computers -- not the consumer<br />
dept.&nbsp; They don't put stuff like that on business customers<br />
unless they ask for it.<br />
<br />
2. It's not a repair disk from Dell, but a MS-Win7 install disk<br />
w/a complete copy of Win7 ultimate on it. I've also<br />
ran the same from the generic-Win7 disk distributed<br />
by MS a few years back.&nbsp; Even did a compare between <br />
the two DVD's and only parts that were different on the<br />
dell were a few screen background and some html reference<br />
stuff, and some licensing stuff on the Dell disks to <br />
recognize your serial-number+license from your computer's<br />
ROM.<br />

1) Why would you think MSE wasn't installed or working properly?<br />
It has tried to detect some sw programs I had installed (deliberately), <br />
and has detected 2 virii before I ran them.<br />
Looking at my update history, I see daily definition updates<br />
for MSE, all "Successful &amp; Optional".&nbsp; I have "full" scans run once<br />
a week, and currently have real time protection turned on again (depends<br />
on how my web-activities).&nbsp; Until ~ 2-3 weeks ago, I did often terminate<br />
the full scan after 48-72 hours.&nbsp; Last time I let it go until I saw it<br />
starting in on my network server via a UNC address (I have all my network<br />
drives excluded -- I didn't know it scanned drives via UNC address<br />
\\servername\[share]/...&nbsp; It had scanned over over 10million files<br />
before I stopped it.&nbsp; Since then I excluded "\\*" and <br />
the most frequent extensions (png is top @ 184162 files)<br />
on my computer (that weren't on MS's "blocked files" list) to<br />
&nbsp;the ignore list and now the complete scan takes &lt; 8 hours.<br />
<br />
2), On windows update, the IE10 update is considered "Important",<br />
while the IE11 install is considered "Optional".<br />
<br />
I looked in my MS-SW folder on my server and found the install <br />
images for IE11 I got to work last time I had probs... It <br />
claims it installed (though it wants me to reboot and haven't done<br />
so yet).<br />
<br />
3) Why would you think that?&nbsp; I sincerely doubt it, though<br />
since the computer isn't easily accessible from the net AND<br />
all my data is really on the linux server.<br />
<br />
So far, I'm afraid, you've mostly shot "wide"...(sigh)<br />
My degree was in computer science and my jobs I worked<br />
in the group's trusted technology (trusted OS w/mostly<br />

2) Running?&nbsp; I rarely used it except for testing purposes, however, as I said in the last note "I **used** to have it installed, but the upgrade/repair<br />

4) Both IE10 and IE11 are offered on updates.&nbsp; When I had IE11 installed<br />
before, it was a royal pain to install (took about 10 months).&nbsp; Since it was so painful and I don't use it that often, Trying to fix that problem is very low priority.&nbsp; here are the IE10 &amp; IE11 errors from Win-update:<br />

3. What do you mean by "connected to the internet"?<br />
In some sense, it's never been connected to the internet, though<br />
in another sense, it's been connected 24/7 since I got it.<br />
<br />
But likely from your perspective, it's actually connected.<br />
It's on an internal network and needs to go out through a<br />
proxy to access the internet.&nbsp; It can't (usually) address<br />
the internet directly, nor can anything outside access my<br />
winbox directly.&nbsp; The internal net is behind another Dell<br />
computer of the same age that acts as a server and runs<br />
linux.<br />

1) I know with 100% certainty my computer didn't come w/McAfee or norton<br />
or any other SW preinstalled.&nbsp; <br />
First reason,&nbsp; I bought it through the the small-business <br />
department as I've bought all my computers -- not the consumer<br />
dept.&nbsp; They don't put stuff like that on business customers<br />
unless they ask for it.<br />
<br />
2. It's not a repair disk from Dell, but a MS-Win7 install disk<br />
w/a complete copy of Win7 ultimate on it. I've also<br />
ran the same from the generic-Win7 disk distributed<br />
by MS a few years back.&nbsp; Even did a compare between <br />
the two DVD's and only parts that were different on the<br />
dell were a few screen background and some html reference<br />
stuff, and some licensing stuff on the Dell disks to <br />
recognize your serial-number+license from your computer's<br />

<p>Um, your last posting said: "Effective 12 January 2016, Internet Explorer 11 is the ONLY IE version supported (and updated) in Windows 7".<br />
<br />
To which I responded with the priorities given to the IE10 and IE11 updates in Windows update, "important" and "optional.&nbsp; The point being that it is odd that the only IE supported is one that is listed as optional and not even 'recommended'.&nbsp;

<p>Non sequitur. Having education and experience in one area doesn't imply one knows "everything", though it does indicate knowing "something".&nbsp; The only way I wouldn't need assistance from you would be if you are certain that you know nothing that I don't

<p>The government, historically has been one of the few funders of secure/trusted OS development.&nbsp; Similarly the trusted security solution on linux with the most traction/exposure is "SELinux" - also a government funded effort, though it doesn't seem to be
 the easiest or most flexible solution from my limited understanding.<br />

<p>The SOHO division used to be part of their consumer &amp; Home business, you need to be careful.&nbsp; Another factor leading to not getting crapware installed is requesting no setup or getting HW that doesn't support an install.&nbsp; That's almost impossible through
 their home division because they get money for installing the crapware, but its possible through their business div.<br />

</p><p>OEM-preinstalled SW requires that they do the install.&nbsp; For the last this machine and the server machine, I got a raw machine and installed my<br />
own disks (their disks were never used).&nbsp; That's why I said I was<br />
100% certain they didn't preinstall anything.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Another problem is installing extra software TAKES SPACE _SOMEWHERE_.&nbsp; I've never seen McAffee or Norton trying to *hide* their entire installation (there's nothing in the menus, nothing in the registry, no program-folder in either "program files" folder).&nbsp;
 Such deceptive practices would be illegal.<br />
<br />
I recently downloaded and ran MalwareBytes scanner -- it too didn't find ANYTHING amiss, well not exactly, it did warn me about some programs that do what they advertise doing (some Nirsoft progs) -- but they aren't self-spreading malware, they just get flagged
 by over-zealous scanners. w/nothing better to report.&nbsp; MSHomeEss flagged them too, years ago, as well as flagging a copy of them on a network mounted share -- gotta love MS, they can't index your network drives for searching, but they have no problem scanning
 them for other reasons.&nbsp; ;-/<br />

<p>I've tried MS's support for home products.&nbsp; The never proved to be worth the time.</p>
<p>

Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.<br />
</p>
<p>BTW, PABear, what is the point in asking all those questions to come up with "it must be 'crapware'" -- something not supported by any of the questions.&nbsp; Looking around MS's website, I notice that you seem to often ask if one question I ask is related to,
 or, several months later, if it is the same problem as another post.&nbsp; But never have I seen you post a solution to any of the problems, nor ask anything about the specific problems.&nbsp; What's up w/that?&nbsp; ;-?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>To answer your question: no, you can't have different size text in Notepad; this is because Notepad is designed for creating and editing text files using basic text formatting. I would recommend using Microsoft Word (which is part of Microsoft Office) to
 have different&nbsp;text styles etc (if you don't have Microsoft Word, and don't want to buy it, you can use a trial version. Also, there is an open and free productivity suite, similar to Microsoft Office,&nbsp;and provided by a different company, called OpenOffice,
 which you can use to have different text styles).</p>
<p>Although, I would recommend getting Microsoft Office, there is a program called WordPad (or TextPad, depending on your Operating System), which is designed for creating and editing text with complex formatting. It should be in Accessories (the same location
 as Notepad).</p>

<p><span>Hi Karl,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to get clarity on this issue and assist you with appropriate troubleshooting steps, please reply with the answers to the questions below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Are you aware of any changes made to this computer prior to the issue?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
How are you trying to import the camera photos onto your computer?</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the Photos Application is just disappearing, then I suggest you to follow the steps mentioned in
<em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/microsoft-store-fix-problems-with-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Fix problems with apps from Microsoft Store</span></a></em> and then try to import the photos from your camera onto your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You might not be able to directly import the photos from your camera to a specific folder in the Photos application, so I suggest you to import the photos from your camera and it will appear in the
 Collection tab in the Photos application. Then, you will be able to create an Album for all those pictures.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Else, once you connect your camera to the computer, you can go to
<strong>This PC</strong> &gt; <strong>Double-click</strong> on your camera &gt; Copy the photos that you want by selecting the photos and pressing the
<strong>Ctrl</strong> and <strong>C</strong> keys &gt; Then, paste those photos in a specific folder that you have created.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you want this folder to be visible in the Photos application, then you just need to go to
<strong>Folders</strong> tab beside to <strong>Albums</strong> tab &gt; Click on <strong>
Add a folder</strong> &gt; Then, select the folder where the photos are located.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For reference, you may also refer

            Try this and see if it goes away: 
<br />
<br />To clear the TPM
<br />
<br />Open the TPM MMC (tpm.msc).
<br />
<br /> If the User Account Control dialog box appears, confirm that the action it displays is what you want, and then click Yes.
<br />
<br />Under Actions, click Clear TPM.
<br />
<br />You will be prompted to restart the computer. During the restart, you might be prompted by the UEFI to press a button to confirm that you wish to clear the TPM.
<br />
<br /> After the PC restarts, your TPM will be automatically prepared for use by Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Otherwise you may have to go into your BIOS and find where TPM is and shut it off.

            There is no TPM update listed for ASUS:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4096377/windows-10-update-security-processor-tpm-firmware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/409637...</a>
<br />
<br />Microsoft says:
<br />
<br /> If the manufacturer of your device is not listed in the following table, please contact the manufacturer’s customer support department for next steps.
<br />
<br />Clear your TPM
<br />
<br />Important
<br />
<br />Before clearing your TPM, be sure to back up your data. Do not clear the TPM on a device you do not own, such as a work or school PC, without being instructed to do so by your IT administrator.
<br />
<br />How to backup:
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-manually-backup-and-restore-your-files/45859954-c9c3-403f-b997-e96c8e001963">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Follow these steps to clear your TPM:
<br />
<br />    Go to Start  &gt; Settings  &gt; Update &amp; Security  &gt; Windows Security &gt; Device security .
<br />    Under Security processor, select Security processor details.
<br />    Select Security processor troubleshooting, and then under Clear TPM, select Clear TPM.
<br />
<br />    Your device will need to restart before the process is complete.

            Is there instructions on how to install it? Tbh it doesn’t sound correct.
<br />It should be a .bin file when unzipped.
<br />What’s the model number of the Asus?
<br />
<br />I had to do mine via the BIOS but then apparently PC Specialist updates are unique.

<h3> mrs j_lb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fraudulent activity on my account</h2>
                    <p>Someone hacked my/my son's account yesterday, changed the password so we were locked out, &nbsp;added themselves as 'family' and then purchased £50 of X Box credit with my stored details.
</p>
<p>I have now reported this to my credit card company to push for a refund, removed my credit card details and reset the password, i.e. taken all the steps recommended by Microsoft.
</p>
<p>Tried to log on again today and the same thing has happened again, password changed and we were locked out - how do I stop this happening??? Luckily no more charges today as I've removed the card details. Will be a pain if I have to keep resetting password
 every day!&nbsp;</p>

<p>To me, it sounds like your email account has been compromised. So each time you change the password, they just do a forgotten password requested and change it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change your email account password and enable 2FA on both your email account and Microsoft account.</p>

<h2>            Flux Problems</h2>
                    <p>I really think the Intel driver issues with f.lux should have been solved by now - especially since according to the flux FAQ the updated (generic) intel graphics drivers solve the problem. However these changes are not yet reflected in the customised driver

<p>
</p><p>Please DO&nbsp;try (as a test) installing the generic Intel display driver on your SP3 to see if you had the same issue. As you've probably seen, it is months and months between releases of the Intel display driver, so the more data on your issue, the better.
 It is really important to know if the generic driver has the same issue on the SP3. If you post your results, I will try to see that it reaches some internal MSFT folks.</p>

            <p>Just to heap one more log on this fire, I have a Surface 3 (not Pro) and it also is freezing--and more frequently now. &nbsp;So far, maybe 10X today!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's more than irritating, it's really cutting into my productivity. &nbsp;I am NOT a power user and am not clear on disabling or even finding flux (or f.lux) to put into the SAFE mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought this machine on 5/8/15 and will stop by the Microsoft store where I picked this up when I'm back in the area in couple days. &nbsp;If anyone has a fix sooner, great. &nbsp;Otherwise, just know this problem is not restricted to Surface Pro 3.</p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I just upgraded my </strong><span><strong>Dell Inspiron 1526
</strong></span><strong>from Vista Home Premium 32 bit, which I never had a problem with, to Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bit. All of my files and programs were fine, but my printer settings seem to be messed up. I keep getting the message that the Print Spooler
 is stopping unexpectedly, and got the error code: 0x000006be. I saw on a Vista forum how to go in and manually turn on the Print Spooler and make sure it was on Automatic. So, I started it and it said it was automatic, but I tried to install my printer again
 and it stopped again. Please help. At the moment, I'm not so sure it was a good idea to upgrade. And the printer is brand new- it's a Canon PIXMA MP 250. I just bought it a couple of weeks ago and didn't have any problems with it in Vista. Thanks for any suggestions
 you can give.<br />

<h3> liberty55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will .pst files disappear at an upgrade to Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    We have problem to get actual Outlook data after upgrading from 8,1 to 10.<br />
<br />
Microsoft does promise several times (also at the start of the new Windows 10 version)<br />
that all your data will be available.<br />
<br />
How will Microsoft explain this? <br />
Can we do anything?<br />
<br />
(We have searched for .pst files on whole C: including windows.old)<br />

            As I said we have searched for pst files in windows.old<br />
I will try that again&nbsp;together with Microsoft people (hopefully - last time the connection failed on Microsoft side).<br />

Our experience of the upgrade to Windows 10 has been&nbsp;terrible.<br />
<br />
Microsoft says that if the system language is English most of the programs should be kept.<br />
For two computers we lost almost all programs including Office 365, which we pay for.<br />
Also Skype and Kaspersky virus, Malware Bytes&nbsp;were lost<br />
<br />
We talked to six different Microsoft support people about this Outlook case including the boss.<br />
The first 3 calls were broken and none of them called back after the&nbsp;break.<br />
One support person tried to connect to our computer but&nbsp;gave up after two failures.<br />
Their knowledge of&nbsp; Outlook&nbsp;is limited.<br />
<br />
The handling of several languages in Office&nbsp;2016 is&nbsp;weak.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For a fourth computer we got the&nbsp;message Please wait when starting the upgrade -<br />

    <title>No roll back to Windows 7 Prof option after Windows 10 install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pw_125  say:</h3>
<h2>            No roll back to Windows 7 Prof option after Windows 10 install</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my Windows 7 Prof 64bit desktop PC to the free Windows 10 with the intention of securing the digital entitlement then immediately rolling back to continue using Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded and ran the Win10 installation exe file and ran it. The Win 10 installation began.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After around 4 hours the PC restarted in Windows 10. </p>
<p>(The only point I had not anticipated was a setup for a Windows Mobile device driver (a mobile phone) wasn't supported and that was accepted for deletion.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 I used the - Settings - Update &amp; Security - Activation and confirmed the "digital entitlement".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then went to - Settings - Update &amp; Security - Recovery and there was no roll back to Windows 7.</p>
<p>There were two options, one of which contained an option to 'Go back to previous build'.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected that option expecting it to open with either further information or other options. It simply began, the screen changed to a mid blue background with the text "Go back to the previous build" and a small swirling circle of dots and the word "Restarting"
 appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC was obviously doing something and I left it to proceed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It has now been in the same state - same mid blue screen, same swirling dots for the last 12 hours. (It was left running overnight.)
</p>
<p>I am very reluctant to force a restart or reboot and propose to leave it running until I can&nbsp; discover a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why was there no roll back option?</p>
<p>What can now be done to regain the existing Windows 7 system?</p>
<p>The PC has a perfectly legitimate Windows 7 installation from a disc I own and which is here on the desk. This is not the sort of problem I expect from Microsoft!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any explanation, help or advice would be much appreciated - as you no doubt realise !</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Hello and thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>Which option did you select (Ex Keep nothing, Keep personal files etc.) While upgrading your computer.</span>"</p>
<p>There was no option about files to keep or anything similar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After running the 'Windows 10 upgrade' tool and confirming suitability of the hardware the Windows 10 upgrade process began downloading files.&nbsp; Then over a period of around 4 hours the process continued through downloading, installing, and eventually setting
 up files and then opening in Windows 10 desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I was not able to watch continually but did look from time to time in case any inputs were necessary, the only one I did see was about the Windows Mobile Device - which may have been referring to an IPAQ HP pocket PC device rather than the Windows mobile
 phone as I originally thought).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As explained I checked the digital entitlement and looked for the rollback to Windows 7 option but it was not displayed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also as explained the 'Go back to previous build' option commenced immediately and continued to run for many hours.</p>
<p>I left it running overnight and the because I was reluctant to attempt a restart or reboot (because the computer sounded as though something was running). In fact I went out for most of the day and left it running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 30+ hours of the screen indicating it was "restarting" I forced a restart by the reset button on the PC's case.</p>
<p>It then restarted and the screen displayed a one line message at the bottom of the same mid blue screen 'Returning to previous version of Windows'.&nbsp; After around 40 minutes the Windows 7 desktop appeared.</p>
<p>I have not had time to make exhaustive checks but it appears - emphasise - appears to be as it was before the Windows 10 upgrade began.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an desktop shortcut icon "Windows 10 Upgrade" and there is a Windows 10Upgrade folder on the C drive alongside the regular Windows folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whilst I now have the Windows 7 system back I am concerned that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. There was no option in&nbsp; Windows 10 - Settings - Update &amp; Security - Recovery
</p>
<p>There was option no roll back to Windows 7.</p>
<p>As I explained; there were two options, one of which contained an option to 'Go back to previous build' - a process which began without any further options or any meaningful indication of progress or lack of progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. the system apparently went into something akin to a perpetual loop which prevented the 'go back to previous build' process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can it be that the entire process was, in my experience, so unexpected?</p>
<p>I am really shocked and my confidence in Microsoft has taken a severe dent because of this experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I be assured that the future upgrade to Windows 10 will work correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your attention and assistence </p>
<p>
</p><p>I trust you will not close this thread as 'resolved' until you (or someone) provides some explanation of why the process was so different from that described and why the entire process took so long with no indication of there being a problem.&nbsp; Please ask
 if you need any further details of the hardware or anything else which may be helpful.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Don't be afraid to reset or do a hard shutdown if you must and always BACKUP YOUR OLD DATA AND HAVE SOURCES FOR YOUR APPS/PROGRAMS PRIOR TO UPGRADING AND DOWNGRADING.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the installation process were to fail it would either just be hung or revert to the previous state USUALLY. But that is why you make backups. Image the drive if you must. You should anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that for many people the process scares them silly and they are afraid of 'killing' their computer (you can't do that, it's not living!) but use some prerogative and initiative and assume that it ain't going to come out unassisted now and then. Microsoft
 farmed 10 out to India in the first place, there was your sign. They've been trying to fix it ever since.</p>

            <p>Hello and thanks for taking the time to reply, apologies but I didn't see your ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I certainly do have backups. I am very well aware of the types of problems which can, and do arise. I have a lot of experience with PCs and software - but this situation was entirely unexpected and the timing was unfortunate.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already assisted other people with upgrades to 10 and roll back to 7 or 8.1 and each of those was&nbsp; straightforward and painless.
</p>
<p>
I had almost not taken the free ugrade for all the reasons it sounds like you are aware of! But at the last minute I thought 'what the ****' why turn down a free upgrade I might eventually want to use (once and then "if and only if" it has been bedded in and
 other&nbsp;guinea pigs have done the necessary - exactly how I approached Windows 7).&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>My main issue with this fiasco, was the fact the screens were different to upgrades I had done only a week before, there was no roll back to Windows 10 and then the completely ambiguous situation of the PC apparently 'hanging'&nbsp; in a perpetual loop.&nbsp; BUT
 there also being sounds of a hard disc reading and writing (I know this PC and the hard disc(s) running and the mounting frame inside the case combine to a recognisable noise) PLUS the swirling onscreen indication 'something was working' (or giving that impression).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... because of other things happening in the real world I had little option than to let it continue - there was nothing to be lost, a lot of further inconvenience to be gained.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, many hours later I did force a restart and then it behaved and began returning to Windows 7 - which then took only around 40 minutes to return to what appears the same Windows 7 setting I had originally.</p>
<p>
Thanks again for the reply.<br />

            <p>I waited a while to get 7 in the first place, and then they wanted me to go to 10 shortly afterward, which was just stupid. I'm also pretty sure that many of the updates they've sent for 7 and 8.1 were probably meant to degrade the performance of IE 11 etc.
 and make you think that it was junk. The real problem is that Microsoft itself has been tossed to the wolves, outsourced to Indian tech workers who proved to be fairly incompetent as well as severely rushed. As bad as Steve Ballmer might have been, this was
 ridiculous. Microsoft was supposedly basing the future of Windows on this and it was junk, looked much like 7 or 8.1 and still has severely crippled Mail features and a new browser that doesn't cut the mustard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And WHY do I get the impression that new installs are the same piece of garbage that was being downloaded one year ago, even knowing the problems the first release had...and everyone is expected to TWEAK IT THROUGH...something nobody has really had to do
 in a while and a skill that was lost for an entire generation or two of new users (that is about ten years in computer terms)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of people don't know what an 'old' computer is...ten to FIFTEEN year old PCs are floating around in the used market and they all look new to most people. Nobody tends to look up all the old Dell Dimensions out there and realize Dell stopped selling
 them here in 2007, before 7 was in use pretty ,<strong>Vista</strong> was the current system!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computers are basically the new 'car'. Everybody feels they need one and few know the difference, as long as it 'works'. Whether or not the time was right for a new Windows, and even given that the economy might support it, the fact that it was offered for
 'FREE' suggests that the need for the 'carrot' was stronger than the perceived economy and people were still highly conservative with their wallets and option for more durable goods and quality used goods.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And YES, the reputation Microsoft has garnered over the years has been that you should wait a while or for the second or third revision before adopting. It is true that many seem to think the OS should work right the first time, but it's not realistic and
 unlike Apple, PC developers threw convention to the wind and just kludged the dickens out of Windows from day one&nbsp;to make it do what people wanted. By the time Microsoft instituted tighter controls and the EULA (End User Licensing Agreement) it was too late
 and Windows has been compromised to make all the old, non-conforming software and routines work. They've paid for it big time over the years, having to abandon basic principles of internet browsing as they became unsafe...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There you have it. INTERNET is killing Windows. Nobody had these problems until they had INTERNET ;-p</p>
<p>
</p><p>The internet is evil!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So much for all of that/</p>

            <p>Hello Kumar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologise if you are waiting for one of your senior colleagues to provide you with information.</p>
<p>But I had anticipated you would have responded to my reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understood you asked me to&nbsp; "<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">write back with the complete details" and "we'll be glad to assist you</span>"</p>
<p>Please explain why you have not replied to the answers I gave to your first questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said in my reply:</p>
<p>"There was option no roll back to Windows 7."</p>
<p>"I trust you will not close this thread as 'resolved' until you (or someone) provides some explanation of why the process was so different from that described and why the entire process took so long with no indication of there being a problem."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have other questions arising from my experience:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have a folder titled "Windows 10Upgrade" on my C drive but that is only 15.5Mb (95 files in 8 folders)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I be certain that when I do upgrade to Windows 10 it will work correctly ?</p>
<p>How can I copy and retain (or in the future confirm) the 'digital entitlement' to Windows 10?
</p>
<p>If I used the Windows 10Upgrade file now on the C drive how could I create a Windows 10 bootable disc from which to make a totally fresh installation?</p>
<p>Could I upgrade using the Windows 10 ISO file I downloaded during the free upgrade period?</p>
<p>Is this the quality of service Microsoft customers deserve?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance, I look forward to your reply to these and my original questions.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It's been pointed out endlessly that once you have installed and authenticated you could do a clean install, your 'key' is part of your Microsoft account now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no, I didn't read it right the first time so this is a complete edit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You won't need the key again, but if you have to change out the motherboard etc I would suppose you'd have to validate that you got the free update in the first place.. that would probably work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But your question is answered if you are indeed waiting to mark it so, I believe. because you can do a clean reinstall I think with the file you have, just not the first install.</p>

</p><p>My problem is pretty much the same though not entirely. I have lost the Arial Nova family of fonts which I got strangely enough when I upgraded to Windows 10. There was a substantial update/upgrade of Windows 10 yesterday on 28/09/2016. Now after this I
 can't find the said fonts family on my computer. Is there any way of fixing this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance,</p>

            <p>Hi Christian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may follow the steps below to fix missing fonts in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type Edit in Cortana.</li><li>Then click on option Edit language and keyboard options.</li><li>Find Language option and check what language is set as default.</li><li>If you want to set a different language, you can change it by clicking “Add a language” option.</li><li>Choose your preferred language and click Set as default.</li></ol>
<p>This isn’t the best solution, but it might help if English is not set as your predefined language, so it’s worth checking out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Karina Aris - Are you serious? I am looking for help with several fonts that have gone missing on my system - suspiciously in the last few weeks and since major Win 10 updates - and found your suggestion. Can you understand why your Microsoft "clients" might
 be frightened of this suggestion? 1. Why type anything in (or even use) Cortana?</p>
<p>2. To fix a font issue, you want me to "Edit language and keyboard options"? 2. You want an English-only speaking User to add a language? 4. You suggest an English-only User NOT set English as their predefined language?? I am mystified, without further explanation.
 I do have English Australia and English UK loaded.</p>
<p>Why have my fonts disappeared? Publisher shows them as censorship masks. Word and Powerpoint show them as present but display them as arial. Control Panel doesn't show them at all but installing them, reports they are already installed. After being re-installed,
 they still don't appear. Amerigo BT is one example but I have several others, even Arial Black.</p>

<p>I agree totally with your post.</p>
<p>I have the same issue with all my ITC fonts. GONE!!!</p>
<p>I was wondering if you have received any response on this. I do not feel I should have to repurchase all the fonts I have lost. (Yes, the were purchased, not "given to me by Windows, or free fonts).</p>
<p>I hope someone will respond and let us know what we are supposed to do.</p>

<p>Debby, I had the problem with quite a few fonts but I think they all came with various software over the years and are stored in my own 'fonts library' from which I install as I require. Biggest problem was with CorelDraw so I manually installed the fonts
 that I immediately required. Now, several Windows updates later, I notice that the "missing" fonts appear to be back again - no 'censorship masks' in Publisher, and Word/PowerPoint seem to report all fonts OK. Would be nice if MS could just admit "oh, sorry
 guys, that's our fault but we'll fix it in the very next update, v10.0.0.5.6.8.45.34.23.0.1 (font issues sorted)." Check your fonts, have they magically returned?</p>
