    <title>Cannot see update details for apps in store. Help&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot see update details for apps in store. Help&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When apps get updated by their developer, there is an icon at the top of the Store page showing how many apps are awaiting action.</p>
<p>Clicking on this icon takes you to a list of apps with updates available.<br />
On Windows Phone 8.1, I used to be able to tap the name of the app in this list, and it would take me to the app details on the store.<br />
On Windows Phone 10, there doesn't seem to be a way to do this. In order to see details of the update, I have to back out of this list, search for the app, and then open the details manually.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I find this to be very annoying. Can anyone help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft is already working on a solution, could you please link me to the details?</p>
<p>If I'm just a dunce that can't see an obvious solution right in front of my nose, could you please enlighten me?</p>
<p>If i'm posting this in the wrong place, could you please direct me to where I can get some answers?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>Hi Justin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That doesn't help me out. I know how to find the apps that have updates. <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d4b395f9-4075-4a29-b23c-df4c9d3fc15d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d4b395f9-4075-4a29-b23c-df4c9d3fc15d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For each of these apps, if you wanted to see what the update details were, you'd have to go to the search button and manually type in each app name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On WP 8.1, you could just tap the name of the app and it would automatically take you to the store page of the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to do this in WP10?</p>
        </p>

Can anyone help me with this question? Is it possible to make this suggestion for a future update to the store?

<h2>            Color scheme changes on different computer</h2>
                    
<p>Why do PowerPoint presentations created on my home computer change color when shown on my office computer? Computer have same Office 2007 and same Windows XP.&nbsp; Problem is that it causes pie charts to be recolored in a way that makes it very hard to tell
 one section from another, and generally spoils the presentation's appeal.</p>

<p>Please check on the data points in the problem charts, too -- there's a bug with displaying pie charts with data points that are zero in PPT 2007, and I wonder if that's the issue here.</p>
<p>There are differences in color schemes in general between PPT 2007 and 2003, but if you are not editing the file, then just opening it and presenting shouldn't cause any color shifts. What you're reporting is very unusual! That's why I'm wondering if that
 zero is coming into play somehow....</p>
<p>As for the file size, you got it exactly. When you'd copy a chart from Excel and paste into PPT 2003, the whole workbook came along for the ride. That created very large presentations and also opened up people to unwittingly sharing their data because they
 didn't realize the whole workbook would be included.</p>
<p>In PPT 2007, when you copy a chart from Excel and paste onto a slide, it creates a link to the Excel workbook. So when you send the file to someone else, they only have access to the chart pieces, but not the data itself (unless they have access to your
 server or drive where the Excel file lives, of course). So the chart can be edited as far as formatting -- colors, fonts, etc., but the data is not accessible or editable by the recipient.</p>
<p>This wouldn't&nbsp;affect the color of the charts, though -- unless, as I mentioned, you actually opened the charts to edit them. Or if you told PPT to convert all charts. (And if you didn't see a message prompting you to convert all or edit existing, then you
 probably didn't do that.) Or if you appled a new color scheme to your deck. Or if you edited it some other way. But just opening and presenting shouldn't change your colors (sorry to keep repeating myself!) -- I know the PPT developers worked really hard to
 ensure that fidelity (display) was the same in both 2003 and 2007 when you'd just open and present. So right now I'm leaning toward that 0 data. :-)</p>

<h2>            Where is the Next Build Gabe&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It is now nearly a month and despite empty promises about a new build from Gabe on this forum, we are still stuck at build 10130 which is still in my view a long way from being ready to release.</p>
<p>Seeing as the release date has been set for July 29th I can see Windows 10 falling flat on it's face if it is any where near as buggy as 10130.</p>

<h2>            Mac Office 2011 MS Word error message - Visual Basic not available&#63;&#63;&#63; what do I do</h2>
                    Have migrated from Macbook Pro 2008 to new Macbook Pro 2014 this week. THEN Disaster, Word wouldn't open - says I need a VB applications program ($%^&amp;*?). How/ where do I get that? What does it cost? I followed someone's advice to move : plist and Normal.dot
 files to desktop. This worked for a couple of days and I was able to work on my Word documents (except for EndNote referencing), but the problem has returned. I am trying to complete a doctorate....and this is not helping. Hope someone is able to help me.
 Thank you in advance. My next issue will be getting Endnote up and running.

<h2>            Possible to reset an existing Sharepoint site home page to offer the Group experience instead&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We have a mixture of Office 365 Groups that were created as groups, and a few older Sharepoint Team sites. I understand Groups and Sharepoint Team sites rely on the same technology and are closely linked. Since we never made significant modifications to
 our Sharepoint team sites, I would like to restart them as Groups. For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past, I have arcived the document library, deleted the team site, &nbsp;created a new Office 365 Group with the same name, and re-uploaded the document library. That is a huge pain as I then have to delete and re-sync dozens of users local file syncs.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Is there a way to keep my existing Sales Sharepoint team site, and easily transition it to default to the Group experience? Below you can see our sharepoint Sales team site in Fig 1. I want it to instead offer the Group experience shown in Fig 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Jesse,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to explain that it's not feasible to set the original SharePoint home page to the New Group Experience. I understand it will be great if we could apply the Group Experience to
 SharePoint home page. Therefore, we suggest you submit feedback in our <a href="https://sharepoint.uservoice.com/forums/329214-sites-and-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SharePoint Uservoice</a>. Many new features came directly from customer's feedback. We appreciate your valuable insights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jared </p>

<h2>            One Drive for Business Next Generation Deployment Windows 8</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.&nbsp; I am currently testing One Drive for Business Next Generation.&nbsp; I have Windows 7 and Office 2016 so the new One Drive was available because I have 2016.&nbsp; I did run the steps by adding the registry key to add an account and default to business.</p>
<p>Some of the users I will be deploying this to are on Windows 8.&nbsp; With Windows 8, there is already a One Drive.&nbsp; I will be installing 2016 on their computers as well.&nbsp; Given they already have One Drive, are the steps any different than my running it on my
 computer with Windows 7 and Office 2016.</p>
<p>When I look at the steps in the documentation,&nbsp; it seems to indicate they would be, but Windows 8 already has One Drive whereas Windows 7 did not, so I would like to confirm.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>All my best,</p>

<p>Hi Kathy,</p>
<p>Actually, there is no difference to deployment the OneDrive for Business Next Generation Sync Client in Win 7 and Win 8. When you have OneDrive.exe installed and already have a personal account configured in Win8, then you can just choose to not install
 a new client and you can set <strong>EnableAddAccounts</strong> by deploying the “EnableAddAccount.reg” file included in the

<h2>            Future of Windows Phone&#58;  May 2017 Update</h2>
                    <p>Guess what??? &nbsp; AT&amp;T no longer sells Microsoft Windows Phones. &nbsp;And Verizon only sells the Microsoft Lumia 735 on-line. &nbsp;<strong>So, you CANNOT PURCHASE the newest model Windows Phones from
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>any</em></span> U.S. wireless service provider. &nbsp;
</strong>Windows Phones <strong>can now <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">only</span> be purchased</strong> from the Microsoft Store, or from some 3rd-party retailer. &nbsp;This is a REAL SHAME because the Windows Phone is absolutely GREAT!!! &nbsp; There's
<strong>ONLY ONE THING WRONG</strong> with the Windows Phone: &nbsp;<strong>IT LACKS &nbsp;APPs</strong>! &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Evidently, Microsoft's offer of Universal Windows Platform (UWP) bridges to make it a lot easier for developers to create Apps for Windows phones has fallen flat,<strong> because mobile&nbsp;</strong><strong>App developers don't seem to be paying much attention
 to UWP</strong>. &nbsp; I've not seen much of a upsurge of existing iPhone or Windows desktop Apps being converted so they work on the Windows Phone. &nbsp; Believe me, I have written emails and "Community Forum" inquiries to mobile App companies, and even written letters
 to mobile App company Executives when I could identify them, asking to please have their developers port existing iOS or desktop Apps to UWP, so they work on Windows Phones. &nbsp;<strong>But none of this has worked, I guessing, because most mobile App companies
 simply have no interest in supporting Windows Phones .... PERIOD! &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Because Verizon is my service provider, the only Windows Phone available to me is the Microsoft Lumia 735. &nbsp;I love using my Microsoft Lumia 735 Phone with Windows 10. &nbsp;<strong>BUT,
</strong><strong>Microsoft's own development organization has just killed off</strong>
<strong>the future of the </strong><strong>Microsoft Lumia 735, </strong><strong>by not including the Lumia 735 in the Windows 10 Creator Fall Update, and announcing there will be no further support for Windows Phones left off the Creator Update list. &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This
 is </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>absolutely unbelieveable</em> since the Microsoft Lumina 735 is the
<em>ONLY </em>Windows Phone STILL BEING SOLD by a U.S. wireless company!</span>&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Verizon Microsoft Lumia 735 Phone users like me will have to either switch to a different wireless company, or convert to an iPhone/Android phone ---
<strong>neither of which I really want to do</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So, with no U.S. wireless company selling Windows Phones </strong>(except for Verizon selling the soon-to-be unsupported Lumia 735)<strong>,</strong>&nbsp;
<strong>the future of Windows Phones looks like this:</strong> &nbsp;<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">DEAD, BURIED AND FORGOTTEN</span>!!! &nbsp; &nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks a lot Microsoft --- for pushing me away from my Windows Phone, and right into the iPhone or Android phone I never, ever wanted!</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm in Melbourne, Australia and use the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Lumia950</span>. I recently was told by the Microsoft Australia Lumia Customer Care company, called B2X.com, that Microsoft no longer support any of the Lumia phones and that the new Microsoft phone will be the HP Elite x3 (No mention of it being a Windows10
 phone, just simply a "Microsoft phone", their words). I went back to my service provider and noticed that the only phone they offered, which is the Lumia 950, is no longer on display. I went online to check out the HP Elite and see that it is as old as the
 Lumia950, if not older. Offering that as the 'new' Microsoft phone doesn't make sense as it is also a Win10 phone. It is more&nbsp;for business and more expensive too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this research has resulted from trying to locate a battery for my Lumia950, as it is getting close to the time to replace it. I've had my phone only one year and use high power usage apps. I contacted the authorized Microsoft Lumia phones repair service
 here and they have stock of the battery, thank goodness. My phone also had an OS update yesterday,18may, so something is still being supported, tho I'm not sure if that was the&nbsp;last update it will receive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has not informed me, personally, via email or by phone push notifications, that they no longer support their current Windows phones. I think that is very poor customer service or care about its client base. However, my phone service provider technician&nbsp;this
 week&nbsp;informed me that he is attending a Microsoft phones conference re the future of their phones and that Microsoft are re-designing the phones to use an Android universal platform that will communicate with all Microsoft devices, not just the phones, but
 that it will NOT be a Windows10 phone, and my telephone service provider will know by mid-June what will be available in the future. I have made a note in my diary to follow up.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Hello, "jmndotme". &nbsp;Thanks so much for letting us know about your experience with the Lumia 950. &nbsp;I've also seen other postings by Windows Phone users with similar concerns and complaints about the
<strong>lack of customer support, and </strong><strong>the ambiguity that Microsoft has allowed to fester about the future of the Windows Phone</strong>. &nbsp;Unfortunately, complaining about this in the Microsoft Community Forum doesn't seem to get the attention
 of anyone within Microsoft who can actually do something about it. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>What all of us Windows Phone users should do is complain directly to the Microsoft Senior Executive in charge of the Windows Phone:
</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px"><strong>Mr. Terry Myerson</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 90px"><strong>Executive Vice President of the Windows and Devices Group &nbsp;</strong></p>

<p style="margin-left: 90px"><strong>One Microsoft Way</strong><br />
<strong>Redmond, WA 98052-7329</strong><br />
<strong>USA</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">This guy Myerson is responsible for Microsoft's software platforms, apps, games, store and devices, including Lumia phones. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I intend to correspond directly to Mr. Meyerson's office, listing my complaints about the apparent lack of device support, and lack of a future for the Windows Phone. &nbsp;Most likely, I'll send him a hardcopy letter. OK, I know a "hardcopy
 letter" is archaic in today's digital world, but email or other digital postings (if you can find his email, Twitter or Facebook address) usually don't have much chance of getting the attention of someone at his corporate level. &nbsp;And calling Microsoft's corporate
 headquarters is, most likely, a waste of time, since the phone call probably would not get through to his office, much less to him. &nbsp;All they will do is direct your call to Customer Service, where it dead-ends! &nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Its been my observation that </strong><strong>if enough customers complain about an issue&nbsp;directly to the senior excutive in charge of the product, that issue
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Simply put, Microsoft really needs to articulate their evolution plan for Windows Phones (if there still is one), and provide Windows Phone customers with a clear-cut understanding of the company's going forward support for
 it.</strong></p>

            I really love my MS phone too. And I'm sad I may have to switch soon as well. I really like that I don't need an app replacing every website I go to... &nbsp;I could just use the little Internet Explorer app for EVERYTHING (ok almost everything minus bitmoji
 - argh I love those!) - but this concept is genius! I mean google is good but this concept for a phone is better. I hope MS makes a comeback on their mobile devices. There are so many cool things on my MS phone compared to my android (my company gave me a
 phone - not my choice). My MS phone is a better bridge to being online and interfacing to my laptop/PC/Surface. I genuinely feel like I'm taking my office with me when I'm mobile. #sadface #callitacomeback

<p>I love Windows phone and still use my soon to be no longer supported Windows 8 phone, 4 years old, 12/06/17</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also "pass the time" well if that's what you call an addiction, supporting the community in answering questions in this forum</p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation is actually dire as within the last 4 years we have lost? TWO of the four operating systems, (&amp; not the mm ones either) leaving us with one that has yet to invent memory expansion the other albeit the most populous MALWARE! and has no effective
 RAM management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First apps follow the phone market, there is no incentive to devote resources to an abandoned market, what we saw in Symbian, apps are no longer updated and no new entrants (remember Google was nowhere once)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows phone 7 also show you have to keep moving, on Window 7 the serious major phone maker released device
<strong>SAMSUNG, LG, HTC.</strong></p>

</p><p>Re buying phones from MS <a href="https://clove.co.uk/microsoft-lumia-950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ancient history</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>We really can't afford to lose Windows as it is a viable O/S, indeed it may be one step back in order to go forward and that maybe a problem for some already (suffering) on W10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would go out tomorrow and buy a Lumia 950 only if it ran Windows 8 out of the box</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is Windows 10 it was never ready, not tested enough and cannot be fixed</p>
<p>the pressure was to release the 950 with 950 running on it out-of-the-box</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft have simply 'pulled' all Windows 10 phone simply to stop bad PR of its flawed O/S not a H/W but a S/W problem
</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Going back in time MS were selling Windows 8 phone by buckets sometimes it was the top selling O/S for a particular month</p>
<p><strong>Additionally there were 6 WP 8 software updates without incident, #1, &nbsp;#2, Amber, Black, Cyan, Denim</strong>. During the COLOURS there was the announcement that all W8, would receive the first W10 upgrade... and then after "testing" only certain
 models qualified this was the first real clue not all was right with W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite this there is a significant premium included in buying phone on launch even discount the free dock, here is the
<a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/compare.php3?idPhone1=7262&amp;idPhone2=8346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Lumia 950 v Google Pixel</a>&nbsp;to show a year before the Pixel (playing catchup), your flagship on your O/S was PREMIUM
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if any one has escaped owning a W10 has updated error free / bug free.</p>
<p>it is being a forum member that we saw errors being reported, and those whose Windows phone that qualified for the update from having a working W8 phone develop similar faults, the solution reverting back to W8 using WDRT</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 updates fix something or not but also introduces some other fault. The posts in this forum is full of owners many with multiple problem's, even those &nbsp;upgrading to W10 and staying upgraded problems losing functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the phone comparison above you can see that new a Lumia is €280 versus a Pixel €770, Ok now affordable, Microsoft in stopping production have no confidence in W10 ever being fully fixed hence the price drop. Its continual silence on the matter only deepens
 the frustration felt in the customers and those selling what stock remains cannot endorse it</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My point is this in order to manufacture phones again, the starting point has to be Windows 8 it's base not &nbsp;Windows &nbsp;10 (if it W10 &nbsp;were its base it would have been fixed already 18 months already) &nbsp;there is IMO no W10 platform, or any platform
 that has an iota of Windows 10 code included</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>During this 18 month period, mine and other W8 phones have performed without incident. Microsoft upgraded W8 phones 6 times, if I had a W10 phone displaying the errors I have seen, no hesitation "downgrade to an actively UPGRADEABLE W8"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is another reason why Microsoft stopped selling Lumia phones other than Windows 10 it is yet to make that announcement.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Microsoft needs to update something that works than trying to fix the irreparable flawed. This is a software issue, clearly not a hardware issue, the ultimate fix is to pull the software</strong></p>

<p>MKdiana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You hit the nail on the head!! I have never been a fan of "apps" (should be called applets) a specialized software program to do a very specialized task I can already do with a browser. Why do I need an app to refill a medical prescription from my phone?
 If I can't wait until I get to a computer, I can log in to my Walgreens account with my phone browser. Most companies have a mobile version of their website. The app world reminds me of the early internet before there were browsers like Netscape or Explorer.
 If you wanted to access a bank or investment company account or a news site you had to download their software, install it and it only worked for that company. Then there was the miracle of the world wide web and browsers and we only needed one software to
 access everyone's internet site!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apps are fine for gadgets/tools like an alarm, a level, a calculator, a word processor etc. but overrated for tasks already available on websites. It's similar with social media. Why do I want to go to Facebook to search for and find a page about Hewlett
 Packard when I can just go to their website directly? Microsoft doesn't seem to be hearing us though.</p>

            Has Microsoft ever cared about customer service?&nbsp; I've been with MS since the mid '80's kik and&nbsp; since forever.&nbsp; HP always cared about their customers especially elite and corporate lines.&nbsp; HP support is unrivalled.&nbsp; HP is dumping Windows phone OS.&nbsp; Microsoft
 Corp culture has always had an attitude problem and always will.&nbsp; They live in a bubble and like it that way.&nbsp; Go on Google and look at their on line stuff.&nbsp; Neat, clean fairly easy to use.&nbsp; Microsoft is a mess that only got less messy.&nbsp; The preach easy integration,
 but when have we ever had it.&nbsp; Apps that make my real life easier for banking and credit cards ...FUGEDABOUDIT never going to happen.&nbsp; Microsoft has always been about what is easiest for their code spinners and luring customers with shinny features for bait
 not what they really need that works and could make their lives easier.&nbsp; Great ideas, but always terrible execution.&nbsp; Wish they would sell all their

            I just got my Lumia 650 repaired and I found out about this, it's a shame that Microsoft will just stop Windows phone, the screen on my Lumia broke and unfortunately I had to buy an android phone to be able to communicate because I can't find Windows phones
 at the stores anymore, I actually bought 2 and they sucked, I bought a new screen and repaired my Lumia 650, and I'll be using it until it dies since apparently we won't be able to find them anymore and maybe eventually&nbsp; support for them will completely stop,
 I've been using Windows since 2012 and I loved them, come on Microsoft don't force us to migrate to crappy android or iPhone.

<h2>            Transpose Data Array in batches in Excel.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have a question about how to batch Transpose data in Excel.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I work in at an archival institution and have over 75,000 digitized catalog cards.<span>&nbsp;
</span>They are in a PDF format and have&nbsp;been OCR’d.<span>&nbsp; </span>I am able to make a compound PDF (about 750 cards/pages each) and export the data into a text file and then import it into an excel sheet. The data then fills column A with no spaces.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have used the Transpose functions to separate the data into columns in my test case.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Because there is so much data, I am wondering if anyone knows how to Transpose data in batch file.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Does a macro for this exist?<span>&nbsp; </span>The cards have three to five lines of data (the majority have 4 lines):</p>
<p>1 line = Subject Heading (Person -usually last name, first name, place or thing)</p>
<p>2 line= RG# -Collection Name .image number</p>
<p>3 line = image caption
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>4 line = image caption cont’d (not always applicable)</p>
<p>5 line = image caption cont’d (not always applicable)</p>
<p>This is what the information looks like in Excel:</p>
<p>Ex.
</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span>Harding, Warren G.
</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span>RG100S-Paul J. Hoover Coll.<span>&nbsp;
</span>.3-4 </span></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span>President Harding visits the 60th anniversary of the
</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span>Battle of Gettysburg in July, 1923.</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last 3-5 caption lines, I figured I could use the CONCATENATE function and run them all together at the end.</p>
<p>Two other questions: 1. Would it be better to organize the cards&nbsp;by the number of lines in the caption?&nbsp; 2. Is it possible to separate the information in line 2
 into three columns (RG#, Collection Name, Image number)?</p>
<p>Any information that anyone could have would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Molly</p>

            You can use OpenTextFile, read the file directly, create an array and split the lines with VBA and transform that into the appropriate format in a 2D array, which you can store into a sheet.<br />
<br />
That's the way that I would go, I've shown this in this forum several times, search for OpenTextFile in this forum. I can't give an example, because you didn't say how we can determine where one card ends and the next card begins.<br />
<br />
If you are not familiar with VBA, upload a sample text file with a few hundred cards to an online file hoster like www.dropbox.com and post the download link here.<br />

    <title>N95 Active standby font size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> igneous---01  say:</h3>
<h2>            N95 Active standby font size</h2>
                    Hi there<br />
<br />
Is it possible to change the font size of the active standby screen/applications on the N95? Specifically the text of the calendar entries and tasks.<br />
<br />
I've also got a N73 and the text on it on the active standby screen is smaller and fits more characters per line than the N95.<br />
<br />
I've changed the font size under Settings&gt;General&gt;Personalisation&gt;Display&gt;Font size to small but this didn't change this text.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks

<br />
Thanks for this. Hadn't seen this. Was hoping there was a way within phone's own settings, but if not then this looks good.

<h2>            Contact Notes Got Deleted from Outlook 2016</h2>
                    Help! After setting up my desktop Outlook to sync to Outlook.com, all my notes associated with my contacts recently disappeared. They were in both locations (desktop and Outlook.com) when I first set up Outlook, and remained there for some time after many
 syncs. But, now they're gone. What happened????

<p>1. I used my Outlook.com account to set it up when I first installed Office Professional Plus 2016.</p>
<p>2. My Outlook.com email address shows up as Exchange, and I have two IMAP Gmail accounts set up.</p>
<p>3. I exported my contacts and calendar items as a .csv file back on August 13th. So, I could restore the notes by re-importing those records. But, I hate to do that, in case I changed any data between then and now. And, there's no import option to merge
 contacts. Only to duplicate them or replace them during the import process.</p>

            I imported the last known file that included contact notes, and the notes showed up in Outlook 2016, and synced to Outlook.com, where they showed up as well. This lasted only two days. This morning I woke up to find all my notes within my contacts files
 in Outlook 2016 and Outlook.com have been stripped out, again. This is VERY frustrating, as I'm losing valuable information. Please help.

<h2>            my pc does not recognize my device htc S621</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I bought an htc S621 device, but when I sincronyzed it with my pc, my device alerted me I was without enough memory -I had to erase some files-. But I could not erase the files because when I unplugged my device in order to erase
 them and put on again te device, this did not function. I only get an Windows Mobile on the screen. Also, the ActiveSync 4.5 does not detect a USB connection to my device. I removed the battery and I put it again, but it does not function, anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Sounds like you may have to perform a hard reset to bring it back to life.&nbsp; Some folks have reported that they need to try this procedure several times before it takes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. PRESS AND HOLD BOTH SOFT KEYS.<br />
2. WHILE HOLDING DOWN SOFT KEYS, PRESS AND RELEASE THE POWER BUTTON, WAIT 3-5 SEC. (PHONE SHOULD POWER ITSELF ON BY DOING THIS)<br />
3. RELEASE THE TWO KEYS SOFT KEYS.<br />
4. WHEN SCREEN ON DEVICE LOOKS LIKE IT'S IN DOS FORMAT, PRESS SEND (GREEN ANSWER KEY)

<h2>            Lost MS Office Key Card</h2>
                    <p>I purchased MS Home &amp; Student from Best Buy, but unfortunately misplaced the activation key card. &nbsp;I have the receipt with the card's serial number on it and would love to get a replacement. &nbsp;MS online support lists it could help if I have proof of purchase,
 which I do, but then was told they'd do nothing for me since I bought it from a third party.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried going to Best Buy to get the old serial number deactivated and a new one re-issued, but they wouldn't help me either saying they send the serial numbers to Microsoft who can deactivate a card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any suggestions on how to possibly resolve this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have consulted with our related team about your issue today and this cannot be done on our side: If the product was bought from Microsoft store then we would have record of the transaction and we
 would be able to help you retrieve the keys. But since they were bought from third party reseller, I am afraid we would not be able to help you with this as we do not have record of the transaction from our data base and the third party reseller has a separate
 transaction records and they should be the one assisting you about this because they are the ones who sold you the product. And if the key was redeemed to a Microsoft account we can still help you retrieve the account the key associated to, but since it has
 not been redeemed yet we can do nothing on our side. So what we suggest is contacting the reseller again to check whether they can retrieve it from their database.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leo</p>

<h2>            MS Office Picture Manager 2010 won&#39;t open when clicking on pictures in explorer </h2>
                    
<p>Everytime I try to open a picture (mainly jpeg) with MS Office Picture Manager, nothing happens except for the occasional error sound (with no error message). when i right click on a picture to change the "open with" to MS Office Picture Manager, i have
 to search the program and it comes up as the program in the start menu. After selecting this, in the Open With box, Microsoft Office Client Visualisation Handler comes up, yet I still can not open picture files. How would I solve this issue?</p>
<p>Thank you, Keval</p>

<h2>            Unable to open OneNote 2016, because it asks for only Office-365 login.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 7 on my laptop and this is my official laptop. I have office 2013 installed. I also had Skype for business 2016 installed on my office laptop. When I tried to install OneNote 2016, it came up with a message box asking me to uninstall "Skype
 for business 2016". I uninstalled Skype and continued with OneNote 2016 installation. The installation was successful. However, when I now click on OneNote 2016, I am asked to sign into "cloud". When I click on the "Sign-in" button, I am getting a dialog box
 to sign into Office-365 account. In this dialog box if I enter my hotmail account it is not accepting. &nbsp;If I close this box, &nbsp;OneNote is quit. &nbsp;Please help.</p>

            <p>Hi Sagnik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The Office 2013 is already installed on my new company laptop. Which means, this is not my personal copy. &nbsp; I installed the free version of OneNote 2016 (Which Is part of Office 2016).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Currently, I do not have subscription of Office 365</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I do not have any other Microsoft account, other than my personal Hotmail account. The office 365 does not allow me to enter Hotmail account. Other than my Hotmail account, &nbsp;I have only tried my company email address. When I give my company email address,
 it proceeds with some processing and comes out with a dialog box with the message "It looks like you don't have Office 365 SharePoint. Do you want to add a different service". I press the OK button and nothing happens!.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply, I want to open OneNote and choose whether to work with a local notebook or Office 365 or OneDrive. I do not know why would Microsoft stop anyone from using OneNote without logging into cloud. I could be in a remote village with no internet connection.
 Does it mean I would not be able to use OneNote. This sounds very scary to me.</p>
<p>

            <p>This is exactly the same problem that I am having--on Windows 7 work computer that already has Microsoft Office, and OneNote 2010 installed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Microsoft OneDrive account that I use to keep my OneNote apps on my Mac, iPad and iPhone all synced with my work computer OneNote program. &nbsp;When I downloaded the new OneNote app onto my work computer today, it first asks me to sign into the Cloud,
 &nbsp;and that is when I also get the dialog box to sign into Office 365. &nbsp;It won't accept my OneDrive sign-in info, and since I don't have an Office 365 account, that is where it all comes to a grinding halt.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same frustrating problem on my business laptop (with OFFICE 2010 professional installed by my company and the free ONENOTE 2016 installed by me afterwards) but I found a workaround :</p>
<p>1. on the same computer, open some notebook from the online ONENOTE version,</p>
<p>2. then choose the option "modify in ONENOTE" in the toolbar (a dialog opens to confirm that we authorize the website to execute an application),</p>
<p>3. then ONENOTE 2016 opens smoothly !</p>
<p>4. then I was able to use it as usual, for example to open and edit my others notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it will help others people with the same issue...</p>

<h2>            Laptop not recognizing earphones as plugged in.</h2>
                    <p>I have recently switched to windows 10 from 8. My earphones were working perfectly &nbsp;even after the upgrade. But recently my laptop hp pavilion g6 is not recognizing earphones as plugged in. My earphones are working just fine as i have used it with my iPhone.
 I have tried opening playback option but shows no earphone devices. When i tried playing music sound is coming from the speakers even when the earphones are plugged in.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Formulas not working in Excel for Mac</h2>
                    When I type in a formula into a cell in Excel and use the formula builder to select and complete, the results that shows in the builder is correct, but when I hit enter to accept it, the text of the formula shows in the cell, not the result.

            The cell that contains the formula is probably set to Text. Change to type general then recommit the formula.

            That usually happens when Excel thinks that the cell is text. Is the cell formatted as text? Make sure it is formatted as General. You may need to copy the formula and paste into another cell that is already formatted as General.

    <title>Do I have to now pay to use my account&#63; I have been a hotmail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kristen davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do I have to now pay to use my account&#63; I have been a hotmail member for over 10 years.</h2>
                    I was just notified by gmail to change my email address cause I have had a hotmail account forever and that is my backup email. But now Microsoft is literally not even letting me get to my email. I don't want an account for xbox. I don't own anything to
 do with Windows products other than the operating system on my laptop and tower.
<br />
<br />
Can I use my email address here with out having to give my credit card info? Or are you now charging for your service?

Hotmail (now outlook.com) is free.&nbsp; There are some features that cost (for example extra skydrive storage space) but the basic mail application if free.<br />
