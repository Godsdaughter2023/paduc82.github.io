<h2>            options running XP on newer PCs&#63;</h2>
                    My 2005 Dell desktop running XP is having issues, and I'm thinking about a newer PC but want to run XP. I dont have the install discs (it's stored on the PC), so I would have to get those - XP PRO seems to be required if you want to run Windows Virtual
 PC on Win7/8... unless other brands of&nbsp; Virtual programs will run earlier XP versions?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
So I'm wondering what's the best way to run XP on newer PCs that typically have Win7 or 8 pre-installed. I'd prefer not wipe out the original OS, even though they take up space. I would imagine it would work best on a separate partition...? I dont want to get
 into a 2nd HDD.<br />
I've read that there wont be XP drivers for newer PCs, so compatibility sounds like an issue.<br />
Here's my questions and exploration of the options. Brief answers (yes, no, wrong, etc) would be helpful since I won't understand too detailed explanations.<br />
<br />
Does XP work better in 1) XP Mode, 2) as a Virtual PC, or 3) on separate partition?<br />
<br />
The advantage of the first is you dont need XP install discs, and it seems to be easily accessible. Disadvantage is you dont get the XP appearance, and it's only available on Win7 Pro and up.<br />
<br />
The advantage of Windows Virtual PC is you can load XP (Pro only) on Win7 Home and up (unlike XP Mode that requires Win7 Pro), BUT you need the XP Pro install discs.
<br />
Can you use another brand Virtual PC on Win7 or 8 and use any XP version instead of XP Pro?
<br />
<br />
Advantage of separate partitions is you are actually running XP and getting XP window, rather than Virtual version. Can you load ANY XP version? Is this faster than using XP in Virtual PC?
<br />
Disadvantage is you have to install programs twice if you want both OS to use it.
<br />
Major disadvantage is it seems XP cannot be installed on pre-loaded Win7 or Win8.<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/install-more-than-one-operating-system-multiboot<br />
<br />
I noticed that Win7, and programs in general, work really fast on my 2011 PC (6 RAM, Intel i5). Is that because of the hardware or OS, or both? Would XP work almost as fast?

            <p>I have another XP related question. I see alot of XP PRO discs for sale (Amazon, Ebay) usually labeled DELL and "Reinstallation Disc." I've asked some sellers, and they say it's the entire OS, not a repair disc or upgrade. Is this true? And does it need
 SPC 3 - or any service pack - or can I download those from Microsoft (and maybe backup onto a disc for the future)?</p>

            XP most likely will not work on your new computer, because it's not likely the manufacturer will have the drivers for you to downgrade. Check with them.<br />

Hi spiritgumm, <br />
<br />
If you have a Dell machine, you only have an OEM license. This means the Windows XP operating system can only be used with that machine.
<br />
<br />
To install Windows XP on another machine, you need to purchase another license together with the installation media and it would have to be a retail version.
<br />
<br />

            I'd just get Windows 7 Professional and use XP mode - less hassle, and the license is included with Win7 Pro, so there's no licensing issues. You might have to download the files for XP mode from Microsoft.com, but you can be sure it's valid and legal
 that way. You'd be better off upgrading to 7 Pro than tracking down a copy of XP and hoping it's legal IMO.<br />
<br />
Whether XP mode will work for you depends on what you plan to do in it. Regular office programs will work fine. At my last job it was used to run digital X-ray viewing software until we could afford to upgrade the program, and it served pretty well for that
 task. It's not very well suited for games, and might not be a good idea for graphic-intensive programs. But you're liable to encounter similar limits with any virtualization method.<br />
<br />
Having used XP mode, I can give a little insight. You can run a full virtual copy of XP, and make it full screen. As long as you're running that virtual machine, there won't be too much difference from running XP natively. You
<u>can </u>run applications seamlessly on the 7 desktop, but that's not the only option available.<br />
<br />
If you have a fast computer with a decent amount of RAM, your VM will run very well. Not quite as fast as a native install, but pretty close. The one exception is starting an XP mode program up on the 7 desktop - that's slow, because you're booting the XP virtual
 machine as well as starting the program. When you close the program, the VM is hibernated, so you wouldn't have to wait when you reopen it until you reboot your computer. But since you want to simulate XP itself, that shouldn't be a problem.<br />

            thanks for all the advice! <br />
I actually have Win7 with a Pro key upgrade, but never tried XP mode because I thought it would only run applications in the Win7 environment; I thought I would be getting a full XP experience, which is why I'm considering it as sole OS or dual boot.
<br />
<br />
David, is this two unrelated statements, or do you mean running a full XP in XP mode?
<br />
<br />
Considering the alternatives, seems like it would be prudent to get XP discs (full retail version) that I can take with me rather than be tied to Win7's XP Mode. But even full retail versions have a limited number of allowed activations, I was told by someone
 at Microsoft.<br />

You can run full XP in XP mode - the whole XP desktop, Start menu, IE, everything. With the limitations I stated above. If you already have the Pro key upgrade, I'd say give it a shot. You can always try another method with a retail copy of XP later on if it
 doesn't do the trick. But why spend the extra money if you can do what you need to with XP mode?<br />
<br />
On the other hand, You're right about XP mode being locked to Win 7. I've seen (and tried) ways to get it working in Windows 8, but had no luck. I'm running XP in a virtual machine in Virtualdub for older games and stuff (my important software works fine on
 Win 8). Going with a full retail copy of XP and something like Virtualbox might actually be the best way to "futureproof".
<br />
<br />
Virtualbox is available for most operating systems - you could have XP running in a virtual machine in Windows 7 or 8, or on a Mac, or on a Linux machine. You will have the limited number of installs to deal with, but you might be able to move the file for
 the virtual machine - the same install, just moved to another host system. I admit I've never tried it, but it seems reasonable that the virtual machine, being just a big file, could be moved. But for all I know, it might violate the license - I'd read up
 before trying it.<br />
<br />
I would not recommend making XP the sole OS on a modern machine, or even dual booting. There aren't going to be XP drivers for current equipment, so you'll be very limited in what you could do - low screen resolution due to no video drivers, possibly no sound,
 those sort of issues. You simply wouldn't get the most out of either the computer or XP.<br />
<br />
Going virtual will avoid those problems, since the virtualization software disguises your equipment as equivalents XP will recognize. You can even back up the virtual machine for easy restore if you have a problem, since it's just a file on your hard drive.<br />
<br />
And keep in mind, you'll have to keep both the host and client Operating Systems maintained - extra work. And support for XP ends in April.<br />
<br />
Hopefully I've given you some points to&nbsp; consider. And I hope others more experienced with virtual machines chip in too. I'm still a bit of a novice about it.<br />

            you've confirmed some of the points in my original post. I suppose I should try XP mode just to see how well XP runs in virtual. Better to find out now if I like virtual running. I'm hesitant since I'm leaning toward doing the "real" virtual PC, and I
 dont want to deal with installing virtual programs over and over again. <br />
<br />
Another reason to get rid of W7 Pro is to resell the key - maybe I can break even since I'll probably buy a used XP Home Full install version.
<br />
<br />
I got my Win7Home reinstallation disc today. I've been told that doing a custom install, or uninstall Pro/install Home, erases only the installed applications, not data memory - I got the impression that everything was erased. Everyone recommends backing up

            Well, I was trying to present a balanced view. You've got a few options for running XP, and there are advantages and drawbacks to all of them.
<br />
<br />
I would do a backup no matter what install method you use - there's a chance of losing your information with any method. And keeping a current backup is a good idea anyway. If you don't want to buy an external hard rive, have you considered online backup?<br />
<br />
Of course, I have two drives in my main computer - one for the OS and programs, and one for data. If it's on a seperate drive entirely there's less chance of your data being lost in an upgrade. Mind you I still back up on a weekly basis, the seperation just
 adds another layer of protection. I can wipe, repartition, reformat, reinstall on my system drive and my data should be unharmed, because it's on another physical hard drive. I use 2 partitions in my laptop to provide some of the same advantages, but it's
 a little less safe because the partitions are on the same hard drive. <br />

            someone suggested 2 hdd for 2 OS, but I hadnt considered separate drives for OS and data. Sounds like a good idea. Does having them separated change the processing speed? Do you need to change your power supply and/or hardware or software? Is it expensive?<br />

<div>Hi lincwack,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What is the make and model number of your laptop?</div>
<div>2. When did the issue occur?</div>
<div>3. Do you remember any changes to your computer prior to the issue occurring?</div>
<div>4. Does the issue occur on all the applications or a particular application?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In the meantime, follow these steps and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'd suggest you get into the laptop manufacturer's website, download and install the latest touchpad drivers for your laptop.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly <br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>

</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Update-drivers-recommended-links</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Boot your machine in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a> and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 3:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue does not occur in safe mode, I suspect it could be the handiwork of a third party software conflict causing the issue to occur. I'd suggest you put your computer in a&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a> state to
 eliminate third party software conflict.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Follow step 7 to restart your computer as usual.</div>

<p>
</p><p>I am still having the problem with certain websites and it is proving to be quite frustrating, as I sometimes have to do research for my work. Has anyone found a solution to this problem as yet? Or should I just go back to Windows 8.1?</p>

            <p>I have resolved the problem on my own. It became frustrating not hearing from anyone and I decided to investigate, despite my lack of&nbsp;knowledge of this new product.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>first off, I knew it was&nbsp;a font problem as I was able to copy the 'text' from the offending sites and past them into Microsoft Word&nbsp;as 'text only' which allowed Word to keep the existing font and format that it was set at, this revealed what the text was
 in a format I could read. You will imagine what an annoyance it was having to do this over and over just to read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After visiting a sight with the issue I decided to zoom in and look at the 'text' and discovered it was a series of over lapping numbers, or to be more accurate fractions, at this point I looked went into an app that I know would allow me to do a font preview
 and I searched until I found a font that was similar and though it was similar it wasn't exact, at this point I knew I was on to something so copied the text and pasted into Word and realized the numbers were an exact match. Hurray, now all I had to do was
 figure out what the actual font was. Eventually I found the font Helvetica Fractions (didn't even know I had it but I got it when I purchased the Helvetica Font family). I made the decision to go into Windows' font folder and delete the font and restart my
 browsers. IT WORKED! Woo Hoo!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note I know somewhere in Windows there has to be a default setting that would have fixed the problem without having to delete a font I paid for but I tried to locate the setting with no luck, as I mentioned earlier I have no real knowledge of this
 new product, but I knew it was the OS and not the browser because the exact font was being used across all the browsers on my machine. I just find it strange that it didn't happen with Windows 8.1 or any other previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For future reference It would be nice if someone could tell me where I can find that font setting. I'd like to reinstall my font in case I have use for it in future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brian&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skittles avatar prop</h2>
                    
<p>Hi to anyone reading this. I missed the promotion for the skittles avatar prop and I from time to time refresh my dash in hopes of it popping up but it never does. I also missed out on a couple other props for not looking at the advertisements I wont make
 that mistake again. Abraham vampire, Looper, and wow, just to name a few. Sucks but I'm ok with it what I really want is the skittles one.&nbsp; I was hoping that if anyone in here know of a trick or anything to help me get this prop it would be greatly appreciated
 I'm a HUGH skittles fan and would love to add that to my avatar props.</p>

                    I did a windows repair install after a recent&nbsp;reboot and not being able to load windows xp pro service pack 3&nbsp;but I&nbsp;can't see anything on my desktop even when I right click&nbsp;on&nbsp;it&nbsp;or use ctrl-alt-delete&nbsp;to bring up&nbsp;the task manager? I found out later that
 the real reason for not being able to load windows was a faulty graphics card so I replaced it with a new one but I now Im asked to re-activate my windows xp pro&nbsp;after I log into my account but I can't. When I log in I don't see any activation screen, etc.
 only my&nbsp;current&nbsp;wallpaper. If anyone knows how to fix this without re-formatting the drive&nbsp;or a clean install of windows let me know. Thanks.

            Reseting the Activation Trial:<br />
------------------------------<br />
In this example: Your activation period has expired, (past 30 days) and you need to get to Normal mode again.<br />
<br />
1. Turn On your PC<br />
<br />
2. Press F8 repeatedly and go to Safe Mode<br />
<br />
3. Logon as per normal <br />
(note: Administrator password is usually blank, but hopefully you know your password)<br />
<br />
4. Allow the Desktop to fully load (answering "Yes" to continue into Safe Mode)<br />
(note: This is just a long way of saying go to Safe Mode)<br />
<br />
5. Click on Start - Run<br />
<br />
6. Type in exactly: rundll32.exe syssetup,SetupOobeBnk (and click OK)<br />
(note: one space, after "rundll32.exe " also the Oo are two letter o's in "oobe"; capitals and comma are important)<br />
<br />
7. Wait a couple of seconds (although you will Not see any change)<br />
<br />
8. Restart your PC normally (Start - Shutdown - Restart - Ok)<br />
<br />
9. You are now able to go to Normal Mode again (For another 30 days !!!)<br />
<br />
10. Do whatever you like, you're back to Normal.<br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>Technical Difficulty With Touchpad &#38; Keyboard Drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zoh7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Technical Difficulty With Touchpad &#38; Keyboard Drivers</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>After upgrading my Acer V7 from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, my touchpad's (Synaptic PS/2) features, like the two finger touch scroll, didn't work. I really liked the feature so I tried to fix that. I tried updating the driver from Device Manager but
 that didn't work. I went on Acer's website and downloaded the touchpad's driver. I noticed a new driver along side with Synaptic called Elen and went ahead downloaded that too. After giving me a notification to restart my laptop to apply the settings and following
 the instructions, my laptop gave me BSOD. After a couple of restarts it finally booted up and I quickly uninstalled both the downloaded drivers from Device Manager and restarted as I assumed those were corrupted files. I downloaded Synaptics driver again (with
 another restart) but it just showed me code 10</span><span> on the driver (doesn't have sufficient resources?) while the keyboard driver shows me code 19. I tried uninstalling both the drivers but I get them back</span><span>. Right now both my touchpad and
 my keyboard isn't working and I'm using my external USB mouse alongside with my touchscreen keyboard</span></p>
<p>

Some devices use different microphones for speakerphone mode and handset mode. Try switching to the other mode.

Echo issues are common on Android devices, especially when in speakerphone mode. Echo usually sounds like noise ‘bursts’ rather than recognizable speech. If your friend is experiencing echo, lowering the playback volume on your device should help. Alternatively,
 use headphones or a headset.</span></li></ol>

    <title>Dual booting with XP, bootmgr file missing from primary partition, how - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robocell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual booting with XP, bootmgr file missing from primary partition, how to make Win7 primary</h2>
                    I have been running Win7 and XP in dual boot because I had some software that only worked on XP. &nbsp;I don't need XP any more and I want to get rid of XP and use the whole drive for Win7. &nbsp;I followed these instructions for moving boot files from the primary
 XP partition to the Win7 partition, but I got stuck when I couldn't find the boot files. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/windows-and-office/migrate-to-windows-7-from-an-xp-dual-boot-configuration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/windows-and-office/migrate-to-windows-7-from-an-xp-dual-boot-configuration/</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The tutorial here says there should be to files on the partition's root, a directory called "Boot" and a file called "bootmgr". &nbsp;The only thing I have that even resembles these are a file called "boot" and a file called "boot.bak". &nbsp;No folders at all.
 &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My initial thought was to just do a backup, and wipe the drives, then restore the backup. &nbsp;But if I do that, I won't have any bootmgr at all, and then I will be in a mess. &nbsp;So, is there another way to make the logical partition into my primary without
 buying software? &nbsp;And is there any explanation of why I don't have the files I am supposed to have? &nbsp;I am coming from Mac, so this is all very new to me. &nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hello,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for providing the screen shot.</p>
<p>When you do a regular installation you have the option to delete the partition in the Drive Options in the partition table.<br />
</p>
<p>For this, all you need to do is to select Custom (Advanced) installation while doing the regular installation and then you have to select the win xp partition, click the Drive options and select Delete. You can allocate the free space thereafter to make
 a different drive partition or even from the Disk Management after the completion of installation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope this information is helpful.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Old ACDSee 5 Power Pack and Windows7 compatibility problems</h2>
                    <p>I am a dentist.&nbsp; Since 2003 I have used a photo-management and photo-editor called ACDSee 5 Power Pack with XP computers.&nbsp; Work wonderfully. Simple, easy changes are made to clinical photos.&nbsp; Lately, added computer with Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ACDsee program&nbsp; crashes
 on start-up.&nbsp; It functioned the first 6 or 7 times, and now it refuses to open.&nbsp; Here is the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>Problem signature:</div>
<div>&nbsp; Problem Event Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; APPCRASH</div>
<div>&nbsp; Application Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACDSee5.exe</div>
<div>&nbsp; Application Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5.0.0.25</div>

<div>&nbsp; Locale ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4105</div>
<div>&nbsp; Additional Information 1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0a9e</div>
<div>&nbsp; Additional Information 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0a9e372d3b4ad19135b953a78882e789</div>

<div>&nbsp; Additional Information 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0a9e372d3b4ad19135b953a78882e789</div>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have contacted ACDSeeSystems.&nbsp; I have been told there is compatibility problem with W7.&nbsp; Instructed to get their new program.&nbsp; I did.&nbsp; It does not do very important function that the old one does that I absolute require.&nbsp; I have further asked ACDSeeSystems
 to fix the problem, for which I would gladly pay a reasonable programming fee to be negotiated.&nbsp; No takers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I have money, but I do not have time to spend trying to work around all these changes.&nbsp; I just want to keep doing the same thing, the same way, because it is fast and efficient.&nbsp; Is that not what computers are for?&nbsp; And I did try to run program in the
 XP mode as suggested on other sites and did not work as others have reported who have tried the suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time programs such as XP to W7 are forced on us, it takes huge amounts of time to do what I doing before.</p>
<p>Case in point is Windows Media Player.&nbsp; Verson 11 and under, worked great on XP.&nbsp; Will not work on W7.&nbsp; Fine, load up the new WMP. The new version with W7 has a mind of it's own.&nbsp; Keeps downloading unwanted albumart, even when the property functions are
 sent to NOT GET&nbsp; ALBUMART.&nbsp; Had to switch to MusicBee.&nbsp; Took weeks to figure that out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone out there in Microsoft Land that can advise on what to do.</p>
<p>If so, how do we connect, given the advise at the top of this page suggests not revealing email address.</p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try these steps and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>If you have not tried installing the program in compatibility mode try it and check if that helps.</p>
<p>Make older programs run in this version of Windows</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/make-older-programs-run#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/make-older-programs-run#1TC=windows-7</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may put your system in clean boot state and try running the program.</span></p>
<p><span>Clean boot helps troubleshoot error messages and other issues. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. This article
 describes how to troubleshoot problems in Windows.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 3 from the above KB article.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h3> cushdy78  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 start button context menu</h2>
                    <p>Does anyone know of a way of disabling the context menu on the Windows 10 start button? I am trying to use Win10 as a kiosk and need to disable/hide this menu. I've managed to lock down many of the items on the menu with gpedit, but I cannot seem to disable
 things like search, event viewer etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!!</p>

            <p>Thanks for your swift reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this method didn't make any difference to the issue. I still get the menu pop up when I right-click over the start button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few items within this menu which I want a standard user to not be able to access. These are: Event Viewer, Search, Computer Management, Disk Management and File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can disable these then it wouldn't really matter that the menu popped up!!</p>

            You can "disable" the start button context menu by deleting its items.<br />
<br />
Go to "C:\Users\&lt;your username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WinX"<br />
You'll find some Folders like "Group1", "Group2", ...<br />
Move them to another location or delete them<br />
After restarting at least explorer.exe, the start-button context menu doesn't show anymore

            <p>hi Eyal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i had the same problem except when i downloaded the drivers and went to install i didn't get that it determined the latest version is already installed. I'm Not sure how you tried installing the download you got but what I did to install it was go to Device
 manager open the Broadcom card properties . Click Drivers Tab, click update driver, Then it game me 2 options search automatically for updates or option 2 was to search my computer for driver software. &nbsp;i did option 2 found where i saved my download and installed
 it that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>since then i have had no problems.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You can use the User Account dialog or run&nbsp;netplwiz to&nbsp;remove it but please consider the advice below.</p>
<p>I recently changed from logging on as the Admin after I'd seen the advice in this forum about malware vulnerabilities. I now just log on to a User Account &amp; have a strong password on the Admin account [so hindering anyone trying to install anything remotely].</p>
<p>I was amazed by how easy it was to do the changeover:-</p>
<p>1 I created two additional admin accounts [both with strong passwords].</p>
<p>2 I changed my original [admin] account into a user account - I entered netplwiz in Start menu &amp; followed that through.</p>
<p>3 I set up a password reset disk for each of the accounts [instructions in Help system &amp; in the Control panel, User accounts dialogs].</p>
<p>4 I set my user account to be the default [with password bypassed and therefore as convenient as my previous setup].</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode with network network function to repair Windows..
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.       
        </p>

            Hi Lisa, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />In cases where a PC reset fails, the next step is to try a clean install of Windows.
<br />
<br />You'll need to have a blank USB drive handy at least 8GB in size, and follow the steps in the below link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/for...</a>
<br />
<br />You can download the Media Creation Tool to make your USB drive a bootable Windows installation drive. Here's the link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/windows-10-create-installation-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot from the USB drive and follow the prompts to clean install Windows 10. This is usually the best way to get around these kinds of issues!
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support. Thanks!

<p>See if you can make some progress with these commands.</p>
<p>If the commands work then you are set.</p>
<p>If the commands fail then you can advanced to more aggressive steps.</p>
<p>Time can be spent on the simpler commands and the benefit is that drivers and applications do not need to be reinstalled.</p>
<p>Alternatively time can be spent on the more aggressive commands, however you will need to backup files, reinstall drivers, and applications, and re-customize Windows settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open administrative command prompt and type or copy and paste:<br />
<br />
1) sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
2) dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
<br />
3) chkdsk /scan<br />
<br />
When these have completed &gt; right click on the top bar or title bar of the administrative command prompt box &gt; left click on edit then select all &gt; right click on the top bar again &gt; left click on edit then copy &gt; paste into the thread<br />
<br />
4) msconfig (in the pop up system configuration &gt; move the dot from normal startup to selective startup &gt; uncheck load startup items &gt; click service tab &gt; in left lower corner check hide all Microsoft services &gt; in the lower right side click disable all &gt; click
 apply or ok &gt; do not reboot)<br />
<br />
5) taskmgr (in the pop up task manager &gt; click on the start up tab &gt; click on status so that the column sorts with enable rising to the top &gt; right click on each row with enable and change to disable)<br />

<br />
<br />
6) shutdown /r (you will reboot the computer so that it is in clean boot)<br />
<br />
Evaluate the performance on your computer in clean boot during typical use. </p>
<p>Are the boots faster or slower? </p>
<p>Are the shutdowns faster or slower? </p>
<p>How has the video performance changed? Is it better, worse, or the same? </p>
<p>Continue using clean boot indefinitely to monitor performance.<br />

<h2>            Info on the halo 3 limited edition console</h2>
                    <p>I'm sure this topic has been beaten to death but I haven't seen much information in my searches the last few hours. I want&nbsp;to dust off my collection of&nbsp;Xbox and X360 titles that aren't back compat&nbsp;on my Xbox One. From announcement&nbsp;I always wanted a Halo 3 edition console, wasnt lucky enough to get one&nbsp;and now that its 10 years&nbsp;old they are very cheap. My biggest question is exactly how prone to failure&nbsp;are they and are consoles closer to the end of production any more reliable? Since age, price and warranties are rear view,&nbsp;I have also considered&nbsp;getting a RRoD&nbsp;Halo console, a 360 elite and just swapping the shells. I know I can go out and get a 360s for only a few bucks more than the work to get 2 consoles and swap parts &nbsp;and I might end up doing that, I just would really love to have the Halo 3 edition in my collection. Any information anyone could give me would be greatly appreciated thank you very much.</p>

            <p>Since you probably can't find the console new in store, the reliability really depends on how the previous owner treated it. </p>
<p><br /></p><p>I have a Elite Xbox 360 that is older than the Halo 3 special edition console, and it's still being used as a secondary console without issues. I have a 360S as my main Xbox 360 console, as it is quieter than the Elite and has built in WiFi.&nbsp; I also mainly use my Xbox One. </p><p><br /></p>
<p>But the Elite still hasn't failed me yet, despite having been used excessively before I got the S model. Also I take good care of my consoles, put them in clean, well ventilated areas and don't smoke.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br /></p><p>However, if you get a console that has been in a house in wich the users smoked, or used the console in a particularly hot or dusty environment, the console will fail sooner or later. </p>
<p>In your case, I'd get the console as a showpiece, and use a cheaper and newer 360 as gaming console.</p>

 device is my PC before a motherboard swap and clean install of Windows 10 with in the last few days?&nbsp; If I deleted the "my name" device could I then rename the "name/type" device?&nbsp; If so, how do I rename?

            Hi BTAH,
<br />computer is determined by motherboard. After motherboard replacement account sees another PC. So you may just delete previous device.

<h2>            HP Desktop Front USB ports have stopped working</h2>
                    I had a 1TB Toshiba External Drive and an HP Webcam connected via the front ports. The rear ports are all working fine.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The front ports do not seem to be active at all, although the Drive power light comes on when I start up, it then goes out and there is no further response from there.</div>
<div>I have plugged in a couple of other things to see if I get any response, but no results.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a new PC (less than a month) and the ports and devices were all fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am not overly technical so the simple solutions will be much appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.........</div>
                </div>

<div>Still no luck. The ports were working fine I think the issue is software related.</div>
<div>I am going to restore and see if that sorts it.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The next time around, check your USB controllers in Device Manager...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You're machine may have two different ones, which would explain why the front didn't work and the back did...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One controller may be Intel or AMD, depending on your machine, and the 2nd, a 3rd party like ASMedia, for instance...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My machine had an issue with the ASMedia and the Win 8.1 Microsoft drivers....</p>
<p>I reinstalled the ASMedia drivers, and things were working again...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may be able to just RollBack the drivers instead of your entire system, or manually update them by selecting Update... Browse... Pick From a List. The previous driver may still be on the list...</p>

<div>When you installed your new graphics card, you did install the </div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You problem somewhat sounds like the desktop is not being </div>

<p>Thank you for sharing on how you were able to resolve your issue. That feature heavily relies on your graphics display card. I recommend that you check with the manufacturer's website of your graphics device and check if there are any available driver update.
 Follow the steps provided in this forum article on <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware-winpc/how-to-install-and-update-hardware-drivers-in/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">

<p>If you already installed the most updated driver version for your graphics card and the issue persists, I recommend that you follow the steps provided in this support article to roll back the driver for your graphics card, then run and install the troubleshooter

<span>The corrupted user profile does not function normally such as not launching Start menu, Cortana, Search bar, Store and other Windows applications. In such cases creating a new profile and checking for the same will help in identifying if the

<p>You can adjust the visual effects in Windows 10 to gain performance boost by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>In the search box on the taskbar, type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>performance</strong>, then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Adjust the appearance and performance of Windows</strong>.</span></li><li><span>On the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Visual Effects</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>tab, select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Adjust for best performance</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Apply</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Restart your PC and see if that speeds up your PC.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I recommend that you perform an In-place upgrade. <span>By performing an in-place upgrade, you will clean up the system which may help resolve some troubles with the system.</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>We have put up a detailed video guide on
 Youtube that you can follow to perform a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BWh0YRmnT8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Trade places with this poster?&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-tms/windows-8-touch-keyboard-gone-small/1e8a1899-3232-4df5-a76c-c8dcfbe98cc6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-tms/windows-8-touch-keyboard-gone-small/1e8a1899-3232-4df5-a76c-c8dcfbe98cc6</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW if you're really&nbsp;using the osk.exe "On&nbsp; Screen Keyboard"&nbsp; you can resize it by dragging on its edges.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I assume you really mean the Touch Keyboard that the other poster is seeing as being too small.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, perhaps you could try the test I was speculating
 about, making a split screen scenario which required a Touch Keyboard--is the Touch Keyboard usable then?</p>
<p><br />
FWIW I would want mine to be large too, even when using&nbsp;a mouse, to have a larger landing area for each&nbsp;key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, are you talking about seeing this in a Desktop scenario or in a Modern UI Fullscreen (MUF) scenario?&nbsp;&nbsp; When I do that with MUF IE on my widescreen monitor the only silly looking keyboard I see is the split-screen one which of course is useless especially
 for a mouse user, but the other ones look reasonable.&nbsp;&nbsp; Having a full width TIP may seem a bit extreme too I suppose but you could just write in it wherever you want to write; you don't have to use the whole thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hmm...&nbsp; I can't do a test for the Desktop scenario.&nbsp;&nbsp; Whenever I try the Touch Keyboard ends up on my Tablet instead of on the monitor where the Start Screen is.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bizarre.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to change my IE window out of Fullscreen mode just to get at the Settings
 charm on that monitor (having temporarily forgotten about Win-I &lt;w&gt;).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
