<h2>            Microsoft Viisual C&#43;&#43; Redistributable Not Installing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently purchased a Surface Pro 4 with Intel Core m3-6Y30 CPU @ 0.90GHz&nbsp; 1.51 GHz and 4Gb of RAM. I'm installing some games on it, and have gotten Skyrim installed with no issues. However, when installing other games I'm told I'm missing MSVCP100.dll
 and MSVCR100.dll. After some research I've determined that I'm having an issue with Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 x64 Redistributable Setup. I receive a fatal error message, and the following Log Files:</p>
<p><strong><span>OS Version = 6.2.9200, Platform 2<br />

</p><p>Any help in getting this installed would be greatly appreciated. Also, just in case it wasn't clear, this was not an upgrade, rather it came with the PC when I bought it. And also I am attempting&nbsp;a Manual install (I uninstalled, rebooted, and it still won't
 take).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for the help!</p>

<h2>            Turned of my laptop during a factory reset.</h2>
                    Hi, so I have an acer 5250 and I upgraded it to windows 8 last year. Yesterday. I accidentally turned it off during the resetting of my pc. Now I can't turn it on. I tried to reset it again, I even have the installation disk but it says its invalid. Now
 I don't have access to my games, browser and Skype. That's why I'm on the iPad rig now. Please help me

<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to get in touch with the computer manufacturer to obtain the installation disc or the product key. If you get the product key, you may create windows 8 installation media as suggested in my earlier post and then proceed with the troubleshooting.</p>

</span>Follow the below method provided. </span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persist, try the below method:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to reset the windows update component manually. Resetting Windows Update Components will fix corrupt Windows Update Components and help you to install the Windows Updates quickly. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong> on the keyboard and then select “<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)”</strong> from the menu.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Stop the <strong>BITS, Cryptographic</strong>, <strong>MSI Installer</strong> and the
<strong>Windows Update Services</strong>. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “<strong>ENTER</strong>” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net stop cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net stop bits</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net stop msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>3. Now rename the <strong>SoftwareDistribution</strong> and <strong>Catroot2</strong> folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “<strong>ENTER</strong>” key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>4. Now, let’s restart the <strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</strong> and the
<strong>Windows Update Services</strong>. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the
<strong>ENTER</strong> key after you type each command.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>net start wuauserv</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net start cryptSvc</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net start bits </span>
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net start msiserver</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>5. Type<strong> Exit</strong> in the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> to close it and then restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Disable anti-</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">virus program while installing Windows updates, if might detect some files as bug and the updates files might get corrupt during installation.</span></p>

    <title>Setting up VPN server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lewis12642  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting up VPN server</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I have created a VPN in the network adapter settings in windows 10 home. I made firewall exceptions and port forwarding for ports 1723, 74, 500 and 1701 to the server.
</p>
<p>When i try to connect from a client running windows 7, it says "Verifying username and password" and then produces
</p>
<p><strong>Error 806: The VPN connection between your computer and</strong><strong> the VPN server could not be completed. The most common cause for this failure is that at least one Internet device (for example, a firewall or a router) between your computer
 and the VPN server is not configured to allow Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) protocol packets. If the problem persists, contact your network administrator or Internet Service Provider.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please could someone help me to set up this VPN. I have made a dynamic dns and am using that to connect. Also, i am using the BT Home Hub 4. It works when i use the local computer name but not when using the Dynamic DNS. I am using Norton 360 on the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate help. Thank you,</p>
<p>Lewis.</p>

            Hi Kristopher, do you mean the installation path for Windows 10 or the default installation path for software being installed on your system?
<br />
<br />If you mean the default installation path for application installation
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to System - Storage
<br />
<br />Click 'Change where new content is saved'
<br />
<br />From there you can divert new content to your D Drive

            Hi Ani
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore or brightness functions missing. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1809 , if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hello AniBoro.
<br />
<br />If you have some performances issue firstly check your system for viruses.
<br />
<br />Check your system files for errors by following this article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/ru-ru/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/ru-ru/help/929833...</a> -system .
<br />
<br />Check whether the error is repeated in the clean boot mode (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/ru-ru/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/ru-ru/kb/929135</a> ) to eliminate the effects of third-party applications.
<br />
<br />Make sure that all updates are installed and the drivers are up to date (from the manufacturer’s website).
<br />
<br />Look at these recommendations: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/ru-ru/help/4002019/windows-10-improve-pc-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/ru-ru/help/400201...</a>

            Hey Zaki J, just said let you know the problem has been resolved and it was not really a problem to start with if I can explain. The game is 8 ball pool where you play for "pool coins" to buy tables, cues etc. &nbsp;and seemingly it became rife with hackers
 who would pop up there error of lost connection to win the games (idiots) so after ll it had nothing to do with the connection at all. Thanks for your help.

            Here's a third option, courtesy of MVP Malke:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>If you have a Windows 7 installation DVD (not a recovery DVD) you can boot the system with it. Select the default language, then choose "Repair your computer". Then select "Command Prompt". At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:yes [press Enter]<br />
<br />
[Note: Do not type the brackets!]<br />
<br />
Remove the installation DVD and reboot the computer. <br />
<br />
If you don't have a Windows 7 installation DVD (only have a recovery disc), the computer mftr. may have given you the Windows 7 System Repair option (not a System Recovery!) on the diagnostic menu. This diagnostic menu is the same one where you can choose Safe
 Mode. Get to this menu by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting up. If you don't have this option you can make a bootable Windows 7 Repair DVD from the file at this link:<br />
<br />
http://neosmart.net/blog/2009/windows-7-system-repair-discs/<br />
<br />
Note: All the Neosmart recovery disc downloads are torrent files. There is a good explanation of torrent files at the Neosmart website. You will need a torrent client such asmuTorrent to get the files. The torrent client will download the .iso file with which
 to create the bootable DVD. If you are creating the bootable DVD in an older operating system (XP, Vista), you will need to use third-party burning software such as Nero, Roxio, or the free ImgBurn (http://www.imgburn.com ) to burn the .iso as an image, not
 as data. Windows 7 can burn .isos natively.<br />
<br />
Once you have fixed things, log into the extra administrative account you will make per the suggestions below and disable the built-in Administrator account again for security purposes:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: cmd<br />
When cmd appears in Results above, right-click it and choose "Run as administrator" [OK]. Now you will get the command prompt. At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:no [enter]<br />
<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
<br />
General Recommendations For Setting Up Users In Windows 7:<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP, Vista and all other modern operating systems, Windows 7 is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, and Guest. These accounts should be left
 alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges in Windows 7 because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult.&nbsp; It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it may be more than you want to do. Better not to put yourself into a bad situation to begin with.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).<br />

<h2>            Skype Number feature is not working</h2>
                    <p>Today, I subscribed to the Skype number feature so that I could have an alternate contact number. I have set it up to go to voicemail if I'm not available to take the call at my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I set it up according to the instructions and when calling the Skype number from my mobile phone, there is no incoming notification at my laptop that anyone is calling me.&nbsp; All the calls go immediately to voicemail after only two rings (even though I have
 the timer set to 20 seconds wait time for answer) and there are no notifications produced when I leave a message in the voicemail box.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed all the instructions in the troubleshooting guide for this feature and it is simply not working for me.</p>

<h2>            After May 2019 update Windows 10 PC hangs at the windows logo when booting up</h2>
                    <p>After the May 2019 update my PC displays&nbsp; the blue Windows 10 flag but does not have the loading circle underneath. It hangs every time I try to boot up from a cold start.. I have to press the reset button on the front of the PC and then it boots up as normal.
 It also starts normally if click restart from Windows.</p>
<p>If I press sleep, when the Pc wakes it just displays a blank screen, no mouse pointer and the keyboard does nothing.</p>
<p>I tried re-installing Windows, but as I was setting it up it automatically re-installed the updates and after 8 hours I'm back were I started</p>

            Hi Alex.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try disabling Fast Startup in Settings &gt; System &gt; Power and Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Change What Power buttons Do.  Then choose Change Settings that are Currently Unavailable, and uncheck the Box for Fast Startup, Save Changes.
<br />
<br />If this was caused by a Version Update then for 10 days you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool which is explained more here:   
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>.
<br />
<br />After 10 days you can reinstall the older version using downloads available from Microsoft TechBench here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />You said you tried reinstalling but be aware that until you roll it back to the old version it will only reinstall the same version if you do the automated Reset.  
<br />
<br />You can do the gold standard Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you use the latest media loaded into the Media Creation Tool it will reinstall v.1903 but in most cases a Clean Install resolves the problems.  Or you can use older version media here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>.
<br />
<br />If you want to try to fix it, then besides disabling Fast startup you can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Okay, thank you for your answer! For my PC, disabling "fast startup" seems to work for now, so I don't need to roll back for now (10 days have already passed since updating, so I'm shying back from that procedure...). However, I also had to disable hibernation

            I've reported the problem using Windows Feeback Hub, maybe other people who also have this issue care to vote for it: https://aka.ms/AA6hor6

<h2>            Random pointer movements and clicks</h2>
                    <p>I'm experiencing an intermittent problem in which my PC acts like it is "possessed", with random mouse movements and clicks. This can result in random apps opening, and is very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running a Surface Pro 4, and the problem started happening after I started using a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, as well as a Surface Dock with an external monitor (all purchased/installed &nbsp;at the same time).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the problem occurs, I notice little "bubbles" popping like crazy along the left and side of the external monitor, and I am unable to get the mouse to move where I want. These "bubbles" are similar to the bubble that appears when you touch the screen
 on the tablet with your finger, however when they appear, the type cover on the tablet itself is "closed", so the touch screen should not be exposed to accidental touch inputs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first though was that I had a virus, however everything checks out clean. My next thought was that I might have a flaky Bluetooth keyboard or mouse, so I returned them and got another of the same model. The problem does not seem to occur as frequently
 with the new mouse/keyboard, although it still does occur. It was happening every couple of hours with the original mouse/keyboard, but has only happened twice with the new one (which I have been using for just over a day).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My configuration is as follows:</p>
<p>-Surface Pro 4 (i5, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD) with Surface Pro 4 Type Cover</p>
<p>-Surface Dock </p>
<p>-Samsung U28E590D monitor connected to Surface Dock via HDMI (using HDMI-mDP adapter)</p>
<p>-Windows 10 up to date (Version 1511, Build 10586.122)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I ran the trouble-shooter from Method 1, the only item identified was "Enable Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Virtual Miniport Adapter for Windows x64". Through some experimentation, I discovered that this will show up in the troubleshooter
 if the VPN is not connected, but will not show if the VPN is connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the drivers are concerned, after searching for drivers they all showed "The best driver for your device is already installed". FWIW, the keyboard is listed in Device Manager as "Designer Bluetooth Keyboard", but the mouse is simply listed as "HID-compliant
 mouse" although it shows as "Designer Bluetooth Mouse" in the Bluetooth section of Devices within Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After following the suggestions, I rebooted my PC. The problem re-appeared immediately, so I restarted again, and once more, the problem re-appeared. I disconnected the Surface Pro from the dock, and switched to using the tablet screen - the problem disappeared.
 I continued for a few minutes to see if the problem would re-occur, but it did not. The Bluetooth mouse and keyboard both appeared to work fine. I then decided to plug back into the surface dock, and upon doing so, have not yet seen any sign of the problem
 (but it's only been about 10-15 minutes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a possibility that the issue is with the Surface Dock? I had originally been thinking it was a Bluetooth and/or mouse/keyboard issue, but it's starting to look more like the Surface Dock may be the culprit.

            <p>FWIW, in case anyone else runs across a similar issue, it appears as if the problem may have been more related to factors other than the Bluetooth mouse and keyboard, possibly the external monitor and/or monitor cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per my previous reply, I had started to suspect that the issue may have been related to my Surface Dock. Based on that, I wanted to&nbsp;do some testing&nbsp;bypassing the dock. When I had my UHD monitor connected through the Surface Dock I was able to get full
 4K resolution, but when connected directly do the SP4, the best I could get was 1920x1080. After some research, I started to suspect that may be caused by the fact that I was using an HDMI cable, so I went out and purchased a miniDisplayPort to DisplayPort
 cable, and used that instead. After a bit of frustration, I was eventually able to get that configured so that I could have the UHD monitor connected directly to the SP4 defined as an extended display, getting full UHD 3840x2160 resolution. I ran for several
 hours with this configuration, with no sign of any problem, so I took the next step of re-introducing the Surface Dock. Although it certainly wasn't as straight-forward as it should be, I was eventually able to get that configured so that I can get the full
 UHD resolution from the monitor. I ran with that for several hours last night without any signs of problems, and there were no signs of any overnight gremlins when I woke up the SP4 from sleep mode this morning. I've been running this morning for well over
 an hour without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the sporadic nature of the original problem, it's probably too early to say for sure that the problem has been resolved, however it certainly looks promising.

            <p>I was starting to think that this issue was indeed resolved, however the issue re-appeared this morning (March 12). I had been running for 5 days without noticing any problems.</p>
<p>I normally leave my devices powered up overnight. I had actually shut down my SP4 on Friday evening, and then powered back up this morning to find the issue at play. I tried re-starting the SP4 but the problem persisted. I then disconnected the Surface Dock,
 and restarted again. There was no sign of the issue without the Surface Dock plugged in, so after a few minutes, I reconnected the Surface Dock. I have now been running in this manner for over an hour, with no sign of the problem.</p>
<p>My current suspicion is that the problem may only occur if the SP4 is powered up with the Surface Dock installed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Hi Neha</p>
<p>Which drivers are you referring to?&nbsp; At this point in time, the problem appears to be related to the Surface Dock, and I'm not aware of any drivers associated with that device.<br />
FWIW, the last time the problem appeared was on March 12. It is now March 16, and I have been running without encountering the issue.&nbsp; The last time that the problem appeared, I had been connected to the Surface Dock when I power cycled the Surface Pro 4. From
 what I can see, the problem only appears if I restart the SP4 while I am connected to the Surface Dock. If I restart the SP4 without being connected to the Surface Dock, it appears that I can then subsequently connect the dock without experiencing the problem.</p>
<p>Also, I have never noticed the problem when I have not been connected to the dock.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Blake</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply Mayank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The document you refer to doesn't really offer any additional insight - it really simply suggests making sure that all updates are installed, and I keep my system up to date all the time. It also mentions some specific issues, but they are not issues related
 to my specific problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As time goes on, I am more and more confident in my belief that the problem is related to restarting the SP4 when connected to the Surface Dock. It is currently March 19, and I have not experienced the problem since March 12, which was the last time that
 I restarted my SP4 with the Surface Dock installed. I had restarted on March 16, but had not been connected to the Surface Dock during that restart - I connected after the restart had been completed.</p>

<p>Hi Mayank</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay in responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally had a chance to run SFC scan, and it identified an issue with "opencl.dll". The instructions in the support article that you referenced indicated that I should be replacing that file with a copy of the file from another instance of the same version
 of Windows that is known to be good. I only have one other Windows 10 PC available, and it does not have that file, so I don't have a copy available to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done some searches online, and found several references to replacing it from the ISO or using DISM, however as per the attached link, it appears that the version from MS itself&nbsp;may be&nbsp;"corrupted".</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/sfc-scannow-report-opencldll-bad/4209b042-1b7b-4fa2-a720-2c0e489d137b</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really like to be able to get this issue resolved, however since the problem only seems to appear if I start the SP4 when connected to the Surface Dock, I don't think it's worth trying to resolve using tools and procedures that I'm not familiar with,&nbsp;especially
 given the&nbsp;fact that there is not a clear consensus of the procedure even resolving the issue in the first place. I'm concerned that I could end up doing more harm in trying to correct this, and am not prepared to take that risk.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, I'm running Windows 10 Pro, Version 1511, OS Build 10586.164. </p>
<p>The errors shown in the SFC scan are:</p>

<p>Already working through this article thanks. No fix yet.&nbsp; Does hardware go bad?&nbsp; Looking like a W10 reset may have to be done.&nbsp; Very odd.&nbsp; Just loses the connection to the router.&nbsp; wifi dongle and tethered phone seem ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: still working on this;&nbsp; after resetting the adapter, release and renew of IP address failed; does adapter hardware go bad?</p>

<p>Hardware failure is one of the possible reasons your WiFi started disconnecting. If the issue persists after running the network troubleshooter and some networking commands, you can try the rest of the steps on the article such as<span> rolling back your
 driver, </span>temporarily turning off any third-party security software, uninstalling and reinstalling your drivers, and more. If none of those steps will work, then you may need to get in touch with your hardware manufacturer to check for possible hardware
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Antivirus software can help you protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn’t disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you’re done. If you’re connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated on the status of the issue. </p>

<br />
<br />To use Tablet Mode your laptop must have a touchscreen, so the movement of your finger can be sensed . . .
<br />
<br />What is the exact Model No. of your laptop - that will be printed on a sticker on the underneath of your laptop . ..

    <title>Briefcase freezes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b. parker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Briefcase freezes</h2>
                    I used Briefcase in XP Pro as a form of quick daily backup tool with&nbsp;an encrypted removable USB drive.&nbsp; It worked well.<br />
<br />
I finally got the Security issues solved to allow the USB drive to work with Users, however Briefcase is not functioning properly.<br />
<br />
In Windows 7, the drive takes FOREVER to load, then when I ask to "Update All" it either gives an error message about insuffient memory ( I have 4Gb on board and at the time of failure, it's less then 30% full), or it freezes up completely and I need Task Manager
 to shut it down.<br />
<br />
I tried deleting the briefcase and creating a new one and that doesn't help.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?

            Hello B. Parker,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
Briefcase is a tool that has been used since Windows 95 and was probably included for backward compatibility. A lot of users have gone to other methods of syncing files and folders. Not sure why Briefcase is slow and hanging in Windows 7. I know it is something
 you are familiar with but you might want&nbsp;to consider another option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I suggest you try SynToy 2.1 that you can download from the Microsoft Website. Click the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=c26efa36-98e0-4ee9-a7c5-98d0592d8c52&amp;DisplayLang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link here to download SyncToy 2.1</a>. It is easily customized and should be able to do what you want with the flash drive and backup your files.<br />
<br />
<div>SyncToy 2.1 is a free application that synchronizes files and folders between locations. Typical uses include sharing files, such as photos, with other computers and creating backup copies of files and folders.
<br />
<br />
I know this didn't help with Briefcase but SyncToy should be able to do the same thing more
<span>efficiently</span> for you.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div>

<h2>            windows 10 upgrade caused reboot and select proper boot device</h2>
                    I just upgraded my computer to Windows 10 and it worked for about a day and now when I start the computer up it says "Reboot and Select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key". &nbsp;A friend of mine recommended I insert
 a Windows 10 CD to try to get it to boot up right but I don't have a Windows 10 CD. &nbsp;I also tried hitting F12 to adjust the boot menu but I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly. &nbsp;Please help! &nbsp;My computer was fine until I did the Windows 10 upgrade. &nbsp;Thanks!!

            <p>Thank you very much for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my addition to your questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>The selected keyboard layout in my <em>regular </em>account is the Swiss keyboard (only keyboard showing up in the "Control Panel\Clock, Language and Region\Language" settings)</li><li>No, I actually don't get an error message while changing the "Control Panel\Clock, Language and Region\Language" settings in the
<em>Guest </em>account. However, additionally to the Swiss keyboard (which is listed at the TOP of the list as primary), the English US keyboard is listed as a second entry. And strangely, the second keyboard layout is the active one in the Guest account (which
 is wrong). If I delete the English US keyboard, save, close the settings and open them again, the English US keyboard shows up again (always as second choice in the list). I even tried the advanced settings and explicitely chose "override and use Swiss keyboard"
 &gt; didn't work.</li></ol>

            <p>I didn't see how you were changing it can you confirm this is the method you used?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Tap ENG from the systems tray next to the clock</li><li>Language preferences</li><li>Click once on the language you want</li><li>Click move Up on the Sections Menu Bar to put it on the top.</li><li>Then Change the Override to Use Language List</li></ol>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p><p>If you have a Guest account Windows will reset the language to the first one that was added. This is done so if you let someone use the computer, guest, they can't change your language and leave you trying to use Spanish Settings when you Speak English or
 French</p>
<p>

            <p>I'm not sure what you don't understand. Please make simpler sentences in order to be better understanable. Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if your question is "How do I change the language in the Guest account?". My answer is the following: I go through the Control Panel (as I described earlier. First open "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Control Panel", then
 "Clock, Language and Region", then finally "Language").</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">There is
<strong><em>no </em></strong>ENG text left to the clock/system tray icons on the bottom right corner of the screen (even though there are multiple keyboard layouts in the settings). Looks like Windows only recognizes the ENG keyboard setting and ignores the
 primary setting completely (hint: this is most probably a bug and no user error!).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In my regular and admin account, there is actually ENG showing up where you describe it (*), but NOT in the Guest account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*)&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Of course, if I only keep 1 keyboard layout and delete the others in the settings, the keyboard layout abbreviation (ENG, DEU, etc) does not show up anymore &gt; only 1 option</span></p>

            <p>You said "Especially, since the keyboard settings don't seem to be accessible within the Guest account which obviously has reduced access rights."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I am not sure which account you changed Settings in the guest account or the Admin.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just did it in my guest account and it worked, keeping the French input after a log out and restart.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Control Panel</li><li>Small or Large Icons</li><li>Language</li><li>Click once on the language you want to highlight it</li><li>Click move Up on the Sections Menu Bar to put it on the top.</li><li>Then Change the Override to Use Language List</li></ul>
<p>Here is what I currently think is the issue. You have two accounts, and admin and a guest. The Admin has the correct language but the Guest account does not. The Guest account has multiple languages in the Contol Panel &gt; All Items &gt; Languages - Language
 List in the center pane.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

<p>
</p><p>If you want to change the keyboard quickly you use Windows Key and the spacebar</p>

            <p>If you no longer want my help let me know, no hard feeling. If you do I added this. Both a unsophisticated and sophisticated answer.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If you have your Guest Account set up the way it shows above.</li><li>And if,&nbsp;you have the Advanced Settings set with both Overrides&nbsp;set to use the language list&nbsp;and the first&nbsp;input in the input option.</li><li>And if, you have the input type on the top of the list in the Language's options button.</li><li>And if still doesn't give you the correct output I would remove the input and language and re-download them.
</li><li>And if when you look at preview the layout is the way it is on your hardware</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I would check the onscreen keyboard to see fi the layout is the way you want it. Make sure to&nbsp;double check the language/input in the lower left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried it with the exact settings you have and when I type my "Y" key, in between the t and u&nbsp;(guessing your "Z") it types a Z. A Swedish keyboard layout can change by region. The German language with Swedish layout has a Z where a ENG US Y would be)
 But a ENG (swiss) has it the opposite. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my settings produce the desired output there is either a issue with the language pack/input files you have, a third party software conflict or something I am not thinking of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check systems files Windows + X &gt; command prompt (admin) &gt; type <strong>sfc/</strong><strong>scannow
</strong>&gt; hit enter &gt; if you have errors that can't be fixed &gt; type <strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Then&nbsp;see if it goes away in&nbsp;Advanced Startup Methods</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Clean Boot&nbsp;</strong> <br />

<p>Answers to your last post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">No I do not agree because we are still trying to identify where the issue is. If&nbsp;all misconfigurations are ruled out then it may be an error.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I don't tell you mine is working because it is fun or I want to mock you. You think it is a bug. If mine works and yours doesn't it is not a bug it is an issue with your system which will help in troubleshooting. This is why I let
 you know that what I explained and tried works. I was able to change the settings and you said you could not. Mine works so we kow it is not there in my&nbsp;build of W8.1 with all current updates.&nbsp;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">How sophisticated are you regarding computer technology? If you want an advanced answer then I suggest you attach the Visual Studio Debegger to Kernel32.dll I believe.
</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Or you can write a small console program that catches the key event and displays all the info you want every time you press a key.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Then you are looking&nbsp;specifically for the following if you are&nbsp;writing a console app or WPF&nbsp;or Windows Forms&nbsp;app.&nbsp;and something similar if you are debugging the kernel.</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">Class: System.Windows.Forms.KeyEventArgs or </p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentCodeblock"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">private</span>&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">void</span> OnKeyDownHandler(<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">object</span> sender, KeyEventArgs e)<br />
{<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">if</span> (e.Key == Key.Return)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; textBlock1.Text = <span style="color: rgba(163, 21, 21, 1)">"You Entered: "</span> + textBox1.Text;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; }<br />
}</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I don't deal with the kernel level events so I can't give you that much info but my basic answer would be to place a breakpoint on the OnKeyDownHandler or on the KeyEventArgs event dispatcher method&nbsp;inspect the KeyEventArgs object
 after a key is pressed and&nbsp;look for KeyEventArgs<span>.</span>ImeProcessedKey or&nbsp; you&nbsp;could follow the event as it bubbles to figure out where the key_ID is translated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can't see your computer and I don't know anything outside of what you input. Because of that the problem can be confusing even though it is incredibly simple. I am not an employee nor to I get compensated from Microsoft. I am doing this on my free time,
 for free, to help you out so please refrain from rude comments. If you no longer would like me suggesting ideas then let me know and I will gladly focus my energy on people that would like help and are grateful.

<p>
</p><p>Well, performing your steps, I actually could fix some system errors - but it didn't change anything on the keyboard problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solution to this is simply to not use the Guest account anymore, since the keyboard works perfectly in all other accounts...</p>

<p>Here, for the Microsoft support team, look at it and you might recognize that this is indeed a bug - or ignore it and leave your products as buggy as they are, it's your choice (I'm pretty sure my next computer will be a MacBook anyway):</p>
