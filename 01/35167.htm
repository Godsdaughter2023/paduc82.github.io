<h2>            Settings does not open up in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have been experiencing this issue with my copy of Windows 10 for the past few days, wherein when I try to update Windows 10, it fails to do so. Another problem is that the PC Settings cannot be opened(Tried opening PC Settings from various
 different locations and methods [Windows Key + I , File Explorer , Run command etc.]).</p>
<p>
</p><p>(To solve the PC Settings problem I tried the following methods):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Ran the SFC (after DISM)</p>
<p>This is the message that is displayed after it finishes with the scan.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log windir....not supported in offline servicing scenarios.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>Error :87</p>
<p>
</p><p>The online/cleanup-image/restorehealth option is unknown.</p>
<p>For more information, refer to the help by running DISM.exe /?.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DISM log file can be found at .....\DISM\dism.log.</p>
<p>_______________________________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>- Ran the DISM a couple of times.</p>
<p>This is the error message I am getting.</p>

</p><p>The Windows 10 copy is a legitimate copy upgraded from Windows 8.</p>
<p>

            <p>1st of all we need to Correct the system files,to do this you were using DISM tool.Your Syntax for the DISM is wrong.There are spaces in between every argument.A better idea is to do a Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V as CMD in Windows 10 supports this.</p>

<h2>            Batman Arkham Knight Season Pass Malfunction</h2>
                    <p>I purchased the digital download version of Arkham Knight Premium Edition back&nbsp;on March 10th for my 2TB One S, all but the content I have unlocked within the game during gameplay will not function and season pass seems like it has a bug. I paid almost $40.00 and I only am only able to view pictures/designs/descriptions/concept art from the DLC's. Is there a fix to get this to work right?</p>

<h2>            NFL Gamepass International  App issues</h2>
                    <p>Regarding the Gamepass International XBox App and the NFL films content part of it, I have two issues:<br />
A) the list of the shows is not displayed properly (see below pic) (minor issue)&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43cfab50-0342-4408-8493-3d112af7e3a6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/43cfab50-0342-4408-8493-3d112af7e3a6?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>and&nbsp;B) The list of the available episodes of the individual shoes (i.e. America's Game) is not complete so you have acces to only a handful of episodes with no way of updating or scrolling through the full list (major issue) (see below pic) .</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02ee5c5b-d3e0-4b35-a2e5-e9b30f61d275?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02ee5c5b-d3e0-4b35-a2e5-e9b30f61d275?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest a fix ?<br />
I know i can stream the required episodes from another device to my TV but it is not really practical&nbsp; (mainly for other members&nbsp; of the household that are not very tech savvy) and i don't reallly see the reason i should go through the extra effort for an issue
 that seems not too complicated to fix.</p>
<p>

<p>Also I noticed that when I uninstalled and reinstalled the first time it did not ask me to sign back in. It appeared that the account details were saved somehow. So I signed out, uninstalled and reinstalled again and signed back in but unfortunately the
 issues I described I n the OP are still there. Hope this helps</p>

<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that there is a quality issue when it comes to the <strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/apps/nfl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NFL App</a></strong> on the console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This quite possibly gets updated by the team working on the app itself. If the uninstallation did not assist, a suggestion would be to try our
<strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/connection-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Network Solution</a></strong> article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The NFL Gampass may also be accessed via the Microsoft Edge application by visiting the
<strong><a href="https://gamepass.nfl.com/packages" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NFL Gamepass</a></strong> website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give these a shot and let us know if this works for you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Hi Javier</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any connection or network issues either with the app or the console itself so I don't see how the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/connection-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Xbox Network Solution</span></strong></a> article might help me. I would appreciate if you escalated this to the app development team to look at as it seems to be affecting only the app - and actually only a part of the app's
 functionality- &nbsp;and get back to me if there is anything I can do from my end or advise if there's an update scheduled to address it.</p>
<p>As far as the NFL Gamepass support is concerned I contacted&nbsp;them initially&nbsp;about this&nbsp;and they referred me to you (Xbox support) as the Xbox app&nbsp;is not directly supported by them apparently.</p>

<p>Hi brandiesel1</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. Have you noticed the glitches I described in my original post too? I really don't have any issues with the live content ( watching from NZ though), my issues are with the on demand part of the content and mainly with the access
 to the lists of the available content (either shows or episodes of individual shows) so it definitely looks like a net code/database &nbsp;issue rather than a connection issue. Anyway thank you for the contribution and I hope the dev team will put some more "love"
 into this app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<h2>            Sorting sub-folders and files within Windows Explorer</h2>
                    <p><span>When I recently updated to Office 2013, I noticed that my sub-folders and files in Windows Explorer were displayed differently. &nbsp;I know you can right
 click within Windows Explorer and select "Sort by" to arrange the files in a variety of ways.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Prior to updating to Office 2013, my sub-folders/files were arranged so that all sub-folders were listed at the top, followed by individual files arranged
 by date (with most current at the top). &nbsp;Post update, when I select "Sort by" date (descending) the individual files all line up with most current at the top and oldest at the bottom (like I want them), but unfortunately, all the sub-folders shift to the bottom
 of the list, and are often not easily seen in folders which contain a lot of individual files. &nbsp;</span><span>Likewise, I tried to sort things by "folder" - which placed the sub-folders at the top of
 the list - but then all the individual files are listed in alpha order (not by descending date).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My question: is there a way I can configure Windows Explorer so that within a given folder, all sub-folders are anchored at the top of the list followed
 by the individual files arranged by descending date (most current at the top and oldest at the bottom?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are several factors why the screen goes blank after entering your pin. One of which may be due to an issue with its software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you check Mar T's post on this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro3-surfgetstart/black-screen-and-no-touch-or-swipe-activity/9530070a-d0e0-4894-90e0-2ae6fd0f3a25?auth=1">
link</a> for steps to troubleshoot blank screen issue. It includes performing a two-button shutdown and installing the latest updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us in the loop for the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong><em>screen goes blank and never comes up. </em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This symptom has several causes.&nbsp; Instead of resorting to sledge hammer solutions immediately I would try to check for more details.&nbsp; E.g. is it blank--does a mouse pointer appear if you move the mouse (a lot)--or is it black--no possibility of a mouse pointer.&nbsp;
 Also, you should try to start Narrator (press Win+Ctrl+Enter) and see if it says anything when you try to do things with your keyboard.&nbsp; In fact, since you do manage to see a Login screen you could start Narrator there too.&nbsp; With Narrator active you could
 try using the Project dialog (press Win-P) and try to change the display that way.&nbsp; For example, it could be that the tablet screen is no longer primary and the display mode is Second Screen Only; then by pressing Home, and Enter you could switch it to PC
 Screen Only and see if there would be something on the tablet screen.&nbsp; Another method of getting back to PC Screen Only supposedly is to press Win+Ctrl+Shift+B but you may have to do it more than once.&nbsp; Etc.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Wake up from Sleep is much slower in Windows 10 than Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;I have a Toshiba Satellite S75 Laptop (16Gb RAM).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen other posts in this forum relating to slow times on the neighborhood of 15 to 30 seconds - my computer is taking more like 10 to 15 minutes to finish coming fully to "life" following sleep &nbsp;(during that time, there is a serious lag when typing,
 files open very slowly, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I notice is that it doesn't appear to actually be a "sleep" mode like before ... &nbsp;When I wake up the computer, all of the system tray icons are reloading, Dropbox is "restarting" which itself can take up to 30 minutes to finish indexing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought "sleep" kept everything in RAM and just refreshed upon start?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a big problem for me. &nbsp;Making my life kinda miserable, since this is how I start every day, and after extended times away. &nbsp;And as I said, it's a BIG change from Windows 8</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. &nbsp;(Note also: I have also seen posts in this forum having to do with tablet video drivers, that don't seem to apply in this situation.)</p>

</p><p>I suspect that some application on background might causing the issue. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Let's perform a clean boot in Windows and&nbsp;check if it works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program. Follow the
 below mentioned steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>

</p><p>I will give it a try, though I am curious if you noted my comment regarding how this was not an issue at all with Windows 8 just before the upgrade. &nbsp;Also, that I observe that all of the icons in the systray are loading from right to left like you would
 see on a reboot... &nbsp;Is that kind of behavior something you would see with just one problematic service?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I was just about to post a "nevermind" on this question, as both of my computers (work and home) that have just recently upgraded to Windows 10, seemed to no longer have this problem. &nbsp;Wake from sleep seems to have "fixed itself" after a couple simple restarts
 - on both computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, just today, my home computer, which had been asleep about 24 hours, maybe longer, woke to a longer wake time again. &nbsp;My Skype completely restarted (which it doesn't usually do on a sleep/wake cycle), Dropbox say it is still "starting" after being
 awake about 15 minutes. &nbsp;Again, all programs are working fine... it just seems that the system is sending different kinds of wake "signals" ... some of the time very snappy, some of the time it's as though it goes into a deeper sleep and a longer restart -
 more like after a shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't consider this problem truly "resolved," but am demoting it to just kind of a periodic "annoyance."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will give it some more time, and see if Windows updates or some other sleep/power settings or actual restarts help the problem. &nbsp;Then if I feel sufficiently motivated, I will try

Yashwanth Kotakuri</a>'s ideas, which admittedly seem to be a big job since not only will I have to go through several restart cycles, but the problem itself is intermittent. &nbsp;It feels to me to be a bigger hassle than the issue itself.</p>

</p><p>UNLESS... did I misunderstand you,&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e11edfe3-bfe6-449b-83b7-e0dce5a6ccae" title="Yashwanth Kotakuri">Yashwanth Kotakuri</a>? &nbsp;Will just performing one clean boot
 help the problem? &nbsp;Or is your suggestion to do several clean boots, followed by several service test/divide cycles?</p>

            <p>Yes, I am still experiencing the problem... but infrequently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From time to time a "wake from sleep" will just cause the computer to act more like a full restart. &nbsp;Again, the best clue that I have that this is happening is that my system tray icons reload from right to left, and Dropbox has to re-index files. &nbsp;Which
 since I have 0.5Tb on Dropbox takes several minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this is unpredictable, and cannot be produced on demand. &nbsp;This makes the first support response (by

<p>
</p><p>So I am not sure that you can help me further in this situation. &nbsp;But it's something I wanted to alert the Windows 10 team on, because my "gut" says that there's some bug in the sleep-system code somewhere.</p>

                    <p>Today I received my new Dell with Windows 8.1,&nbsp; I worked on the set-up with no problem, adding my preferred software.&nbsp; As a final step, I used the program uninstall to uninstall Taplika and PC Utilities Pro.&nbsp; I then restarted my computer.&nbsp; Now I can't get
 to my start page.&nbsp; Everything seems normal until I type in my Microsoft password.&nbsp; Then it goes to a dark grey screen.&nbsp; The mouse works, but there is nothing on which to click.&nbsp; If I do control-alt-del, I can log out.&nbsp; I've had this computer for 5 hours and
 it is now unuseable.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Instead of going to Safe mode try requesting Low res video support.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, if you can do a Ctrl-Alt-Delete you may be able to get into Task Manager that way and start msconfig.exe.&nbsp; With it you could change your boot options that way instead of having to go into the Advanced Boot Options menu.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, while you are in Task Manager you could check to see if explorer.exe is running.&nbsp; Restart it if it is.&nbsp; Use the TM File, New task command to try starting it otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are getting a lot further than many others seem to be but maybe your symptom description is just clearer than most.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>

<p>
Looking in event viewer it seems to relate to a problem with Faulting C:\Windows\system32\msvcrt.dll, can I get another version of this dll?<br />
<br />
Or could it be a problem with the registry and are there any good registry analysers / fixing programs?<br />

            <p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you make any significant changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li><li>What is the make and model no. of your computer?</li></ol>
<p>I appreciate your efforts taken to resolve the issue. The issue might arise due to various reasons including low memory, damaged or missing system files, issues with the video driver or due to a third party software conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to diagnose and troubleshoot the issue, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><span>Try to boot the system in safe mode and check if&nbsp;the issue is reproduced. If not, then clean boot the computer and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></em></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode in which you are logged in with only necessary minimal services and drivers enabled. Check if the issue is reproduced.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the following steps:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on the Power button on the login screen.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press and hold the SHIFT key on keyboard and simultaneously click on
<strong><span>Restart</span></strong> option.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once your PC restarts, on the <strong><span>Choose an option</span></strong> screen, tap or click
<strong><span>Troubleshoot</span></strong><span><span>.</span></span><br />
If you don't see the <strong><span>Startup Settings</span></strong> option, tap or click
<strong><span>Advanced options</span></strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Tap or click <strong><span>Startup Settings</span></strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Tap or click <strong><span>Restart</span></strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">On the <strong><span>Startup Settings</span></strong> screen, choose the startup setting for
<strong><span>Safe Mode with Networking</span></strong> (Generally <strong><span>F5</span></strong> key is pressed to select this setting).</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Sign in to your PC with a user account that has administrator rights.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Check if the issue persists in Safe Mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue does not reproduce in Safe Mode, then try to clean boot the system and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></em></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></em></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue does not occur in clean boot, then you may determine which application/service on the computer is causing this issue. This can be done by following the instructions for “Windows 8.1 and Windows 8” given in the section “How to determine
 what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot” from the same given link.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps suggested by </span>xdozex replied on January 15, 2010 in the following thread:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-in-windows-7-keeps-crashing-and/c6fddc14-7649-4334-ac9a-6d049fd503bd"><em><strong>Windows Explorer in Windows 7 keeps crashing and restarting</strong></em></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>There are updates that have been published to fix the issue related to Windows Explorer crashes. Please refer to the following article and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>Hi Tim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the recurring updates on your issue. Much appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>From you issue description, we can conclude that the issue does not persist in the safe mode but reproduced in clean mode. So, I would suggest you to try disabling the display adapter and check with the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disable the display adapter in&nbsp;the safe mode and boot normally to check for the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Boot in </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">safe mode</span></em></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Press "Windows key + X".</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click "Device Manager".</span></p>
<p><span>d. Expand "Display Adapters" and right click the device driver.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click "Disable".</span></p>
<p><span>f. Reboot your system normally.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue does not reproduce than you might need to update the display adapter or check for its compatibility from the manufacturer. You may refer to the steps above to enter the Device Manager and update the display adapter in the normal mode.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank&nbsp;you for your update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the issue does not reproduce in safe mode, we still have options to diagnose the root cause of the issue. Run the Windows Memory Diagnostics Tool and check if it helps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows key + X.</li><li>Click <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Open <strong>Administrative Tools </strong>(in "Large icons" view).</li><li>Double-click to initiate the <strong>Windows Memory Diagnostics</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Restart now and check for problems (recommended)</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Let the tool run and check if any memory errors are fixed. Let us know the results if the detected errors are not fixed.</p>

            <p>Not sure what a "complete restore" is but it looks like from activity in other forums that might mean a restore of the system to the as shipped from the factory condition using a built in recovery partition that might be available on some store bought computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is just about the absolute last resort in problem solving since you will have to download, reinstall all the driver updates, Windows updates, third party software, etc. since your system came out of the box.&nbsp; Then restore a backup if you have one and
 hope it all works.&nbsp; Too much like work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a recovery partition or reinstalling Windows is not "fixing" any problem.&nbsp; It is giving up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why you thought reinstalling C++ would help, the advice from the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" to "try" things like disabling your video driver does not make sense (notice the words "try" all over the place).&nbsp; And I am sure not
 reading through 13 pages of things to try when looking for a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you want to waste a lot of time and get frustrated, you don't need to try things - you need to do things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your system is up to date with MS updates and if Explorer is crashing, the problem is often a third party Explorer shell extension.&nbsp; Sometimes things you install or download will add a shell extension to Explorer and can cause it to crash.&nbsp; You may not
 even know that a new shell extension has been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find out, use <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ShellExView from NirSoft</a> and you will be able to see all your Explorer shell extensions and then you can start disabling the third party non Microsoft extensions one by one (or all
 at once) and see if the problem goes away.&nbsp; If it does, you can start enabling them again one at a time until the problem returns and the last extension you enable is likely the culprit.&nbsp; Once you figure out which it is you can visit the WWW page of that software
 and see if there is an update for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After running ShellExView you can widen the columns to better see things and then click the Product Name or Company Name column header to sort the extensions and easily see which are from Microsoft and which are not (they will be in kind of a pink color).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can disable them all or one at a time as you isolate the afflicted extension.&nbsp; Note that the effect is immediate and there is no need to restart the system or login again.&nbsp; And disabling a shell extension extension does not uninstall it - it is
 just disabled and you can simply enable it again when you are ready.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will look something like this:</p>

<h2>            Getting Unbanned</h2>
                    <p>Dear Xbox Enforcement Team,</p><p>approximately 2 days ago I got a communication ban. This ban was fairly given as someone had been sending hate messages after the lost fairy in a game. Unfortunately the person who said those rude and obnoxious messages wasn't me. My mate Will (aka APMW on xbox) decided it would be funny to play some solo games on my account and be disrespectful to anyone who outplayed him. I would like to get unbanned because I would never do this sort of stuff and Its really hard being a member of the community without a microphone or any form of communication. Sorry about the inconvenience.<br /></p><p>XCNW -&nbsp;</p>

            These instructions are for printers?&nbsp; Our HP fingerprint readers no longer work since moving to windows 10... you know biometrics, using your finger print to sign on?&nbsp; It is no longer enabled, how do we turn it back on? I have a HP Pavilion dv6 laptop.

            <p>Sayan_Ghost, the Microsoft Support Engineer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems you have created an algorithm to detect key phrases so you can publish responses in a timely manner. I am sure this one had much to do with the "print" and "scanner" portion. Perhaps, however, you actually read this question and chose to give a
 non-applicable response. I do hope it is the former and you simply have not checked your automated responses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, it has been a week since your original response and I would like to imagine someone at Microsoft is taking this issue seriously as it is not yet resolved, or even properly acknowledged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your response, Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respectfully,&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Nelson and Justin I fixed my own problem tonight... maybe it will work for other HP users that upgraded to Windows 10, so I'm posting here...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For others that may have the same issue, in your apps look for HP Support Assistant and a launch it.&nbsp; When I launched it I said that there was a new version of HP Support Assistant available would I like to upgrade?&nbsp; I said yes.&nbsp;It also said I had updates
 available from HP would I&nbsp;like those, andI clicked yes.&nbsp; &nbsp;It downloaded a New Support assistant and asked to restart my computer.&nbsp;When the computer came back up&nbsp; my finger print reader lit up, I put my finger acrossed it and it worked!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I want to&nbsp; add the date showed that my HP Support Assistant had stopped working after my Windows 10 upgrade as it showed its last check for updates was the day of the upgrade which was last week.&nbsp; So maybe it needs to be updated when you upgrade to
 10 for it to continue to work. </p>

<p>She's not his ex. Shes dead.</p>
<p>You never heard she was having an affair because that never happened. </p>
<p>Or at least I haven't heard that before. </p>
<p>In either case, Isaac is wracked with guilt over her death on the Ishimura. The reason is because he was the one who recommended her to take the job on the ship.

<p>AMCope. In the future you should call out "Spoilers" when you're about to give some out. Especially when they are as big as that one. There are people out there who haven't beat the game who would appreciate your discretion. &nbsp;How would you feel if someone
 told you the ending OMG moment of the story in the game you were currently playing? OP, I don't know where you're getting your info, but it's all wrong. The only affair I know of takes place in one of the two movies between two doctors who aren't even worth
 mentioning.</p>

<p>Spoilers, though it doesn't really *** matter anymore. Nicole IS technically his ex because she is a girlfriend from his past because she's dead. In his head she is his current girlfriend. It really comes down to semantics. In the second game she is for
 sure his ex because (Dead Space 2 SPOILERS) the *** is trying to kill him lol. But then again it's the marker... Semantics...</p>

<p>It set up the fact that she was in trouble, but certainly not what you spoiled above. That wasn't revealed until the end. A lot of us may have assumed that, but we didn't know for sure. When she was walking around I doubt you thought he was hallucinating.
 If you say you knew he was, you are lying. Either way there is a good chance you ruined the ending for another person. In the future please be sure to let people know you are going talk about important story details that aren't revealed at the beginning of
 the game.</p>

    <title>DIY Windows 8 Start Screen Tiles &#8211; Pin to Start Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rohn007  say:</h3>
<h2>            DIY Windows 8 Start Screen Tiles &#8211; Pin to Start Screen</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Basic
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br /><p><span>The Windows 8 user interface depends on “Tiles” as the first line of access to the contents of the computer. At a high level, you can consider tiles as the rough equivalent of Windows Shortcuts in previous versions of Windows.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, here is a screen clip of Word Shortcuts on the Window 8 desktop</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c2bbdc9-e9c4-47b8-a624-f7a8305fa7ae" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here are Tiles (Shorcuts) to the the same programs on the Windows 8 Start Screen</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7d926d81-9385-42b6-997b-5a0f17c2f8dc" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In both cases they are just static “shortcuts”, not new active Windows 8 Tiles.</span></p>
<p><span>Tiles go beyond simply providing a graphical link to the underlying file. Tiles provide the option of displaying active content from the app on the Start Screen. For example, the “Live Tile” for a weather app can show weather “highlights” that are
 periodically updated, as shown below.</span></p>

</p><p><span>Up until Windows 8, you could easily create “shortcuts” on the desktop and Start Menu. Apparently it is no longer that easy to create “shortcuts” on the Start Screen. Here is how to do it on the legacy desktop:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Right click on desktop</span></li><li><span>Select new</span></li><li><span>Select Shortcut</span></li><li><span>Define the location of the user file or program executable file</span></li><li><span>Click on Next</span></li><li><span>Define the name to display on shortcut</span></li><li><span>Click Finish</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Or you could create a shortcut by right clicking and dragging a program or user file from the File Explorer to a new location on the desktop, then releasing the mouse button and selecting “create shortcut”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This process is documented with pictures in this tip: <a href="http://www.7tutorials.com/how-create-shortcuts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br /><b>Details</b><br /><br />
<p class="contentHeader1">Why Create or Tweak Start Screen Tiles</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can think of at least 3 situations where you want to work with the Start Screen tiles:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You want to create a tile for a “legacy” desktop program</li><li>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You want to create a tile for a user file,</li><li>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rename one of the default tiles.</li></ol>
<div>
<p class="contentHeader2"><span>Point 1: Desktop Programs</span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Unlike MS Office, most 3rd party “Desktop” program installers do not include Code to create Win 8 Tiles. For example, if you install a Portable application, you have to manually create the shortcut on the desktop and the Start Screen.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="contentHeader2"><span>Point 2: User Files</span></p>
</div>
<p><span>On the desktop it is trivially easy to create a shortcut to a file you want fast access to.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It takes a little more effort to create a tile to file, but it can be done</span></p>
<div>
<p class="contentHeader2"><span>Point 3: Rename Tiles</span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Given the HUGE icons in tiles, thank you very much, but I don’t need to see the full name “Microsoft Office 2013 Word” on the tile, renaming the tile to “Word 2013” gets the message across very clearly.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="contentHeader1">Create Tiles for Installed Desktop Programs - “Pin to Start”</p>
</div>
<p><span>“Legacy” desktop programs do not create “Active Tiles” on the start screen. The installer program does not include the special code required to generate fully functional Windows 8 Active Tiles.</span></p>
<p><span>After you install a legacy / desktop program, the first thing to do is scroll to the far right side of the Start Screen. If you are lucky, all of the old Start Menu shortcuts will appear there. You will probably want to hide some (or most), and move
 the rest to a more appropriate location on the Start Screen.</span></p>
<p><span>If the shortcuts to the application are not on the Start Screen you next want to look in the “All Apps” view of the Start Screen. There are several ways of doing that. You want to display the task bar at the bottom of the screen by doing one of the
 following actions:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Use &lt;CTL&gt;&lt;TAB&gt; shortcut key combo</span></li><li><span>Right click on the Start Screen</span></li><li><span>Right click on any existing Tile</span></li><li><span>Hit the “Menu” key on the keyboard </span></li></ul>
<p><span>You then want to click on the “All Apps” icon at the far right end of the task bar.
</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/63fb2590-9bd9-4b06-8353-a39df3a9283c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This will display the tiles for all of the programs installed on the computer.
</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/754fe651-5062-4477-89a8-9413b80bd707" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First are the Tiles for new style Windows Apps, then you will see all of the icons for legacy programs and finally many of the built in Windows utilities. These are all of the programs and folders you would normally see in the Start Menu. In The Start
 Menu you would see folders, now you see low key group names above tiles for programs in that folder. Just like the Start Screen, this screen scrolls from off screen on the right to left.</span></p>
<p><span>Sure, you can still create a shortcut to them on the old desktop, and/or you can pin them to the task bar (if you have enough space). But, there does not appear to be an easy way to put them on the Start Screen.</span></p>
<p><span>To create a static Tile for a program you have to find the folder that the program has been installed to. You can navigate to it in Windows Explorer. Typically that would be in one of these 2 locations:</span></p>
<div style="margin-left: 0.4in">
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><span>C:\Program Files</span></p>
</div>
<p>
</p><div style="margin-left: 0.4in">
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><span>C:\Program Files (x86)<span>&nbsp; </span>(for 32 bit apps installed on 64 bit Windows)</span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Right click on the program file and select “Pin to Start”. The new tile will be displayed at the far right end of all tiles currently on the Start Screen. You can click and drag it to relocate it.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="contentHeader1">Create Tiles for User Files</p>
</div>
<p><span>If you try to pin a user file, such as a Word document or Excel spreadsheet, you will not be offered the ”Pin to Start” option.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Instead you will see options to “Create Shortcut”, or “Send to / Desktop (create shortcut)”. But nothing to do with the Start Screen.</span></p>
<p><span>To get a document tile on the Start Screen you have to “think outside of the box” and combine a couple of “old school” techniques. Many (all?) applications allow you to start the program and automatically load a specified file at the same time. In
 DOS you used command line parameters. In previous versions of Windows you used the “Target” parameter in the shortcut properties.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Either way, you provide both the executable program name and the file name. This technique still works for Windows 8 Start Screen Tiles. I prefer to “fully qualify”, include the full filename and path, to make it clear where they are located.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Either way, you provide both the executable program name and the file name. This technique still works for Windows 8 Start Screen Tiles. I prefer to “fully qualify”, include the full filename and path, to make it clear where they are located.
 This is especially important if you have multiple versions of a program installed or multiple files with the same or similar names in various folders. For example, I have 4 versions of Office, so simply specifying WINWORD.EXE would start the current default
 application, not necessarily the version I wanted to start.</span></p>
<p><span>There are 2 ways of approaching this problem.<span>&nbsp; </span>I find it easier to have 2 File Explorer windows open at the same time.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In one, navigate to the program file, in the other navigate to the user file. In one window you create the base shortcut, in the other you extract the full path and file name.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>right click on the program file </span></li><li><span>create a shortcut on the desktop for the program</span></li><li><span>right click on the new program shortcut</span></li><li><span>select properties to display the shortcut properties dialog</span></li><li><span>copy the path and file name into Target field after the program name. You will have something that looks like this:</span></li></ul>
<div style="margin-left: 0.4in">
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><span>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office14\WINWORD.EXE" "F:\Public\Documents\@@Answers dot com.DOCX "</span></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><span>You may also want to the “Start in” location to the document folder.</span></li><li><span>Click on OK to save the changes.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>You now have a shortcut on the old style desktop that will start Word 2010 and load the file “@@Answers dot com.docx”.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4596ed95-da44-407b-9e44-19408e6d02e1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The final step is to right click on this desktop shortcut and select “Pin to Start”. You now have a new TILE placed at the far right end of the existing tiles.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can drag and drop it to place it in a more appropriate location.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="contentHeader1">Create Tiles and Taskbar Shortcuts with Parameters</p>
</div>
<p><span>It is simple enough, working from the desktop side of the OS.<span>&nbsp; </span>
In Windows Explorer</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Locate the program or data file</span></li><li><span>Right click on it</span></li><li><span>Select “Send To &gt; Desktop (create shortcut)</span></li><li><span>Right click on the resulting shortcut</span></li><li><span>Select the Properties option</span></li><li><span>In the Properties dialog, click on the Shortcut tab</span></li><li><span>In the Target field, you can add the desired parameters. <br />
NOTE: you may have to add quotes around the file name if there are spaces anywhere in the name or path</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>OK</strong> or <strong>Apply</strong> to save changes</span></li><li><span>Right click on the modified shortcut</span></li><li><span>Select “Pin to Start” or “Pin to Taskbar”</span></li></ol>
<p><span>After you have pinned it, you optionally may delete the shortcut </span>
</p>
<div>
<p class="contentHeader1">Delete a Live Tile</p>
</div>
<p><span>Live tiles constantly update summary data displays. Usually the data is retrieved from the internet. If you want to cut down on internet bandwidth use, you can selectively turn off “live tiles”</span></p>
<p><span>Right click on the live tile and select<span>&nbsp; </span>“Turn Live Tile Off.
</span></p>
<div>
<p class="contentHeader1">Rename Tiles on the Start Screen</p>
</div>
<p><span>Tile names, and previously Shortcut names, are often long and cumbersome, ie Microsoft Office 2010 PowerPoint etc.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Well, I KNOW that PowerPoint comes from Microsoft and if I put it in an “Office 2010” Group on the desktop I don’t need that as part of the shortcut/tile name. Often the repetitive stuff is so long the relevant part is wrapped off screen. So I go from
 a Tile name of “Microsoft Office 2010 PowerPoint” to “PowerPoint 2010” which will probably all be displayed all the time.</span></p>
<p><span>Although it is not obvious, the Windows 8 Start Screen still relies on the “old” Start Menu folders. For example the underlying shortcuts for Office applications are located in:</span></p>
<div style="margin-left: 0.4in">
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><span>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Microsoft Office</span></p>
</div>
<p><span>And</span></p>
<div style="margin-left: 0.4in">
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><span>C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</span></p>
</div>
<p><span>Any folder inside of these folders is displayed as a Group on the All Apps screen. And all shortcuts in these folders appear as app tiles on the Start Screen.</span></p>
<p><span>If you right click on a tile, a command bar is displayed on the bottom of the screen. One of the options is “Open File Location”.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f0120a6-825a-4c8b-927f-667d86ee494b" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>That will open Windows Explorer in the appropriate location, in the start menu or the program files location.</span></p>
<p><span>Now you can rename the existing shortcuts by single clicking to select the shortcut then using the &lt;F2&gt; (rename) shortcut key or right clicking and selecting the “rename”. You are now in edit mode on the name and change it as desired. When you are
 finished, hit &lt;enter&gt;. You will then see the UAC prompts requesting the Admin Password for the change</span></p>
<div>
<p class="contentHeader1">Use “Group” to Organize Tiles on the Start Screen</p>
</div>
<p><span>By default, tiles can be organized into groups that use multiples of 2 columns of tiles, ie 2, 4, 6, etc columns.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The tiles automatically flow within the group.<span>&nbsp; </span>I like to control where the tiles are placed within a group and have not been able to find a way of turning the auto flow off. The work around I use is to go with no more than 2 columns in
 each group.<span>&nbsp; </span>This next screen capture has 2 groups in it, the first one is unnamed, the second one is called “Office”:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5dd18266-454d-4648-990b-f6ccb45a4e23" /></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> I have already customized 3 of the Office application tile names</span></p>
<p><span>You create new groups simply by slowly sliding a tile until you see a “ghostly” thick white vertical bar. Release the tile and a new group will be formed. Simple.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="contentHeader1">Name Groups</p>
</div>
<p><span>Mouse down to the bottom of the screen until you see a horizontal scroll bar. At the far right end of the scroll bar you will see a small minus sign (indicated by the Yellow arrow).</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/58c280b8-f6c9-4aee-8a36-46fd5b96c9c2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you click on it the start screen will zoom “out”, making all of the tiles small.
</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/073efaca-b76f-442f-8b2f-93883addc431" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Right click on a group, for example you can see a check mark in the upper right corner of the first one and the task bar displays with the Name Group command. You can give the group a name or change the existing name.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="contentHeader2"><span>Build an “Applications” folder for quick program launching from the Desktop</span></p>
</div>
<p><span>There's an even quicker way to access all of your apps from the Desktop, create an “Applications” that directly access all of them.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Copy the full text on the next line: </li></ol>
<div style="margin-left: 0.4in">
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><code><span>Applications.{4234d49b-0245-4df3-b780-3893943456e1}</span></code></p>
</div>
<ol>
<li>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Right click on the desktop </li><li>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Select “Create a new Folder”</li><li>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paste the copied text into the folder name</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: The “name” before the period and braces, ie “Applications” is simply descriptive text. It is the “Registry Key” in the braces that enables the access (this is also true for the “God Mode”
 folder). So you can change it to anything you want. For example, I changed mine to “All Apps” (remind you of anything, say on the start screen).</span></p>
<p><span>On the Desktop and in File Explorer, the folder will be called Applications. Double-click it to see a list of all your applications, including Windows 8 Store apps, traditional Desktop applications and many system applet such as Control Panel. To run
 an app, double-click it. So, yes, this means you can now start “Metro” apps from the Desktop.</span></p>
<p><span>When you are in the “Application” (or “All Apps”) folder, as any other folder there are several views (see Tile view):</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7576866-bc0c-4799-8b62-62a3464b27e8" /><span><br />
<strong><em>Applications Folder View Options and Tile View</em></strong></span></p>
<p><span>The Tiles View (shown above) is somewhat limited. I prefer the “Details” View because the names are sortable (click on the column title “Name”).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92901ecb-ec57-4cbf-bd7e-0bc0808aa4d6" /><span><br />
<strong><em>Applications folder, Details View</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:<span>&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span>most<strong> </strong>
of the names in the “names” in the screen capture above are actually “Metro” apps.
</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><em><span>EDIT</span></em></strong><em><span>: If anyone knows how to edit the values in the “Long Display Name” column I would appreciate hearing in a comment or suggestion. I suspect it is a registry entry, I simply haven’t
 found it yet.</span></em></p>
<p><span>There's still one problem, though: The folder doesn't show up on the Start screen. It's simple to put it there, though. Right-click it on the Desktop or in File Explorer and select "Pin to Start." It's now pinned to the Start screen, though it might
 not be immediately visible there. </span></p>
<p><span>To find it, scroll all the way over to the right, and it'll be there. Click it, and the folder opens with all your apps. If you like, you can move it to a more prominent location on the Start screen by dragging it to the left.</span></p>

<p class="contentHeader1">Apps to Create Tiles</p>
</div>
<p><span>Here are links to a few apps I’ve found that automate DIY tile creation. I’ve played with them briefly and generally like them, within their limits. I am not associated with any of these companies.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="contentHeader2"><span>OblyTile</span></p>
</div>
<p><span>This link describes how to use a program called OblyTile to create Tiles with custom images. I did a quick test and it is very easy to use.
</span></p>
<p><span>The program requires 2 sizes of PNG image files to create square and rectangular Tiles.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can use the default Windows 8 Paint program to SAVE AS current JPG files into the 2 required PNG file sizes</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>:<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
do not add quotes around path names that have spaces. The applet will do this for you. If you do you will get a VB error.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="contentHeader2"><span>Tile Genie</span></p>
</div>
<p><span>This free Windows 8 Store app allows you to create a grid of tiles from any picture. You can associate web pages with each tile of the grid. I was not able to “convince” it into launching files on the computer.</span></p>
<div>
<p class="contentHeader2"><span>PinTo8</span></p>
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">With <strong>Pin to 8</strong> you will able:</span></p>
<ul>

<div>
<p class="contentHeader2"><span>Tile a File</span></p>
</div>
<p><span>This app allows you to navigate to pick a file on your system and give it a display name. You can choose which size tile you want to use. Much faster than the manual method I described. I didn’t see a method of customizing the image displayed.</span></p>

<p>
</p><div>
<p class="contentHeader1">Remove “Shortcut” from the Shortcut Name</p>
</div>
<p><span>When you create a new Shortcut in any version of Windows, the default action is to add a little arrow to the icon and add the word “Shortcut” at the end of the file name. For example</span></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76947f91-4f63-4fe0-8878-f18eb0d08ea3" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For this, I am a graphical sort of person, so with the arrow indicating it is a shortcut, I prefer to not see the word “Shortcut” wrapping off screen.
</span></p>
<p><span>There is a simple “registry hack” fix for this that has worked for earlier versions of Windows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Start the registry editor: </span>
<ul>
<li><span>Press &lt;Win&gt;&lt;R&gt; </span></li><li><span>Type REGEDIT </span></li><li><span>Press &lt;enter&gt;</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>Navigate to: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer</span></li><li><span>Double click on the “Link” key.<span>&nbsp; </span>The default value is “1e 00 00 00”.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></li><li><span>Change the value to “00 00 00 00”.</span></li><li><span>Sign out from this User ID</span></li><li><span>Sign back in to the User ID for the change to take effect.</span></li></ul>

    <title>Recurrent crazy sleep mode and sluggish typing in word combined - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr. jack hill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recurrent crazy sleep mode and sluggish typing in word combined - drives me crazy&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now this. I had so many different stupid problems with this laptop x Windows 10 combination. Now this. There are two new symptoms which co-appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) A month ago the power button stopped working correctly. So far, a short touch put the pc into sleep mode, a long pressing switched off totally the laptop. But this does not work any more. However long I press the power button, nothing happens. Furthermore,
 Windows automatically goes into sleep mode after 3-4 min of inactivity. I checked the power settings and they are fine, unchanged. I went to Power Options, Chose what the power button does, Change settings that are currently unavailable etc. Everything looks
 normal: on Plugged in: never put the computer to sleep. Pressing the power button: sleep mode. I also ran from elevated command prompt: sfc /scannow, and finds no integrity violation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) And when the computer behaves like this, typing in MS Word (but only in MS Word) becomes crazy. You hit Space and it deletes a letter backward etc. It also becomes sluggish. Why these now? What else will happen to this poor stupid laptop? I am so tired
 that I cannot go to some selected webpages because of the error "This site can’t be reached The connection was reset." to which I still have no solution, I cannot watch streaming videos or stored movies because it cracks and buzzes, and now this. I have no
 idea what else to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>A</p>

<h2>            Disruption caused by Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709 - Error 0x80d02002</h2>
                    Once again the feature update to Windows 10, version 1709 is rendering my PC useless and unresponsive and making access to the internet virtually impossible for hours on end whilst the update downloads, and then subsequently fails to install. This issue
 continues to cost me hours of valuable work time. If these updates cannot be downloaded and installed in the background with little or no disruption then the least that Microsoft could do is to notify users. Is there no way of temporarily disabling or deferring
 Windows updates?

            <p>Wordpad is not designed to open PDF files - that's why the content looks like garbled code.</p>
<p>To open PDF files you need a PDF reader program. The most widely used is the free Adobe Reader* program.
</p>
<p>If you don't have such a program installed then install one and it should then automatically open PDF files for you when required.</p>
<p>If you already have a PDF reader program then you may need to associate the PDF file type with that program as follows:</p>
<p>1. Click on <strong>Start-&gt;Default programs-&gt;Associate a file type or protocol with a program.</strong></p>
<p>2. Scroll down the list of file types until you see .<strong>PDF</strong> then select it.</p>
<p>3. Click on <strong>Change program</strong> button (top-right).</p>
<p>4. Select your PDF reader prgram such as Adobe Reader.</p>
<p>5. Tick the box at the bottom&nbsp;for <strong>Always use....</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Hit <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* <u><span>To install Adobe Reader</span></u><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Go to </span><a href="http://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://get.adobe.com/uk/reader/</span></a></p>
<p><span>2. Untick the optional <em><span>Google Toolbar</span></em> if you don't want it then download and install Adobe Reader.</span></p>

    <title>security update messed up fonts in Windows XP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            security update messed up fonts in Windows XP</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>in the early morning (Feb 11 2015) I've installed (via Microsoft Update):</p>
<p>1. Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack Service Pack 3 (KB 2956097)</p>
<p>2. Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack Service Pack 3 (KB 2956098)</p>
<p>3. etc, see <a href="http://www.streamline.cz/download/microsoft/windows_update_2015_02_11/1_Windows_Update.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
1_Windows_Update.jpg</a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, latest update messed up my fonts! See <a href="http://www.streamline.cz/download/microsoft/windows_update_2015_02_11/2_Messed_up_fonts.bmp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
2_Messed_up_fonts.bmp</a>. Plus, there's no chance to uninstall those updates since I can't see them in Add/Remove programs (control panel).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried to restore the XP to yesterday's state but it didn't help. Then I reinstalled KB 2956097 &amp; KB 2956098 &amp; KB 3029944 via Microsoft Update just to make sure whether I can find them in Add/Remove programs. No, I can't. :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to switch back so that I have my fonts as before: <a href="http://www.streamline.cz/download/microsoft/windows_update_2015_02_11/3_Regular_fonts.bmp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
3_Regular_fonts.bmp</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated. Thank you very much in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi Vladimir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you install KB3013455?</p>
<p>If so, I suggest uninstalling it for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seem to be some problems with that update but Microsoft is aware of it and doing researches..</p>
<p>
</p><div>Known issues with this security update
<div>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; After you install security update 3013455, you may notice some text quality degradation in certain scenarios. The problem only occurs on systems that are running Windows Vista SP2 or Windows Server 2003 SP2. Microsoft is researching this problem and will
 post more information in this article when the information becomes available. </li></ul>

<p>I can see KB3013455 in <a href="http://www.streamline.cz/download/microsoft/windows_update_2015_02_11/1_Windows_Update.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
1_Windows_Update.jpg</a> but I can't find it in Add/Remove programs under Updates. I'm afraid that update history is not stored in registry since I can't find it there either. There are about 40 screens of listing in Add/Remove programs so I have to check the
 list very carefully.</p>
<p>Will let you know ASAP...<br />

            <p>Hello, <span>Robear Dyer (PA Bear),</span></p>
<p><span>here's the list of updates: </span><a href="http://www.streamline.cz/download/microsoft/windows_update_2015_02_11/4_WindowsXP_update.bmp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">4_WindowsXP_update.bmp</a><span>. I've created this screenshot in the "second round", see my original
 post.</span></p>
<p>I checked out Installed Updates very carefully and (finally) I've found KB2956097 &amp; KB2956098! Those updates are stored under "Sada Compatibility Pack pro systém Office 2007". This is the reason why I could not find those KBs under "Microsoft Office Compatibility
 Pack" / "Security Update for Microsoft Compatibility". I'm very sorry about it.<br />

            Hello Doreen, 
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, according to the instructions provided by Cricut Inc., Cricut does not have a singular link to click and download the application.  These are the instructions provided by Cricut to obtain the application:
<br />
<br />Quote from the above article link: 
<br /><pre><code>"Design Space is typically installed on your computer through the new machine setup process. However, you can manually install it through the steps below:
Open an internet browser and go to design.cricut.com.
When the page has fully loaded, sign in with your Cricut ID, or create one if you don't have one.
When you are signed in, click the New Project tile. You will receive a prompt to download and install the Design Space plugin. Click the Download Plugin.</code></pre>
<br />
<br />Please also see the screenshot provided by Cricut.com 
<br />
<br />I cannot override the instructions for a product given by its manufacturer. If you are able to download the application after following the instructions please let me know.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a0009ec-71ef-4c57-9adb-9b42c78fc1de?upload=true" />

<h2>            desktop icons deleted disappear from all user accounts&#63;</h2>
                    I have 3 accounts for my computer, all set to administrator.<br />
<br />
one for business, one for projects {adobe photoshop, flahs, premiere, etc.} and one for personal.<br />
<br />
whenever i setup the business user account today, i went onto that account and it said "preparing your desktop" then after that all my desktop icons for the most part were on that user account.&nbsp; when i deleted the desktop icons, later i found out it deleted
 all the desktop icon links off my other main user account to...why is this, and what can i do to clear up my business account desktop without affecting any other one?<br />
<br />
and going off of that, how do i set up to where my user folders {documents, videos, pictures, etc} are on another hard drive?<br />
<br />
I want my C: drive to have no user folders on it, i want all of them on my 2cd, 1b western dig. hard drive, how do i do this?<br />
<br />
thanks

<div>The information below has been edited for Windows 7 from <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaappearance/thread/18ac090e-989f-4e7b-8f4e-6709974b1c8b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a>&nbsp;thread:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>
<span><span><span>There
 are 2 locations for the desktop in Windows 7.<br />
<br />
C:\Users\Public\Desktop is the location for All Users. Any shortcut icon in this folder will appear on every user desktop.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>C:\Users\user
 name\Desktop is the location for each individual user. Any shortcut icon in this folder will only appear on that individual user desktop.<br />
<br />
To get the result you want, if a program installation places an icon in the “All users” desktop folder, you can simply move that icon from that folder to your individual desktop folder. i.e You can remove a shortcut from an individual user's desktop on either
 OS by moving the icon from the All Users (on Vista, Public) Desktop directory into the Desktop directory(s) for the user(s) you want.</span></span></span></p>
