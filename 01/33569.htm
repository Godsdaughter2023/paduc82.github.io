            <p>&nbsp;Not being to change recycle bin properties is definitely not normal.&nbsp; Have you checked for viruses yet?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Also do you have some system utilities installed that might be causing this?&nbsp; I remember years ago installing Norton Utilities and it had an option to take over control of the recycle bin.&nbsp; If you have a utility like that, it could be responsible for what
 you're seeing.&nbsp; Have you installed any software in the last few days?&nbsp; Have you made any settings changes&nbsp;recently?</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;One option you could take advantage of is System Restore to go back a few days before the problem began.&nbsp; To run System Restore, click Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; System Restore. Click the box that says
<i>Show more restore points</i>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

<p>There was a Xbox Live service alert affecting social features several days ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve that, make sure that when you sign in on <a href="https://www.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.xbox.com</a> you can see your profile, and see your friends, access your messages and send a test message to one of your friends, and have them reply to that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that works, follow the instructions of Njal the Blue, where you <a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
remove your account according to these instructions</a>. Then restart the console by holding the power button on the console for 10 seconds, etc, and after the console has restarted, follow the linked instructions above to add your account to the console again.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can try some of these in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot.</p>
<p>If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer.</p>
<p>Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>

 this is a pain because i never know how much battery i have left <br />
<br />
Any advice please.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>Check with System maker's&nbsp;Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and their forums<br />
(if any) for known issues. Some maker's have issued BIOS and other updates to help with battery<br />
problems.</p>

Other information that might help :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Power Options - Power Plans - Change plan Settings - check the Advanced<br />
Settings for drain and usage settings (this is how much to be used and not how much or how<br />
long to charge).</p>
<p>Actually what causes a lot of wear on a battery is draining it too low repeatedly. With today's<br />
systems over-charging is not an issue.<br />
<br />
Here are some tips to help and troubleshoot battery related issues.</p>
<p>Old battery? Unplug power to computer - remove battery and clean the contacts with a pencil<br />
eraser (do not use this if your battery has thin slots -&nbsp;just clean the knife edges that fit into<br />
them and be careful). Batteries do wear out if old, or it could be a problem with the computer.<br />
Check with the support of the system maker and many of them&nbsp;have on-line forums.<br />
<br />
Newer type Litium-Ion batteries usually last longer if you do not discharge them below 30%<br />
however on a laptop that will not extend their life that much. Best is to use A/C adapter<br />
whenever possible.<br />
<br />
I use the free version of BatteryBar to monitor my battery.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Surface Book freezes, display get corrupted</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 2-month Surface Book. About once a day, the machine simply crashes and get completely unresponsive. Only a power-button hard reset brings the device back to life. When this happens, the displays show complete rubbish on the screen:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have looked at the event viewer but have not noticed anything in particular related to errors that lead to the crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also reinstalled the OS to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate any tips on how to diagnose and correct this issue.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Security Auditing being turned off - By what&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billp3rd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Security Auditing being turned off - By what&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This has been driving me nuts. I've searched high and low for a solution but have found nothing. I
<em>did</em> find <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/691565/advanced-security-audit-policy-not-applying-to-win7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a>&nbsp;question which I thought held the solution through <strong>auditpol.exe</strong>. No dice.<br />
<br />
I can set my Windows Audit Policy using either <strong>secpol.msc</strong> or <strong>
gpedit.msc</strong>. The problem is that after a few minutes, they're being cleared (<em>all</em> getting set to "No Auditing"). From the event log, the only clue I get is:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; System audit policy was changed.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Subject:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Security ID: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SYSTEM<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Account Name: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MYCOMPUTERNAME$<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Account Domain: &nbsp; &nbsp; WORKGROUP<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Logon ID: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 0x3e7<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Audit Policy Change:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Category: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Account Logon<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Subcategory: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kerberos Authentication Service<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Subcategory GUID: &nbsp; {0cce9242-69ae-11d9-bed3-505054503030}<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Changes: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Success removed, Failure removed<br />
<br />
After the last of these, no further entries of any kind will be written to the Security Event Log.<br />
<br />
My system configuration:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; OS: Windows 7 Ultimate w/ SP1<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Processor: x64<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; RAM: 12 GB<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; NOT Domain-joined. In WORKGROUP (so, no Group Policy is being applied).<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Windows Firewall enabled<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials<br />
</p>

<p>Did you login with administrator account?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Security auditing allows you to track the effectiveness of your network defenses and identify attempts to circumvent them. There are a number of auditing enhancements in Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 that increase the level of detail in security
 auditing logs and simplify the deployment and management of auditing policies.</span></p>

            <p>You misunderstand my problem. I have no problem enabling auditing. It's that within a few minutes, something is turning it back off. To your response:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I have turned UAC off so it's not an issue.</p>
<p>2. The account I'm using is in the Administrators group.</p>
<p>3. I have tried logging on as Administrator and the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The commands I'm using to enable auditing of the items of interest are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>auditpol.exe /set /category:"Account Logon" /success:enable /failure:enable<br />
auditpol.exe /set /category:"Account Management" /success:enable /failure:enable<br />

            <p>Again, you apparently don't understand the issue. The thread you reference has nothing to do with my specific problem. I know how to enable and configure auditing and what auditing does (or should be doing). I've provided the specific commands I'm using
 to configure auditing and their output.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm happy to post elsewhere if you are uninterested or incapable of helping with my issue. If additional details are needed, I'm also happy to provide those.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>We have a similar problem with a domain computer which take policies.</p>
<p>The advanced auditing parameters are applied by GPO. But the Auditpol command give the same result. (No Auditing) for all parameters.
</p>
<p>We have no particular alert under eventvwr.</p>
<p>We have found this into winlogon.log</p>
<p>
</p><p>"La configuration des valeurs du Registre s’est terminée correctement.<br />
Les paramètres d’audit hérités sont désactivés. La configuration des paramètres d’audit hérités sera ignorée.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;La configuration de l’audit/du journal s’est terminée correctement."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you received any details for your issue ?</p>

    <title>No Audio Using Realtek HD in Vista Home Basic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lisa_vista  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Audio Using Realtek HD in Vista Home Basic</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am so hoping someone can help me as I have been trying to find a resolution for this for over 6 months now :(</p>
<p>I am running a Dell Inspiron 530 with Vista Home Basic, SP1 &amp; SP2 installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; All security updates&nbsp;also&nbsp;installed&nbsp;and several months ago I suddenly lost all of my sound.</p>
<p>I have updated my drivers from the manufactures website (Dell &amp; Realtek), uninstalled them, reinstalled them.....everything.....and I still get no sound.&nbsp; I am using the dell speakers that came with my computer and they plug into the back of the tower using
 a green speaker jack.</p>
<p>When I unplug the speakers,&nbsp;I can get my&nbsp;email to ding and notify me that I have received mail but when I plug them back in, I get nothing,&nbsp; I know the speakers work because I&nbsp; plugged them into another computer and they play beautifully.</p>
<p>I posted in another forum (VistaHeads) and&nbsp;no one has been willing to reply and offer any kind of advice so I am hoping that maybe someone on here&nbsp;has encountered or heard of this issue and may have something that could help.</p>
<p>It seems that there is a conflict somewhere and I am not a complete dufus when it comes to computers but I cannot seem to find a solution that will work for me.&nbsp; I have looked in&nbsp;Control Panel/Sound and all seems well, Device&nbsp;Manager says all is well,&nbsp;when
 testing&nbsp;the sound the speakers look like they are working but no sound is playing.&nbsp; I even&nbsp;used Microsoft's Fixit and it says everything is working.</p>
<p>I think the Microsoft update in May 2008 may be the culprit - This is what I found so far - Microsoft pushed out a new IDT audio driver via Windows Update. IDT is the company that bought SigmaTel, which makes a lot of the audio chips used on motherboard-based
 PC sound solutions. So if you have a SigmaTel audio system, that IDT driver should have been for you.</p>
<p>Except it didn’t work. On the one and only system where I installed that update here, it wiped out my audio completely. And a lot of Dell customers had the same experience, based on the uproar in the Dell Community message boards.</p>
<p>Please view and give me&nbsp;somewhere to start because I&nbsp;cannot afford to buy a new computer and&nbsp;I use it&nbsp;for my job so I have to get it working.</p>
<p>THANKS&nbsp;in advance and BLESSINGS!&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for looking that link up!&nbsp; I actualy came across that same link in my searches and tried the suggestions there and none of them worked either.&nbsp;&nbsp; The question I now have is this - The most current driver that is recommended for Realtek, does it now
 require speakers that are "powered"?&nbsp; I am using the same old sepakers that came with my original Dell computer that was purchased sometime in 02 or 03 and I wonder if Microsoft and Realtek have advanced the drivers and the old speakers do not have enough
 power to play the sound now.&nbsp; I am going to buy some new ones and see how they do and will post when I find outl.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>THANKS!</p>

            did anyone figure this out. I'm having the same problem. Windows Vista Home Basic, Realtek HD Audio and Dell Inspiron. Everything says sound is enabled but I get nothing out of my speakers.

<h2>            Counter-Strike&#58; Global Offensive</h2>
                    
<p>I very much look forward to this games release having fallen in love with CS Source years ago. Here's some info and vids for you.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Counter-Strike: Global Offensive features new maps, characters, and weapons as well as new gameplay modes, matchmaking, leader boards, and more.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>"Counter-Strike took the gaming industry by surprise when the unlikely MOD became the most played online PC action game in the world almost immediately after its release in August 1999," said Doug Lombardi, VP of Marketing at Valve.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>"For the past 12 years, it has continued to be one of the most-played games in the world, headline competitive gaming tournaments and selling over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. CS: GO promises to expand on CS' award-winning gameplay and
 deliver it to gamers on the PC as well as the next gen consoles and the Mac."</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Footage is mostly from the PC beta, some from the 360.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>So, any of you going to get it? price wise from 1200msp is the best bet me thinks.</p>

<p>Won't get it for Xbox, but i'm sure i'll get it for PC. &nbsp;I started playing CS:S, just over a year ago, great fun. &nbsp;I've been watching a fair bit of gameplay from the PC beta.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've also been reading about it, alot of PC players, especially CS1.6 players seem to be complaining about it. &nbsp;But i think this is always going to happen when people get attached to a old game and the new version offers something different. &nbsp;Here's some gun

<p>They are constantly getting feedback and making improvements and testing different things with the PC beta. &nbsp;I guess the release won't be till they're are happy with the improvements made so that players are content with a final product.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bare in mind, that the PC version, they can update whenever they want because it will be done through Steam, but the Xbox version, &nbsp;patches and stuff take a while to be processed. &nbsp;(For example i think DICE recently did a massive patch for BF3, and i read that
 they decided to delay the PC patches because of certifcation of the patch for consoles)</p>

            You should install new Skype v8. Windows 10 stock Skype is a basic client whereas new Skype is quite better with a lot of extra features.

            Skype for Windows 10, version 12 is not as recent as version 8.30. Try installing that version to see if it works.

<h2>            Skype - where&#39;s my mother gone&#63;</h2>
                    With the previous version, I could see that my 90 year old mother was booting up her laptop because she appeared as online on Skype as soon as she did so. Now I see nothing, and have no idea if she is ok. Even though she was online yesterday her Skype
 contact details just say 'Gallery' under her name. How do I get this vital information back? Thank you

            As a work-around, You can download Classic Skype and use that. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a> 
<br />
<br />Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.

<br />
<br />The new Skype app it is being updated constantly to bring it up to the functionality of Skype 7 . . . 
<br />
<br />In order to improve Skype, please provide feedback to Microsoft regarding any shortcomings or bugs you have found in the new Skype app on this thread

<h2>            Unofficial Game Room Thread&#47;Forum June 2011</h2>
                    
<p>Right, had enough of this...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since there is STILL no Game Room Forum as off right now and no Official Word if there ever will be one again or on the Future (if any) of Game Room on Xbox 360.. (I have emailed Support Twice and been given no straight answer!)</p>
<p>Then bugger it, lets at least have our own thread for Fans of Game Room and for the many people who paid over £200 for a full Arcade of 96 Titles and have been left out in the cold, ignored and treated very badly...What we want are the ongoing Issues regarding
 freezing and crashing sorted..I realise that this Project is more than likely dead in the water but it had so much potential..mostly unrealized and..its just sad as its such a waste of a great idea for Retro Gaming..this could have been massive and from my
 Retro Gaming point of view is a far far better than Kinect ever was (If I wanted a WIII id have purchased one previously!)</p>
<p>We have been treated badly and unjustly regarding Game Room people..I was so excited at the Project launch, been gaming since 1978 (im 43)&nbsp; and owned most consoles that came out since that period including a Grandstand System,&nbsp; Atari 2600 VCS, C64, ZX Spectrum,
 Master System, NES,&nbsp; Megadrive, 32X, MegaCd, Sega Saturn, Dreamcast, N64,&nbsp; PS1 and PS2 and was so happy to have so many fond games from my Youth on my favourite Console yet somehow..its come to this? My Fav game completely ignored and disregarded cause its
 not an 'A - List title'? and appeals to&nbsp; a niche Market of mainly older Gamers? We spent a load of hard earned cash on this Application&nbsp; to receive very little support and have opinions and suggestions to better the product ignored..no games for over 6 months
 and to top it all, a patch came out last November that made Game Room almost unplayable for many people (including myself) with pretty much constant freezsr and Crashes, with mine the crashes required switching of the Xbox 360 every time (possibly damaging
 the Fan/Harddrive in the process...)</p>
<p>Far from good enough Microsoft...</p>
<p>I realise that apart from the people who downloaded this and bought the Game Packs its obvious no one in control/Charge is the least bit bothered but I sure am..we have tried almost everything to get Microsoft to address these ongoing Issues, including outside
 agencies and Game Sites..with no redress we have no where else to turn..</p>
<p>Please feel free to post your opinions relating to Game Room here..Thank you and my best to all the ex Game Room players and&nbsp; former Forum members...</p>
<p>To Microsoft, Krome is no longer so can you please put a Forum up for us for 'Game Room' please? Your support answers have not provided any answers to help us in this situation, a ta loss what to do next..</p>

<p>May i ask you a genuine question and i mean no disrespect when i ask this - Why did you continue to plough money into something when it was obvious MS couldn't care less? &nbsp;Surely you have to shoulder some of the responsibility and accept £200 is an obscene
 amount of money to pay out on a half arsed project and when you know your concerns are falling on deaf ears?</p>

<p>Hiya Darth....</p>
<p>Before the patch that caused the crashes/ freezes Game Room worked just fine, both on and offline..I had always dreamed of having my old Aracde (my seaside Scottish town here in Fife had 4 local arcades theat me and my pals visit ona regular basis, they
 were all within easy walking distance, I saw Games room as an opportunity to be able to do this, albeirt in digital Form..I bough most of mt Games before the patch came out that caused all the problems...I also thoguh Repeated complaints to Microsoft would
 work eventually and that they would repair Game Room and id still have an Arcade with 96 Retro Games that all worked and i didnt have too much problem paying £200 for that...I did and still do really enjoy playing game room with over seven and half days worth
 of play clocked up on it</p>
<p>What annoys me most wasnt the cost, its the principle, myself and many others now have essentially a non woprking product..that wasnt the case when I first downloaded Game Room.I thought it was fantastic!!! Also, compared to the price of the Virtual Consoles
 Retro Arcade Titles I didnt see it as too bad a deal for the Arcade Games (although the Intellivision and a portion of the Atari 2600 Games being 240 MSP was somewhat Questionable!) The whole project had &nbsp;great potential to bring games out from other much
 loved Consoles, we were promised new Games every Wednesday and over 1000 Titles..This obviously hasn't happened.I still try to play my Game Room often but most of the time it just Hard Crashes, although I do get better results and less crashes if I play offline
 but then you loose all the cool features such as the Global Leaderboards, Challenges with friends etc...</p>
<p>I am still of the opinion that it was a great idea with massive potential let down by **** poor support and a complete lack of big name developers..Had we had Namco, Nitsibuschi, Taito,Capcom,Irem, Data East and Sega onboard it would not have collapsed after
 only 9 months (well that and Kromes unfortunate demise so guess its cicumstances too)</p>
<p>Such a shame and it could have been handled and supported just so much better and much more &nbsp;professionally...Many of u thought that thew Windows Phone version of GR was being worked on and after that we would get our fix for 360 Game Room but sadly that
 hasn't happened..strangely the Face Book Page for Game Room is still up although our Forum has gone! lol..dont think anyone could have predicted that we would be let down and pushed aside this badly mate...</p>
<p>Kind Regards...</p>

<p>That's why i asked a question rather than make it an all out statement, as i wasn't sure if most of these issues had been around since its launch or not. &nbsp;Funnily enough, i just d/l it myself yesterday. &nbsp;Yet to purchase anything, so in that respect, thanks
 for the prior warning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where about in Fife do you stay, mate? &nbsp;I look out onto Fife (Musselburgh Harbour).&nbsp; I was always down at Portobello arcades as a child so i kind of grew up doing the same things.</p>

<p>Hi Darth, </p>
<p>Im in Leven mate, small town inbetween Kirkcaldy and St.Andrews on the East Coast, cheers for the reply and i have been to Portobello in the past, in the days when you could still foind an Amusement Arcade and a Pinball machine back in the early 1990's!
 Lol...I wish you all the best with Game Room, not everyone has the same problems with it..some only have freezes, some have crashes, some have both an some aren't too effected! lol. its very starnge..it does work better for me offline I find,</p>
<p>There are some great games through it..loads of good Konami Arcade titles like Time Pilot, Jackal, Scramble, Super Cobra, Jailbreak and many others..some excellent Atari Arcade Titles too, like Crsytal Castles, Centipede, Asteroids, Tempest, Battlezone and
 the like...im not keen on the controls on the Intellivision but there are also many great Atari 2600 VCS Titles that I remember having great fun with and playing back in the day...Pitfall 1+2, Enduro,Missile Command,Megamania,Chopper Command,Yars Revenge..plenty
 of good stuff there...</p>
<p>Its just too bad that they didnt have more licenses and publishers..would have loved to have seen my old favourites 'Gorf', 'Tron' and Mr.Do' on there</p>
<p>We had a really good community on the old Forum, many of them with good and valid opinions and always ready to help, it would be a shame to lose it...</p>
<p>All the best....</p>

<p>i would have loved for game room to achieve what it was said to. if we could have seen a wider variety of consoles on there, it could take a better foothold than the virtual console does. and also its a much better way to beat piracy with roms and emulators,
 having the option to buy the games on my xbox is a far better option in my opinion!</p>

<p>What would have perhaps sparked interest was if you could have launched your XBLA titles from inside Game Room as well, with a nice little cabinet for them.</p>

<p>I agree with everything you posted, RAB1968, &nbsp;I had a great time playing and collecting classic titles in Game Room but like you said, that last patch destroyed it almost completely. It really does seem like an unworkable product now and I find it ironic
 that they are still selling games and allowing people to download the GR shell with it's current state of being.. I remember how little information we would get in regards to patching it correctly, game releases, etc. At least Virtual Console still works and
 has a tremendous back catalogue to choose from.</p>

<p>im new to this, and i signed in just to comment on this forum, so im not sure how the community has worked so far so forgive me if im missing something already confirmed. but ive been through this with a different product, the forums close, the support stopped
 and for anyone with the product and a windows 64 system the product became unusable. it sounds like something similar is happening with game room. a year later than that products website has been closed, and its safe to assume its discontinued. now i got some
 game room apps on my windows phone 7 less than a month ago, so the product is still receiving activity, but the original for xbox seems to have fallen off microsofts promise, should i be assuming game room is cancelled? its a shame because only people like
 us who believe the vision of somethings full potential and actively support a project since its conception get left in the dark.</p>

<p>That's a good question, Flumpy, i'm not sure about the Game Room app for Windows Phone 7 but if i'm not mistaken, the developer Chrome is no longer a viable company. My guess is that it won't be long before that version falls to the wayside but hopefully
 not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have alot of games for my GR and i'm dissapointed that everytime I load it up it invariably crashes on me. Not only does it crash but I am forced to do a cold reboot to my 360. I miss my Game Room.

<p>i love my xbox, but it makes me sad when microsoft do this kind of half arsed promises. first with backwards compatabilty with orig xbox games, theres still MANY i want to be able to play on my 360. and now game room. in my eyes, for the 360 to be this mega
 multi media device in everyones rooms, retro gaming is a huge part of that. people being able to just use their 360, rather than having an old xbox, and countless other consoles lying around!</p>

<div>So I am really confused on what I have to do. I keep on getting the 4013 error on my dns server and I do not know how to resolve it. I found the resolution of creating:</div>

<div><span>however I keep reading that it is only a temporary solution. Is there a definite solution where one can dumb down for me so I can follow? If possible thanks!&nbsp;</span></div>

                    <p>I bought a Surface Pro 4 for my wife in October of 2016.&nbsp; Monday, while she was playing the pre-installed solitaire game, the device froze.&nbsp; Screen, keyboard, and power button were all non-responsive.&nbsp; &nbsp;I verified this state.&nbsp; She had not dropped the device.&nbsp;
 Was laying on the couch with the device held in her hands so not even the exhaust vents were covered.&nbsp; No messages or error notices appeared on the screen.&nbsp; There were no blinking indicators (not that this device has any to blink other than the light on the
 power cord but it was steady too).&nbsp; In order to regain control of the device, I pressed and held the power button for about 30 seconds and the device went dark.&nbsp; It has not be on again since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the restart methods I could find on the internet and these forums:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Power button for 2 minutes, then power + vol up for 15 seconds - no response</li><li>Remove all peripherals and retry - no response</li><li>Remove all peripherals and typecover, vol up and vol down 3 times in 2 seconds - no response</li><li>Drain power, charge for 30 minutes, attempt start - no response</li><li>Win + P, home, enter - no response</li><li>Tried connecting a separate monitor using mini-DSP port, then Win+P, Home, down arrow, Enter - no response, second monitor went to sleep.</li><li>Win + Ctrl+Shift+B - no response</li><li>Repetitively pressing power button every 10 seconds for a couple of minutes - no response</li></ul>
<p>What I do have:&nbsp; When I say no response above, I mean the screen has no activity and the device makes no sounds.&nbsp; However, the back-lighting for the keyboard will come on.&nbsp; Further, the indicator light for the Fn key will illuminate.&nbsp; This is how I knew
 the battery was drained, i.e. I couldn't get the keyboard to illuminate.&nbsp; This makes me think it's TRYING to work.&nbsp; This is the difference I have compared to all the other information I've found doing research on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I post hoping someone or Microsoft has a suggestion that hasn't been tried here (I haven't yet put it in the refrigerator for 30 minutes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any assistance and for putting up with yet another post on this tired subject.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're sorry to hear this experience.&nbsp; You practically have done a lot of research on what to do to troubleshoot the issue you're having with your Surface device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is just one bit of clarification or step which we would like you to try to do.&nbsp; Can you plug in the power (PSU) and press the power button and see if the device would turn on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can also try to re-initialize the display driver which may be able to show a display on your screen.&nbsp; To do this, simply
<span><span><span><span><strong>Press CTRL + Shift + Windows + B</strong>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>If both steps won't work, then there is a possibility the device needs to be replaced.&nbsp; To process a replacement, you may contact our Microsoft Support via this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> or you may also go to the nearest Microsoft Store.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>You may try to check the <strong>Startup</strong> tab on your Task Manger to see if there's any software or program that is causing this issue. You can also run a full scan using
<strong>Windows Defender</strong> just to make sure that your device is safe. Lastly, we suggest that you also try to run
<strong>Window app troubleshooter</strong> as well. You can check it from our support site on this

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, DirectX 11 is compatible with most games that run on Windows 7 and DirectX 12 is the latest version of it. We would suggest running the compatibility troubleshooter by following the steps on this link
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15078/windows-make-older-programs-compatible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</a> to possibly resolve your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also advise making sure that your drivers are up to date to avoid any other issues. You can check this link

<h2>            strange files in C&#58;&#92;Windows&#92;System32</h2>
                    
<p>I use Vista Home premium 32 bit with Vista SP2<br />
<br />
I noticed these files in C:\Windows\System32<br />
<br />
jupdate-1.6.0_13-b03 <br />
<br />
jupdate-1.6.0_15-b03<br />
<br />
and a few other older ones.<br />
The are text documents and apparently belong to previous versions of JAVA</p>
<p>Only strange thing is that I have<strong> java 6 Update 23 installed</strong>, yet there is no entry for that.<br />
I also had updated several versions of java Update 16-22, yet nothing appears on them<br />
Makes me wonder if java 6 update 23 is installed ( it is saying so in programs and verified at the java verification page)<br />
<br />
Anyone know why there would just be like 3 or 4 of these entries, none newer than 1.6.0_15 ?</p>
<p>Do others see this too (including nothing newer for Java 6 update 23)?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Those are update logs - note the extension .log - sometimes created when Java is updated.<br />
<br />
You can read them in Notepad or Wordpad.<br />
<br />
Also they can be deleted without issue (only those such as jupdate-1.6.0_21-b07.log as an example).<br />
<br />
On my system, which also has 6.23, there are only 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 20, and 21 with nothing in<br />
any of the logs to indicate why they were made as there are no errors.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and Happy Holidays!<br />
