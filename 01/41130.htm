                    <p>I have new HP 15 series notebook with Windows 8.1.&nbsp; The Disk Cleanup dialog box does not appear, only Administrative files in the folder.&nbsp; It also automatically cleans up so I can't check what is being cleaned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, what is safe to delete other than thumbnails and recycle bin?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, technically it's all safe to delete.&nbsp; By safe I mean, "will not cause any harm".&nbsp; But that doesn't mean it's actually beneficial to delete.&nbsp;
<span>Here's why:&nbsp; your computer caches information it needs (makes&nbsp;a temporary copy).&nbsp; When you use a cleaner, you delete that cache (the temp files) and it has to rebuilt them all again from scratch
 -- which is slow (that's why it tried to cache them so it didn't have to build them!), and causes your computer to get slower and slower every time you "clean" it.&nbsp; Consider your temporary internet files.&nbsp; Those speed up your Internet use (that's why they
 exist).&nbsp; If you delete them, all that data has to be downloaded again, which slows down your internet access and your computer while it rebuilds.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also consider that some of this data is for diagnostic purposes.&nbsp; Such as the "problem reports" in the list.&nbsp; If you delete them, then your computer will no longer be able to check for solutions
 to those problems, which means that if a solution comes available someday for a problem, you won't get the update.&nbsp; Of course you can go check yourself for updates, but it's nice for the computer to be able to help you out by checking for new solutions and
 performance improvements.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So my recommendation is to only use the clean up tool if you are concerned about retrieving more space on your hard drive at all costs, giving up the benefits of the caches.</span></p>

<h2>            Mail Attachments not visible in the Windows 10 Mail program</h2>
                    I upgraded my laptop to Windows 10.&nbsp; When I receive e-mails in the Mail app from one individual, &nbsp;I cannot see that I have attachments.&nbsp; On my other machine running 8.1, the same emails show the attachments.&nbsp; I sent myself an email from 8.1 mail and I
 did see the attachment in the Windows 10 mail program.&nbsp; The emails from another user did not show in 10 but did in 8.1.&nbsp; Any help will be appreciated.

<p>On the contrary, the problem is most probably with the sender. </p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>... sending email is from exchange server. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a message is sent from Exchange Server (or Office Outlook) using their proprietary RTF format, the recipient will have to have special software to be able to decode any attachments. That software is included with Office Outlook (and Exchange Client) but
 no other mail client that I know of. Some webmail services are also able to decode that kind of attachment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you sign in to the account at <a href="http://mail.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Outlook.com">
mail.live.com</a>, you can right-click on a message with an attachment that doesn't appear in the mail client and select
<em>View message source</em>. Scroll down to the bottom of the text file, then scroll back up to the last blank line in the message. That's where you'll most probably see the start of a MIME part whose
<em>C</em><em>ontent-Type</em> is given as <strong>application/vnd.ms-tnef&nbsp;or similar. The important bit is
</strong><em>TNEF</em>, the encoding method used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the possibility, you should instruct the sender only to use RTF when sending to correspondents known to be using Office Outlook. You'll find an explanation and instructions in this article:

<p>The fact that attachments to some messages sent from Outlook/Exchange are invisible to other mail clients has been a problem for users for at least 15 years. If you had a look at the message source as I suggested, you'd probably have evidence to support
 the idea that these attachments are TNEF-encapsulated.&nbsp;Anyone working at Microsoft will be using Outlook for email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By pointing the finger at a well-known long-standing culprit, I'm by no means ruling out other failings with the W10 Mail app.</p>

<h2>            When I print an airline itinerary from an email in Windows Live Mail the printed itenerary is much harder to read. How car I increase the printed size&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use Windows Live Mail and just tried to print an airline itinerary. The printed copy of the itinary itself seems about 1/3 the size of the print in the email message itself. Is there a way to ensure I print the same size as I see in the message?</p>

<p>The Subject, Date, From and To lines are all printed much larger than the detailed itinerary.</p>

            <div>Hello,</div>
<div><br />
Thank you for the information that you've provided. By design, the fonts cannot be changed within the Subject, Date, From and To lines when printing. Since this only happens within your airline records/route, as a workaround, we would like to verify if the
 same issue happens when you print the document when using the web. If there are changes and will be more preferable in your end, we advice that you use this method instead.
<div><br />
<div>In case you want to add the feature of changing fonts when printing within Windows Live Mail, please create a separate thread within the link below. Information provided within the link will be reviewed as future reference:</div>

            thanks Cesar.&nbsp; After going to other web sites and printing, some work well and others do not.&nbsp; What I mean to say is that some will print full size, as you see them displayed on your monitor, while others are much smaller.&nbsp; For whatever reason, this is
 a common occurance on all airline sites.&nbsp; Would it help if you went to an airline site and attempt to print out an itinerary to see what I'm talking about?&nbsp; (You wouldn't have to purchase a ticket of course!&nbsp; Just look up a flight from point A to point B and
 try to print it)

            Hi Mark,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for getting back to us.</div>

<div>Like what&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/b09548f5-75eb-4ca7-ac9c-3ab0971ac85a">Cesar_E.</a>&nbsp;said, what you see in the Print Preview in Windows
 Live Mail will basically will be the product when you print it.</div>
<div><br />
For a workaround, you can copy an airline itinerary to Microsoft Office Word document and from there, you edit it and then print it the way you like it to be.</div>

    <title>cannot move files or folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> walter.bishop  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot move files or folders</h2>
                    This is an issue that is very similar to an issue <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-files/i-cannot-move-files-from-folder-to-folder-in/e4f5710e-c807-4ba7-ac7d-9fcf9cad76e4">
posted on October 2009 </a>. The issue remains unresolved over three years later. Windows XP MCE SP3. Cannot move files or folders. Files and folders become inaccessible and corrupt after moving. Error messages vary when attempting to open a moved file. For
 example a self-extracting exe file will produce the error message with the file name in the top of the error box "Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."&nbsp; A notepad file will
 simply produce an "Access is denied" error upon attempting to open. <br />
<br />
I am unable to move the files again after they have been moved once. Once the file has been moved (and assuming&nbsp; corrupted) any further attempts to move the corrupt file receive this message: "Error Moving File Or Folder: Cannot Move Filename: Access is Denied.
 Make sure the disk is not full or write protected and that the file is not currently in use." Unlike the issue posted in October 2009 I am able to delete the newly moved files however I originally did share the same issue. My inability to delete the newly
 moved files was only resolved after installing "unlocker" software. <br />
<br />
I have run every virus scan, malware scan, and spyware scan available.&nbsp; Issue occurs across all files on the hard-drive regardless of their location. As this issue has been ongoing for several years, System Restore is not an option.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Creating a new windows user account identifies additional issues. While a newly created (administrator) user account does not have the above issues with moving files, other issues do arise. For example, a number of folders and files are no longer accessible.
 Folders which are regularly accessed by the main account display the error "Access is denied" when they are attempted to be accessed by the newly created account.
<br />
<br />
Microsoft you were made aware of this issue several years ago. Your response was "use system restore." Many responded to your useless suggestion and still that's the best you could come up with?&nbsp; Instead of spending so much time developing new operating systems
 how about dedicating a little time to maintenance and support for the only microsoft operating system that is worth using. You can upgrade windows as many times as you want but we're sticking with XP. I'd rather be unable to move files and risk losing my data
 than have to use something as awful as Windows 8, 7, or Vista. <br />

            <p>1. you should delete files in safe mode</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. in the newly created account you may not have transfered the data from the old account properly to work in the new account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. have you checked your permissions for the file you want to move or delete?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. if something is in use you cannot move or delete, which is why it would be good to use safe mode as the minimal is loaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. if your scans have not found anything, and the issue has persisted for an extended period, you may have an infection that is too deeply embedded to find. There are some malware removal sites I can direct you to if you like.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. as a last resort you can reinstall your os and start fresh.</p>

<h2>            Print spooler service keeps stopping. Errors 7071 and 7074 in Event viewer.</h2>
                    <p>This is Windows XP Pro SP3.</p>
<p>A virus bit my computer. I was able to remove it, but since then I've had print spooler problems. I noticed I couldn't print. Going into Printers and Faxes showed all my printers were gone. Clicking 'Add a printer' gives the error 'Operation could not be
 completed. The print spooler service is not running.'</p>
<p>I can manually start the Print Spooler from the Services program (yes, it is set to automatic) and the spooler appears to stay running until I click on Printers and Faxes, then typically error 7074 pops up in the event viewer, and I find the service has
 stopped again.</p>
<p><br />
I've tried everything&nbsp;suggested when searching for print spooler errors: cleanspl, sfc /scannow, several registery suggestions removing monitors and drivers. Nothing has helped, the spooler simply will not contiue to run if I open Printers and Faxes to try
 to install a printer.</p>
<p>I finally tried running Malwarebyes and Spybot as I noticed somebody else having issues after an infection, it seemed to help them, but not me. Please help me get my printer back.</p>

<h2>            Error code 8000FFFF when installing service pack 1 to Vista</h2>
                    Hi, I downloaded service pack 1 for Vista 2 days ago. It worked but I ended up with no sound. Nothing fixed it so I uninstalled the service pack thinking it would fix the problem. I still have no sound, and now when I try and install service pack 1 again
 I continually end up with an error code 8000FFFF and it won't install and I still have no sound. How can I fix my sound problems and add the service pack? (I don't really care about the service pack, just really want my sound back!)

<h2>            my laptop fan which I think is affecting game play, PLEASE HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a red Lenovo laptop with an i5 processor. When running any game, as expected the temperature increases. However I have never noticed my fan turning on, or running above very low performance. On my old laptop I could feel air being pushed
 out of the vents, this I feel nothing. This means my laptop gets very hot, and I have to stop playing games. I would like to know if this is a software problem (i.e. windows 10) or hardware, or if there is any easy fix in windows settings. Thanks :-)</p>

<p>Hi Jude,</p>
<p>
</p><p>BIOS error is one of the possible reasons why your laptop's fan is not working properly. We'd like to ask a few questions for us to better assist you:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you install any Windows Update prior to the issue? Or did it occur from the start of the purchase?<br />
</li><li>Is it only happening when you're playing games or others?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can check the settings of your device. Open<strong> Control Panel</strong> &gt;
<strong>Hardware and Sound</strong> &gt; <strong>Power Options</strong> &gt;<strong> Advanced Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Processor power management</strong> &gt; <strong>System cooling policy</strong>. For
<strong>Plugged in</strong>, changed it to <strong>Passive</strong>, and then to <strong>
Active </strong>again. Select <strong>Apply</strong>. Check if there's any changes on your fan.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, we suggest that you contact the device manufacturer to get additional troubleshooting steps regarding the BIOS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Should you have any other concern, don't hesitate to post back.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

 The device is defective in some manner.</p>

                    I recently purchased a new laptop with Windows 7 Pro 64-bit. My native screen resolution is 1920 x 1080.&nbsp; Unfortunately EVERYTHING in ALL programs is so small and so hard to read.&nbsp; I have attempted to adjust the resolution, but it doesn't help matters
 at all.&nbsp; I have adjusted the DPI in the "Make Text &amp; Display Larger" to 150% and the only effect that has is increasing the size of the text in desktop shortcuts.&nbsp; However, all other text is very difficult to read and ridiculously small.&nbsp; I have been forced
 to use the Zoom feature to 200% in every tab of Inter Explorer, FireFox, &amp; Chrome. I have adjusted default text sizes in all my web browsers &amp; word processing programs to 24 pt, but this is NOT a permanent solution and it's a very annoying work around.&nbsp; All
 the icons on toolbars within programs like web browsers are very tiny too (even if I zoom).&nbsp; I have another laptop virtually identical to my new one that runs XP and I have none of these issues.&nbsp; I'm not sure if this is relevant to a solution, but the problem
 even affects the virtual desktop in XP-Mode too.<br />
<br />
Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

<br />
I strongly recommend that you keep your monitor set to its default <br />
resolution.<br />
<br />
Instead of changing the resolution, change the size of text within <br />
your applications. If you're not aware of it, a Windows standard is to <br />
hold down the Windows key and scroll your mouse wheel. One way makes <br />
everything bigger, the other smaller. That's quick and easy to do, and <br />
it work in almost all applications.<br />

<h2>            Flight Simulator X with Acceleration will not install &#40;error message&#41; on 3 different Windows 10 computers. Suggestions please&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have used FSX on a computer which was then running Windows 7 also using X52 flight control system, no problems. Lost all when upgrade to Windows 10 came along. Some message boards claim it should install but after a lengthy "apparent" installation I get
 an error message and the program will not run. (Do not remember it, but was told to check on it but that only got me the support page with no reference to FSX.)</p>
<p>Is it possible to install FSX to run on the latest update of Windows 10?</p>

    <title>Desktop files disappearing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> munchichic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop files disappearing</h2>
                    Hi Everyone. I'm using Windows Vista Home Premium SP1. For the past month or so I've been having this problem and I don't know what's causing it. I have several files on my desktop such as Word, Excel (Office 2003) and PDF files. Sometimes I open them
 directly from the desktop while other times I'll go to Start-Documents to open them. On occasion the file that is located on the desktop literally disappears from view. I have to go into My Documents (or another folder) to bring up the explorer window where
 I can then search my desktop and find the file listed there. If I delete the file from the desktop, move it to another location and then paste it back on the desktop directly it comes back. I do not understand why these files are disappearing from view on
 my desktop while the windows explorer clearly shows that it's still there. This has become increasingly frustrating and it's very annoying!<br />
<br />
Also, some of these files are changing appearances. For example, I have a calendar template that I use that is a Word file on my desktop. Sometimes the image of the icon will be the standard Word image, other times it appears as a preview of the actual calendar.
 This issue is also related to my desktop only and seems to be related to my overall desktop problem. Can anyone explain these phenomenons? Please help! Thank you!

            Hi munchichic,<br />
<br />
<p><span>One possible</span><span> fix is to Right-click on the desktop
 and choose Properties.<br />
In the Display Properties dialog box, click the Appearance tab.<br />
From the Item drop-down list, choose Icon. Click the up arrow in<br />
the Size box to increase it by one pixel then click the down arrow in the<br />
Size box to return the icons to their previous dimensions. This<br />
activates the "Apply" button. Click Apply, then OK.<br />
<br />
For a permanent fix, You can increase the size of the cache with the<br />
following registry patch. Create a new text file called IconCache.txt<br />
Select the below text beginning with the 'R' in REGEDIT4 and<br />
and include the blank line. Copy it to the clipboard, and paste it into the<br />
text file. Rename the file to "IconCache.reg" and then double click it to<br />
modify the registry.<br />
<br />
Let us know!</span></p>

            Hi Dave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for your support. Despite setting it up, I didn't get an email notification on your response so that explains my delay. When I right click on the desktop I'm brought to the "Personalize appearance and sounds" window. I did go into the advanced settings
 area to adjust the icon size (I also tried the icon horizontal and vertical settings) by following what you said. This didn't do anything for me however. The screen temporarily dimmed to indicate something was happening, but nothing actually changed.<br />
<br />
On the other permanent fix idea I created a notepad file, saved it as IconCache.txt and put it on my desktop. I then copied the text "REGEDIT4", added a line after it and saved it to the file. I then went to my desktop file and renamed it "IconCache.reg" and
 double clicked it to open it. Nothing seems to have happened. Did I do this right? How would I know? Thanks for your help!

            Hi Dave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know why I'm not getting the emails when there's a response but at least I check this page often. People make mistakes so no big deal about the line you forgot. ;) Ok, so I followed those instructions and copied all but the "-----End copy". Am I
 supposed to notice something when I open the file after saving it under the different name? Also, is there supposed to be that space between the word "Current"? I'm not noticing anything and my Word calendar is still showing as the Word icon rather than the
 preview image. I actually prefer the preview. And sure enough, just as I checked it right at this second the Word calendar file is missing again from the desktop. I now notice that if I have the file open and look back on my desktop the space it occupies is
 replaced with a Word temp file. Once I exit the file it disappears yet again from desktop. What am I doing wrong? Thanks again for all of your help. I'm sorry this is becoming so difficult!<br />

            Thanks for the response however I still have the problem. I've already made sure that the Auto Arrange option was not enabled so I know that's not the problem. My desktop does have more folders on it than I'd like but it's never had this problem before.
 Funny thing is, this is ONLY happening with specific Word, Excel or PDF files on my desktop. The link you provided does not indicate that the issue is relevant to Vista but even if it was I'm not using the Auto Arrange option and adjusting my icon spacings
 haven't produced any results. This only just started to occur at the same time that my Word calendar file on my desktop has changed it's appearance. First it would show a thumbnail image of the first page in the calendar; now it shows the default Word icon.
 I'm not sure if these issues are related but they have never been an issue previously and both occurred at the same time several weeks ago. Thanks for trying to help, but I'm still having these issues.

<p><span>Hello munchichic,</span></p>
<p><span>I was reading through this thread and wanted to ask a couple of questions.<span>&nbsp;
</span>About the time your calendar changed and this problem started did you download and install any new toolbars or desktop gadgets like Google Desktop?<span>&nbsp;
</span>Are you running a antivirus/security software package that could have updated itself that tries to control things like changes to the desktop?<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you could let us know it would help narrow down the possibilities of what is going on with your machine.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

 it set up to do automatic updates; I only run them manually and do so about every week. I'm sure I would have unchecked any option to control the desktop for that though. I know a bit about computers and know I would not have allowed any program such access
 to change things like that. I'm still baffled by this problem however because of how annoying this problem is. I'd be happy to hear any suggestions since at this point it looks like this is not a "typical" issue. Thanks again for the response! :)

            Hi munchichic<br />
<br />
Let's try doing a Clean Boot and see if any programs or drivers are conflicting and causing this<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. This article describes
 how to troubleshoot problems in Windows Vista by performing a clean boot. This article also describes how to start the Windows Installer service and how to reset the computer so that it starts as usual.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original behavior.<br />
<br />
Please Posts the results - thank you

            Hello again and thanks for the reply. I'm already using a selective start up so I know how the process works. I haven't had the time to do a clean boot and disable the non-Microsoft items one by one. That's just going to take a lot of time all at once
 and I haven't had that kind of time. I haven't even installed any new software or made any changes to any preferences or software options. The only "changes" I've made are updates to my Norton 360 and Windows Vista. Since I'm using a cable modem I'm really
 hesitant to disable Norton on start up unless I disconnect my modem first. I really don't see how an update to my antivirus software is the cause for this. It just doesn't make sense. Like I said, I don't have the time right now to disable everything to test
 that theory out right now, but I do appreciate the suggestion. Looks like my problem is not typical if we're resorting to this kind of suggestion though and that really makes me question what's going on. Thanks for the suggestion. When I hav

<h2>            Programs missing in Volume Mixer &#63;</h2>
                    Hey! So I have this problem as mention in the title for quite sometime now, any games or programs I download and start it up, there was no sound, I turn the audio/volume up in the program and still there was no sound, unchecked the mute button there was
 no sound. However, in my older installed games or on the browser, there is sound. I went to Volume Mixer to see if I can turn the volume up but there was nothing there other than my browser, I had my browser and two more games open but only the browser was
 found in the Volume Mixer. I don't know if the problem is related to this but I have another problem where all of my musics and videos open with Windows Media Player was considered corrupted but it was not the problem when I took the video or music to my friend's
 house to watch it. Can anybody help me ?

Hey, so I didn't think you get what I mean :O<br />
See this picture:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.steampowered.com/attachment_tickets.php?do=imgpopup&amp;id=3235820" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.steampowered.com/attachment_tickets.php?do=imgpopup&amp;id=3235820</a><br />
This is another question I post on Steam, I thought I'd do the same there too. As you can see in the picture, I had a game on the taskbar, a mask with the flag of USA. In the picture too, you can see my Volume Mixer, I didn't have the game in Volume Mixer despite
 having the game up. You can read what I wrote there too :)<br />

I thought I'd show you the link of post on Steam:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.steampowered.com/view.php?ticketref=4321-IOSF-4584" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.steampowered.com/view.php?ticketref=4321-IOSF-4584</a>

            The game is installed on my computer, it's not just this game, almost all my games.<br />
Just to let you know also, all video clips and audio file cannot be played by Windows Media Player, some can be played in RealPlayer, some can be played in Windows Live Movie Maker.<br />
Anything played on Windows Media Player is corrupted, files that could be played on other computer couldn't be played on mine. I tried to google about the problem about Programs not appearing and they say change the settings the programs of Right Clicking the
 Speaker icon in the toolbar, go to Playback Devices try disabling it, or click the Properties button after selecting Speakers, and change any settings. It keeps going back, maybe because it is set or maybe because it is the only Speaker I have.

<h3> skyzophrenyk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 - Persistent list and start maximized&#63;</h2>
                    Is there any way (perferably without the use of third party software) to force windows media player to 1.) open maximized, regardless of video, video size, etc. and&nbsp;2.) have a persistent list that doesn't disappear each time a new video plays?<br />
<br />
Also, is it possible to have windows media player always&nbsp;stay at a particular fixed size width unless manually dragged, and if manually dragged, save the information about it's size and keep that size next time its launched?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with your ISP to see if the issue is on their end or even an internet issue beyond
<br />
them (such as a errant router). Especially if the issue is only with eBay or just a few sites.<br />
<br />

Wired and wireless network connection problems in Windows<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/wired-and-wireless-network-connection-problems-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/wired-and-wireless-network-connection-problems-in-windows</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible solution? And I would<br />
update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are you positioned from the router? Are there
<br />
obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click on it - driver's tab - write
<br />
down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then<br />
Right Click on Wifi Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

How to Install a Device Driver in Vista Device Manager<br />

<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions. (The<br />
ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated drivers as Vista loves<br />
updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests one just HIDE it as they<br />
are almost alway old and you can look for drivers manually as needed.<br />

<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Make sure you know the login details for your wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />
<br />
You will lose connection when doing this and have to redo your logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network &amp; Sharing Center - on Right Side click Customize - Set Network Locations page -<br />
on lower left click Merge or delete networks&nbsp;locations&nbsp;- DELETE ALL instances of your network&nbsp;(and any&nbsp;<br />
others you no longer use) - REBOOT.&nbsp;Start - Connect To to logon on to Network.<br />

<h2>            Error code 80151904, first time its happened and I can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t log back on.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
so the problems simple, I'm in the middle of playing mw ghosts and it starts to suddenly lag hard. I try leaving and rejoining a game and after doing that for 5 minutes and getting really irritated that it seems I'm dealing with a massive lag spike that's ongoing
 I ended up getting booted off line. and bam this error code shows up. </p>

<p>so down the list of possible fixes that are proposed on this site. clear cache.. nothing,&nbsp; redownload profile nothing, restart the system ... nothing, restart the router.. nothing, restart the modem.. nothing. do various combinations of the above over the
 next hr and.... you guessed it... nothing.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
I'm using a wired connection so interference is not an issue aside from that I did the google ping test from my computer (which i'm currently using ONLINE to write this msg.)&nbsp; it pinged none stop without issued for 2 minutes. hey my computer is online, my wifes
 computer is, my phone has net access, her phone has net access, my PS3 has access, my Wii has access.&nbsp; This is not an issue on my end from my network. Couple that with attempting everything that has been previously suggested and the fact that I have played
 Ghosts pretty much without issue since the day it came out until earlier this afternoon.. in the middle of a game with no apparent reason or change in any of my hardware or software.</p>
<p>The only thing I'll add at this point is despite obviously having a working router, modem and working home network which as stated above hasn't changed and worked fine earlier today.. yesterday and the day before that and before that etcetcetc is that now
 when I test the connection on the xbox it can't connect to the network.</p>
<p><br />
So whats the deal? why when everything has been working is it out of no where that it suddenly stops, and every suggestion listed above doesn't work and hasn't worked for those people asking for help.</p>

<p>whats next? what do you want me to try from here? I don't even care why at this moment, just help me to make this work right again.</p>

<p>well well here's a fun bit of news. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In a last ditch effort to make something happen I yanked my cable out of my xbox and put in the wireless adapter. logged on right away. &nbsp;Now if that isn't the strangest thing ever. usually people tell you to go the other way.
</p>
<p>anyways once back online i took no chances and did all the steps again. &nbsp;I can't say if that did anything because the problem was already solved at that point but with the not-so-stunning lack of solutions provided I figured what the hell lets waste some
 more time restarting and redownloading and such. &nbsp;</p>
<p>after all was said and done I turned my xbox off. popped the wireless connection off, hard wired it back to the router (same cable, same set up, no changes to my router, modem, net connection, or anything else. literally just taking the cable out and back
 in) turned it back on and so far ... so good. </p>
<p>I doubt my experience will help anyone as the only solution that i could offer is to remove a cable.. then put it back in.... which seems unbelievably pointless... but hey if you're like me and have the wireless adapter but generally play on a wired connection.
 just give it a quick go. it takes all of 1 restart and it might allow you to redownload your profile and play.
</p>
<p>I don't know i can't explain it. just what happened to work for me. &nbsp;Good luck.</p>

                    Every time I have tried to play Crackdown 3 in the last month or so, the textures on some of the objects in the world have a strange rainbow variety of colors. The game eventually freezes and I have to quit. But each time I do, within a minute or so the
 light on the front of my Xbox One X flashes twice like 3-4 times in a row and the Console shuts down by itself. When I restart the console I get the Hard Reset Green Screen. I have reported these issues to Xbox through the Console report a problem option yet
 nothing has yet been done. Yes, I have tried everything! In fact I looked into it today and someone recommended deleting local saved games. I did. I relaunched Crackdown 3 and within 5 minutes of playing, it froze again. Anthem has also been crashing lately
 after 2-3 hours into Strongholds on Grandmaster 3 difficulty. This is becoming extremely frustrating. I have done tried every troubleshooting step. It is not an issue on my end, these are problems with these games. And they both h

<p>Hi, i am really sorry to hear you are having issues with games crashing, if its doing it on more than 1 game it looks like it could point to a possible fault with the graphics chip inside the one x :( i had a similar problem with my one S and i had to send
 it off for a repair, if your device is still in warranty i would maybe look into having it repaired as it definitely doesnt sound too good :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<p>I'm using a 5 year old 20GB and it asked for security proofs which I then entered. Since then it's been stuck on the spinning circle for almost 20 minutes, meaning I can't do anything apart from close the guide which means I'll have to do it all over again.
 Why is this taking so long? I don't remember my 250GB ever taking this long</p>

<h3> diegosegui  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do we put up with Microsoft&#39;s BS&#63;</h2>
                    After reading all of the posts about Windows 7 spontaneously deciding that a legal copy of Windows is no longer "genuine", I have to wonder how much longer this monopoly will be permitted to take advantage of us all.&nbsp; The DOJ really blew it when they called
 off the dogs back in the nineties after a federal judge had certified their monopolistic practices.<br />
<br />
So now we have a company that thinks is perfectly O.K. for a product, legally bought and paid for, to declare ITSELF as being stolen goods and, as a consequence of this declaration, to provide reduced functionality and banishment from support services.&nbsp; Boy
 if that isn't the definition of gall I'd like to hear a better one.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
When I called Ma 'Soft for help they acknowledged that my Product Id was valid, but said it was my tough luck because the product was "out of warranty".&nbsp; Out of Warranty?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Since when is a product self-destructing based on advance programming a warranty
 issue?&nbsp; This product isn't defective, it is doing exactly what it was built to do by its makers who don't care a lick about their paying customers.&nbsp; Their only concern is trying to thwart thieves.&nbsp; Too bad a few thousand legitimate customers get whacked in
 that pursuit.<br />
<br />
The fact that people think it is reasonable that we should have to come, hat in hand, back to Ma 'Soft asking to have back what was rightfully purchased is bizarre. Why does this make sense to anyone?&nbsp; If I bought an automobile, and then one day on the highway
 it suddenly shut down because it thought it had been sold through a chop shop, would that be considered 'reasonable'?<br />
<br />
Many, many hours of my recent life have been spent trying to resolve my current problems.&nbsp; I have spent hours pouring through forums trying to find some tidbit of knowledge that might straighten things out.&nbsp; I can honestly say that none of the helpful information
 has come from Microsoft employees - it is always from good hearted users who post hard-gained knowledge for the benefit of other victims of this half-baked, exploit-ridden product that that presumes to be smart enough to know whether it is "genuine" or not.&nbsp;
 What a joke - but the joke is clearly on me and all other Ma 'Soft customers.<br />
<br />
Now that I have that all off my chest . . . <br />
<br />
I have given up hope of 'fixing' the OS in place, but low and behold, even being willing to reinstall does not get me out of the woods.&nbsp; I chose the reinstall option under Advanced Recovery.&nbsp; The first thing it suggested was that a backup my data.&nbsp; That sounded
 like a good idea, so I told it to proceed.&nbsp; It returned with an error message that backup was not working<br />
<br />
So I decided to go ahead anyway, so I told it to do the repair without backing up.&nbsp; It said that it was ready to restart and continue with the reinstallation.&nbsp; It shut down and started the setup process but then, as with so many things I have tried of the past
 few weeks, dashed my hopes at that last second.&nbsp; In this case the message was:<br />
<br />
"The unattended answer file contains an invalid product key.&nbsp; Either remove the invalid key or provide a valid product key in the unattended answer file to proceed with the Windows installation."<br />
<br />
My sole response option to this statement was "OK".<br />
<br />
I'm not even given the satisfaction of responding that the situation is most definitely NOT OK with me.&nbsp; I'm, forced to answer "OK"!&nbsp; Why do we put up with this BS?<br />
<br />
Because they're Microsoft - "They don't have to care".<br />
<br />

- Andre: 


  Thanks for your reply and interest.  I've answered your questions below . . .   



Sorry about your situation, but if you could just clarify, what is status of your situation? Is Windows 7 installed or are you attempting install it? 

	After many hours I have manged to get the system to where it boots and I can log into the various user accounts.  But the PlugPlay service never came back no matter what I tried, which means that Device Manager does not work and neither do the services that depend on it.  


  Is this a retail license or one that came preinstalled with your computer?  

	Windows 7 Home Premium is installed on my machine.  I bought it directly from Microsoft to upgrade the XP that was previously running on the machine.  It running well until 7/6/2011, then all **** broke loose after running the beta of the Microsoft Standalone Sweeper rootkit detector.  



If its a retail license, is it a digital download or retail box license? 

	I have the DVD's that were shippe

            For the plug and play issues, I would go to the computer manufacturers website, search for your model computer and download the latest available BIOS and Chipset drivers and install them. If there are no Windows 7 native drivers, I would install Windows
 Vista drivers if those are available.

            Hello, George.&nbsp; Thanks for you reply.<br />
<br />
I don't know if it was your post or someone else's that I had seen in my travels through the forums, but I had already tried the steps with stopping sppsvc, renaming the tokens file and restarting the service.<br />
<br />
But, just to be sure, I tried it again just now.&nbsp; When I run slui.exe after the rename and restart of sppsvc I get the following error:<br />
<br />
"An error has occurred."<br />
<br />
Then there is hyperlink labeled<br />
<br />
"You can also contact Microsoft by phone to help resolve your problem" <br />
<br />
which takes you to a useless help screen with no phone number for contacting Microsoft.<br />
<br />
There is a 'details' button that you can click, which reveals some very helpful information:<br />
<br />
Code:<br />
0x800700B7<br />
<br />
Description:<br />
Cannot create a file when that file already exists.<br />
<br />
As for the System File Checker, everyone and his brother recommends running this program.&nbsp; When I do (in a CMD window with Administrator privelges) I get the following messages:<br />
<br />
"Beginning System Scan.&nbsp; This process will take some time"<br />
<br />
Three seconds later it announces:<br />
<br />
"Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation"<br />
<br />
And so it goes.<br />

I'm not understanding this suggestion.&nbsp; This machine is about five years old, so Dell hasn't posted any new drivers for it in quite some time.&nbsp; Are you thinking that the BIOS has been damaged?<br />

            <p>If the machine is not supported by the manufacturer (Dell) in Windows 7 - why do you expect it to work well in the first place?</p>
<p>Yes - the manufacturer(s) of the hardware are the ones that decide (or decide not) to supply drivers and software for their hardware in *any* given operating system.&nbsp; If you stray too far in one direction (older OSes) or another (newer OSes) then it is likely
 you have gone outside the 'sweet spot' and your hardware may not function under the operating system.&nbsp; It is the hardware manufacturer's choice to do this - not Microsoft's,&nbsp;not *nix, etc.</p>
<p>As for your more direct question to Andre, does that imply you have kept the BIOS up to date since you purchased it?&nbsp; Dell does release updates for their BIOS every so often for a variety of reasons.&nbsp; One reason some manufacturers released BIOS updates was
 Windows 7 - although I do not recall Dell being one of those manufacturers.</p>
<p>For the rest of the hardware - if you know the manufacturer's of the components - you can sometimes get lucky going direct.&nbsp; Intel chipset?&nbsp; Maybe Intel put out the drivers for it.&nbsp; Broadcom network card?&nbsp; Maybe Broadcom put out drivers for it.&nbsp; Realtek
 audio device?&nbsp; Maybe Relatek put out drivers for it.&nbsp; Etc and so on.</p>
<p>What is the model of your computer?&nbsp; Service Tag would be a FANTASTIC thing to give.</p>

            I am at a loss at this point. i suspect something has damaged your install.
<div><br />
<div><b>&nbsp;It running well until 7/6/2011, then all **** broke loose after running the beta of the Microsoft Standalone Sweeper rootkit detector</b></div>

            I've done System restore to points before 7/6.&nbsp; Didn't fix the problem.<br />
<br />
I am completely baffled, frustrated, and ticked off by this whole affair.&nbsp;&nbsp; At every turn in trying to patch this up I have run into dead ends.<br />
<br />
The obvious inclination is to reformat the drive and start from scatch.&nbsp; But I'm pretty sure this DVD would refuse to install onto a clean hard drive because it is an "Upgrade" product, not an OS for a new machine.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it shows on your device that the location is in Germany instead of your current location, then it's because your computer doesn't have a GPS. The system will attempt to figure out where you are based on your IP address. Now, just to get a few details
 regarding the device location of your computer, have you been in Germany or did you set it to that certain location before?<br />
<br />
For more information about the location settings, you can refer to this article: <a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-10-location-and-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>I get an error, &#34;Windows cannot access the file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b.doug  say:</h3>
<h2>            I get an error, &#34;Windows cannot access the file C&#58;&#92;Windows&#92;SysWOW64&#92;MMDevAPI.dll&#34; whenever I try to access an application uses the Internet.</h2>
                    A friend is getting this error with multiple 32-bit networking related programs (e.g. 32-bit IE, Chrome, Skype). 64-bit IE is working fine.<br />
<br />
<span><span>
<span><span>
<div>Windows cannot access the file C:\Windows\SysWOW64\MMDevAPI.dll for one of the following reasons: there is a problem with the network connection, the disk that the file is stored on, or the storage drivers installed on this computer; or the disk is missing.
 Windows closed the program Internet Explorer because of this error.</div>
<div>Program: Internet Explorer</div>
<div>File: C:\Windows\SysWOW64\MMDevAPI.dll</div>
<div>The error value is listed in the Additional Data section.</div>
<div>User Action</div>
<div>1. Open the file again. This situation might be a temporary problem that corrects itself when the program runs again.</div>
<div>2. If the file still cannot be accessed and</div>
<div>- It is on the network, your network administrator should verify that there is not a problem with the network and that the server can be contacted.</div>
<div>- It is on a removable disk, for example, a floppy disk or CD-ROM, verify that the disk is fully inserted into the computer.</div>
<div>3. Check and repair the file system by running CHKDSK. To run CHKDSK, click Start, click Run, type CMD, and then click OK. At the command prompt, type CHKDSK /F, and then press ENTER.</div>
<div>4. If the problem persists, restore the file from a backup copy.</div>
<div>5. Determine whether other files on the same disk can be opened. If not, the disk might be damaged. If it is a hard disk, contact your administrator or computer hardware vendor for further assistance.</div>
<div>Additional Data</div>
<div>Error value: C0000185</div>
<div>Disk type: 3<br />
<br />
CHKDSK didn't resolve anything. Just for kicks, I tried copying MMDevAPI.dll from another system of his, but access permissions aren't allowing that even in Safe mode. I don't know if there's some other standard way to copy over system files like that. (No,
 I'm not a Windows system wiz.) Although the file date and size of the two files already match.<br />
<br />
He tried restoring from an earlier System Restore point, but that failed. I don't have the specific failure, and when I looked at the available restore points myself just tonight, I think he no longer has any from before when this problem began.<br />
<br />
He's going to see if he can find the correct manufacturer's harddrive test tool, and call the system manufacturer to see if he can obtain a Windows/System recovery disk in case we have to reinstall.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

            <p><span><strong>Hi B.Doug,</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in the
</span><strong><span>Microsoft Community</span><span> Forums</span></strong><span>. If I understand
 you correctly, you receive an error, “</span><span><strong>Windows</strong></span><span>
</span><strong><span>cannot access the file C:\Windows\SysWOW64\MMDevAPI.dll” on multiple programs</span><span>.</span></strong><span>
 I understand that it must be frustrating, but rest assured, we are here to help fix your issue and guide you in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us start with a few questions-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this error come up on
</span><strong>other</strong><span> </span><strong>applications</strong><span> that do not use the Internet?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made
</span><strong>any changes</strong><span> on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>I would like more information regarding the issue.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Let us now perform some troubleshooting steps. All the steps are to be performed systematically and in an order.</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is not advisable to copy and restore the .DLL files from a different computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 1-</strong></p>
<p><span>I would have you run an SFC scan to check for integrity violations.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the article-</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista
 or on Windows 7</strong></a></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2-</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 1-</strong></p>
<p><span>You need to check if this issue persists in
</span><strong>Safe Mode</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the article-</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong></a></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong><span>: Make sure you log back into
</span><strong>Normal Mode</strong><span> after performing all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure, you select
</span><strong>Safe Mode</strong><span> </span><strong>with</strong><span>
</span><strong>Networking</strong><span> instead of </span>
<strong>Safe Mode.</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Proceed to
</span><strong>Step 2,</strong><span> if the issue does not occur in
</span><strong>Safe</strong><span> </span><strong>Mode</strong><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2-</strong></p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to perform a
</span><span><strong>Clean Boot</strong></span><strong>.</strong></p>
<p><span>Placing your system in
</span><span><strong>Clean Boot</strong></span><strong> state</strong><span> helps in identifying if
</span><span>any third party applications or startup items are</span><span> causing the issue.

<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span><strong>Note</strong></span><span>: You need to follow
</span><span><strong>Step 7</strong></span><span> from the article to get the computer back to
</span><span><strong>Normal Startup</strong></span><span> after you follow all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 3-</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Try logging into a
</span><span><strong>different User account</strong></span><span>. Check if the issue persists over there.</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, then refer the articles-</span></p>

            1) We have not seen this problem on programs that do not access the internet.<br />
2) I don't think we know for certain if there were any changes. There were definitely none obvious in our recollection, but of course things like Windows and AV are always updating in the background.<br />
<br />
We attempted to run sfc /scannow, but it failed at about 80% through the process with no identifying error.<br />
<br />
Issue persisted in Safe Mode with Networking (since we need Networking to use the internet apps).<br />
<br />
Haven't tried Clean Boot or a different User yet. Will do those.<br />
