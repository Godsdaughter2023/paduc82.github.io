</p><p>As observed, Skype Lite has a user interface that does not show your and your contacts' profile pictures. It will however, show bots' pics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't worry as the profile photos are still saved in your account and visible <strong>
when logged into Skype for Web</strong>, <strong>other Skype versions</strong> and
<strong>Skype website</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will have this observation raised with our developers for review.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and frustration you have been through. I will be glad to assist you.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer these questions to assist you better.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;What is the make and model of your computer?<br />
2.&nbsp;Have you installed all pending Windows and driver updates?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For devices like Bluetooth keyboard mouse etc, I suggest you to check manufacturer website for latest drivers. Also install all pending Windows updates. Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works,
 or enhance your computing experience.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Check for Windows updates.</strong><br />
1.&nbsp;Type <strong>Check for updates </strong>in <strong>Search.</strong><br />
2.&nbsp;Click on <strong>Check for updates </strong>and follow onscreen instructions.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Run the Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with hardware and devices. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with the Bluetooth adapter. Refer these steps:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, select <strong>Control panel.</strong><br />
2.&nbsp;Change the view by option on the top right to <strong>Large icons.</strong><br />
3.&nbsp;Click on <strong>troubleshooting </strong>and click on the <strong>view all </strong>
option on the left panel.<br />
4.&nbsp;Run the <strong>Hardware and devices troubleshooter</strong>.<br />
5.&nbsp;Restart your computer and check if the issue is resolved. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: </strong>To control how your computer pairs with Bluetooth enabled devices.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press<strong> Windows Key + X </strong>then clicking <strong><span>Control Panel</span>.
</strong></li><li>
<p>In the <strong>Control Panel search box</strong>, type <strong>
<span>Bluetooth</span></strong>, and then click <strong><span>Change Bluetooth settings</span>.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p>In the <strong><span>Bluetooth Settings</span> dialog box</strong>, click the
<strong><span>Options</span> tab </strong>and do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To make your computer discoverable to Bluetooth enabled devices, select the check box for
<strong><span>Allow Bluetooth devices to find this computer</span>. </strong>
</p>
</li></ul>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4: </strong>Refer the Microsoft article below and perform troubleshooting steps suggested.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Fix connections to Bluetooth audio devices and wireless displays.</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-connections-to-bluetooth-audio-devices-and-wireless-displays#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-connections-to-bluetooth-audio-devices-and-wireless-displays#v1h=tab01</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps you. Kindly post back with the updated issue for further assistance.

            <p>Hi Pavan_N.<br />
</p>
<p>You are right, it is frustrating. Especially when considering that I can run my Laptop with a Livestick-Version of Knoppix on a 4 GB USB-Stick without any additional configuration but
 entering the password of my WiFi Router and booting in seconds. Main reason I write this detail: it proofs that &nbsp;the hardware is in flawless condition.</p>
<p>My answer may be disappointing for you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most troubleshooting in Windows ends with "ask a friend" and in many cases I am the friend who answers the questions but here I am speechless.</p>
<p>After following the proposed procedure I just received a message that some modifications have been made and that I should reboot. It was not giving any details of what had been modified,
 so even the way to roll back was not given. But there is no success anyway and even worse,&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>I found out that I cannot go back to Windows 7 anymore although I did not
 touch any relevant settings.</strong></span></p>
<p>Your questions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;What is the make and model of your computer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; HP Compaq 8510w</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; HP is not providing any new drivers &nbsp;for W10</p>
<p><br />
2.&nbsp;Have you installed all pending Windows and driver updates? YES SURE<br />
</p>
<p>I performed the last Windows update before changing to W10</p>
<p>
</p><p>After encountering problems I have performed a driver update (Driver booster 3 and Intel Driver Update Utility) and disabled the HP Integrated Bluetooth driver since W10 reports that
 it is not supported, I bought a dongle which is compatible to w10 and downloaded the driver for it. Once paired and connected sound is flawless to 3 different bluetooth devices. As reported after rebooting the PC connecting is not feasible although devices
 are paired. Troubleshooting impossible, no hints where to look</p>
<p>The device-manager is clean!</p>
<p>I am further using 2 Xiaomi Phones, before changing I could use the PC as well as the source as for the target to play sound. Currently (sometimes) just transfer of files is possible
 but needs many steps. Xiaomi-phones can work as FTP-servers so I don't care for the smartphone stuff, I don't need to change accounts, just use it.</p>
<p>My second laptop "HP Elitebook 2560p" is doing slightly better. No dongle required. But same issue as before, cannot connect headphones or sinks although devices are paired.</p>
<p>Boot process takes also minutes instead of about 40 secs before.</p>
<p>I don't have the time to examine all issues. Currently this second laptop causes me extra headaches because after a powersaving break the touchpad does not wake up anymore.</p>
<p>Best solution for me to receive a download-link for windows7 professional german, so that I can restore what was working before since WIN10 is a step backward for me.</p>
<p><span><span>I appreciate and thank you your efforts but must say, that the problems I encounter -7 months after launching w10- should be known and an advice NOT TO UPGRADE could have been given. It would have saved much time
 and cost</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>best regards&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Pavan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to add some new information concerning Laptop HP Elitebook 2560p.</p>
<p>Today it performed an update and since then it is booting in 45 sec and I can activate the bluetooth headsets.</p>
<p>So far so good and I am glad for fixing this. This is the English version</p>
<p>But all the problems are still unsolved on my HP Compaq Mobile Workstation 8510w.</p>

<p>
</p><div>the Bluetooth-Issue is just a little part of the story.</div>
<div>To really understand how I feel about this, I need to tell you that I am working in China right now. I cannot afford to do any experiments on my computer since I need it every day from
 early morning to late evening and nobody can help me here in case of trouble.BTW I&nbsp;can see that the Bluetooth problems are around everywhere and appearing on all types of computers. It means Microsoft has launched unready software and is using its customers
 as Guinea-Pigs.</div>
<div>Your answer is just concerning the Bluetooth, I did not find one word about the extremely long boottime and found no solution for how to get back to windows 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;

    <title>Copying folders to a USB drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimpeterson212  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copying folders to a USB drive</h2>
                    
<p>I copy folders I want to save to a USB drive.&nbsp; I have encountered a problem in Windows 7&nbsp;that I do not know how to solve.&nbsp; Once I copy a folder to the drive, when I want to save it again I just copy it again and overwrite the previous version.&nbsp; However,
 in Windows 7 it will not let me do this if the remaining empty space on the drive is less than the size of the folder that I want to copy.&nbsp; There is enough space on the drive to perform the copy, because it would mostly just overwrite existing files and possibly
 add a few new ones.&nbsp; So, it does not require additional space equal the the size of the folder I am copying.&nbsp; I was looking for a way to override this check in Windows 7 but have not found it.&nbsp; If there is no override for this it seems like an oversight in
 the Windows 7 design.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>This is not by design in Windows 7. This could be because of the file system corrupted on your USB Drive. You should try to format the USB drive once and then check if you have the same issue. Make sure that you backup all the data that you have on the USB
 drive before formatting the drive.</p>
<p>You should try to format it with Disk Management. Check out the link that will help you:</p>

            Temzin, thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I tried reformatting the USB drive but it did not fix the problem.&nbsp; I did not expect that it would.&nbsp; The system seems to recognize the amount of space on the drive correctly.&nbsp; The problem is that Windows 7 does not check
 that the folder I want to write to the disk will overwrite a folder already there, and so it is not necessary that the drive have free space larger than the size of the folder I want to copy to it.&nbsp; If it was correctly designed, there should be an override
 for this, or it would do a more sophisticated check.&nbsp; But I don't believe there is an override.&nbsp; Fortunately, USB drives are getting larger all the time, so the solution is simply to buy a larger USB&nbsp; drive that always has as much empty space as the largest
 folder that you want to write to it.

            I know this thread is old but I would like to make it clear that I have noticed this problem as well. Windows 7 will check for free space first before it checks to see if it's overwriting something. This only causes more frustration when trying to update
 files on a usb flash drive or other small storage device that doesn't have a lot of space and the file you are trying to update is larger then the remaining free space of the device even though you are only updating an existing file or files.<br />
<br />
Older versions of windows do not have this issue and prompt a free space warning only after the copy process gets to a point where there is no more space to copy data. While this can also cause problems it would be nice if Windows 7 prompted about overwriting
 files before it did a free space check. Also it would be nice to speed up that check because in the case where there is a large number of files most of those could have been copied over in the time it takes Windows 7 to locate them which can make large copy
 processes take longer then they need to.<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
This issue may be involved :<br />
<br />
A thumbdrive can support only a very limited number of files and folders in the root directory/folder.<br />
To solve this make one or more&nbsp;folders and copy the files into it/them.<br />
<br />
H:\&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if H: is the thumbdrive<br />
<br />
H:\MyFiles<br />
<br />
H:\Documents<br />
<br />
and so one and copy the files into those folders. You may have to remove a few files from a seemingly<br />
full thumbdrive to be able to create the folders. </p>
<p>Hope this helps.<br />

            No it is a bug. It doesn't matter how many files/folders/subfolders there are and if they are in the root. It appears that Windows 7 doesn't accommodate for the fact that some of the space needed to perform the copy will be obtained from the

<br />
There may be a bug however how many folders and files you have on <br />
the root of the drive definitely matters. Even if there is enough space on<br />
the drive if the total number in the root is too high you will get that error.<br />

            Yes, this is a bug or at least poor design.<br />
I don't know any way around it in Windows Explorer, but one solution is to do the copy in a command prompt.&nbsp; The following command will copy all newer or unique files to the target<br />
xcopy /d sourcepath targetpath&nbsp; <br />

            I've gotten this error when I'm only overwriting 1 big file and it's the only file taking up most of the space on the flash drive. It only occurs when copying more data then there is free space for (which I'm sure is what it's suppose to do) or overwriting
 an existing file(s) with data that is larger then the remaining free space. After posting my last message on this thread I loaded up my copy of Ubuntu Linux that I have on a netbook and did the copy that Windows 7 wasn't allowing me to do (I only needed to
 recopy a few files because Microsoft Security Essentials flagged a few files on the flash drive that I wanted to keep for pen testing purposes and wasn't sure which files had been removed...an issue for another topic) and while Ubuntu also warned me that there
 wasn't enough space it also gave me the option to perform the copy anyway. This would be a nice thing to have in Windows 7 instead of flat out not allowing the copy at all.<br />

            I have just had the same issue after a while of copying the many hundreds of files to and from removable media, but this time I changed the filesystem from FAT to NTFS and this made a difference. I believe it is the cluster size with large files which
 could bring this error.<br />

            <p>Delete all the target disk's files that will be overwritten, first.&nbsp; Then the correct amount of free space is available.&nbsp; In theory.&nbsp; Haven't encountered the problem (that I know of).<br />
</p>
<p>Or use the FreeFileSync utility, which I'm just learning.&nbsp; Looks good (ver 9.3.1, IIRC).</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the forums today, I'd be happy to help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You definitely can see the time he spends on gaming and you can even set screen time limits and content restrictions if you want to have some more control over his gaming. You simply just need to have your own adult/parent Microsoft account and add your
 son's account to your Family group where you can manage his gaming all from one place online. Adding them to the Family is really easy and everything can be done from
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/family/</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll provide you with all of the support articles walking you through the process of adding members to your Family and then managing their account with screen time limits or activity reports along with their&nbsp;Xbox Live&nbsp;privacy settings:</p>

    <title>Annotating pdf in Microsoft Reader gradually puts more stress on the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anonymous203423  say:</h3>
<h2>            Annotating pdf in Microsoft Reader gradually puts more stress on the cpu, even while not annotating</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 8.1 tablet (Core i5). With the Microsoft Reader app, I can open pdf files, and use a wacom stylus to annotate them (the screen has a built-in wacom digitizer). However, the more I have written, the more the processor gets utilized. Eventually,
 one cpu core is exhausted, even if I do not scroll or use the tablet in any way; just displaying the pdf file stresses the cpu. This can be resolved by saving the annotated pdf, closing the Reader app via the task manager, and reopening the annotated pdf.
 Then, I can continue annotating, until the cpu is exhausted again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The high cpu utilization reduces battery life, heats up the tablet, and causes the fan to be louder than necessary. Neither of these is desirable for making annotations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tablet is fully up to date, and I can reproduce this bug on other tablets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem was also observed at:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What information does the task manager show about reader app?<br />
2. Did you try using suggestions provided in the links you mentioned?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to check the issue in <strong>safe mode.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Refer this article:<br />

<p>
</p><p>1. as I make annotations, the task manager shows a gradual increase in memory usage (starting from 70 to over 100 MB) for the Reader app. There is no disk or network activity. While I write, cpu usage is between 12-18%, but as soon as the stylus is lifted
 from the screen, cpu usage increases to 25% (which corresponds to 1 cpu core being fully utilized). The 25% is the final level, and depends on how much the pdf file has been annotated (just after opening it is 0%, and it gradually goes up as I make annotations).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The first link mentions checking which updates I have installed; they are all installed and my system is fully up to date. The second link does not show any suggestions (my problem is described in the last two messages only).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Process monitor does not show any disk, network or registry activity that is apparent to come from the reader app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I cannot boot into safe mode without a keyboard, and a usb keyboard does not work. I will check at a Microsoft store soon to see if I can reproduce it in safe mode there.</p>

            <p>A demo Surface Pro 3 in the microsoft store has the same issue. The demo model had some protection that prevented booting into safe mode. However, the observation that the bug occurs on a brand new tablet with a random pdf file, shows that the bug is easy
 to reproduce and probably affects every Microsoft tablet.</p>

            <p>The first part isn't the best answer but Reader is more of a convince app. Isn't made for heavy work. However I don't think that is the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Reader loses focus, you hover the mouse over a different app or you stop using it, the cpu should drop to zero. Before it drops the CPU it needs to off load the changes you made on to the hardrive so it can grab them back into ram when reader gets focus.
 This is the same with every Windows App. They will wait 5 seconds then it figures you aren't going to restart it so it unloads its hooks on the resources so they can be used by another process.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried it on my PC with a Wacom external tablet and the cpu jumps to 33% at the most then it drops to zero when I stop. It is&nbsp;HP built in 2009 so it isn't the fastest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first guess would be the graphics driver needs an update or possibly the touch/pen tablet could be the issue. Check what is really using the CPU by right clicking reader in the task manager and click details. Then use the Reader app to see which of those
 values are getting stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is nothing using the CPU Reader will use as much as it can but it shouldn't remain that way for long. The only think that can cause it to block the CPU is if it is trying to perform a CPU task that needs to wait on an&nbsp;I/O and the I/O is blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know what items in the details&nbsp;are using the CPU for an extended amount of time&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 new PC instantly connected to Wi-Fi out of the box and asking for login&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased 2 laptops with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took out the first one, connected to Wi-Fi (had to use 5Gh as the 2.4 a couple feet away seemed to be unstable). Then I was forced to create a MS account, could not create a local one. I signed in and could create a new local only user if I wanted to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I opened the second box. Turned it on and it is strait to the login screen, not Wi-Fi, not create new account just login? I tried my newly created MS login. Got an error saying service is currently unavailable. (in case anybody wanted to know why I
 use local logins). I tried random entries and I either got the account does not exist or the password is incorrect, but no option to create a new one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After about 30 minutes or so I was able to log in with my MS account. Interestingly I could not create a local login like with the other laptop, but I could switch to a local login instead?? So clearly they are using different version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also in the windows store on the first machine, I could not get anything at all, such as Ublock Origin for Edge without a MS login, but on the second free apps loaded fine without issue. It asked for a MS login, but continues after I closed the prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the one thing I did not do on the second machine is connect to Wi-Fi or even select a MS account. Somehow it already had it, possibly from the first machine. Similarly it may have had login data as I could not even create a new account at all. I
 wonder if a different account would have worked as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very concerned that a new windows 10 PC can gain access to my private home WiFi right out of the box. How can I stop it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the exact PCs if it helps anyone solve this:</p>
<p>The first:</p>

            Hi MichaelEPQ 
<br />
<br />If you used the same Microsoft Account initially on both devices, that would explain the auto login, because everything would have been synced to your Microsoft Account form the first device
<br />
<br />Were you able to change both devices to a local account successfully, if so that will stop this type of data syncing . . .
<br />
<br />When you say you are able to access the Microsoft Store on the second device - are you logging into Windows or the store with your Microsoft Account, prior to the download succeeding?

            Hi Michael.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See here how to change a MS Account to a Local Account:
<br /><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-switch-back-to-a-local-account-from-a-microsoft-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-swi...</a>
<br />
<br />If that isn't available then see here how to create a New Local account to sign into, move your files over, test all programs run correctly, then when ready delete the old account:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br /> 
<br />If you had Signed in with the MS account on both PC's then it may have synced Wifi sign in to the other in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sync your Settings &gt; Other Settings. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>For the first computer I switched to a local account and removed the MS account before I started with the second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DaveM121,</p>
<p>On the second computer, I did not do anything, it instantly had internet access. I can only think that is somehow synced from the first one, but even before the MS account. I took a while to just be able to login, due to the error, but it clearly had internet
 before I logged in??</p>
<p>
</p><p>In both cases I was not logged into the Store at all, but the first machine gave me the Get It button, but asked for a login and stopped, but the second machine still asked for login after the Get It button, but continued with the download after I closed
 the login prompt. By the way, the first machine did not have an option to log in only to the app as described
<a href="https://lifehacker.com/install-windows-10-store-apps-without-switching-to-a-mi-1723075610" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>, but would have forced me to switch to the MS login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greg,</p>
<p>You are exactly right. But on the first laptop I had to create a new user as in your second link. On the second machine I had to switch to local user instead like in your second link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously the 2 machines have different W10 builds I will check tonight if I remember and post, assuming they have not already updated to the latest.</p>
<p>In hind sight, I will I had taken pictures and/or videos of all this as it was happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest question of how the second machine had internet access before a successful login still remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

            Unless it was plugged in by ethernet cable I know of no way it will sign into your Network without your user participation unless it had already sync'ed your Account from other PC which sounds unlikely.  
<br />
<br />I would go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.

<p>The first machine is running 1809 and the second one is running 1803 if that means something to anybody.</p>
<p>1809 is the one that will not let me download free apps at all without a MS account.</p>

            First make sure that your Dell wifi card supports wifi direct, not all do.
<br />
<br />On your machine use the win + k to launch the connect.
<br />Make sure to connect that way.
<br />Let me know if that works.
<br />
<br />Also make sure your Intel drivers are up to date.

<h2>            Cannot move desktop to a new location in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying to move the desktop location on a machine that runs Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my own machine (Windows 10), there's a "Location" tab in the desktop properties.&nbsp;<br />
That tab is missing on the machine that runs Windows 7.&nbsp;<br />
I came across the suggestion below in other threads, but it is not working for me. Any other suggestions on how to change to location or how to get the location tab to show?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Try opening your user home directory and then directly drag-dropping the deskop folder to the place you want it to be.&nbsp; Immediately after, log out and back onto the computer and check the registry again, the value for Desktop should have been updated to
 be the path to the place you dragged it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I wanted my desktop to be inside my OneDrive so it gets backed-up automatically and I can never lose anything even if my computer burned in a house fire.&nbsp; After dragging the folder there and rebooting, the registry shows it as such.</p>

    <title>H.265 video on Intel i5-4200U processor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasseymour18901  say:</h3>
<h2>            H.265 video on Intel i5-4200U processor</h2>
                    <p>I have a fairly new Dell Inspiron 5537 with an Intel i5-4200U processor from mid-2013. I was very happy to hear that Windows 10 will natively support FLAC, HEVC and Matroska files natively, eliminating the need for me to install third-party software on every
 device I want to view my H.265 videos on. I was wondering how an Intel i5-4200U processor could handle H.265 video. I've done a lot of reading about the differences between H.264, which is what everything from Blu-ray discs to YouTube videos to Netflix streams
 use. Proponents of H.265 claim that in return for increased computational complexity, H.265 can store your videos at approximately half the file size over H.264 without any reduction in the video's quality. It also supports 10-bit color and 300 frames per
 second, both of which were only science fiction when the H.264 standard was finalized in 2003. Throughout 2015, support for H.265 is expected to become wider than ever. Right now, most people still use H.264 since many common devices like the iPhone and iPad
 currently don't support H.265 except for FaceTime calls, perhaps because of how powerful the hardware needs to be to play H.265 video without any significant compromises in battery life and/or performance. Since the iPad Air 2 is going to be able to multitask
 when iOS 9 comes out perhaps in September judging by Apple's release history, I would imagine the successor to the iPad Air 2 might have the right hardware to play H.265 video natively. The iPad Air 2 has 2 GB of RAM and a 64-bit 1.5 GHz tri-core processor,
 which is quite an improvement over the original iPad Air. I also heard the Intel Haswell processors are going to support DirectX 12, which is what Windows 10 will ship with. Intel did release a driver for their Intel and Broadwell processors to be able to
 play 8-bit HEVC video early this year, and their Skylake processors will support both 8-bit HEVC and 10-bit HEVC without the need for any drivers. The reason I am thinking about this so thoroughly is that I have five DVD sets totaling 95 discs. A DVD can hold
 up to 4.7 GB of data in the MPEG-2 format, which was quite impressive for its time when DVDs started becoming the standard circa 1997.&nbsp;Logically, the world can't stay on H.264 forever, since the file sizes are unrealistically large for 4K videos. In essence,
 H.265 is the codec of the future. I plan to back up all the videos on those discs and permanently save them to my OneDrive so that I will not ever have to worry about having to buy the whole set again if any of those 95 discs become unplayable for whatever
 reason. I also would like the ability to play those videos on all my devices, including those that don't have or work with DVD drives, such as the iPhone and the iPad. 95 discs worth of DVDs is a lot of video. I have a terabyte of OneDrive storage from my
 Office 365 Personal subscription, plus 15 GB everyone gets for free, and an additional 15 GB for using the Camera Roll function on my iPhone 4S when Microsoft offered that perhaps because of the issues in iOS 8 that existed at the time, totaling 1,054 GB.
 I figured that since H.265 will likely succeed H.264 by the time the last MPEG-2 patent expires on February 14, 2018, I probably should encode those videos in H.265 rather than H.264 so that they wouldn't take up too much of those 1,054 gigabytes. I use my
 OneDrive for all the files I store from documents to movies to pictures to music to TV shows to videos I have recorded on my iPhone and downloaded from YouTube. The only trouble is, I need to be certain watching those videos on the computer I have won't dominate
 my system's resources! The worst case scenario is that I wait until I get a new computer several years in the future to encode those videos in H.265. My laptop has been holding up quite well since I got it on Christmas of 2013, and I don't think it would need
 to be replaced until at least 2018. By that time, Intel will probably have 7 nm processors, down from the 10 nm they are struggling to get down to here in 2015. I certainly won't leave the videos in MPEG-2, because Microsoft dropped support for that in Windows
 8 since they didn't want to pay a $2 license fee for every copy of Windows they shipped like they have to with Windows 7. Lastly, I won't expect any device to drop support for H.264 anytime soon, because videos have become far more ubiquitous in practically
 every reach of the world since technology had advanced enough for cameras and devices to move forward from MPEG-2. Also, there are billions of videos on YouTube. To re-encode all of them from H.264 to H.265 is no easy task, and probably wouldn't be worth the
 effort until several years from now or maybe even until after H.265 is succeeded by an even more advanced codec, whatever it may be.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;im not able to run CPU on dell Inspiron 15R 5537 with i5-4200U. .After upgrading from Win 8.0 to Win 10 my CPU is not able to run faster than 0,78 GHZ. All drivers from dell.com installed. It looks that my win 10 is ignoring any but base power management
 on my i54200U CPU. Any advice? Thanks a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Switchable Graphic not working for Acer Aspire 4820TG notebook with Core i3</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have&nbsp;Acer Aspire 4820TG notebook with Core i3 (Intel HD Graphics) and AMD Mobility Radeon HD 50470. I have a option in BIOS for Switchable
 Graphic Mode, Switchable or Dynamic, in Windows 7 I had the "Configure Switchable Graphics" options once right clicked on Desktop and it had option for switching automatically while plugged in or on battery.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I updated my laptop to “Windows 10 Home” through windows update. Now with the new Windows I can't manually switch between AMD Graphics
 and Intel power save graphics. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I selected Maximize Performance in both Plugged In and Battery, restarted and before Login Screen the screen starts to flash repeatedly
 for 15-20 seconds then message pops that <strong>loginui.exe</strong> failed. I restarted several time, same issue, had to go into the BIOS and switch to Dynamic mode , after restart Widows chose the AMD card but know I cant switch to power save mode (Intel
 Graphic).</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the latest Catalyst and Intel graphics driver for Windows 10 64-bit and Windows update is also up-to-date.
</p>
<p>Is there a way to get the switchable mode to work?</p>

            <p>I think this is something that you need to take up with Acer, as they would need to provide the Drivers to reinstate those missing features. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked Acer's site to see if they have Windows 8 Driver's available or are working on them? &nbsp;Quite a few major manufacturers do still seem to be working on firmware/driver updates for Windows 10.</p>

            <p>I also have the Acer Aspire 4820TG with I5.&nbsp; After the upgrade to Windows 10 everything appeared to work for a couple of days with the exception of 3 of the 4 games I have installed.&nbsp; Guild Wars 2 worked however World of Tanks, Star Wars the Old Republic,
 and Everquest 2 would boot to the login screen and then when trying to actually launch or play the game it would go to a black screen with cursor and no further. Game audio appeared to be playing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After two days I think that drivers must have been updated by Windows update because after a restart the computer would no longer finish the boot sequence.&nbsp; After the swirling boot animation the process would stop at a flashing Blue screen and go no further.&nbsp;
 I had to repeatedly power off and try again until I got to the advanced repair options.&nbsp; I was able to boot into safe mode and successfully reverted back to Windows 7 where all works as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A google search shows that many variations of AMD/Intel switchable graphics problems are preventing a fully functional upgrade with some to the point of making the computers not usable at all.</p>
<p>
AMD, Intel and Microsoft need to work together to find a Unified driver solution that allows various brand&nbsp; that have legacy computers with switchable graphics to successfully upgrade to Windows 10</p>

<h2>            Direct3D Not Working</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 3 with an i5. It was working fine until I changed the resolution in a game to my native resolution then changed it back to the 720p resolution I use so it doesn't go as slow. When I went back to windows it kept the 720p resolution until
 I went and set it back to the native resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, now when I go to open Facebook Messenger it says I need to have Direct3D with feature level 9_3 or greater. I also can't open the games anymore and no new games will install.&nbsp;I reinstalled Facebook Messenger and it didn't make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked DXDIAG and it said that I have DX12 and that direct draw, direct 3D acceleration and AGP texture acceleration are all enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix DirectX?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to verify, have you tried performing a system restore? If not yet, kindly do so.
<span>This option will revert your PC to an earlier point, called a<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>system restore point</strong>. Restore points are created when you install a new app, driver, update, or when you create a system restore point
 manually.<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>You can choose a restore point created before the issues occurred.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To use this recovery option, kindly follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>button, type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><em>control panel<span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong>and then choose it from the
 list of results.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Search<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Control Panel</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>for<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Recovery</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Recovery &gt; Open System Restore &gt; Next</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Choose the restore point related to the app, driver, or update that was recently installed, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Next<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Finish</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Restoring your PC to an earlier point will remove updates and drivers installed after the restore point was made. It won't affect your personal files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you’re not seeing any restore points, it might be because system protection isn’t turned on. To check, go to the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Control Panel</strong>, search for
<strong>Recovery</strong>, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Recovery<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Configure System Restore<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Configure<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>and
 make sure<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Turn on system protection</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>is selected.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know if the issue persists after performing System Restore.</span></p>

<p>Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, we suggest performing a reset. <span>Resetting lets you choose whether to keep your files or remove them, and then reinstalls Windows.

 this PC</strong><span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><strong>Get started</strong><span>&nbsp;and choose an option.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you chose to keep your files, resetting <span>will only remove the apps and drivers that you installed. It will also remove the changes that were made to your settings. Any apps from your<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>PC manufacturer will be reinstalled if
 your PC came with Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Kindly update us with the result.</span></p>

<p>- 1GB OEM Partition</p>
<p>- 455GB Primary partition</p>
<p>- 8.28GB Healthy recovery partition</p>

            <p>Hi Christian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you facing any issues with the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The partitions other than the primary partition is created by the manufacturer of the computer. If you want to delete any of those partitions, it is better if you contact them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you use Disk Management, a Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in, to create partitions on a basic disk, the first three partitions you create are
<span>primary</span> partitions. These can be used to start an operating system. If you want to create more than three partitions, the fourth partition is created as an extended partition. You can refer to the link below to know more about partitions in Windows
 operating system.</p>

<p>I was trying to install an update for Windows Messenger on 12th June and it includes (a) messenger, (b) mail, (c) photo gallery, (d) movie maker, (e) toolbar, (f) writer, (g) family safety and (i) microsoft office outlook connector. It downloads and installs
 up to 100% and starts rolling back.&nbsp;After some time an error message appears saying that "could not open key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Mocrosoft\Mec-F5A6-404B-9A78-7027FA6AADD". I tried it from Windows Live Essentials Download web site as well but with
 same results.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2006/09/04/739820.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2006/09/04/739820.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>I did it actually to solve my problem with Adobe Acrobat&nbsp;but it solved many other problems such media player 11 not showing video, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;(see my other threads)</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t play multiplayer Minecraft through XBOX live and can&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t play multiplayer Minecraft through XBOX live and can&#39;t sign into the marketplace</h2>
                    <p>I can't play multiplayer in Minecraft through XBOX Live because of how "my Xbox Live account is set up." My privacy settings are ALL adult and it's not working at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ALSO can't buy ANYTHING from the Marketplace (EVEN if it's free). When I try to buy something, it asks me to sign in, and when I do, it says something went wrong. This is frustrating me very badly. Anyone else experiencing this?</p>

<p>Hello negativize!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. Is the account that you are playing with&nbsp;tied to an adult account through
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/security/add-family-member-on-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
a family</a>? Is the account a child account? We recommend checking the<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/security/cannot-change-my-privacy-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> privacy settings
</a>on our website. The privacy settings for Xbox One/Windows 10 and Xbox 360 must be adjusted to the preferred settings. Be sure to let us know the results!</p>

<h3> diamondsx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t install Asus Smart Gesture even after uninstalling it</h2>
                    <p>Hello guys! Like many others I'm also having the issue that I can't install Asus Smart Gesture for Windows 10. My problem though is that I have already uninstalled the old version of it (Windows 7) but I still can't install the new ones. This keeps appearing:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66578d22-2593-4ca3-8969-31a37aba4e0d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66578d22-2593-4ca3-8969-31a37aba4e0d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? Cause I'm pretty sure the old version's gone because the first time I tried to uninstall it, it wasn't and this kept appearing</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e137b22-e479-4fc9-8c42-23dc5c0e8d14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e137b22-e479-4fc9-8c42-23dc5c0e8d14" /></a></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, we appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are facing with installing the Smart Gesture drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have&nbsp;occurred due to installer service or corrupted drivers,&nbsp;we will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the below and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Check with the status of the status of the installer service.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Windows Installer service: </strong>adds, modifies, and removes applications provided as a Windows Installer (*.msi, *.msp) package. If this service is disables, any services that explicitly depend on it will fail to start.</p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows Key + R</strong>&nbsp;on the keyboard and type <strong>
services.msc</strong>, Services window gets opened.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Search for </span></span><strong>Windows Installer
</strong>service<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>,&nbsp;right click on it and click on <strong>
Properties</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Start </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">the service, set
<strong>Startup type </strong>to <strong>Automatic</strong>.</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Restart the computer and check if you are able to install the driver.</span></span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>You can run Driver Verifier on multiple drivers simultaneously, or on one driver at a time. You can configure which tests to run, which allows you to put a driver through heavy stress loads or through more streamlined testing.</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/dn305113(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Driver Verifier: What's New</strong></a></p>

</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. Kindly update the status of the issue, we will be happy to help you.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the fast reply! </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the first Step, but it didn't change anything. I still couldn't install the driver. I also had trouble to change the Startup Type to Automatic, so that I had to use the method like this&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-installer-start-up-type-stuck-on-manual/82a4e2cd-dc03-4f78-85da-18b3ee38502a">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-installer-start-up-type-stuck-on-manual/82a4e2cd-dc03-4f78-85da-18b3ee38502a</a>
 to change it to Automatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also did Step 2, but I'm not sure which drivers it should run through, so I chose some drivers of the list that have to do with Microsoft, but it also didn't help. So, I still can't install the driver.<br />

    <title>Dead motherboard, new machine, can digital license be transferred - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jbelian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dead motherboard, new machine, can digital license be transferred &#40;if so, how&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Windows Pro purchased from MS Store and installed on a HP machine without media, properly registered via digital licensing process. &nbsp;That computer’s motherboard has now failed, making it impossible to boot or otherwise access the info on it. &nbsp;I have purchased
 a new computer - it’s a Mac, but intel chip allows installation of a Windows bootable partition. &nbsp;All of this works fine except (obviously) I can’t digitally activate the new machine as things stand now. &nbsp;I don’t plan to revive the old machine - not worthwhile,
 it’s very old. &nbsp;The purchase of Windows Pro shows on my MS store account, so someone there can easily confirm I paid retail for the product. &nbsp;BEFORE I get on the phone and wait however long it takes to get someone to answer this question, does anyone here
 know: &nbsp;Will Microsoft allow my previous digital license to activate a new install on a completely different machine? &nbsp;I don’t want to waste my time on hold just to be told “No.” I have scoured online sources, but they all presume scenarios slightly different
 from mine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            Hi Jbelian 
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with question on license after hardware change.
<br />
<br />Linking Microsoft Account with a digital license after a hardware change
<br /><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-re-activate-windows-10-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-re-activate-...</a>
<br />
<br />To determine if you can you must first determine the version of Windows you have.
<br />
<br />When we purchase Windows operating system, we purchase them through different types of licenses. These Windows License impose restrictions, terms and rights which are based on Microsoft Software License Terms. The most popular license terms are  Retail (FPP (Full Packaged Product)), OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer), and Volume Licensing.
<br />
<br />Retail license - yes. You can move it to a different computer as long as it's only installed on one computer at a time (and if it's a Windows 7 Upgrade version the new computer must have it's own qualifying XP/Vista license). The previous Windows 7 installation on the old computer must be formatted/deleted. You might have to call Microsoft and explain what happened to complete the activation. Activating it on the second computer will automatically in effect "deactivate" the license for the first computer. The key will work with both 32 and 64 bit, but only one can be installed at a time. 
<br /> 
<br />OEM license - no. OEM licenses, including Windows preinstalled on a computer before purchase, are tied to the first computer they are installed on and can not be transferred to a different computer. To install Windows on a different computer you will need to buy another copy. 
<br />
<br />Volume Licensing: Volume License Keys are issued by companies for use on client computers of its own organization. Volume License Keys and Volume Product keys are not-for-resale keys and they cannot be transferred if computer changes ownership. Volume License find applications in government and educational institutions. The prices for volume licensing varying depending on the type, quantity and applicable subscription-term. A volume license key (VLK) can also indicate the product key used while installing software licensed in bulk. It allows a single product key to be used for multiple installations. For example, the Windows Enterprise edition is activated with a volume license key.
<br />
<br />To determine what kind of license you have here is a link that will show you how.

            Hi Jbelian
<br />
<br />If the license is the full version Windows 10 Pro digital download and not the $99 Windows 10 Pro Pack, yes, you can transfer it to your Mac and reactivate it. 
<br />
<br />If the license was linked to your Microsoft Account, then all you need to do is install Windows 10 Pro through Boot Camp then follow the steps below.
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation 
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Sign into your Microsoft Account
<br />Select your previous machine then click Next for it to activate.
<br />
<br />If it does not activate, change the machine name to the one listed in the Activation Troubleshooter wizard.
<br />
<br />Restart the machine, then try activating again. 
<br />
<br />See steps how to change your machine name below. If you still encounter problem, then you will likely need to contact support:

            Thank you, Andre. The MS Store receipt includes precious little detail about my purchase, but it does include the price - $99.99 - &nbsp;and I am going to assume it is therefore unlikely to be transferrable. Your clear reply is a godsend in that you have recognized
 that I cannot turn the old machine in to find out any info! For that, and your helpful tips about trying to change the machine name, I thank you and bless you. Microsoft is lucky that when they farmed out the job of answering questions, some of the people
 who have picked up their slack are actually competent. Have a great day!
