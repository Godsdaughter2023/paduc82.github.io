<h2>            Blue Screen on Surface RT after Optional updates were installed</h2>
                    Help, I have a Surface RT, has anyone experience a blue screen when putting on optional updates after installing the necessary ones. My laptop starts up pass the Logo but after that goes into a blue screen. I've tried turning it on and off several times
 but still get the same results. I have upgraded to windows 10 in the past and would like to keep it if I have to reset my laptop.

<p>Hi Gail,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A blue screen stop code error may be caused by either a software or a hardware issue. We would need to determine and isolate this and do several troubleshooting steps. Please just bear with us for the time it may take to resolve this but we'll get this sorted
 out.<br />
<br />
You mentioned that whenever your device boots up, it goes into a blue screen. You also mentioned you updated your Surface RT to Windows 10. Has your device worked fine with Windows 10? We're just looking into the possibility that it might be one reason causing
 the Blue Screen.<br />
<br />
Give us an update so we can assist you further.</p>

<p>Hi Sujith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There might be a software-related issue that's causing the touch keyboard icon on the taskbar to constantly blink. Just to clarify, which build and version of Windows do you have? Have you tried to perform a clean boot, see if the problem persists? If not,
 you can go to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> and follow the steps on how to do a clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us an update, and let us know if you have any additional concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Regards.</p>

                    Ever since I updated to windows 8.1 I can't open the device manager, and then in 10-15 minutes a message pops up saying this app isn't supported on this version of PC. Is there any way of fixing this. Please can someone help asap.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As I understand you are not able to open device manager after upgrading to windows 8.1 and after every 10-15mins it gives an error saying that device manager app is not supported on this version of PC. It could be due to hardware or software changes
 or missing windows updates or third party application issues. </span>Device Manager will also usually display an error message with an accompanying error code. There are many different Device Manager Error codes.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></li><li><span>Do you get any error code?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Using Device Manager, you can determine which devices are installed on your computer, update driver software for your devices, check to see if hardware is working properly, and modify hardware settings.</p>
<p>So you can try the below steps.</p>
<p>Step 1: Install all windows updates on the computer:</p>

            <p>Thank you for replying. Sorry for the delayed reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You said that all updates are installed on the computer and did you try the other steps. What happens when you&nbsp;try to open the device manager?</p>
<p>To open device manager please follow the steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press Windows key + R </li><li>Type&nbsp; <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong></li><li>Check if you are able to open device manager</li></ul>
<p>If you still have the issue, navigate to C:\WINDOWS\system32 and look for devmgmt.</p>
<p>If you are able to find it, click on it and check if it helps in opening the device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still have the issue, try SFCSCAN and check if you are able to open device manager.</p>
<p>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files. It is same as third step mentioned above.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is not resolved, do get back to us.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 is the WORST OS EVER&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have worked in IT for several years (currently, JUST a consumer), so I have quite a bit of technical knowledge.&nbsp; With that in mind, I am so frustrated with the Windows 8 OS.&nbsp; I can't tell you how many times I've had to do a Google search on how to fix
 something or find a work around.&nbsp; For example, printing a PDF file.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; It seems a menu item would be available from a right click.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, have been unable to get my GoDaddy email to work from either the Metro or Desktop.&nbsp; It works off and on.&nbsp; I've changed from POP to IMAP, but it is inconsistent.&nbsp; The email will sometimes work on Metro - but I often need to manually sync and even then
 it doesn't always work.&nbsp; Sometimes sent emails will go to the intended recipient, sometimes they don't.&nbsp; Quite the mystery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel as though this is a Beta or "Consumer Preview".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only reason I am using Windows 8 is because I got a new laptop that was preloaded w/Windows 8.&nbsp; Big bummer for me.&nbsp; Am seriously considering returning the laptop for one loaded with Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just saying...<br />

<p>I dont know if this has been discussed before, but what does everyone think about this?&nbsp; I dont know if there is any info about this in the books? I have them, but not read them yet.&nbsp; I wonder what this weapon thing is all about, and whether it will play
 a role in ME3?</p>

<p>I just thought (only played a couple of times, so going from memory here) that this weapon thingy sounds rather important. Now, I kno they have to work on the fact that dlc is not owned by everyone, but this seemed like a pretty major thing. I mean, the
 Reapers are invading, and there is some secret weapon out there, that only a few humans are aware of? All this info, is locked up in the memories of one of Shepard's (former?) squadmates. Fascinating stuff in my book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT. Kasumi should have been in from start! Jacob should have been dlc!</p>

<p>TBH, I'm not sure... there may be some consequences (I'm actually hoping we'll get to confront Balak from the "Bring Down The Sky" DLC from ME1 in ME3), but until ME3 is released all we can do is wait and see.</p>

<p>prior dlc cant play a significant role in mass effect 3 because theres no guaranty that everyone has played it. hopefully bioware does more than just emails and throw away dialogue between missions tho</p>
<p>its possible [but highly unlikely] bioware could release dlc for mass effect 3 that addresses extra content from other games, betting that someone has all the dlc for all 3 games is a bit much tho. again, highly unlikely</p>

<p>'Arrival' will play a significant role in ME3, as that was a major event (Same with Lair of the Shadow Broker and Overlord) imo. WIth all the DLC made either for free or fairly cheap for PS3 users, I recall a post made by Casey Hudson stating that the PS3
 version is the one they'll be basing ME3 from (I can't find the link, but I do remember that.), so with the free DLC made available for PS3's, it is probable that they'll address the extra content.</p>
<p>While it's true that not everyone will have gotten all the DLC (for either the PC, PS3 or Xbox 360 versions), we honestly won't know until ME3 is released next March.</p>

<p>I think it just makes sense to destroy the grey box. Not because of any galactic security issue but rather it is quite clear that Kasumi would loose herself in the memories instead of living in the real world.</p>

            You can't. &nbsp;Both Access and Publisher are not available for the RT. &nbsp;You have to remember that the RT cannot install and run anything that is not available from the Store and the Office suite that comes with the RT is a recompiled version that only works
 on the RT. &nbsp;Microsoft believes that few users used Access and Publisher and didn't develop a version for it.
<div><br />
<div>I personally don't use Access but have been thinking of coming up with some database applications of my own and I also have a RT. &nbsp;I know a bunch of others who are engineers and also into construction that uses Access and think that maybe Microsoft may
 need to reconsider making a version of both Access and Publisher both for the RT.</div>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to try these steps and check if that makes any difference.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong>Boot the computer in
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>Safe mode</span></span></strong></a><span>and
 check if the issue persists. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode then perform a
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">clean boot</span></strong></a> to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating
 software conflicts. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong>: After troubleshooting, see the section “<strong><span>Reset
 the computer to start as usual</span></strong>” to return the computer to a <strong>
<span>Normal startup</span></strong> mode.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to follow these steps and run the

<h2>            Windows 10 wants a product key</h2>
                    So I upgraded to windows 10 when it was first available to download for free.. now all of a sudden it wants an activation key to activate it? I don't understand what is going on. I have never had this issue before. I'd love some help or thoughts as to
 why this is now happening? Am I going to have to downgrade my laptop back to it's original windows or reformat my computer to fix this issue?

                    <div style="text-align: left">I upgraded to windows 10 yesterday and everything is working fine except Cortana. When I try and click on it's settings in the notebook it just crashes/freezes. Also in Time/Language (windows settings) under speech when I click
 "Get Started" for set up your mic for speech recognition I get an error message saying "Wizard could not start - Make sure your audio hardware is working properly and check your audio configuration in the audio devices and sound themes control panel." I'm
 not sure what this means and it's stopping me from setting up voice recognition.</div>

            Hi again, I just tried Cortana on the other account and the same problem happened. I feel like it has something to do with the "Wizard could not start" problem but I don't really know.

    <title>Sharing folders on a Domain Network with Win7, non-domain computers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dlevasseur  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharing folders on a Domain Network with Win7, non-domain computers receive &#34;The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary domain failed&#34;.  Domain computers can access the share just fine.</h2>
                    
<p>I have 1 Windows 7 computer connected to the my SBS2003 Domain.&nbsp; This has been fine so far and I can see the network shares, logon scripts work, and domain settings seem to work.<br />
<br />
I use the administrative share for a backup program that runs on a machine that isn't connected to the Domain.&nbsp; It has the same workgroup name as the domain, but is not "attached" to the domain.&nbsp; This machine uses a Domain Administrator's credentials to log
 into each machine at night and backup the user's profile folder.&nbsp; This works fine for all machines on the network 2000,XP, Vista.<br />
<br />
The Windows 7 machine rejects the connection with the error "The trust relationship between this workstation and the primary domain failed."&nbsp; I assume this is because the backup machine is not listed in the domain.<br />
<br />
I also have various other machines on the network that are not attached to the domain but use the same workgroup name.&nbsp; These machines also receive the same error when trying to connect to any share on the Windows 7 machine.&nbsp; Connecting to shares via computers
 not attached to the domain results in a popup box asking for credentials.&nbsp; After proper domain/username/password is entered, they are allowed to browse the device.&nbsp; This no longer happens with Windows 7, the connection is rejected immediately.<br />
<br />
I assume this is some sort of security policy that doesn't allow shares to be browsed by computers not listed in the domain computers OU.&nbsp; Is there a way to disable this policy?</p>

<p>Hi crestonave,</p>
<p>Since you are having no issues updating the software from a new user account it looks like that the old user account is corrupted and you will need to fix it by transferring the files from old user account to new user account.</p>
<p><br />
For more information refer the below link.<br />

<h2>            upgrading from vista &#40;32bit&#41; to windows 7 &#40;32bit&#41;</h2>
                    I have a 1yr old&nbsp;Dell Inspiron,&nbsp;2 gigs RAM,&nbsp;but only 32 bit achitecture with NO 64 bit capability,&nbsp; is worthwhile to upgrade from vista (32bit)&nbsp;to windows 7 (32 bit) or should I just keep vista on it and&nbsp;eventually buy a new pc with windows 7 and 64 bit
 architecture?&nbsp; I'm not sure how much improvement I'll get with windows 7 (32 bit).

            For the most part, you will only notice a difference with 64bit if you have over 4GB of RAM. Since you have 2GB, if you like Vista and don't have any problems just stay with it until you buy a new computer. If you don't like Vista it's worth the upgrade
 - most people think Windows 7 is better.<br />

<h2>            In the Paint program add text to a drawing</h2>
                    In the paint program, after drawing a few lines and a curve I attempt to add text. I can acces all tool box icons, except the text icon will not respond. When I start a new paint program, before adding any drawing elements the text icon is active and it
 lets me add text. Any suggestions?

            Hi Matt,<br />
<p><br />
After you start working in paint do you use the zoom feature? The text option is disabled while the image is zoomed in, go back to 100% and you should be able to add text.</p>
<p>I apologize if this doesn’t apply to your situation. We look forward to hearing back from you so that we can further troubleshoot this matter if need be.</p>

    <title>The Worst gaming company of the year award - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hobblejp  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Worst gaming company of the year award</h2>
                    
<p>Well I think its about that time of the year again for the forums Worst company of the year awards</p>
<p>This is open this year to both publishers and developers</p>
<p><br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong></span>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">This is an entirely for enjoyment / fun forum thread not to be taken too seriously so please keep your fanboy rage inside rather than going report mad. Any company that ends up winning this will get no prize other than the knowledge
 of being the company people like least.</span><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Nominations</span></p>
<p>Company: Valve</p>
<p>Reason for entry: Well they managed that April fools day joke that was rather cruel. What people would get mad if some super lovable company wasn't added to balance this out.</p>
<p><br />
Company: EA</p>
<p>Reasons: Well having won the worst company in the US award that's pretty much automatic qualification here but since then it doesn't look like they're getting better. BF3 Online Pass code to "Keep servers running" only to then allow people to rent their
 own server, flooding their game with every self entitled little MLG [expletive] out there to kick people from servers for killing them. Add to this the new BF3 premium system and you'd think they'd have stopped there, however they didn't. With Mass Effect
 3 coming out the word from EA was "True Fans will buy it" an excuse to sell all kinds of crap and charge more just to get Day 1 DLC and a robotic pet dog in the game. Oh and managing to create a security weakness in xbox live due to Fifa 2012
<br />
<br />
<br />
Company: Bioware</p>
<p>Reason/s: After big Daddy EA hyped Mass Effect 3 through the roof and drove the fans into a frenzy, Bioware were left holding the baby unfortunately the managed to drop it a few times and really have a go at fans saying they were " ruining their art" that
 "fans didn't know how hard it was to make games" and of course "We only care what game developers think" (*looks at the XBLIG game Avatar Fart and shudders*) On then there was the whole thing of managing to even screw over the fans plot to try and convince
 them to change the ending.<br />
<br />
<br />
Company: Activision</p>
<p>Reason: COD Elite being the service that gives back to fans and turning out to be a way to charge for what 343/Bungie and Dice have been doing for a long time already. Add to this them playing the innocent and hurt / upset person when EA hit back after the
 Activision smack talking and once again Activision you're on here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Company : Crytek</p>
<p>Reasons: for their continued insistence that Timesplitters 4 wouldn't sell like if Ikea started selling £20 gold toilet seats and a Rap concert. The Idea was Crytek UK would make the Crysis 2 multiplayer and if it was seen as good enough they'd be let loose,
 well it was and they kind of were cut loose more in that they had a choice of 2 projects. Oh also for their comments about Second hand sales being like stealing food out of the mouths of Developers kids.<br />
<br />
<br />
Company:THQ</p>
<p>Reasons: Oh dear THQ have had one of their bad years. First they force out a rushed poorly made Red Faction game without the multiplayer vs features which made all the series better then they stop the series due to its poor sales. They Managed to remove
 the traditional Saints row cheats only to sell them on as day one DLC. The final main reason they are here is due to the Homefront issue, "Oh the Online code is to support the developers" 2 weeks after launch of the best selling game THQ have had all year
 pretty much up to that point and they forceably close Kaos studios apparently because they have financial issues which the online codes were meant to prevent happening meaning they then pocketed all the online code money too pretty much. Here's hoping homefront
 2 fails</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Company:Lucas Arts</p>
<p>Reason/s : Milking the force unleashed series and the reveal that they prevented the release of a pretty much completed Battlefront 3 game along with then causing Free Radical to close down at times refusing to pay the Free Radical staff it may have been
 a while ago now but this information has only just come to light.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Company: Gearbox</p>
<p>Reason: duke Nukem Forever (need I say more ? I may like it but I still know its a terrible game)</p>

<p>Company: From Software</p>
<p>Reasons: putting unkillable super enemies into peoples games if they started playing it before the official launch. Thus punishing those people who merely got the game a little early.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Company Mojang</p>
<p>Reason: for the countless hours people will no doubt end up playing on minecraft only to later wonder what the hell happened for those past 2 months of their life.<br />
<br />
<br />
Company: Capcom</p>
<p>Reason: The initial on disc DLC is required now to make things work and needed in modern gaming, which while they turned round on it still doesn't quite explain the madness of the next reason. Blaming cannibals for poor sales, ok cannibalism is a bad thing
 but to blame that for poor sales of Street Fighter x Tekken is madness when the real reason was people objecting to the on disc DLC.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Company: Microsoft</p>
<p>Reason/s: it wouldn't be a list without them to start with but with Kinect 2 on PC expect to retail at £220, a bigger focus on Kinect for the 720 apparently, now trying to get Lion Head studios to make kiddy games and kinect games so much so even ever enthusiastic
 Peter Molenyeux resigns and doesn't have faith in it being the best thing since Sliced bread the game , you know there's an issue. Managing to screw up XBLIG sales stats for months then managing to end up being 1 month late paying the devs their 3 months worth
 of game sales money, all this on a service where they take 2/3 of the sales money and charge £60 a year to use for developers, add to that the fact they've managed to forget about their "Kinect for indie games" dev tools and you have a big issue there. Also
 the adverts on the new dashboard which were dire and launch and still don't seem much better. Also keeping Rare in the cupboard of making kinect games too</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Company: Silver Dollar</p>
<p>Reason: for managing to single handedly lower to reputation of XBLIGs.</p>

<p><br />
<br />
Before someone asks I do this now rather than every actual end of year as its in the slow release time with least hype and least anticipation for a certain companies game so people are more inclined to think about companies not their upcoming AAAs.</p>

<p>The thing is I can kind f see the point of the fan anger I actually sat down and watched the side by side of all the endings and while fans might have made some silly comments they did pay for the game and found compared to the previous 2 there were actually
 less endings in a game where your actions are meant to have long lasting consequences. EA did kind of start the mess by playing their "True Fans " card and expecting fans to give them something so fans expected EA to give back on the whole "your own adventure"
 thing they've been on about for so long. Then for Bioware to pretty much lash out at these "True Fans" it was like biting the hand that feeds them. While I can to some extent see the point of the video games are art argument they are interactive art and in
 a game priding itself on interactivity and choices to have the ending/s it did kind of defeats the purpose of having it as an interactive media form.</p>

<p>Its more about MS's pet project Fable Heroes and the fact they managed to get Peter "I'm always super hyped our game will be the best ever" Molyneux to pretty much disown the game and say it would be bad, that's takes some doing considering the guy managed
 to think Fable 3 would be the best Fable yet</p>

            We can't. 
<br />You would have to buy the Software.

<h2>            How do I exit Steel Mill Second time&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Okay I'm sure its been ask and might be stupid question but maybe i'm over thinking it. But, I completed the game and went back for the Riddler Trophies.. But, now I have all them in steel mill I can't seem to get back to the exit. I'm in the Coolant B area
 at the first part u suppose to throw and freeze a patch ice in the water. But, when u do that the current is pushing u away from the part u came in at its not like u can crouch and walk off the patch ice. Is there another exit or a spot I'm suppose to grab.
 I'm stumped and I see there is no other Exit's on that map but the spot I entered from...</p>
