<h2>            Complaint about the irresponsable Hong Kong Customer Service and poor quality of the Surface Pro4</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;am now writing a complaint about the&nbsp;irresponsable&nbsp;Hong Kong Customer Service and the poor quality of the Surface Pro 4. I am the current user of Pro 4. Before it launched, I was so exciting to this product and I pre-ordered. The first day that I received
 the Pro 4, I was so disappointed, It could not operated normally. Since there was the defect of the product, so I had no idea to returned it on the first day and I had to wait almost a month to receive a replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last month, I found that there was a defect at the buttom&nbsp;of the screen.&nbsp;Then I called the Hong Kong Microsoft Customer Service to&nbsp;seek&nbsp;assist.&nbsp;Then I realized there was no repair service in Hong Kong.&nbsp;The only&nbsp;way to solve this case is exchange another&nbsp;Used
 Pro 4. I think it is&nbsp;totally unacceptable. This is&nbsp;not&nbsp;my&nbsp;first time to&nbsp;experience the&nbsp;poor product within a year! You can only replace an used product. How could I have the confident to use it. Then I calmed that I could not accept this settlement and request
 a senior staff to contact me, however the answer was the same. I replied could it be the special arrange to me since this was a specal case that unpleasant experience twice within a month. I understand that it would take much time to discuss the issue, so
 I sggested them to reply me a week later. However I did not receive any call or email until NOW!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not believe Microsoft such as a leading company in this industry did not respect the customer. I believe&nbsp;Mircosoft&nbsp;should follow up my case. It is totally unacceptable. I would like to receive a reasonable reply or I would like to tell my unpleasant
 experience to the media!</p>

    <title>Windows resumes from sleep mode by itself and reboots. Error The - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bastian weber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows resumes from sleep mode by itself and reboots. Error The bugcheck was&#58; 0x00000116</h2>
                    <p>I have noticed a weird behaviour recently, that I cannot explain and that is very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I put my PC to sleep last night, it resumed from sleep automatically. The event log says:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">23:20:14 The system is entering sleep.</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">23:20:16&nbsp;The system has resumed from sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's on thing. Then it stays awake, and some hours later, it rebbots. In the event log I can find the following entries (error):</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">05:24:25&nbsp;The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">05:24:43&nbsp;The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck. &nbsp;The bugcheck was: 0x00000116 (0xffffe000719d8010, 0xfffff80149f567b4, 0xffffffffc000009a, 0x0000000000000004). A dump was saved in: C:\WINDOWS\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: d83e6320-86ce-4092-ab5b-a74fc4465fde.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I encountered this behaviour a couple of times by now. However, I never had a problem, like a reboot, when I was using my PC. Everything runs fine then. I have wake timers disabled, so I don't see a reason why my PC should wake up from sleep autonomously.
 I don't know if this problem is caused by Windows, but I suspect so. Furthermore, this never happend with older versions of Windows like Windows 8 on the same machine.</p>

            I made a clean install of my graphics driver. However, the problem occured again yesterday. It follows the same scheme: The PC awakes after being put to sleep, and one hour later it reboots, probably after a crash. I never have any crashes apart from that.

            <p>I again had the problem today, however, with much worse result. Yesterday evening I realised that my PC had awoken by itself. I turned on the screen an all I could see was a solid grey screen (grey is the background color of my login screen). There was no
 interaction possible. In the end I could do nothing but reset the PC. Login seemed a bit slow but I didin't pay much attention and put the PC to sleep again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning after I had woken up the PC and logged in I noticed that I couldn't open the start menu. Furthermore, many actions seemed to be terribly slow (like bringing up the context menu of a file or folder). The general performance of applications was
 as normal, but all Windows functionality had big delays. I tried some tips from the internet, but couldn't get my start menu to work again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I decided to try and restore a system restore point. This was not successful. After a reboot Windows told me that this couldn't be completed because System Restore failed to extract the original copy of the directory from the restore point and that
 the restore point had been damaged or that it had been deleted during the restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My next attempt to fix my OS was downloading the media creation tool and telling it to upgrade my PC. This had worked for me before to fix system errors. It seems to reinstall the system without affecting programs and settings. However, I had to realise
 that this didn't help as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I reset my PC using Windows' reset function. This made me lose all my installed applications, so now I am sitting here setting up my system again, which is quite a pain in the **** (installing Visual Studio, CUDA and a dozen other development tools).
 The thing is that actually I'd have work to do, like finishing my Master's thesis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that at least now the problem I had before will now longer occur.</p>

            Thanks for responding but that didn't help. They need to have a button in that same notification that says "unblock this publisher". It makes no sense that HP is being blocked as a publisher<br />

            <p>Further to this I have now got the printer driver installed OK on my computer. &nbsp;I was doing several things at once so I'm not sure what achieved it in the end. It may have been because my printer was switched off when I was trying to reinstall it, or perhaps
 because I made a new download from HP, including support solutions. &nbsp;Either way that "blocking this publisher" message was not helpful!!!</p>

<h3> hhl530  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to build a Windows 7 Kiosk with active desktop feature</h2>
                    I'm upgrading my Kiosk machine from Windows XP to Windows 7. This kiosk only have access to 6 links on the active desktop, other than that user don't have access to start menu, taskbar, and can't go to different website from the browser.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In windows XP &nbsp;I used active desktop to show a local html file, that will display 6 links, when user click on the link a new ie window will open they will be direct to the site, and when user close the Internet Explorer (ie) window all the browsing history
 will be delete.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In windows 7 because active desktop is not available, so i have to use ie kiosk mode. So here are some problems.</div>
<div>- I'm not able to auto delete&nbsp;browsing&nbsp;history</div>
<div>- User able to close ie by right click at the icon on taskbar. If I set never close ie under group policy, then I can't close the window that open when user open using one of the 6 links.</div>
<div>- I have also tried to disable right click under group policy, its disable somes but right click on ie icon on taskbar still available.</div>
<div>- Is there a way to keep the Internet Explorer kiosk mode window always open, and still able to close the new window that open up when click on one of the 6 links?</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Update - Check backup disk space</h2>
                    My backup disk was full before upgrading to Windows 8.1. After the upgrade, the "Check backup disk space" message is still in the Action Center and I can't get rid of it. Nothing happens if I click "Options" since I think it's been removed in 8.1. I've
 formatted the backup drive but it hasn't fixed the issue. Please help.<br />

<h2>            No disk storage remaining &#38; cannot free disk space on Win RT 8.1</h2>
                    <p>My disk space is 100% consumed on my RT Surface.&nbsp; I have used the Window's Disk Cleanup to clear all space possible.&nbsp; I believe the problem is that OneDrive and OneNote may be syncing to local storage, even though I have configured these as "make available
 online only."&nbsp; I am unable to uninstall programs.&nbsp; When I ctl-x into "Programs and Features," it states that there are "No programs are installed on this computer,"&nbsp;which I can only assume is due to the space-full problem, since I have many programs installed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in search for a solution to get my RT back.&nbsp; I've read a lot of posts...most say, 'use disk cleanup,' which does not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any recommendations appreciated. </p>

            One drive and recovery partitions keep on growing larger with time and cause this issue, you can try taking a backup of recovery partition on usb to free at least 4gb... After a backup you can delete the partition with recovery.. It's funny that engineers
 at Microsoft are sleeping on these issues.

<p>With time the installer folder grew to 14 gb and since that folder can not be deleted and it keeps growing as new windows updates are released, the 32 gb surface tablets become useless good 8 gig is taken by system and ms office already; you can delete the
 backup particion but that saves you for a little time.</p>

<p>I had to do a complete&nbsp; system restore to get it operational again. I can already see the disk space being taken up again without adding any programs or files, only system updates.</p>
<p>I'm glad that they still provide regular updates though.</p>

<p>Thanks all for replies.&nbsp; By way of update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a system restore,&nbsp;(full restore). Used the work around to get update working and now have a completely functioning Surface RT.&nbsp; Things to note.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do a full restore there is a good chance that Windows update will get stuck and not update to RT8.1 and subsequently the 'update 3'. There is a work around for this and you will need to manually download install some updates from a USB stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to avoid having my Surface fill up was to use a local account NOT a Microsoft Account.&nbsp; As soon as a Microsoft account is used it will sync with Onedrive and fill up the Surface Storage, even when files are checked as on-line only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are much less apps in the RT Store these days, I lost access to quite a few.&nbsp; If they have been removed from the Store you cannot restore apps even if you purchased them in the past.</p>

    <title>Asus VivoTab Powers On Then Immediately Shuts Down - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Asus VivoTab Powers On Then Immediately Shuts Down</h2>
                    Bought this tablet 2 years ago.&nbsp; It was used for a few weeks by an employee and then put away until last week.&nbsp; I did a full reset on it and proceeded to install the 8.1 update and several important and optional updates after that.&nbsp; Everything seemed fine
 until today, when I installed 6 optional updates.&nbsp; Upon completion and restart, the unit will now not stay powered on.&nbsp; I hit the power button, the unit vibrates a bit and shows the ASUS starting screen. I can barely get signed in and to the start page before
 it just automatically goes into shut down.&nbsp; I don't know how one could uninstall those updates, (assuming they're the cause of this sudden odd behavior), since the thing won't stay on for more than 5-6 seconds.&nbsp; I've seen a few threads about similar issues.&nbsp;
 Some reference Windows, some are about Asus, but I can't find anything that's exactly this particular issue.&nbsp; Thoughts, anyone??<br />

            <p>Hi there, I actually know what the problem is AND the solution!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Marc - I did exactly the same as you. I hadn't updated for a while and went and installed all the updates, next thing I know the pad shuts down immediately after opening..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is this <strong>optional</strong> update</p>
<p>Intel - Other hardware - Intel (R) Dynamic Platform and Thermal Framework Generic Participant</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using multiple resets to get back to that point before the failure and systematically went through all until I found the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with our tablets is that if you are like me, you have no mouse or keyboard etc to get back into safe mode to try and reset. So you need to do a hard reset to get into the PC settings menu on start up. Now Asus didn't do a very good job at explain
 how to do that did they? We know there is a hole that you can put a safety pin into but to use it there are no actual instructions in the manual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use these steps as follow (you have to trick it first);</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press the button in and hold till the startup ASUS words come up, then using a paperclip, press the button inside the hole. You need to do this at least 3 times to artificially turn it off prematurely.</p>
<p>2. On the fourth time, let it start again by itself normally, it should tell you that it had some problems starting up and reboot into the reset mode.</p>
<p>3. If you have a restore point, you can use the advanced settings to go back to that safe point before the update. If you don't you can do a refresh etc (pick your poison) to go way back before and start again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I had no restore point and had to basically do a fresh install. It took a couple of days to get back to the place where I could then reinstall windows 8.1 (which is much more user friendly). Just keep going with the updating until it allows
 you to update back to 8.1. Some times you think you are done but its actually installing something in the background so be patient. It really does take a few days of constant updating!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, once you get back to the nice place where it all began before you loaded the Intel update, PLEASE CREATE A RESTORE POINT!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any troubles installing win 8.1 let me know. There are a few tricks to it that are not written anywhere on the web for our tablets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sonja</p>

<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that you have no chance to open the keyboard screen to get into safe mode and the device automatically shut down itself. This issue might be cause by a hardware issue that unable to respond properly. We would suggest you to contact the manufacturer

<h3> phrustrated  say:</h3>
<h2>            Your computer is running low on memory. Quit other programs, and then try again.</h2>
                    
<p>I note that others have the same issue and replied that your suggested solutions didn't work but you checked the query as answered anyway.</p>
<p>I have windows 7 and windows media player 12.0.7600.16667. I play approximately 3 or 4 videos and get the error message "Your computer is running low on memory. Quit other programs, and then try again.". As others have noted I have attempted suggested fixes
 using the troubleshooter and suggested fixes found in similar queries (adjusting virtual memory etc). NONE OF THESE WORK!! These problems did not manifest themselves until I installed windows 7 and windows media player 12. How about a solution that works!
 Would reverting to WMP 11 be a possible solution? Any other suggestions besides running the troubleshooter and changing the virtual memory?</p>
<p>I have Gateway with AMD Athlon(tm) 62x2 dual core processor 6000+ 3.0GHZ and 3Gb RAM.</p>
<p>Also have ~2Tb of physical memory and 3Gb RAM to play with so my computer memory is not the issue, windows 7 or windows media player 12 or the combination windows7 and WMP 12 is the issue. If you can't offer a viable solution please ask Uncle Bill to divert
 some resources to solving this issue please (preferably before the next overpriced and under-performing version of windows is thrust upon an unsuspecting public). Thank you.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Does this issue
 occurs only while using WIndows Media Player or other applications as well?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you made any recent changes on the computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above step fails then perform&nbsp;<strong>clean boot</strong> procedure to check if any third party program installed on the computer is causing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup
 is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Refer the below link to know more about clean boot procedure.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in&nbsp;<strong>Step 7</strong> in the above KB article.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span><span>Preventing low memory problems</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I would also suggest you to run&nbsp;<strong>Msconfig (system utility tool</strong>) and place a check mark on maximum
 memory and see if you get the same error again. To do so follow the steps provided below:</span></span></span></span></p>

</p><p>This error code occurs because the computer cannot download the required files from Windows Update.
</p>
<p>
To fix the error code for Windows 10, follow these steps:
</p><ol>
<li>Download the Windows Media Creation tool, and create an ISO image locally, or create an image for the version of Windows that you have installed.
</li><li>Configure the Group Policy as in Method 2, but also follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Mount the ISO image that's created in step 1.</li><li>Point the "Alternate source file path" to the ISO sources\sxs folder from the ISO.</li><li>Run the gpupdate /force command.</li><li>Add the .Net framework feature.</li></ol>
</li></ol>

    <title>Customize an OEM Disk to Install XP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Customize an OEM Disk to Install XP</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased an OEM Dell Windows XP Install Disk online and I want to use it for my Dell Latitude D600. It seems to have come with an integrated product key, so I went into the nLite program and removed the product key from the disk and burned it to a new
 CD. Is this new disc fine and legal to use? If I use it to install it on my D600 and use the product key on the bottom will XP be fine after installing drivers? Can I use this disc with other computers as well? I know XP is out of date, but I want to have
 a genuine, and legal XP disk ready at my disposal in case I want to revert from Xubuntu Linux. I'm still used to the Windows layout, and I might return despite the risks. Also, do OEM Windows licenses die with the hard drive, CPU, or mobo?</p>
<p>

<p>Do not do that! Follow the instructions here:</p>

</p>
<p>You want the original product key on the Dell branded XP Reinstallation CD. This is a generic Dell System Locked Preinstallation Key which will automatically be input and activate when installed within a Dell BIOS (such as that present in the Latitude D600).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its best not to have a Windows XP installation connected to the internet as the OS is its reached end of life. I advise updating it using the WSUS Offline Update and leaving it disconnected.</p>

            <p>Okay, so even though this is a reinstall CD I purchased online not for that specific model, I do not need to make changes to use it? The BIOS will automatically activate the system? I thought that was on only new computers. That's nice to know. When I check
 in nLite though, it shows that the CD has an integrated product key? Does the PK just input itself into the system and activate if the system is a Dell product?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The install DVD I created via NLite before that slipstreamed SATA drivers, Service Pack 3, and removed the product key that was on the OEM CD, &nbsp;could I use that on other machines since it asks me for the product key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I'm installing XP directly from the reinstall CD I purchased online and I will download the updates directly via Windows Update. I'm not sure sold on the unofficial SP4. I just feel like sticking to official Microsoft updates.</p>
<p>

 on XP and everything seems to be well. Will there be no activation problems with the system in the future? Can I use that CD on any Dell that had XP on it?</p>

            <p>You can use the Dell XP Professional Reinstallation CD on any Dell which came with Windows XP Professional, Windows Vista Business or Windows 7 Professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the Dell XP Home Reinstallation CD on any Dell which came with Windows XP Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the Dell XP Media Centre Edition DVD on any Dell which came with Windows XP Media Centre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be no future activation problems. My testing with unofficial Service Pack 4 has been unsuccessful so I recommend using the WSUS Offline Update to fully patch Windows XP as it saves many hassles with Windows Update:</p>

    <title>I have the &#39;BOOTMGR is missing&#39; screen - has my HDD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brett sanftleben  say:</h3>
<h2>            I have the &#39;BOOTMGR is missing&#39; screen - has my HDD failed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My HP computer 'crashed' this afternoon. It was switched on and running normally, then froze, then restarted and got as far as a black screen with the text 'BOOTMGR is missing, press CTRL + ALT + DEL to retry'.</p>
<p>This is the first time this has happened. I did the CTRL + ALT + DEL several times but got the same result. When I go in to the Boot Menu the system can see my 500GB 'D' drive and my 160GB 'E' drive but not my 500GB 'C' drive that has Windows 7 installed
 on it. This has led me to believe that my hard disk drive has failed or developed a fault which is preventing the system from accessing the boot files for Windows 7.</p>
<p>I switched the machine off, left it for approximately 6 hours, used it for a few hours this evening and the exact same thing has happened - it&nbsp;was working normally, froze, can't restart and can't see my 'C' drive. One change I&nbsp;should note with this drive
 is that for the very first time since I have had the computer the drive is almost 100% full - could this have revealed a previously unknown disk issue?</p>
<p>I'd be grateful for any advice. I'm thinking that I'll just switch the 'C' driive for the 'D' drive and re-install Windows again. If I catch the 'C' drive on a good day before it completely fails I can hopefully recover my personal media files that are stored
 on it. I don't mind losing the 500GB as all my data is stored on a 2TB NAS - the current&nbsp;'C' drive&nbsp;was only going to be full temporarily. Even if I do replace the drive, I know storage doesn't cost a fortune anyway. It's a bit disappointing though as I've
 only just recently replaced the 4GB of&nbsp;RAM modules for this machine after two weeks of 'Blue Screen of Death' headaches!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help...</p>

            <p>HI,<br />
<br />
The data on C: may still be accessible.<br />
<br />
If the D: drive is a separate physical drive then you could switch it to C: and install Windows<br />
on it. Of course you could format C: and re-install Windows on it though the drive would<br />
always be suspect.<br />
<br />
You could also back up the data and re-install Windows 7. The hard drive can be put into
<br />
another&nbsp;computer as 2nd drive (best) or into an External USB case. Either would allow you
<br />
to copy the data&nbsp;to removable media such as CD, DVD, or other USB drives. If you do<br />
install Windows on the now D: (after switching it to C:) then the old C: would become<br />
D: and hopefully the data would be acessible.<br />
<br />
Or you could use an Ubuntu boot CD to back up the data.<br />
<br />

<br />
Use the <strong>Advanced Methods</strong> and the <strong>Manufacturer's Diagnostic Utilities</strong>, and the
<strong>trial <br />
programs </strong>below to thoroughly check the drive. The top methods are for casual checking in
<br />
the future as needed.<br />
<br />
Disk issues can get serious very quickly so I would thoroughly check the drive now and be sure<br />
to keep redundant backups of your important data (use several methods).<br />
<br />
Inside Windows - Regular or Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot).<br />
<br />
Run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />

<p>Truncation seems to happen with user profile folder names when MSA is used. Local account has no such issues. You can

            <p>Depends how your Windows device connects to the internet.&nbsp; Does your Windows computer connect using your phone's connection?&nbsp; If so, data usage on your computer will cost you against your limited number of GB's for data on your cell phone.&nbsp; That's not a
 "problem", you just have to be aware of what your limit is and make sure you don't use too much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your computer connects through an "unlimited" home internet connection that has unlimited data use, you can tell Windows that it's not really a metered connection and it will not try to save data any more.&nbsp; To do that, just touch-and-hold (or right-click)
 on your wifi connection name (just like you were going there to connect for the first time) and you can unset it as metered.</p>

            <p>Hi JuanGmz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done tests with the same device environment, same iOS version and Skype for Business version. However, the meetings show correctly on my side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please change another network environment to test? I mean that you can use your phone telecommunication network ( like 3G/4G ) or home wifi to check if the issue persists.<br />
</p>
<p>If it doesn't help, please uninstall the app and reinstall it to see if there is any improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I'd like to confirm if your organization is connecting Skype for Business on-premises or pure Skype for Business online. It may need the IT admin to answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lance</p>

    <title>Redundant Lenovo ALPS UltraNav trackpad drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> polyprobatos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Redundant Lenovo ALPS UltraNav trackpad drivers</h2>
                    <p>So, I got a notification the other day, in my Windows 10 Pro system tray, that new ALPS UltraNav drivers (for trackpad) were available. I postponed installing them for a while, since my laptop (trackpad included) was working just fine, without separately
 installed ALPS UltraNav drivers. However, it being Windows 10, I eventually <em>
had</em> to install them, so I did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Thinkpad laptop&nbsp;doesn't have a touchscreen, and there really is no difference between having the dedicated ALPS UltraNav driver installed or not. The trackpad works in exactly the same way, and there is no performance difference either,.. for the trackpad.
 There<em> is</em> a performance difference for my laptop overall though. The dedicated ALPS drivers, which otherwise seem to serve no&nbsp;practical purpose, bog down the system a bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can this 'update' PLEASE be removed as a Windows roll-out update? It makes no sense to fix something that ain't broken, only to slow down the system and have another process to start up and running in the background continueously.</p>

<h2>            Microphone too low.</h2>
                    <p>I have had a problem ever since i got my Lenovo G70-35 that my microphone is so low that you can barely hear me. I tried to update to the latest drivers and it worked but then when windows 10 had to update it became bad again.
</p>
<p>And now i've tried everything from updating drivers to trying to change the microphone volume in the microphone settings tab to changing microphone that i have plugged in and it just won't work, i've tried doing basically anything i can find on the internet
 but it wont work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey locksk8r666!</p>
<p>It looks like there's a problem with your Microsoft account. This issue is best resolved over the website before trying to sign in on your console. Here's more information on what you can do to resolve the issue:

<p>Hey there, what worked for me when this happened was once the profile download failed and the error code popped up I tested my Xbox Live connection which showed everything was working fine and my console could connect to Live.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>After that I was able to download my profile without issue, so see if testing your connection after the failed profile download helps.</p>
