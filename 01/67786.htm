<h2>            looking for MMORPG equivalent to World of Warcraft and Diablo.</h2>
                    
<p>I have played World of Warcraft for years. I also have played Diablo from the beginning. Now I have got A 360 console and am looking for an equivalent to the above-listed RPGs. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>yeah hes been on a pc playing the games he listed, so he was looking for an alternative not someone telling him to play his pc. I dont understand how some people make it to level 5 on these forums, they are not helpful at all in their posts and are usually

<p>So would you prefer we give him bad info? PC is the only place to get MMOs, end of story. The ones on consoles are either already on PC or subpar because they have to be watered down to fit on a console.</p>

<p>ya, I played WoW for over 7 years, I'm actually trying to get away from it, not to mention take advantage of my 60" TV in the living room. Plus I was an old xbox gamer so with the new TV I went ahead and got the 360...&nbsp;&nbsp; of course right afterward I read
 that the 720 or whatever will come out in another year...&nbsp;&nbsp; but so what...&nbsp;&nbsp; anyway, I want something "like" WoW or Diablo and figured this was a good place to post. Something a little lighter on content might actually be better as the reason I'm moving away
 from WoW is cause I can't invest the time required anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once again thanks for your input and suggestions.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One won&#39;t start after update</h2>
                    So, last night I was informed of an update to be performed. I agreed, started the update and walked away. After a while I came back and the console was powered off. This morning I try to turn it on and I hear the chime, power button lights up for a second,
 and then turns off again. I have tried every troubleshooting technique I can find (unplug cord, wait for 10 seconds, unplug everything wait for 5 minutes, continuously press eject button) and nothing works. I've even tried the procedure to manually install
 an update offline but can't get to the install screen by pushing all three buttons. I've tried the online support here and all it says is to try unplugging and if tht doesn't work to send it in. I've tried to contact an actual person with support but am rerouted
 to the forum. This console was just purchased a week ago and has only been in use for three days. Overall a very unpleasant experience.

<p>Are you able to access other features like settings? If so, have you tried viewing the setting where it shows you the "current update" and see what that tells you. Have you tried a hard shutdown? Another thing to try, since it is a new system reset it...technology
 isn't always perfect...their could have been a system glich. If not let me know and I can try and help further.</p>

<p>Hi CJ's Beard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us with this issue. Sorry to hear that you're having issues with your console and the update. Since you're not having much success with the offline system update and would prefer to send in your console at this point, you have
 a couple of options to do so on your own since you haven't been able to contact support. Don't forget to register your console after signing into your account.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set up the repair yourself online</a></li><li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/locations/find-a-store?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact a Microsoft Store near you</a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I did see that you've had the console for about a week and this also gives you the option to return it to the point of sale as well if you wish as an option. If you would like to continue to troubleshoot on your own prior to anything else, then I'd recommend
 using the&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox One System Update Solution</a> to see if it makes a difference, if you haven't already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps out!</p>

            Thanks for the fast reply. I have tried the hard shut down and no I can't get to any screen. It will not power up at all. I think at this point I'm going to take it back to the point of sale as others have suggested.&nbsp;

            <p>Yes.&nbsp; This is a problem that can occur from time to time.&nbsp; Generally, the issue is caused by a hardware fault with the storage device.&nbsp; Sometimes the problem appears after a download glitch, but this almost never happens because the data is verified when downloading.<br /><br />The reason why the system says 'disc read error', even when installed on a USB&nbsp;drive - or traditional Xbox 360&nbsp;a hard drive is because the Xbox 360 Operating System is quite basic and has never been programmed/updated to record specific read errors from anything other than a DVD.&nbsp; This does not mean there is no read error, there is, otherwise the game would be still be working.<br /><br />Generally, deleting and re-downloading a game with this issue won't help as the game will occupy the same location on the storage device again,&nbsp;and will&nbsp;produce the same issue.&nbsp; The only option you have is to delete the game, go to the marketplace and add a demo.&nbsp; When the demo has downl

<p>Yes.&nbsp; This is a problem that can occur from time to time.&nbsp; Generally, the issue is caused by a hardware fault with the storage device.&nbsp; Sometimes the problem appears after a download glitch, but this almost never happens because the data is verified when
 downloading.<br />
<br />
The reason why the system says 'disc read error', even when installed on a USB&nbsp;drive - or traditional Xbox 360&nbsp;a hard drive is because the Xbox 360 Operating System is quite basic and has never been programmed/updated to record specific read errors from anything
 other than a DVD.&nbsp; This does not mean there is no read error, there is, otherwise the game would be still be working.<br />
<br />
Generally, deleting and re-downloading a game with this issue won't help as the game will occupy the same location on the storage device again,&nbsp;and will&nbsp;produce the same issue.&nbsp; The only option you have is to delete the game, go to the marketplace and add a
 demo.&nbsp; When the demo has downloaded, re-download your game again.&nbsp; This will insure that the game will occupy a different location on the hard drive.<br />
<br />
If it's a USB device, you'll need to replace it.&nbsp; USB Flash storage has no moving parts and stores data in a&nbsp;completely different way.&nbsp; Even USB&nbsp;Flash storage doesn't last forever.</p>

<p>This thread is quite old, so please create a new post if the problem isn't solved with the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>As said above, if you get a disc read error for a download game, the download is corrupted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either because of a faulty download (during transmission through the internet the data became corrupted), or because the game downloaded correctly onto a defective area of your storage device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ideally, get a new USB storage device that is large enough for the download, and try to re-download it again to that new storage device. Delete the old download, as it is broken and can't be repaired, because the Xbox 360 will not check for internal download
 errors. It only sees that a file with the correct size exists, but doesn't check for corruption in the download.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you just try to download it again without deleting, the console will not actually re-download a fixed download.&nbsp;</p>

'repair installation'</a> which should leave things mainly as they are, see the 'ITEMS THAT WILL BE RESET TO DEFAULT OR AFFECTED:' section, but should leave your accounts and installed programs etc alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or have a read to acquaint yourself of the procedure and wait a while to see other possible suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I hate to say it but, Just as a check, update your AV package and run a full scan, just in case. It shouldn't take too long and it seems a few of these missing 'windowscodecs.dll' posts have been possibly related to malware. And maybe run the MS scanner
 as well as an extra check -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-gb/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-gb/default.aspx</a></p>

    <title>Mouse&#47;Touch input for Windows Connect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jbcdn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse&#47;Touch input for Windows Connect</h2>
                    <p>I have seen at least two different extensive threads on this subject without resolution. When connecting an Android device using SmartConnect to Windows Connect, the keyboard function works but the mouse or touch input on the Windows PC does not. Instead
 a notification appears directing the user to enable touch input in the Action Center -&gt; Connect area. Microsoft's standard answer is the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we recommend that you check the&nbsp;<span>Action Center&nbsp;</span>and check if you're able to see the&nbsp;<span>Allow input from a keyboard or mouse&nbsp;</span>option. If the option is available, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Under&nbsp;<span>Action</span><span>&nbsp;Center</span>, click&nbsp;<span>Connect</span>&nbsp;button.</li><li>Click the name of the device you're trying to project.</li><li><span>Uncheck</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span>check</span>&nbsp;the&nbsp;<span>Allow input from a keyboard or mouse connected to this display&nbsp;</span>option. Kindly refer to the screenshot below:&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c21d94d9-aeb6-46a2-bb60-d52a6b691f8b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c21d94d9-aeb6-46a2-bb60-d52a6b691f8b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This, however, does not work. I have tested this on several Windows PCs with and without touchscreens and it makes no difference. The option does not present itself and therefore there is no way to control the connected device from the PC. The creen
 merely functions as a remote display. It does not mirror the Android device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you provide a solution?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 &#43; RawInput &#43; XBox One controller removal &#61; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guavamanx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 &#43; RawInput &#43; XBox One controller removal &#61; fatal system crash - How to report this&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've discovered a reproducible fatal crash in Windows 10 when using the Xbox One controller with Raw Input. It has been verified by multiple people on different PCs. I've got a repro VS project ready, but I don't know where or how to get this information
 to Microsoft. This is a pretty significant bug IMO because it could affect thousands of games that use Raw Input.</p>
<p>What happens:</p>
<p>In Windows 10, after calling&nbsp; RegisterRawInputDevices and registering to receive WM_Input messages from HID usage page 5 (gamepad) with an Xbox One controller attached (wired or wireless), once you unplug the Xbox One controller, the entire system will become
 unstable and unusable requiring a hard reboot to recover. More specifically, Desktop Window Manager seems to go into an infinite loop, maxing out a core, and then all mouse clicks fail, after a few clicks the mouse cursor frame rate drops to about 3 fps and
 with every movement or click a beep sound is played. Keyboard input still works, so even force closing the application does nothing. Trying to shut down the system or Desktop Window Manager does nothing. The only way to recover is to press reset on the PC.</p>
<p>There is no way I know of to get RawInput data without registering for the devices, and once you do that, this crash occurs if the controller is disconnected. If you unregister the devices before disconnecting the controller, it does not crash; however,
 unregistering the devices JIT by using device event notifications does not prevent the crash as it seems Desktop Windows Manager already goes into the infinite loop by the time those system events are sent.</p>
<p>I happen to know this error did not occur a couple of months ago, therefore I believe it was something in a recent Windows update that caused this. In addition, it never occurs with Xbox 360 controllers, clones, or on Windows 7.</p>
<p>Any information on who to contact or where to file this bug report would be greatly appreciated. I've also posted this to MS TechNet.</p>

            <p>The first thing to check is whether the files still exist on your hard disk in the original locations.&nbsp; A project file in Windows Live Movie Maker does not store any video, photos or music.&nbsp; It just stores a reference (the file name) to where the file is
 on your computer (the hard disk, a temporary folder, an external hard drive, etc.).&nbsp; If you've done anything in the meantime to rename, move or delete those source files, WLMM will show you an exclamation point instead.</p>
<p>If you have just renamed or moved the files to another folder, simply double-click on the yellow triangle and choose 'Fix' then find the new location of the file.</p>
<p>As for the video shown inside Movie Maker, it only shows you a thumbnail view of the video clip where the first frame is shown.&nbsp; But if you click play, you should see it move through the whole movie.&nbsp; You can zoom into the storyboard/timeline by changing
 the zoom scroller in the bottom right.&nbsp; That will give you an expanded view of the timeline.&nbsp; You can also make splits to break up a long video into separate scenes.&nbsp; Each split will cause Movie Maker to show a separate new thumbnail for that split off portion.</p>

    <title>What is SLRuntimeLoader and why does it always stop working&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What is SLRuntimeLoader and why does it always stop working&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Windows Vista laptop. Whenever I start my computer I get an error message "SL RuntimeLoader has stopped working. Windows is collecting more information about the problem. This might take several minutes." Needless to say, Windows still hasn't
 come up with a solution. When I wake the computer from sleep mode, I sometimes get three or four of these error messages in succession. There seems to be no noticeable difference in the way the computer performs. Any idea what's going on and how I can fix
 it?

            No one has been able to suggest an answer to this problem in the five weeks it has been posted, but I think I've stumbled on the solution by accident. I recently began having trouble with ImageBrowser EX, software that Canon includes with their digital
 cameras. After contacting Canon and getting nowhere with the problem, I gave up on ImageBrowser EX and uninstalled it. Voila! No more "SLRuntimeLoader" error messages.

            Got it. On Xbox One, if you use the home console setting, your two accounts can share games and DLC no problem. If its already set up that way, then yea hopefully its a temporary glitch! :)

<h2>            Old not connected device shows up in Devices and Drives area of Windows Explorer - Win 10</h2>
                    <p>My wife's laptop has Windows 10 installed and working. &nbsp;From one of her previous wireless networks 'Network Discovery' was turned on for a while. A co-workers MacBook Pro shows up under the "Devices and Drives" area in Windows Explorer... Have tried multiple

<p>
</p><p>The old computer is not connected to the same network</p>
<p>It doesn't show up in Devices and Printers</p>
<p>I see no obvious driver in Device Manager for it</p>

<h2>            Cortana&#39;s pop ups are invasive and I can&#39;t turn them off</h2>
                    <p>With the latest update, Cortana has started giving me unwanted suggestions that pop up in the bottom right corner, usually when I first log into my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I wanted someone to suggest what I should do without me asking, I would call my mother-in-law.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I wanted random interruptions throughout my day interrupting my work flow, I would... ok who would want that??</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to Cortana's settings to attempt to turn off the notifications, I'm told I need to sign in and give Cortana access to "things like search history and other info on your device" before I can even access settings. When I opt out of this, I'm told,</p>
<p>
</p><p>"I'm afraid I can't help out without that permission. I'll be happy to do anything else that doesn't require that, though."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are. You. F*ing. Kidding me, Microsoft? "I'm afraid I can't allow you to do that??" Do you think this is funny, or are you trying to feed into AI fears and a discomfiting lack of control over our devices? Go to ****, worst UX designer ever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Devices that intrude on you and can't be turned off are terrifying. Time to move to Apple. But in the meantime, can you please tell me how to turn off Cortana's unwanted suggestions without giving this intrusive "assistant" access to my f*ing diary?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides killing it with fire. Because right now, tempting.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for trying, but that's not helpful at all. For one thing it's a completely different problem: that thread is related to search pop-ups while using the touchpad, and my problem concerns suggestion pop-ups when I first log into my laptop (not related
 to touchpad use at all).</p>
<p>In other reasons why this is not helpful, when I go to Settings/Devices/Mouse and Touchpad/Touchpad, the only setting I can change is the degree of delay, which has nothing to do with even that thread's issue.
</p>
<p>So this is still very much unresolved. </p>

            <p>I'm not actually worried (for now), just annoyed at the interruptions. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But I can't see any way to turn Cortana off. Instructions online say the first toggle under Cortana's Settings allows you to turn it off, but that option is not available on Windows 10 Cortana (see pic).</p>
<p>
</p><p>(And - in case Microsoft is listening - I really don't want to turn Cortana off; I'd love to explore its potential. I just want an option to turn off its intrusive suggestions. An assistant should be there when I want it, not knocking on my door going, "Did
 you eat your vegetables today?" or whatever asinine thing it deems important.)</p>

</p><p>There is another way to turn off the suggestions made by Cortana. The second option is by launching the

            you've been bugging the Microsoft team for this issue with no solution. I have the same problem for a while now, and the solution I found is a third party link. check this out:

            <p>Thanks BlackWeedow. I'd rather not mess with the registry, but it's helpful knowing you have the same issue and I will definitely save this as a last resort.</p>
<p>My larger goal here is to let Microsoft know that invasive elements like this that can't be turned off are a real sore point for users, and they are going to lose customers if they don't figure it out and give them options (that don't involve workarounds
 like messing with the registry).</p>
<p>"The things you own end up owning you." A computer is a tool, not a master. If you ignore this fundamental human desire to be able to control our own world, you are going to lose.
</p>
<p>It's what Apple Watch marketing understands - how to make digital notifications less intrusive? This is what customers are moving towards. It's not a backlash against computers. It's a backlash against being controlled by our devices, and it's only going
 to grow. Don't miss the boat.</p>
<p>So I'll wait for Microsoft to notice this thread and explain why they think it's better for users to not be able to turn off Cortana's popup suggestions - or fix the issue.
</p>
<p>Microsoft has consistently chosen invasive marketing and monopoly strategies over user needs. That's their MO, and like any forceful strategy it is sometimes effective, but at the cost of having a consumer base that kind of despises them and is ready to
 switch teams. I'm about at that point. </p>

    <title>There was a problem while resetting your PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr. djuvik  say:</h3>
<h2>            There was a problem while resetting your PC</h2>
                    <p>Hi all!<br />
<br />
As I'm sure you all know by now Windows 8/8.1 is packed with problems both large and small. My own worst prolems have to do with the mandatory update: Every third day or so the computer is forced to restart and try to update only to fail. This takes forever
 every single time.<br />
<br />
So now, after having lived with the problem for way to long, I finaly decided to resett the PC to factory settings and loose all my files (no backup). My NEW favorite problem is that this isnt posible.<br />
Windows is preinstaled so I have no disc: I start the resetting proces from systems, but after some minutes I get the message,<br />
"<em>There was a problem while resetting your PC"</em>,<br />
and the entire process stops. There IS an option to troubleshoot the problem, but the troubleshootingbox appear and disappears in seconds without doing anything at all.<br />
The same thing happens when I try to refresh the computer in order to save my files. In short, nothing works.<br />
<br />
Please help. And if posible, dont post links to long manuals. Try to explain the problem/fix in your own words.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Yea..that's all good and gravy ngocphi, but what do I do if I haven't the slightest clue what the security question's answer is or some of the other information. I created my account (that I still can't sign in to because of the latest update with the Windows
 Live ID thing) years ago and most of the information is my mother's. I asked her and she has no clue about most of the stuff. So right now I'm screwed and don't know what to do all because I don't know some stupid security question.</p>

            <p>Hi Ruth</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was an upgrade from 8.1 via the update.</p>
<p>If it matters, I forced the upgrade with the following command from the command prompt since the machine alerted me the update is ready but wasn't preforming it:</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 three versions 1607, 1703, 1709</h2>
                    Anybody can clarify my issue, I would appreciate. I get confused with three versions. I have been running version 1607, and no problem updating any KBxxxxxxx updates. However, I can not update any KB's of version 1703 and 1709. Why three version? Do I
 have to have all three version installed? Thanks in advance.

            i am continually getting upgrade advice from Microsoft to install windows 10 version 1709. My computer downloads everything usually over a period of two to three hours, gets to the end then re-installs the previous version of windows being 1607. I am fed
 up with windows wasting my bandwidth time after time with no result. I have used Microsoft since the early 1980's &amp; think maybe it is time to switch over to Apple. All my associates with Apple computers&nbsp;don't seem to have these upgrade issues.

            I also have a paid Microsoft Assist account for online help. You arrange for Microsoft to log in to your computer, when they do and cannot solve the problem they just disconnect your chat line and the help connection. You then have to log in again and
 same scenario. If I ran my business like Microsoft I would have no customers. They just rip every dollar they can from you &amp; give nothing in return. You cannot even ring someone for help. I think their operations are bordering on dishonest as they are not
 governed under local Australian consumer law. I wish they were.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you logged in as the administrator?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you able to perform other administrative level functions such as installing applications, creating accounts, making changes on the system etc?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to start your computer with default/inbuilt administrator account and check for the issue.</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
To start the computer with default administrator account follow the below provided steps.<br />
<br />
1. Open the Microsoft Management Console console and select Local Users and Groups. Click
<b>Start</b>, type <b>mmc</b> and hit enter to open MMC console.<br />
2. Right-click the Administrator account and select Properties. <br />
The Administrator Properties Window appears. <br />
3. On the General tab, clear the Account is Disabled check box. <br />
4. Close the MMC console.<br />
5. Log off, and you will now see the built-in Administrator account log on icon added (enabled) from the log on screen.</p>

<br />You can change your User account name here:

<br />
<br />This will not change the User account folder which requires these other steps:

<p>I recently had to get my hard drive replaced, and the computer repair guy misspelled my name on the User drive. It's not detrimental to anything, but it's really annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I change this? Or, how do I make a new account, and will I need to put all of my files and programs on an external storage device and move them over?</p>

Misspelled, then show it where I can fix it, or you fix it

<h2>            Win 7 and LG GP50Nb40 USB DVD Writer - unknown device</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased the LG GP50Nb40 external USB DVD writer and i am running Win 7 64 bit. &nbsp;i connected the device with the provided cable and windows said there was already a device and refused to read the DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have an internal HP DVD writer. &nbsp;so i assumed there was a conflict and disabled the HP device. &nbsp;Windows still refused to recognize the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so i enabled the HP and put the LG install disc in it and copied the whole thing to my hard drive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>then i opened up my desktop case and disconnected the power and sata cables from the internal HP DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>then i turned the computer back on and did the LG software install from disk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>then i downloaded a firmware update from LG as per their software.</p>
<p>it failed because it said i did not have the specified LG device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but i do have the LG connected via USB 2.0 hub but i can not use it all all.</p>
<p>windows shows an unknown device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there anyway to get my LG external to work or do i have to return it to Fry's Electronics?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have already spent over 2.5 hours on what should have been a very simple install, which is why i bought a USB device instead of an internal device.</p>

            <p>Assuming that you've tried connecting it to different USB ports -- preferably a USB port on the back plane of the computer and not through a hub -- I'd assume that the device is defective and return it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I can tell, this external drive does not have its own power supply and relies on the USB for power.&nbsp; This can cause problems if you have other devices drawing power.&nbsp; Try it connected directly to the computer with no other USB devices connected
 other than mouse and keyboard.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Start - type Search box -&gt; calculator&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list - Right Click on - COPY then go to a blank area
<br />
of the Desktop - right click - Paste. Then you can paste into the Start Menu as desired.<br />
<br />
Normally it is here :<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs - Accessories - Calculator<br />
<br />
An excellent 3rd party Calculator - Free<br />

            If it came preinstalled, then it likely is a trial? Did you eventually purchase a subscription for it? Is the subscription active?
