<h2>            Windows 10 ITB hard drive filling by itself</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 10. My 1TB hard drive is rapidly filling itself and I have no storage space left. I have moved all my files and deleted programs, and it's still not helping. What should I do?

<br />Treesize should tell you which files and folders are taking up the space.
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />It is worth checking the Users folder and its subfolders with it.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

            Hi Randy, Okay, we need to dig a little deeper . . .
<br />
<br />Windows and indeed Windows Explorer is useless when it comes to working out where your hard drive space is being used . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility called Treesize. Using that tool, you will instantly see where this space is being used
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have worked out where this space is being used, please let me know so I can advise on what is safe to remove . . .

    <title>GFWL, Steam, Windows 10 and You - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ackis  say:</h3>
<h2>            GFWL, Steam, Windows 10 and You</h2>
                    
<p>GFWL can work on Windows 10, however it may take a bit of additional work to get it working fully.</p>

<p><strong>Purchased from Steam:</strong></p>
<p>Steam is a wonderful platform - you buy the game, install it and it should just work. &nbsp;Well with GFWL that's not always the case. &nbsp;The reason is that Steam is required to redistribute the exact version of GFWL that came with the game. &nbsp;This means that you're
 getting older versions when you install from Steam.</p>
<p>To fix this you need to install the latest version of GFWL. &nbsp;You can see instructions under the Windows 10 header.</p>
<p><strong>GFWL Achievements on Steam:</strong></p>
<p>If you're worried about achievements for GFWL there is still a way to get them.</p>
<p>Some games on Steam (Ms. Splosion for example) allow you to install the Steamworks version or the GFWL version. &nbsp;Other games (Batman Arkham series, Toy Soldiers, and many more) have patched GFWL out completely. &nbsp;You won't be able to get the achievements
 for these games anymore.</p>
<p>These games may aiuto-update to non-GFWL versions, however there is a way you can prevent this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the game from the Steam list of games. </li><li>Right click, and go to properties </li><li>Click the Updates tab </li><li>Under automatic updates select "Only update this game when I launch it" </li></ol>
<p>This will prevent the game from getting updates automatically, however you'd still need to update it when you try to play it. &nbsp;You can get around this by setting Steam to offline mode when you launch the game.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 10:</strong></p>
<p>Getting GFWL to work on Windows 10 take a bit of extra work. This can be fixed pretty easily by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Removing GFWL, the Marketplace, etc. from your PC </li><li>Reboot </li><li>Download the latest version of GFWL from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-CA/Live/PC/DownloadClient" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-CA/Live/PC/DownloadClient</a>
</li><li>Install it </li><li>Reboot </li></ol>
<p>Now with GFWL this doesn't have a 100% success rate. &nbsp;However you can try the exact same steps and it'll work the second or third time you do it. &nbsp;Pretty annoying, but at least you get to play your game.</p>
<p><strong>DLC:</strong></p>
<p>Any DLC that you have purchased in the past will still be accessible and you can download it. &nbsp;However you cannot purchase anything new. &nbsp;There are a few ways around this. &nbsp;For example Dirt 3 has a physical copy that includes codes for all the DLC.</p>
<p>If you have a DLC code it should still work, you just need to enter it via the GFWL client.</p>

<p><strong>Games for Windows Live Release Date Activation:</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes when you install a game that uses Games for Windows Live it'll ask you to verify the release date of the game online. &nbsp;When you click the accept/next button it gives you an error that you're not connected to the internet.</p>
<p>Thankfully there may be a very simple fix for you. &nbsp;Change the date on your computer to be in the same month/year that the game was released. &nbsp;For example, Batman Arkham City was released on October 18, 2011. &nbsp;Changing your system clock to October 30, 2011
 and then trying the activation will work.</p>
<p>Contrary to what SecurROM support states (<a href="https://support.securom.com/pop_batmanac.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.securom.com/pop_batmanac.html</a>) the Games for Windows Live service is NOT shut down.</p>

<p><strong>GFWL Log File Locations:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>The log files for the GFWL client may provide some insight into what's breaking with GFWL. &nbsp;These files are located here:</p>
<p>C:\Users\&lt;Username&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\GFWLive\Logs</p>
<p>You can access/view these by:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the Windows Key + R </li><li>Type in: C:\Users </li><li>Press enter </li><li>Find your user name. </li><li>Navigate to AppData -&gt; Local -&gt; Microsoft -&gt; GFWLive -&gt; Logs </li><li>Right click on the log file and choose Open With </li><li>Select Notepad (or another text editor) </li></ol>
<p>The default Windows Notepad program will let you see the contents, however due to the nature of the log files they may be hard to read. &nbsp;I personally use a program called Notepad ++ (<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://notepad-plus-plus.org/</a>)
 which makes the log files a bit easier to parse. &nbsp;Right now I have one line in my log file that is&nbsp;48849 characters which turns out to be 14 pages.</p>
<p><strong>What to look for in the log files:</strong></p>
<p>This is hard to say without knowing a specific problem, however searching for the word "error" may help. &nbsp;As I mentioned above, some of the log lines may be quite long, and you'll have to use your judgement on if they provide any information that's of use.</p>

<h2>            Skype VoiP system</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I run a small business and am trying to use skype as my main phone line. Is this possible/recommended?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, I struggle to get skype to be on consistently as it keeps logging out and isn't the most responsive when someone calls (i.e. usually takes about 3 rings before it shows on my mobile) then I usually have to say hello twice because there's a small
 lag at the start? Is anyone else having this issue, if so what's the fix? Is skype business any better?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy to invest into a proper phone for the skype setup and have done in the past but the one I bought just cancelled it's skype support I believe...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is much appreciated!!</p>

 college course, only have 3 left, to get my degree.&nbsp; this uninstall completely hinders my ability to work or to do my homework.&nbsp; I have 8 assignments per week that require me to be able to utilize MS Word.&nbsp; What am I supposed to do?

            Hi Amy 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. First see whether they are installed or not. To check this type Excel or Word or PowerPoint in Windows search (Cortana) and see whether they come up or not. If yes, they can be pinned by right clicking on them.
<br />
<br />2. Another way to check it - type appwiz.cpl in Windows Start Search Box (Cortana) &gt; Click appwiz.cpl &gt; See whether you have your Office listed here or not.
<br />
<br />3. Start Excel by double clicking any Excel file &gt; CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to open Task Manager &gt; In Processes tab, right click on Excel &gt; Open File Location &gt; See whether Word.exe and Excel.exe and Powerpoint.exe and other MS Office product exe are there or not. If they are there, right click &gt; Create shortcut and pin the shortcut 
<br />
<br />4. Try repairing your Office installation. First try Quick Repair (takes 5 - 10 mins) , if that doesn't help then try Online Repair (Takes more than 30 mins but less than 1 hour in general)
<br />
<br />(it might ask for product key for Office 2013 or below. Hence do it if product key is available for if you had Office 2013 or below)

            Hi Amy
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Sounds like you have logged into a temporary profile. Try restarting your computer a few times. Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />At the sign in screen, click the power button, then click Restart. Do this a few times then try signing again. If the desktop still does not show up, then you will need to  create a new local user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Shift + Esc
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Click Add
<br />
<br />Enter a user name
<br />Password, confirm it, create a hint
<br />Click Next
<br />Click Finish
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files 
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account.
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Which Antivirus utility do you have installed? Can you try disabling it temporarily to see if the apps work?
<br />
<br />Also, try launching each Office application in safe mode to see if they work. If they do, its possibly a bad add in.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-office-apps-in-safe-mode-on-a-windows-pc-dedf944a-5f4b-4afb-a453-528af4f7ac72" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/open-o...</a>
<br />
<br />Press the windows key + R and write the command to open the office app in error, below are the commands to open all office apps:
<br />
<br />For Excel: Type excel /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Outlook: Type outlook /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Word: Type winword /safe, and click OK.
<br />For PowerPoint: Type powerpnt /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Publisher: Type mspub /safe, and click OK.
<br />For Visio: Type visio /safe, and click OK. 
<br />
<br />Disable add ins:
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-manage-and-install-add-ins-in-office-programs-16278816-1948-4028-91e5-76dca5380f8d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/view-m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the problem persists:
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try running the applications again. 
<br />
<br />You can also try repairing Office:
<br />
<br />Which version of Microsoft Office (2016,2013,2010,2007) or Microsoft Word/Excel/PowerPoint etc. is it? 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type each of the following commands then hit Enter to open the respective application.
<br />
<br />winword
<br />excel
<br />powerpnt
<br />msaccess
<br />outlook
<br />mspub
<br />
<br />This should open Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access, Outlook and Publisher.
<br />
<br />You can then right click and pin each to the Taskbar if you wish.

            Hi Amy
<br />
<br />What version of Office did you previously have installed on your PC, is that Office 2016, 2019 or do you pay a subscription to Office 365?
<br />
<br />Is your version of Office supplied to you by your education institution or is it a private licence?

<h2>            Printing problems with Canon Pixma MX920 printer connected with wifi</h2>
                    <p>I have a canon pixma mx920 printer. It is connected via wifi. I have a desktop computer running windows 7 and have no trouble printing from it. The trouble that I am having is printing from my laptop which is running windows 8.1. I have installed the printer
 on the laptop but when I go to print it says that it cannot communicate with the printer. I have gone into printer properties and ticked bidirectional printing but when I apply it doesn't keep the changes. Can you help.

            <p>Hi Sandra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your reply and I apologize for the delay in responding to this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue usually happens when there are some issues with the printer driver, the printer service is not running or some printer associate system files are damaged.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this printer was working fine with your Windows 7 computer and the issue has started very recently, it seems that there could be some issue with the printer service on the computer. Let us restart the services and check the status of this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Start the “Print Spooler” and set the Startup Type as “Automatic”</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>R</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard to open the “<strong><em>Run</em></strong>” command box.</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;Type “<strong><em>Services.msc</em></strong>” in the “<strong><em>Run</em></strong>” command box.</p>
<p>c)&nbsp;In the “<strong><em>Services</em></strong>” window, double-click on “<strong><em>Print Spooler</em></strong>” service to open the properties window.</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;Stop the service, if it is already running and then restart the service by clicking on the “<strong><em>Start</em></strong>” button.</p>
<p>e)&nbsp;Now, select “<strong><em>Automatic</em></strong>” from the “<strong><em>Startup type</em></strong>” drop menu.</p>
<p>f) Click on "<strong><em>Apply</em></strong>” and then “<strong><em>Ok</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>g)&nbsp;Close the “<strong><em>Services</em></strong>” window and restart the computer.</p>
<p>h)&nbsp;After the restart, check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please get back to us with the troubleshooting result.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Corrupted Windows 10 Lock-screen Picture - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kn1000a  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupted Windows 10 Lock-screen Picture</h2>
                    <p>Hello, this issue recently started to happen to my 64-bit Dell Inspiron Windows 10 (upgraded from 8.1). I don't know how but lately the lock screen on my PC start to change by itself from time to time without me messing with the settings. Usually I would
 have it set to this as I like to see backgrounds changing here and there:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b6ed8bd-4d24-4bce-80ef-b6e913f1066f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b6ed8bd-4d24-4bce-80ef-b6e913f1066f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But recently something went wrong with the Windows spotlight photo and sometimes when I turn on my PC I got this corrupted version of the picture:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d46ae624-9665-41b9-856d-3548543a6ad0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d46ae624-9665-41b9-856d-3548543a6ad0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(*That blue bar is just a watermark)</p>
<p>When I visit my setting for Personalization I got this:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f3342bd-681c-4064-a7f6-090f9dfe4f65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f3342bd-681c-4064-a7f6-090f9dfe4f65" /></a></p>
<p>(Notice this had happened to me a few times and each time those corrupted versions will save itself in this Picture location. I can still revisited them through this setting page when choosing Picture as my background source, so these photos are not temporary).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know the location of this Picture place since clicking "Browse" bring me to the general My Pictures folder. Also after this, I would choose Windows Spotlight as my lock screen source again, all for it to be changed probably the next time I turn the
 PC on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was wondering if there is anything to check on my computer. Here are also a few things that can be helpful to this situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>1. I have Bing Desktop installed. </strong>I like changing wallpaper everyday, and this program does it automatically so that's why I have it. I don't know how much of an impact this does to my problem though considering that, as I mentioned above,
 I do have Bing Desktop installed way before this problem occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. Something went wrong with my PC/explorer module recently.</strong> I think this is the more suspicious one as it happened close to when this background thing started. For some reason, some location on my PC will be harder to access, as in opening
 certain folders will take a very long time to load (the green loading bar keep going on and on...). Fortunately before I post a question on here, I booted in Safe Mode, tested those certain folders, restarted, then be patient and waited for those folders to
 load once I am back on normal boot. The problem went away, and my antivirus + Malwarebytes didn't find anything bad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>__________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone out there will be able to advise me on what to do next. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to perform Startup repair with these steps:</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>1. Start your Windows 10 machine, and quickly shut it down before it reaches or if it is at boot screen. Do this two times repeatedly.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>2. On the third time, Windows 10 will automatically display 'Your PC couldn't start properly' message. Now press Esc key for recovery options. If your Windows doesn't displays anything,
 you need to boot from bootable USB and then click Repair your computer link after language selection on setup.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>3. Then under Choose an option screen, click Troubleshoot option and now click Advanced options option.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>4. Under Advanced options screen, click Startup repair. Your system will restart now and then perform repair. Let it complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If nothing helps, you can make a clean install using this guide:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587</a></p>

            Hi Mmf123456789 
<br />
<br />I know how frustrating the System Restore process can be, but honestly you may have bricked your Windows installation by interrupting that process . . 
<br />
<br />Please try the below, to see if Windows can be repaired, if not, your only option may be to clean install Windows 10
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<p>I' ve heard over that nothing actually happens. U would have to get rid of that patch and of course play offline to do that glitch. I have pub games and I like the prizes, I just wish I didn't have to put so much time in for them. Those weapons aren't worth
 the time. Love the high- rollers coat.</p>

            There's not much you can do about such spam (other than using a different email address). Believe it or not, Outlook.com's SmartScreen filtering is deleting 90-95% of such messages on the server (i.e., before anyhthing downloads into your folders). The path of least resistance would be to disable the Reading (AKA Preview) pane and then delete everything in the Junk Mail folder on a regular basis.

Otherwise, you could add the offending email addresses (i.e., FROM addresses) and domains/websites to your BLOCKED SENDERS list but the offending sources are constantly "morphing" so that wouldn't help for very long. 

Ditto for using Message Rules to delete such qualifying messages from the server (i.e., Delete these messages—don't even put them in my Deleted folder).

    <title>Two Xboxes - both with same audio issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> knoxsanders  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two Xboxes - both with same audio issue</h2>
                    
<p>Both of my Xbox Ones have an audio issue. Whenever I am playing a game (all are digital), watching a DVD/Blu-Ray, or using other media with sound components I have an issue. This occurs on multiple TVs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After only a few minutes of use from startup, game audio becomes distorted for seconds at a time. The period of audio distortion can last from half a second to two or three seconds. In some cases, with one of the Xboxes, the audio would get so bad and so
 prolonged that I would have to quit the game and restart it, only to have the problem potentially happen again 30 minutes later. Adjectives that describe the sound include:
<em>distorted, garbled, tearing, screeching</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I <em>can</em>&nbsp;describe what is happening when this issue occurs. This problem
<em>usually</em> happens during heavy processing or heavy load scenarios: killing a thick horde of zombies in Dead Rising 3 or engaging in multi-ship battles during Assassins Creed IV play. Having the audio issue
<em>usually</em>&nbsp;take place during times of heavy stress on the console leads me to believe that it is an operating system issue, as does the fact that both of my Xbox Ones have this issue. Wouldn't the odds of me having the same audio problems for both consoles
 be incredibly low if it was a hardware problem?</p>
<p>In the case of Blu-Ray or other media, video frames freeze for 1-2 seconds, and then quickly increase their framerate in order to catch up with the audio. The issue increases in frequency the longer the media is viewed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hard restarts and factory resets have done nothing to fix this problem so far. Hopefully the next update will address this problem...assuming it is a software optimization issue. Anyone else experiencing something similar? It is getting hard for me to believe
 that this is hardware related. Help?</p>

<br />
As you are able to connect to home network, it appears to be an issue specific to second network that fails to connect.<br />
<br />
I suggest you to try the following steps. If the issue still persists, you may contact the Internet Service Provider.<br />
<br />
Let's refer to the following suggestions and check.<br />
<br />
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span> </b><span>I would suggest you to run the network troubleshooter.</span></p>

    <title>Downloads folder disappeared - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lenamagdala  say:</h3>
<h2>            Downloads folder disappeared</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
just looking for some hints. My friend is having a funny issue I was not able to explain. She has Windows 7 and is used to download all her stuff into her Downloads folder. And it suddenly disappeared (as she says) after visiting some new site. Apparently the
 folder was several Gb and she cannot find anything that was inside. Search does not find neither the folder nor the content. Nothing in the bin either. I assume that if it was somehow deleted it would be too big to go to bin and would just delete altogether.
 But she is pretty sure she did not delete anything and nobody else has access to her PC. How could this happen? Any ideas? Just trying to determine possible problem to avoid it in the future. Could some malware from some web simply delete the location into
 which a file is being downloaded?<br />
Thanks for any ideas,<br />
Lena<br />

            Hi, thanks for advices. <br />
My friend is going to download the Safety Scanner and try it later (normally she uses Eset).
<br />
Good ideas with the first two methods but we are struggling. The hidden folder did not help and the folder recovery did not work. For some reason there was not the recovery option after right click and I don´t understand why. Problem is that she had the folder
 situated on the desktop and she is sure it was not just a shortcut but the actual folder (unfortunately I am not able to verify it).<br />
I am just prone to think it is a lost case, but still wonder what did actually happen to it :-(<br />
Thanks for your help anyway.<br />
<br />

            <span>Hi Lena,<br />
<br />
As a last option we can try to boot to safe mode and check if the folder appears.<br />
</span><br />
<b><span>To boot to safe mode, refer to the suggestions from the following link:</span></b>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<span><br />
If you are unable to find the file, it might be deleted by virus. You need to use data recovery application to recover the file. Use your favorites search engine to download the data recovery application.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 cannot see 64bit machines or Windows Server 2008 R2 on network. Only 32bit machines are visible.</h2>
                    <p>I service a network with approx. 12 Computers including a Windows Server 2008 R2. My problem started when I installed a new</p>
<p>Windows 10 Laptop and all the 64bit computers became invisible but all the 32bit computers were visible.&nbsp; The problem was doubled
</p>
<p>when a Windows 10 64bit workstation which&nbsp; worked perfect running windows 7 was upgrade to Windows 10 by a company employee.</p>
<p>Same result, could not see the file server and could not map a network drive.</p>
<p>All computers and file server are visible from a windows 7 machine regardless of being a 32bit or a 64 bit.</p>
<p>I have read all the comments and tried a few things but nothing works.&nbsp; As my visit to the site is a round trip of 120km I am not impressed</p>
<p>that I have to stand the cost and time with a problem I did not create.</p>
<p>Can you help</p>

    <title>Win XP Boot and Event Analysis Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aldago  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win XP Boot and Event Analysis Problem</h2>
                    <br />
My Win XP Home SP3 has started to take an extraordinarily long time to boot. It hangs at a message that appears "C:\Windows\System32\wlnotify.dll" after the Windows Splash Screen. During the boot the Windows Splash screen goes off for about 2 or 3 seconds and
 then comes on again. After the wlnotify.dll message I get another message "Instruction at "0x7c919af2" referenced memory at "0x0000010". The memory could not be written.&nbsp; (There are probably only one or two people in the whole world who really understand these
 codes. Maybe one reads this forum.) <br />
<br />
"I've done antivirus and antimalware scans and I'm convinced that there is no malware present. I ran sfc.exe /scannow to verify Windows files. I checked the Event Viewer and the events under Application &amp; Security are clean. Under system I get several errors
 which I'm having trouble analyzing. <br />
I get two Service Control Manager errors as follows:<br />
1. The following boot-start or system-start driver(s) failed to load: <br />
szkg5<br />
szkgfs<br />
I can't find the locations of these drivers.<br />
<br />
2. The Windows Driver Foundation - User-mode Driver Framework service terminated with the following error:
<br />
A device attached to the system is not functioning.<br />
Can't find any way of identifying the device causing the problem.<br />
<br />
For completion I mention that I also had an AcrSch25vs service error.&nbsp; My understanding is that the mentioned service is used to check applications that the user has written. Since I don't use the service I disabled it and that problem is apparently taken care
 of.

            Thank you. Went through everything suggested but the wlnotify,dll still appears on boot. I had to turn on some services (in particular Avast) after restoring from clean boot. Machine runs fine otherwise but sloooow boot up - shutdown seems to be oksince
 I disabled AcrSch25vs service. The Only changes made were MS updates. I will start to remove the updates added this month to see whether or not the problemj goes away.<br />

<h2>            Error Sistray.exe</h2>
                    I've just finished a bunch of Windows updates on this laptop running Windows XP.&nbsp; Now I am receiving an error:<br />
<br />
sistray.exe - Entry Point Not Found<br />
<br />
"The procedure entry point 
?SupportHotKeyDef@SCiSEscExt@@QAEKXZ could not be located in the dynamic link library SiSApCom.dll."<br />
<br />
What does this mean and how do I fix it?&nbsp; So far I've only seen it show up on boot up.&nbsp; What other information do you need?<br />

    <title>Toshiba hardware set up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrisannm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Toshiba hardware set up</h2>
                    I have reserved the windows 10, but then I received a message that said the app developers for toshiba hardware set up haven't made these apps compatible with windows 10. Check with the developers for support. I am not sure what this means. And I am not
 sure if I can upgrade to windows 10, or if I have to make some changes, or if I am even able to make changes, I can't find any answers. I have windows 7 with service pack 1.&nbsp; But the message is telling me the toshiba hardware set up is not correct?

            You might want to delay the upgrade for a while until you get more information from Toshiba about support for the bundled apps that come with your system.
