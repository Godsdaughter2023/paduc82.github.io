<h2>            3D Builder and Printrbot Metal Simple X-Axis Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I've upgraded the bed on my Printrbot Simple Metal.&nbsp; I've stored the new dimension in the G-Code on the printer but 3D Builder only shows the original bed size.</p>
<p>How do I set the new bed size in 3D Builder?</p>

    <title>Hardware Error Live Kernel Event code 141 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steve1916 on community  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hardware Error Live Kernel Event code 141</h2>
                    <p>On&nbsp;7-22-14 during Windows Update on Surface RT (original surface), I got the following error message twice in&nbsp;Reliability Monitor:</p>
<p>Hardware Error</p>
<p>Live Kernel Event</p>
<p>Code: 141</p>
<p>Parameter 1: 8faa6500 &amp; 90822500</p>
<p>Parameter 2: 8f4cee1</p>
<p>Parameter 3: 0</p>
<p>Parameter 4: 2b4 &amp; 1f0</p>
<p>OS version: 6_3_9600.2.0.0.256.97</p>
<p>Service Pack: 0_0</p>
<p>Product: 256_1</p>
<p>Local ID: 1033</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system became unresponsive to all controls. Finally restated, but since the event system works slowly.&nbsp; For example, using Solitaire, Klondike, it randomly takes 2 to 3 seconds to respond to click commands.&nbsp; Other apps are similarly slow.&nbsp; According
 to Reliability Monitor, no solution exists.&nbsp; Forums are filled with similar, but related to video problems, on other Surface models (not RT).&nbsp; Links to hardware reset in this forum lead only to Guides that may or may not apply to this problem if reset procedure
 can be found.&nbsp; Continued RT (and Windows 8.1) failures after Windows Update have reduce system reliability to "untrustworthy for business or important data applications".&nbsp; Can anyone shed some light on this issue, even if only to verify or debunk possible
 solutions?&nbsp; (Yes, all Windows Updates have been installed as of 7-28-14)</p>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your follow-up messages. Considering you still have numerous issues even after a refresh, I'd highly suggest performing a
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/refresh-or-reset-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reset</a>, as recommended in my previous post.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Step 1</strong>:&nbsp;Plug in your Surface so that you don’t run out of power during the refresh.<br />
<strong>Step 2</strong>:&nbsp;Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and tap <strong>
Settings</strong>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, click
<strong>Settings</strong>.)<br />
<strong>Step 3</strong>:&nbsp;Tap or click <strong>Change PC settings</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 4</strong>:&nbsp;Tap or click <strong>Update and recovery</strong>, and then tap or click
<strong>Recovery</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 5</strong>:&nbsp;Under <strong>Remove everything and reinstall Windows</strong>, tap or click
<strong>Get started</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 6</strong>:&nbsp;Tap or click <strong>Next</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 7</strong>:&nbsp;Choose either <strong>Just remove my files</strong> or <strong>
Fully clean the drive</strong>. The option to clean the drive is more secure, but takes much longer. For example, if you are recycling your Surface, you should choose to clean the drive. If you are keeping your Surface, you just need to remove your files.<br />
<strong>Step 8</strong>:&nbsp;Tap or click <strong>Reset</strong>.<br />
Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process completes (this can take several minutes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a reset did not resolve your issue, please contact <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    I disabled birthday notifications in Skype (on windows desktop) and everything was good. However, once I updated it, I received again notifications, and it keeps happening again and again. Is there a way to disable these notifications once and for all?
 It is really boring!

<p>Hi Elaine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. However, this is actually my issue. I do not understand why parameters are set to default after updating, this is really annoying, and I hope this will be soved, so we do not change parameters every time there is an update (which
 are very often lately).</p>

                    <p>Hello Everyone</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ddaa526c-a72b-471e-bc34-71004ae0a268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ddaa526c-a72b-471e-bc34-71004ae0a268" /></a></p>
<p>I know there are a lot of posts similar to this however I couldnt fix my error through the other posts and on the other posts I read they got this BSOD from freshly installing Windows 10 while I got mine after using it for a few months without any issues.
 I woke up today and turned my laptop on and played a song and all the sudden it froze and made a weird buzzing noise for about 10-20 seconds then went to the BSOD with the DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION error code. It rebooted and took MUCH MUCH longer to start up
 (usually takes about a minute max but it took almost 10 minutes) and then I tried a Windows Update and that failed and said: "There were problems installing some updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact
 support for information, this may help:" and there was nothing but the Retry button under it which didnt do much. I tried a System Restore and that failed too (I forgot to write the error code down I can get it if needed). I tried some common fixes I found
 on the web such as updating my graphics card (Nvidia GeForce Experience says its up to date but the Device Manager starts a update when I click update driver but midway I get the BSOD). I checked if I had the
<em>iastor.sys driver</em> and I didnt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate any help, also if you require any files or relevant information from me I'd be glad to provide it.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply. I did some more trial and error yesterday and I may have found what is causing the BSOD. My laptop has 2 usb ports and one of them is USB 3.0 (its blue opposed to black so I know which one is the USB 3.0 port) and whenever I have something
 plugged in there (USB tethering or USB mouse) I get the BSOD however last night I left the laptop on the whole night with nothing in the USB 3.0 port while I did a Windows Defender full PC scan (which came up clean so I can assume its not a virus or something
 of that sort). So yeah Im currently using my laptop perfectly fine however I cant use USB 3.0 port as whenever I use it I get the BSOD. Is there anyway to fix this or should I just avoid using the port and hope for the best?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Also, the windows update went through when I tried doing it with nothing in the USB 3.0 port so thats fine.<br />
</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a couple of links on using OneDrive (SkyDrive):</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time</p>

<div>As per the message it does seem that the content is blocked in the country you are try to view in because of some legal issues.</div>

<h2>            Not able to print using a Brother HL-2270DW printer.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Brother HL-2270DW seems to install - appears as printer under Devices and Printers, but does not function as printer or show as selection when&nbsp; printing from application,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried to install my Brother HL-2270DW. &nbsp; It should work with&nbsp;built&nbsp;in drivers under Windows 8. &nbsp; When I plug it into the USB, it appears as a printer under Devices and Printers (it even has the right looking HL-2270DW icon. &nbsp;However, it has not printer
 properties or configuration options. &nbsp;When I double click on the icon, it opens the HL-2270DW /brother page, with links to brother documents, solution center, and other online links - nothing about printer settings.&nbsp;
</p>
<div><br />
<div>Furthermore, it does not show up as an optional printer when I try to print from an application like Notepad. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried installing it as a network device, but I get problems with installing it as some sort of kernal printer. &nbsp;</div>
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm not even going to try to install it as a wireless device since my PC is wired to the network, and I don't have a spare wireless card to plug in to it. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PS I also had trouble installing another brother printer (one without network and wireless capabilities, but it seem to fix itself after a few reboots. &nbsp;Not sure how it got fixed. &nbsp; I was hoping the HL-2270DW would do the same. &nbsp;Nope.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Battery indicator disappeared from taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bulendbekaroglu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battery indicator disappeared from taskbar</h2>
                    <p>The battery indicator disappeared from the taskbar after the last Win 10 update (version 1511). I tried the flwg:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>Press and hold or right-click an empty area on the <strong>taskbar</strong>, and then tap or click Properties. Under the
<strong>Taskbar</strong> tab, under Notification Area, click Customize... Tap or click
<strong>Turn</strong> system <strong>icons</strong> on or off. Under Behaviors, tap or click On in the drop-down list next to Power, and then tap or click OK."</span></p>
<p>The problem is "Power" appears to be "off" and cannot be switched to "on." The on/off switch just does not work. (All the others work with the exception of "location".)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions for a solution to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hello,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help. Regarding your issue,
<br />Microsoft provides many options to get the latest feature upgrade manually. You can use any of:
<br />Upgrade assistant
<br />Media Creation Tool
<br />ISO File
<br />to get Fall Creators update right now. 
<br />You can use the following guide having detailed Instructions on how to upgrade to the latest Feature upgrade i.e. Fall Creators update using all the three methods:
<br />How to upgrade to Windows 10 Fall Creators update right now
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade-to-windows-10-fall-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade...</a>
<br />Media Creation tool has an Edge over the Upgrade assistant in my opinion as it offers a greater degree of flexibility of downloading and using the ISO file so that one can deploy it on multiple computers.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

<p>When I started my desktop this morning, I had a black screen with the Windows Vista logo at the top and a never-ending scrolling messsage saying "recovering orphaned back up file xxxxxx into directory file yyyy". This has now been going on for 90 minutes

<p>
<span><span><span>Hi ogueris,</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>Thanks for posting on Microsoft Answers Forums.<br />
<br />
This issue may cause because of any error or bad sectors in the hard disk.<br />
<br />
Was there any changes done to the computer recently?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may try booting the computer to Safe mode.<br />
</span>- To boot the Computer in Safe mode, press F8 continuously during the restart, which will take you to the “Advanced Boot Options” menu where in you can select “Safe mode”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<span>Once you are in Safe mode try chkdsk and also perform a System Restore.<br />
</span></span><span><br />
<span><span>Run chkdsk on the computer to check for errors in the hard disk:
<br />
To run Chkdsk.exe program, follow these steps:<br />
1. Click Start, click Run, type cmd, and then click OK. A Command Prompt window opens.
<br />
2. Type chkdsk /r, and then press ENTER.<br />
You are prompted to schedule Chkdsk to run when the computer restarts. <br />
3. Press Y, and then press ENTER. <br />
4. Restart your computer. During startup, Windows will scan your disk for errors, and Windows will try to recover any files that are located on damaged areas on the disk.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:
</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in
 the Programs list.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.
<br />
2. In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.
<br />
3. In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click Next.
<br />
4. Click Finish.</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212/</span></a></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>If you are not able to boot into Safe mode, then perform a Start up repair.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>If you have a Windows Vista installation disc, you need to restart (boot) your computer using the installation disc. If you
 do not restart your computer from the disc, the option to repair your computer will not appear.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have a Windows Vista installation disc:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp; Insert the installation disc.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp; Restart your computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button , and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp; If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.
</span></p>
<p><span>Note: If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You
 may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For more information, see BIOS: frequently asked questions.
</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp; Choose your language settings, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp; Click Repair your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>6.&nbsp; Select the operating system you want to repair, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>7.&nbsp; On the System Recovery Options menu, click Startup Repair. Startup Repair might prompt you to make choices as it tries
 to fix the problem, and if necessary, it might restart your computer as it makes repairs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If Startup Repair is a preinstalled recovery option on your computer:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp; Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp; Do one of the following:
</span></p>
<p><span>• If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need
 to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>• If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to repair,
 and then press and hold F8.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp; On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight Repair your computer, and then press ENTER. (If
 Repair your computer is not listed as an option, then your computer does not include Startup Repair as a preinstalled recovery option.)</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp; Select a keyboard layout, and then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp; Select a user name and enter the password, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>6.&nbsp; On the System Recovery Options menu, click Startup Repair. Startup Repair might prompt you to make choices as it tries
 to fix the problem and, if necessary, it might restart your computer as it makes repairs.<br />
<br />
Let us know if that helps.<br />

    <title>Windows Installer service is missing and I&#39;m unable to install any - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> k_cutt08  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Installer service is missing and I&#39;m unable to install any updates.</h2>
                    <div>original title:&nbsp;Missing windows installer service, vista sp2 64bit, cannot update anything</div>
When I go into my local services there is no Windows Installer in the list. &nbsp;I discovered this because I was trying to update to the latest version of Java the other day. &nbsp;It gives me a message saying that it cannot access windows installer because it may be
 installed incorrectly. &nbsp;But it's just NOT THERE. &nbsp;So I go to try to install Windows Installer version 4.5 from this page&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8483</a>&nbsp; &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On that page it says that these are the files that would correspond to Windows Vista. &nbsp;I noticed that it didn't specify a different one for sp2.</div>
<div><span>For Windows Vista, Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and Windows Server 2008:</span><br />
<span>x86 Platform: Windows6.0-KB942288-v2-x86.msu</span><br />
<span>x86 Platform: Windows6.0-KB942288-v2-x86.msu</span><br />
<span>x64 Platform: Windows6.0-KB942288-v2-x64.msu</span><br />
<span>x64 Platform: Windows6.0-KB942288-v2-x64.msu</span><br />
<span>IA64 Platform: Windows6.0-KB942288-v2-ia64.msu</span> </div>
<span>IA64 Platform: Windows6.0-KB942288-v2-ia64.msu</span> </div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I downloaded the one for the x64, it loads up and says it's checking for updates and then says that "the update does not apply to your system" and just closes itself out. &nbsp;I can't update anything or install anything new so long as Windows Installer
 does not exist on my computer and NONE of these downloads for Windows Installer seem to be the correct version.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I went into command prompt and tried to open Windows Installer to see if it would start the service and it also agrees that there is no windows installer. &nbsp;I also would like to point out that I tried the other .msu files above and all of them had the same
 result. &nbsp;Am I supposed to use a OLDER version for SP2? &nbsp;If so, why is 4.5 not compatible then? &nbsp;</div>
<div>Right now I am running a scan in command prompt with the "sfc/ scannow" command.</div>
<div>Also, windows update cannot install its updates, I did some just the other day, but now it can't anymore, which I think it's safe to assume that it is because there's no longer a windows installer to assist in that process. &nbsp;I get an error code 641 and
 an error 80070641 as well when it fails to update. &nbsp;Trying again does not help.</div>
<div>What I really want to know is HOW could my windows installer just disappear, I feel very strongly that it couldn't be a virus because I have very good anti-virus protection and I've scanned and double checked many times. &nbsp;I just really need to fix this
 so that I can continue to keep my computer running Up-To-Date.</div>
                </div>

<h3> pa311  say:</h3>
<h2>            Burn Data Disc in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have a disc with 32 files totaling 550 Mb.&nbsp; I need to supply these file to 20 customers, and do not have any storage location to place them that all could get to.&nbsp; The best solution would be to copy/burn discs to distribute.&nbsp; I recall being able to burn
 discs in Windows Explorer in previouls versions of of Windows, but can not find a method to do the same in Windows 7.&nbsp; Can anyone please advise?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>&nbsp;If you want to use the Windows built in software, you may want to copy one of the discs to a folder on your hard drive, then repeat the burn process 20 times.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Personally I use either Roxio or Nero software which I bring up, tell it to copy a disc, then tell it how many copies I want and insert new discs when it tells me to.&nbsp; There are professional services like Kinko's and OfficeMax that will do this for a fee
 if you'd rather go that route too.&nbsp; Finally, you might look for free programs you can download like imgburn from
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com</a> .&nbsp; You could also do a search at
<a href="http://www.download.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.download.com</a> for other free downloads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

<h2>            Screen turns yellow after sign-in even though Night-light is turned off</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My screen turns very yellow soon after signing in (at the booting stage and the welcome screen stage everything is fine), even though "nightlight" is turned off. The "nightlight" function is working ok. So when my screen is already yellow, turning on "nightlight"
 will make it even more yellow. Windows 10 is up to date (1803 17134.81). It seems like changing to another user account will stop the problem, but I have so many customised file with this user account that I want to fix the problem with this particular user
 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have only started noticing this problem today, after I shut down my computer and re-start. I did a virus full-scan using McaFee, didn't find anything. The problem also occurred when Windows 10 was at a previous version (17134.48 I believe?), updating Windows
 to the latest version does not help.<br />
</p>
<p>The only temporary solution I have now is to re-calibrate the monitor, but restarting or simply signing out and sign back in will cause the problem again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer was only purchased very recently (less than a month ago), up until a few days ago, restarting this computer will not cause such problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC is a Lenovo yoga 920 with 4k resolution and 16GB of DDR4 RAM running a core i7 8550U processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>I tried troubleshooter before, it doesn't detect anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried updating the graphic driver, but it's already up to date. And I didn't update the graphic driver after buying this laptop since it's only purchased less than a month ago. Lenovo website also doesn't offer any new drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone please help !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to migrate to a new user account and maintaining all the settings except for the color profile !? - i.e. since a new user account doesn't have this issue (because of default color profile?), I might as well just migrate all my stuff to a new
 user account, and then delete the older one? Or is there any way to reset the current color profile?</p>

    <title>Skype Phone&#58; Basis for Refund, Blocked by Atrocious Customer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype Phone&#58; Basis for Refund, Blocked by Atrocious Customer Service.</h2>
                    <p>I am aghast at the utterly bizarre dealings I have had over the last week with Skype regarding an account credit refund in consequence of the deliberate removal (by Skype) of the mechanism through which Skype phones. My Philips VOIP841 phone used to work
 but it doesn't any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In theory it should be a simple matter to deal with a refund. In practise I have never seen such incompetence and bad customer service compounding to a degree that it is evidently nigh on impossible to extract a just refund out of Skype, let alone extract
 an ounce of honesty or integrity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third criterion of the published Skype policy for refunds is that a technical issue caused by Skype is grounds for a refund. It is self-evidently true that the "technical issue" here is the removal of the software interface through which Skype phones
 used to operate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My Skype phone no longer functions as a Skype phone in direct consequence of the change made by Skype. Therefore a refund is both justifiable and is just. Any company that subscribes to honesty and integrity in their dealings would recognise this to be true.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My dealings with Skype have yet to achieve a just outcome and so far I have seen very little honesty or integrity. Here are a few of the idiotically bizarre things that I have encountered so far. Bear them in mind when you too attempt to claim a refund:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Despite repetitively informing Skype "chat service" agents (yes, more than one session needed!) that I wished to claim under the third criterion of the refund policy, I found my self endlessly being refused on the grounds that I did not satisfy the criteria
 for a refund based on the first criterion. Eventually "the penny dropped" and I came to understand why this repetitive circular cycle of utter lunacy was happening....</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Eventually an agent on the "chat service" finally understood that the first refund criterion had absolutely nothing to do with my claim. He then started to listen properly, understand the problem properly and then finally accepted that I had legitimate
 grounds for a refund. He was unable to issue the refund simply because he did not "have a button" to issue a refund based on the third criterion. He only had a "button" for the first criterion. You should note that by this stage in proceedings I have been
 granted a refund but it can not be effected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) The second point links nicely with the first point if you consider the old adage "to a man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail". It became evident in my mind that the reason behind the endless refusals, quoting the first refund criterion despite
 claiming against the third, is because that's the only criterion available on the computer system that the agents are using. They only ever apply the first criterion because it's their only available option. This explains a whole lot of their "rigid thinking".</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) A further implication of the computer system being able only to issue refunds based on that one criterion is that there are four criteria that cannot be handled by the call centre agents. When there are five criteria for refunds stated in the published
 refund policy and only one is accessible by call centre agents, it indicates a dis-functional computer system that does not implement the published refund policy. The call centre agents are being "ham-strung" by the computer system. It is forcing their "rigid
 thinking" by necessity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) If someone is unable achieve what is right and just then it is time to escalate the call. Unfortunately a first escalation to a supervisor will also fail to achieve a promised refund because the supervisor has the same dis-functional computer system to
 use.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>6) If you complain for long enough you will achieve a second escalation. The aim is to find someone with the brains and authority to circumvent (aka "workaround") the problem previously encountered with the computer system. For the second escalation, I was
 unlucky enough to receive a most bizarre email from a Customer Service Manager, the likes of which had be aghast and astounded. I will give you the most impressively bizarre and insulting part of her email reply later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) An overall conclusion to be reached is that customer service at Skype is dis-functional or just plain bizarre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) If you do not have a stong sense of "right and wrong" you would be better served by simply transferring your account credit to a friend then wiping all traces of Skype from your life. Less hassle but in some ways still an unjust outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I leave you with the promised quote from the supposed Customer Service Manager for your delight, with a couple of my reflections about it:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"I am sorry but we are unable to grant your refund request. Depreciation of Skype phones is not a technical issue but an innovation."</span></p>
<p><span>To
</span><span>hide behind a word such as "innovation",&nbsp;</span><span>claiming there have been no technical changes at Skype, is nothing more than a weak and feeble
 mis-guided excuse. It is not a justification to countermand a previous decision to grant a refund. This has me aghast with disbelief. I am insulted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am also insulted on behalf of the many technical staff at Skype who have spent many years implementing
 major changes to Skype. As much as those changes have been of detriment to me (I now have a disfunctional Skype phone) I can at least recognise their work as highly technical and very skilled. My sympathies to the IT staff at Skype.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also insulted on behalf of the only call centre agent who took the trouble to listen, understand and then at least try and resolve my refund claim. His honesty and integrity is demeaned by the customer service
 manager's subsequent actions. My sympathies to SP at Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Customer Service Manager EA should be deeply ashamed at her attitude towards the technical staff at Skype, just as she should be deeply ashamed at her behaviour towards the only person within Skype customer service
 that had and honesty and integrity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You DID make a technical change (regardless of whether or not it was "innovative"). You DID cause a technical issue for many people including myself. You WERE responsible for that technical issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I amtherfore entitled to it under the third criterion of your published refund policy.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Pay up.</p>

<p>Microsoft knew that there would be many angry Skype users, when they decided to abuse thousands of their customers. They knew that after the initial outburst of justified anger that things would settle down over time. Young people, who have never heard of
 a dual phone, will go on using their android and iphone and ipad versions of Skype enjoying the ability to select the colour of the Skype wallpaper.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In time the anger will subside. And what will those of us affected do anyway, other than complain? Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Six months from now-if not sooner-no one will remember the dual Skype phone or have any idea what we were angry about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end and short and midterm Microsoft wins.</p>

            Excellent information. &nbsp;I have ordered a Magic Jack, which seems like it will be a good work around. &nbsp;If it works as advertised, it will connect to my modem and I can use an old landline phone. &nbsp;And it should work when the computer is turned off. &nbsp;Microsoft
 needs to understand that not everyone has a smartphone on hand 24/7. &nbsp;I'm very disappointed that they made this decision. &nbsp;

<p>I too use Whatsapp. I will stop using it if Microsoft every buys them out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no refund though eventually I was offered a Skype Credit Note. This of course is utterly pointless as my Skype phone does not work.</p>

<br />
Thanks for using the Asnwers Forum.<br />
<br />
I'm not aware of a way to omit the hidden files when searching in un-indexed areas.<br />
<br />
You could try posting to the Windows 7 TechNet forum:<br />

<p>when trying to use the xbox beta app , I seem to be stuck on an endless green loading screen I have tried to re install, I have a newer pc,and I don't have man programs running or installed on my computer. I have windows 10 and I hae refreshed my modem several
 times I just cant figure it out, the only thing I could think of is maybe it is not available for Canadian users, any advise or help would be greatly appreciated thank u</p>

<p>Have you tried loading other Windows 10 apps like Weather or News? If they are working as expected, maybe is an issue with the beta branch. Since it's a beta stability is not a priority there. Please, use the normal release app instead.</p>

<h2>            I get an iaStorAVC.sys failure with RAID M.2&#39;s</h2>
                    <p>I have read the previous post about this failure but my situation is a bit different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Z390 motherboard with 2 NVMe drives in RAID 1. I know know I need the drivers installed for Windows to boot, but I never get far enough to add the drivers. Here is the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 10 USB Boot drive.</p>
<p>I set my BIOS per the Manufacture, save and exit.</p>
<p>Windows begins to boot by showing the spinning dots.</p>
<p>After a couple of minutes I get a BSOD with the iaStorAVC.sys fail.</p>
<p>I never get to the install screen that would allow me to add drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the USB is good, because if I un-RAID the drives and try to boot off of the USB it works fine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get Windows to install?</p>

<p>I finally figured out this issue on my own.</p>
<p>On a separate system, I had to copy off the boot.wim file from my bootable thumb drive and then Dismount it. Then I had to add the iRST drivers to the file and remount it. Once I put the new boot.wim file on the thumb drive, Window booted and installed perfect.</p>
<p>Windows needs to update their 1809 download to include the latest iRST drivers or a lot of people who RAID their boot drives are going to be stuck!</p>
