            <p>Assuming you have already saved your movie using <strong>File</strong> and <strong>
Save movie</strong> you should have a .wmv or .mp4 file saved on your hard disk.&nbsp; To put it onto a USB drive is just a simple matter or using Windows Explorer to copy the file from where it is, to the drive representing the USB stick.&nbsp; Alternatively, you could
 use File &gt; Save movie and save it directly onto the USB drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For a DVD, it is a little more complicated.&nbsp; If you just want a data DVD for archival purposes, you can burn the file onto a DVD directly.&nbsp; That will be playable in another Windows PC, but not in a DVD player.&nbsp; If you want to make a playable DVD, you need
 a program for making playable video DVDs.&nbsp; Windows Vista and Windows 7 came with Windows DVD Maker, so you could use that.&nbsp; If you have it, Movie Maker will show the option under the
<strong>File</strong> menu for <strong>Burn a DVD</strong>.&nbsp; If you don't you'll need either freeware or 3rd party software for making a video DVD.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; How to make Private Network enabled</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have Lenovo laptop with below configuration:</p>
<p>Lenovo / Windows 7.1 Premium / 64-bit / 3 GB RAM / T6600 @2.22 GHz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.22GHz / Intel Core2 Duo CPU</p>
<p>I had Windows 7.1 installed in it.</p>
<p>20 days I upgraded to Windows 10:</p>
<p>Lenovo / Windows 10 Home / 64-bit / 3 GB RAM / T6600 @2.22 GHz&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.22GHz / Intel Core2 Duo CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem: </p>
<p>In Control Panel&gt;Network and Internet&gt;Network and Sharing center:&nbsp;</p>
<p>My system is displayed as 'Public network'. I want my system to display 'Private network' instead.</p>
<p>Is it possible?</p>
<p>Windows 7 had this capability. </p>
<p>

<h2>            PCMCIA Not Working</h2>
                    <p>First let me start with i have asked this question twice before and the replies i got were the basics check drivers use fix-it tool etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time i asked this question was with the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"Hi I have a Dell Lattitude D630 (http://www.dell.com/us/dfb/p/latitude-d630/pd) I installed windows 10 x64 Pro (clean) yeasterday, I use the PCMCIA Regularly for my IBM Micro Drives. The device is detected and the&nbsp; driver (<span><span>O2Micro OZ77Cxx
 USB SmartCard Controller, v.1.1.4.202, A04) </span></span>is installed, but the micro drive is not showing up in explorer can any one help with this issue."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The second time i asked with more detail.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"Hi i installed Windows 10 a few weeks ago on my laptop a Dell Latitude D630 and it works great, Apart from one thing my PCMCIA Card is not functioning correctly.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I use the slot for my camera micro drive cards, when i insert the card it is detected a driver installs, it is correctly shown in device manager and it shows on the removable device list. . But for some reason it dose not show in file explorer.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>It is very weird and the only thing i can compare the problem to, is the problem some windows 8 installs had with the DVD drive not showing on file explorer with some computers, and you had to do a reg hack to get it to show. This is basically the
 same except its a PCMCIA device.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My device works fine i have about 10 different micro drive's from several different manufacturers and none of them work. I have tried them on a friends Windows 7 laptop and they all work perfectly. So i dual Boot my laptop with Windows 7 to make
 certain my PCMCIA slot was working and they all worked perfectly, and the slot functions correctly, so this is definitely a issue with Windows 10.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I have asked this question before and the advice i got from Microsoft did not do anything which is why I'm re asking just this time making sure i give better information. So if anyone can help i would be very grateful."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This time i will ask with all the above but this time will include some pics too.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If anyone can please help with this issue, other than telling me to check drivers or use a fix-it tool that don't work on windows 10. I will be doing somersaults with joy and will buy you a pint many thanks Ian.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. and before someone says its my device I've tried it with other peoples windows 10 laptops and none of them work.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it. We will assist you to resolve this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to send the event logs from Even Viewer to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow the steps:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Type <strong>Event viewer</strong> in the Search Bar.</span></li><li><span>Open <strong>Event Viewer</strong>.</span></li><li><span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></li><li><span>Click an event log in the left pane.</span></li><li><span>Double-click an event to view the details of the event.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps. If you aren't logged on as an administrator, you can change only settings that apply to your user account, and some event logs might not be accessible.</span></p>
<p><span>Event logs are special files that record significant events on your computer, such as when a user logs on to the computer or when a program encounters an error. Whenever these types of events occur, Windows records the event in an event log that you
 can read by using Event Viewer. Advanced users might find the details in event logs helpful when troubleshooting problems with Windows and other programs.</span></p>
<p><span>Event Viewer tracks information in several different logs. Windows Logs include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Application (program) events: Events are classified as error, warning, or information, depending on the severity of the event. An error is a significant problem, such as loss of data. A warning is an event that isn't necessarily
 significant, but might indicate a possible future problem. An information event describes the successful operation of a program, driver, or service.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Security-related events: These events are called audits and are described as successful or failed depending on the event, such as whether a user trying to log on to Windows was successful.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Setup events: Computers that are configured as domain controllers will have additional logs displayed here.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>System events: System events are logged by Windows and Windows system services, and are classified as error, warning, or information.</span></p>

<h2>            Activity Feed</h2>
                    <p>My activity feed is removing items for some reason.&nbsp; Yesterday I manually posted some achievements and when I logged on today about 12 of my older achievements were gone.&nbsp; This is the 2nd time that this has happened in a few months.&nbsp; I contacted the Xbox
 chat for troubleshooting and I was provided a link&nbsp; on how to manage the Activity Feed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously?!&nbsp; I know how to manage the Activity Feed and I didn't change anything but manually upload some achievements.&nbsp; Is this happening to anyone else or does anyone have any suggestions other than 'power cycle' or 'check your activity feed settings'?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if it has anything to do with my Iphone Xbox app....</p>

            Hi! Sorry this happened to you and the experience you had with Support. I guess no one here can tell you for sure, but I assume that it's still due to server issues on Microsofts side as quite a lot of people report issues with social features like the
 activity feed or achievements these past few weeks. I'd recommend to perform the actions you'd like to do via xbox.com or the Xbox-app instead to see if that works. Other than that you'll probably have to wait until MS fixes these issues.

</blockquote>
<p>=========================<br />
The following steps may be worth a try:<br />
<br />
Turn the camera on and connect it to the PC via a USB cable...<br />
<br />
Close any windows that may open...<br />
<br />
Go to...Start button / My Computer...<br />
<br />
Does the camera show as a drive letter?<br />
<br />
If_Yes_right click the drive and from the menu...choose...Explore...<br />
now you should see the directory of the memory card.<br />
<br />
From there...you should be able to drag/drop or copy/paste the <br />
files to a folder on your hard drive.</p>

    <title>8.1 very slow on new omputer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zanejohn  say:</h3>
<h2>            8.1 very slow on new omputer</h2>
                    I just bought a new Windows 8.1 computer with an Pentium J2900 quad core at 2.41 GHz. I powered it up at 4pm. I have 30 M internet. &nbsp;It is now 11.15pm and it is still updating with over 30% of the updates not installed yet and it has not gotten to where
 I have to restart it yet. I find it totally unacceptable that just to set up a new computer with updates should take this long, making the computer unusable for any productive use. I got rid of my Windows 10 computer after a month because of update problems
 and many other problems (bought a Chrome Book for surfing the internet because my Windows computer could not) (in that month it was only usable less than 10% because it was in a never ending update loop running at 100% cpu usage 90% of the time). &nbsp;As far as
 I can tell this was the first time the computer has been powered up (brand new in never been opened box) and is not the first time that I found Windows unusable. Next step is to replace with a Mac book or Linux computer.

            wired Ethernet cable. I have had this problem with every Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 computer that I have owned. When I check my internet speeds on this computer it shows 30+ M speeds. On my Windows 7 it took less than 1hour for the updates and my computer was
 usable but on Windows 8 and above it takes about 1 hour to download the updates 1 to 4 hours to install and up to 12 hours to configure the updates with he computer totally unusable. On the previous computers even re-installing Windows, refreshing, running
 SFC scannow had no effects. Even "fixing" Windows update did nothing.&nbsp; If I start task manager or process explorer with no other programs running it shows the cpu running at 90 to 100% usage which makes it very slow to respond to anything. Windows 10 on my
 computer was so bad because auto-update started updates while I was working on my genealogy projects, effectively preventing me from working on them so I removed Windows 10 and installed Linux giving me a working computer.<br />

                    <p>I'm getting to the "Get Going Fast" screen, I select my settings and save them. I get "Just a minute" and the computer reboots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything in the computer is brand new, including the SSD I'm using to install Windows. No other drives or non-essential devices are connected to the computer. I've even gone so far as to use my son's computer to wipe the SSD and start over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot get to repair or safe mode, so don't mention it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been at this for several hours and I'm on the verge of RMA'ing everything and buying a Mac. This is beyond stupid. And please don't tell me the boot cycle is normal and can take several hours because it's not. Especially not if it's requiring my input.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Neither if these apply to this situation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It won't &nbsp;load in VGA mode and apparently it is possible to get this mode without ever seeing the black screen because IT IS OUT OF BOX, NO OS HAS EVER BEEN INSTALLED ON THIS MACHINE BEFORE. Therefore it's impossible to have ever had a black screen before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish I could report you for being &nbsp;unhelpful. I really didn't need anymore reasons to dislike Microsoft. Thank you for wasting my time and sending my frustration level even higher. I'm so done.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Recap of issue:</p>
<p>Brand new Windows 10 install (not an upgrade) gets to the "Get Going Fast" screen. I choose my settings and save them. Windows 10 reboots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've Tried - NONE of these worked or helped:&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Checked all of the connections</p>
<p>- Removed all non-essential hardware</p>
<p>- Disconnected and reconnected everything</p>
<p>- Had someone else come in and check my connections</p>
<p>- Connecting to the internet with an Ethernet cable (no wifi card)</p>
<p>- Disconnecting from the internet</p>
<p>- Disabled all of the boot drives except for the USB I was using to install Windows</p>
<p>- Changed to boot drive to the SSD I installed Windows on and removed the USB.</p>
<p>- Booting into Safe Mode (it just won't)</p>
<p>- Trying to get the repair screen to come up (it won't)</p>
<p>- Reformatting the SSD</p>
<p>- Reformatting and recreating the USB boot disk</p>
<p>- Changing the CMOS battery</p>
<p>- Bench tested each component and they're all fine&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Components ALL NEW except the CPU, I moved that directly from a slightly older build into this one--they were next to each other on the bench so nothing was set down anywhere. Yes, I quadruple checked compatibility and it posts without issues, I can access
 the BIOS and make changes to it, no problem. It's Windows that's the problem.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Motherboard MSI 970 Gaming. I checked the box, MSI site to see if I was missing something in terms of your question and nope - that is the model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The RAM is now two sticks, 4GB each (8 GB total) seated in slots 1 &amp; 3. I had 4 sticks, 4 GB each before but the other two were needed in another build. Even after going down to just the two, same issue. Reducing to one, seated in slot 1, no change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No one seems to be able to figure out why it's getting stuck even after formatting the SSD and both HDDs using one of my other computers and buying yet another USB drive to create a new install disk (also formatted to ensure there was no encryption or other
 files on it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what the deal is because this is a configuration that worked before (it's almost identical to another build I did - the only difference is the CPU cooler) and Windows 10 installed on that one without any issues. I've also never had an issue
 installing Windows before...ever; not at work or at home or doing custom builds as a hobby.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already requested RMAs on what I could because this has entered "waste of time" territory. Not disappointing anyone -- it was for me. Maybe someone will figure this out...maybe not.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Farewell My old friend&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> forge steele  say:</h3>
<h2>            Farewell My old friend&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>This is a both a fond and bitter farewell to my favourite game system up until this year. &nbsp;Just going to go through some history of what 9 years of xbox live was. &nbsp;I'll start with the great times!</p>
<p>I remember the first time i played halo, it was four player split screen and it blew me away. &nbsp;The game was so much fun that i tried to hang out anywhere someone would be bringing halo. &nbsp;The one thing that always stopped me from owning my own was the controller
 and you guys fixed that very quickly! &nbsp;I was sold. &nbsp;I eventually got the package that came with knights of the old republic and mech ****. &nbsp;Those were awesome titles if anyone here remembers them! &nbsp;I played both for hours and hours. The day finally came
 when i found a used copy of Halo.(i thought i would reiterate "used") &nbsp;I beat in on legendary 3 times I believe. &nbsp;During my time with halo it was always my goal to get 4 xbox's linked up on four tv's but we always got stuck with 3! &nbsp;We tried hard for that
 elusive 16 players and it was a hilarious enterprise. &nbsp;Some of the funniest, drunkest, loudest gaming times i ever had.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got Xbox live the second year it was out. &nbsp;That was the time i finally had broadband internet to get online and use my trial. &nbsp;The first game i played on live was rainbow six 3. &nbsp;It was hilarious and awesome fun. &nbsp;I then tried mech **** online but it
 was a bit more frustrating then rainbow 6 but still had some good times. &nbsp;It wasnt until crimson skies that i found out how awesome xbox live was. &nbsp;It had matchmaking, it had a fun multiplayer and kept me going for hours playing online. &nbsp;It is hands down still
 one of my favourite multiplayer games ever.</p>
<p>No too long into the future Halo 2 came out and blew the first one away. &nbsp;Multiplayer would never be the same for me. &nbsp;I waited in line for my first midnight release for that game. &nbsp;I played it for hours, got all the maps and loved every minute of it.</p>
<p>Xbox 360 came out later and I got one The first or second year, i cant quite remember. &nbsp;I know that i got kameo for it which was an ok game, need for speed most wanted and ghost recon. &nbsp;It was kind of meh until oblivion came out and that was and still my
 most played games ever. &nbsp;I got horse armour, i got all the houses, knights of the 9, mehrunes razor, the island all of it. &nbsp;It was a blast. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Later on halo , gears of war and call of duty helped to define an entire generation of games for me. &nbsp;Xbox truly gave me some of my most enjoyable gaming moments through my teens and young adulthood. &nbsp;There are many more games that I played on there as well!</p>

<p>The Bad.</p>
<p>unfortunately games are only as good as the console they run on and xbox 360 has done a massive disservice to the idea that xbox can deliver quality. &nbsp;I had four red rings since i've owned a 360 with 2 of the four happening the launch days of gears of war
 and halo reach. &nbsp;the fourth i was so frustrated that i went and bought another xbox rather then call support, stay on the line for an hour then have to wait 3 weeks without a console. &nbsp;This happened almost annually until i bought a new box. &nbsp;To picture how
 frustrating this actually is, picture having the internet go off one day a week, but only on the day that you have set aside to use it.</p>
<p>This brings me to why i'm saying goodbye. &nbsp;I look at how awesome my experience with xbox was, and it was a no brainer to get a 360. &nbsp;I took my experience with the 360 and now look toward the xbox one and can't say that i am as enthusiastic. &nbsp;You guys have
 truly done your community a service by listening to the&nbsp;<span>criticisms of the direction you were choosing, and decided to change it. &nbsp;You will effectively ease your following into the direction you want to take gaming and with old dogs of gaming like me
 that is truly important.</span></p>
<p>My question is where was this desire to please your customers when you unveiled the Xone at E3? Where was this listening to what your fanbase wanted when months before you unveiled a console you had the general opinion of your fans and still stubbornly decided
 to go in an unpopular direction? &nbsp;Why this vendetta against used games? &nbsp;Despite what you are saying now, that is still the first thing on the execution block. &nbsp;I bought one used copy of halo, then bought 4 brand new copies of sequels that came out. &nbsp;Did i
 not pay for that used copy four times over?</p>
<p>And worst of all my old friend, where was this desire to listen when i complained about getting sent back xbox 360's that continuously break down?</p>

<p>I see the old tagline "i'm not a fanboy, but" come up all the time and i offer that i am a total and complete xbox fanboy. &nbsp;I loved your brand more than any other! &nbsp;And like any friend i wanted to stick with you during the good times and the bad. &nbsp;I'm just
 not even sure what direction you are even going at this point, and i can't get behind this level of uncertainty. &nbsp;I cancelled my xbox live today after 9 years, and will not be purchasing an Xbox One. &nbsp;I no longer trust that you will deliver a quality machine,
 and i don't trust that you will stick with the important changes that you have made. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe in a few years i'll have another look at Xbox One and hopefully i'll say "Damn I think I want one!" &nbsp;Take Xbox there.</p>
<p>TL;DR&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll miss xbox, but politely refusing the new One.</p>

<p>Forge Steele</p>

<p>Well, between a playstation and an xbox, the choice is simple, I cannot play with a Playstation controller, and I don't want to get learn and get used to it. So no matter if the Xbox One will be good or not, I'm going for Xbox One, (I'll also get a WiiU
 later). You are right about the red ring, I'm about to pay 600$ for a new console, and this is my biggest concern. I am so scared that it break, I don't have enought money to buy another one...</p>
<p>About those used game, They spent money on something called; Exclusivity. Game developper company would bring us exclusive game for Xbox One because they would make more money from it. We refused. We lost the exclusive game, but we can get used game. I do
 not agree with this as even if I am not rich, I never buy used game, I buy them brand new, and if I am not ready to pay full price, I wait for price drop, as EVERY single game on Xbox become one day or another 19.99$ at futureshop and other places. 19.99$
 is such a good price for brand new game, sometime you can see used game that cost more then that. I already saw Bioshock 2 brand new 49.99$, right beside it, there was Bioshock 2 Used 47.99$. What the...</p>

<h2>            Photo Editor Retouch feature no longer working</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I have been using the Windows 10 Photo editor for over a year now. One of the features I most frequently use is the "retouch" feature. However recently (possibly in the most current Windows LCU) this feature is no longer available to me. I look in
 the store and it thinks I have the Photo app installed, but for some reason my screens have even changed and don't match. Has the Photo program been changed recently?</p>

<h2>            How to setup Cortana in Local User account on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>HI, Am using a laptop, pure home use only. Laptop never leaves house.</p>
<p>I have not set up Cortana as from past experience. At present when I want into my laptop I do not have any password set so computer opens right up automatically ( that's how I like and want it).</p>
<p>But if I set up Cortana with email and password will I end up having to sign into my laptop every time I want to use it, that is my fear?</p>
<p>Help please?</p>

            Hi Hazel
<br />
<br />If you installed the game from with the Microsoft Store, it is normally stored in the Windows Apps folder; and its difficult to find the executable in that location.
<br />
<br />Have you considered just temporarily disabling F-Secure and try launching the game?
<br />
<br />Or
<br />
<br />Remove F-Secure and switch to the built in Windows Defender Security Center. 
<br />
<br />Windows Defender has come a long way from the days of Microsoft Security Essentials. 
<br />
<br />It includes a decent Antivirus scanner thats more robust and uses heuristics and the cloud to detect and remove malicious code. 
<br />
<br />There is also a built in offline scanner you can use to scan Windows outside of the installation.
<br />
<br />Windows Defender also includes a Firewall, Network Security and protections again newer types of attacks such as Ransomware. 
<br />
<br />So, its pretty robust, especially when combined with other security features such as Windows Smart Screen Filter. I think when used with a Standard User Account, some common sense - don't just download software from suspicious websites or open strange emails with attachments. 
<br />
<br />Also, keep a regular backup of your computer, system restore points; you really can't go wrong. 
<br />
<br />You can also supplement it with third party solutions such as the ESET Sysrescue offline scanner and Malwarebytes.

<br />
<br />My name is Phillip and I am an Independent Advisor. I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps.
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem 
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            Hi FluffyGrenade, mostl ikely this is caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<h2>            I have to select default playback device to play the sound after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I guess I don't rate an answer from Microsoft customer assistance. I appreciate "the community" trying to help me, but I'm not getting the solution to my problem, and I can't seem to find out how to get an answer directly from the windows 10 people. My speakers
 and headphones on my laptop use to work fine before I upgraded to "10". They still work fine on my wife's laptop, upgraded at the same time. But I have to physically choose a default playback devise in order for the head phones or the speakers to work. I put
 in microsoft's latest sound drivers, no change. What's up? Why can't the people who wrote the code tell me what to do?</p>

    <title>Friend appears offline to me only - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Friend appears offline to me only</h2>
                    
<p>I play destiny with a friend constantly but he always appears offline to me. There is only 1 other person he has appeared offline to, everyone else sees him online just fine. He can send and recieve invites and messages to and from anyone except for me.
 This is very frustrating for both of us because he does not recieve my invites, so i always have to send him a phone text and tell him to invite me, and i recieve his invites just fine. H3 can recieve invites from everyone else, just not from me. His account
 is set to show online and all his privacy settings are set to everyone. We have been trying to figure out why this is happening for a month. Any help in this regard would be great.</p>

<p>most of my friends appear &nbsp;"OFFLINE" &nbsp; today even when they are online. the &nbsp; "OFFLINE" &nbsp; people sent me message saying their friends are &nbsp; &nbsp; "OFFLINE" &nbsp; also. &nbsp;this happens a couple times a month. &nbsp;when you call 1-800-469-9269 xbox live support every time
 they say they can not do anything about it. &nbsp;so you and your friends appear &nbsp; &nbsp;"OFFLINE" &nbsp; &nbsp;about a couple of days a month times twelve months which roughly comes to twenty-four days a year but xbox live told me they do not reimburse for your time loss( unless
 you go to arbitration).</p>
<p>the only thing that works for me is that you send a message to all your friends stating "i am letting you all know that i am onlne because i see you all &nbsp; &nbsp;"OFFLINE".</p>
<p>i hope this helps. &nbsp;good luck with the fix</p>

<p>Hi Zambesi</p>
<p>In your situation it looks like the NAT problem. There is 3 different type NAT. Strict, Modern and open. Check your NAT type. And if you have STRICT or moderate type NAT then there may be some problems with seeing your friend and invite him to game.</p>
<p>&gt; SETTINGS &gt; NETWORK</p>
<p>With a MODERATE NAT type, you’re able to chat and play multiplayer games with some people; however, you might not be able to hear or play with others, and normally you won’t be chosen as the host of a match.</p>
<p>With a STRICT NAT type, you’re only able to play multiplayer games with people who have an OPEN NAT type. You can’t be chosen as the host of a match.</p>

<p>hi &nbsp;ZAMBEZI WITHIN,</p>
<p>don't do it. &nbsp;i have spent several hours with xbox live connectivity department three way with the internet provider trying to change and trouble shoot this:</p>
<p>Xbox Live requires the following ports to be open:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 88 (UDP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 3074 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 53 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 80 (TCP) </p>
<p>and everything still the same.</p>
<p>everyone on my friends list notice this problem after the big dash board update around 2014 Christmas time. &nbsp;xbox live connectivity department does not know when the next big dash board update is and does not know if it would include the "OFFLINE" fix.</p>
<p>i hope i saved you some time on that.</p>

<p>hi &nbsp;ZAMBEZI WITHIN,</p>
<p>sorry i forgot to include an other new modem which we set up from scratch with still "OFFLINE" problem. &nbsp;also this new modem set up was now tested on a new xbox with still "OFFLINE" problem.</p>
<p>that is why we spent so many hours trouble shooting &nbsp;:(</p>
<p>hope this saves you some money too.</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />Sadly, as per Microsoft "you can't make multiple call in the same Skype account simultaneously" (<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum/all/can-i-make-multiple-skype-calls-simultaneously/05e2fe0a-9235-4e3d-bcea-9a7058021aec">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/skype/forum...</a>).
<br />
<br />As such, it would not work in the scenario you have described.
<br />
<br />I am sorry for that.
<br />
<br />Kind regards
<br />Maggie

<p>The game looks good but Im not sure about the lack of guns, fighting your way out of a tight spot in L4D with a club is fun but a whole first person game with just close range hand weapons seems like it might get a bit boring. (yes, I no there are some guns
 in the game, &amp; yes I no it fits in with the story, why would a holiday island have crates of guns &amp; ammo laying around.) but you get my point.</p>

<p>Doesn't look too bad actually! I'll repeat what I've always said though - The electrified weapons look a little silly, but other than that, quite good.</p>
