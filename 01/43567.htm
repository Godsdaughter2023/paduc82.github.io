            <p>Hi there,<br /><br />Remeeming errors can be caused by issues on the account itself. Be sure to check if your billing information is correct at <a href="http://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://billing.microsoft.com</a> and also check <a href="http://account.microsoft.com/services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.microsoft.com/services</a> for any outstanding amount issues, these need to be sorted prior to being able to redeem codes. <br />After that try redeeming the code on both xbox console and via xbox.com/redeemcode</p><p><br />Also check that the Xbox Live account, the console and code all match region wise, using different regions for any of them cause issues too.</p><p>I assume that your acocunt's region is not the one you suspect it to be, this can be checked here: <a href="https://live.xbox.com/Account/BillingAccountInformation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://live.xbox.com/Account/BillingAccountInformati

    <title>Realtek Audio Manager Missing. Please help&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> louise peatfield  say:</h3>
<h2>            Realtek Audio Manager Missing.  Please help&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My computer was having some glitches and I called MSN Support Services who told me to do a clean install, and talked me through it. After the&nbsp;clean install I&nbsp;found&nbsp; my audio devices don't work right, and I can't listen with head phones or record with microphone.
 I tried e-mailing the Realtek people twice, several months ago, and they never bothered to reply. I Can't find a download anywhwere for the actual program, only for the drivers.&nbsp;I also can't seem to find my other CD for the computer just the one called "Operating
 Systems Disc". I have an Emachines T5274.&nbsp;Can anyone help me get the actual Realtek Audio Manager back? Someone told me if I knew someone else with the same computer and they could copy their second CD for me, as the audio files would be on it, or they could
 copy the Realtek Audio Manager files off their computer and burn to a CD or e-mail it to me, or post it on a YouSendIt type site&nbsp;for me. I know of no one with the same computer. So I'm really stuck here as I need to find the Manager in downloadable form. The
 Realtek website seems to have drivers only, and since they don't bother reading or replying to their e-mails, I can't get any help from them. I tried using my Sound Recorder but when I play something to record on it, it doesn't hear the sound. I also have
 a "Audio Recorder For Free" program and it too can't hear the sound to record anything I play. Before the clean install, both devices worked fine, and my headphone jack and microphone jack both worked fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please if you can help, I'm not computer literate as some people are, so I need you to explain in basic dummy English so even an idiot like me won't royally screw things up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you in advance&nbsp;for any suggestions or assistance.</p>

            <p>Hello Sandeep V!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you so much for replying to my request for assistance. My speakers work just fine, as I can play audio, and video files with sound on any of my media players, and of course the various sounds the computer makes. The problem seems to be that
 I'm missing the Realtek Audio Manager, and if I can find a download for the actual program, I think it would solve
<u>all</u>&nbsp;the problems.&nbsp; The other problems which I'm guessing also relate to this, is that when I try to use either the Sound recorder or the "Audio Recorder For Free" and I play a video or audio to copy, neither program is capable of hearing the sound to
 record it, although the speakers play it just fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I appreciate the info you posted. You asked if I updated the drivers and to be honest I have no idea if they were or not, but since I feel the whole problem can be fixed with getting the Realtek Audio Manager back, I'm not sure if updating the drivers
 will fix the whole problem. Any ideas of how to get a download for that program? It was all working fine, as I originally had it, but when I did the clean install to fix a bunch of glitches, they made no mention of any programs that might disappear and need
 to be re-installed, beyond the essential ones to get the computer up and running again and on line, which I of course downloaded and installed per their instructions, or used the CDs that came with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, I will go through all your links to see if they can lead me to the info that will fix the problems for me or give me a workaround for now. Thank you again for your help, and if you find out where I can locate the download for the missing
 Realtek program, please let me know. </p>

            <p>Hello again Sandeep!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I did try the links you gave me for diagnosing and fixing&nbsp;the problems but the scans found nothing to fix. I have been trying over several months to get the Realtek folks to answer my e-mail about these problems. I sent it twice to tech support
 and once to customer service, and none of them answered me. It shouldn't take four&nbsp;months to reply, so I'm guessing they don't even bother to check the e-mails or care about any problems we have with their products.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, there is a download for the drivers for my make and model computer on the companies website, but I need to know if downloading the drivers will give me back the Realtek Audio Manager. I'm on dial up and it's a pretty big file and I don't
 want to go through the agony of waiting forever, only to have the download not be of help with my situation, so I'm conflicted about downloading it. Will it damage my computer to download drivers for a program that apparently is no longer there or will it
 somehow prompt my computer to&nbsp;maybe "re-add" the program?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks again for your advice!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Louise</p>

            <p>Hello Sandeep! </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And for anyone else having this problem, it has been solved, and I'm quite jazzed about it! I went to the site of the company that makes my computer, as you suggested earlier, and then to the support area for my model type, and downloaded the Realtek
 Drivers from there, and when I installed them, the Realtek Audio Manager showed up! I believe if you go to the Realtek site and download the drivers from there that apply to your OS, etc, the same thing&nbsp;should happen. If you did a clean install as I did, this
 should work out as well as it just did for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, thanks Sandeep for your advice and assistance. It is very much appreciated. I will keep the links to the audio troubleshooter, should any future problems arise. At least now I know what to do about the Manager, should it disappear again!</p>

            <p>Hi Sandeep!</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will do! I hesitated on whether to do that Realtek driver download, but went ahead out of desperation, so am very grateful that it fixed the problems I had, once I enabled a couple things and made the mixer my default device. Now my two audio recorders
 work again too. I'm glad there are places like this that can offer helpful advice to those of us who aren't quite so computer literate. I will indeed come back with any future questions or problems. Thanks again!</p>

<h2>            Not able to connect to internet after repairing Windows XP.</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: Error 12007 in XP.</p>
<p>We had a virus infection a couple of months ago. The virus caused a lot of damage so I had to repair the XP installation. However, little problems accumulated to the point that I decided to make a new installation. Re-formated the bootable HD and started
 re-installing software. After installing E8, the error 12007 showed up and I&nbsp; lost the internet&nbsp;connection. Initially, I would be able to restore the connection by uninstalling the NIC and re-installing upon rebooting; but later I couldn't restore it at all!</p>
<p>There is always the question if the virus is still present in the system. The computer have 2 HD and I moved data that we did not want lost into the non-bootable one. I did all these after scanning the whole system (I have the Panda Internet security program
 as AV) which resulted in a clean pass. I repeated the scan after the new XP installation before connecting to the web or installing software with the assurance that the computer was clean.</p>
<p>After looking into microsoft support and this forum I tried several of the recommendation given to other with similar problems such as disabling the Bonjour service, upgrading the ethernet drivers (in the motherboard), installing a PCI NIC, and of course,
 going through the internet and network setups around a thousand times.</p>
<p>What else can I do short of go back to install XP from the begining?</p>
<p>Thank you for your help</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Victoreme,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let’s follow these steps &amp; check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may boot into ‘safemode with networking’ and check if the issue persists. It will start Windows XP with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup
 programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed, follow the steps to boot the computer in safe mode:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Start tapping F8 key.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. You will get advanced boot option window.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Select the option “Safe mode with networking”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>A description of the Safe Mode Boot options in Windows XP</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue doesn’t persist in ‘safemode with networking’, you may configure the computer in clean boot and check if you are able to connect to internet.
<span>&nbsp;</span>It will start Windows XP by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs and helps to eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</span></a><br />
<span><strong>Note:</strong> Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the section ‘Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state’ from the article: How to configure Windows XP to start in a
 "clean boot" state:&nbsp; </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</span></a><br />

<p>Q: Please give the details about how to use my skype number where i get continuous ring to my skype mobile or pc.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>When you purchase a Skype Number, your voice messaging is automatically enabled. It might be that your calls are being forwarded to voice messages. To configure it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to the Skype website. </li><li>Under Manage Features, select <strong>Call forwarding</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Voice messaging </strong>then select how many seconds to forward calls after.
</li></ul>
<p>Make sure that you are signed in to one device at a time only so the call to your Skype Number will&nbsp;not be misrouted to a device you are not using. Check that you are set to accept calls from anyone and use the latest version of Skype available for download.
 If this doesn't work, let me know so we can check further. </p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Q: Also tell me how the money from my skype credit gets deducted.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Can you clarify this further? Your Skype credit gets deducted if you call a mobile/landline number not covered by your subscription, or if you send an SMS. Skype credits can also be used as a payment option, so if you used credits to purchase a subscription,
 your credits will be deducted with the same amount you purchased the it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!<br />

<p>I am having the same problem on Skype, no matter whom I call it hangs up after the first ring. &nbsp;It was working as recently as last week. &nbsp;I was using it weekly, and did not have any call forwarding setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know of no way to let Microsoft know when their software is broken, so the only thing to do is to wait. &nbsp; Usually they find this sort of thing on there own, though I have seen it take as long as a year. as they have no real good way of reporting these
 sort of issues that I know of. &nbsp;I did report it thourgh skype, but I am 99.9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999% sure that no human ever reads that.</p>
<p><br />
So, wait for somewhere between one day and one year and it will work again.</p>

    <title>Xbox One USB Offline update problem. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ashleemc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One USB Offline update problem.</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to update my Xbox One using the offline USB method. I have extracted all files and copied the folder into my NTPS USB stick. The update goes well up until its the first few seconds of 'Applying update' part of it which is around 54% and the Xbox
 turns off. A few secnds later it will reboot and give me the 'Something went wrong' with Error 100 and troubleshoot options. The first time i tried the USB offline method it got to about 74% and did the same thing. I have then also tried to factory reset in
 the settings though it just shuts off as soon as I select it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is all breaking my heart as it was working fine yesterday to it having this problem today. Any help would be much appreciated.<br />

<p>Hey there AshleeMc!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to get your console to boot up correctly.
</p>
<p>I know it's not the thing anyone wants to hear but if you are unable to get the offline update to completely initialize and the factory reset did not clear up the issue either, you would definitely need to get your console serviced or replaced.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are interested in a repair you can totally get that done by visiting our

            I believe that is a 32 bit only file and is used for bluetooth operation and works on both 32bit and 64bit system and might not have a 64bit version.

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>I did this and the number is 231 which you said that is probably an MSDN key. How come you are saying I am running a non-genuine copy. I don't understand?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<div>MSDN Keys (which is what you have) are only issued on request to members of MSDN, TechNet, BizSpark, and similar subscription schemes. They are for use ONLY by members of the scheme and cannot be legally sold for any reason, outside of selling the complete
 subscription to the same purchaser. You have therefore been sold a pirated copy of Windows, and there is no guarantee that you didn't also get a bunch of malware along with it.</div>
<div>You need to claim a refund from the vendor, and notify MS of the vendor's details.</div>

<p><span><strong>Your Windows Product ID: 00359-231-7645166-86901</strong></span></p>
<p>Lately there have been several reports of instances of blocked MSDN keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media and reciepts, if you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the store you purchased
 it from and report it to www.microsoft.com/piracy&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you have purchased a key, with or without DVD's or packaging from EBAY or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN key because your key has been blocked you can check a few things yourself, if you received your key with the physical product
 go to www.microsoft.com/howtotell and verify your product however some counterfeit software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.<br />
<br />
To check your PID press the win key and pause at the same time, or open system properties through the control panel, scroll down to activation section and look at the PID It will look something like this 12345-067-1234567-54321, the portion you are interested
 in is the three digit section, if it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have an MSDN key.<br />

<strong>231</strong> </span>, 221 area for premium, there are probably others but they should be close to those posted<br />
<br />
If you have a similar PID, or your key is blocked and you want confirmation post a new thread with a report from the MGADIAG tool, download and run the tool, click copy and paste it in a new post here and Darin Smith from MS can verify your key for you. NEVER
 post your key, the report will suffice.<br />

<h2>            Send To attach a shortcut instead of entire attachment to email&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible to setup a right click Send To that will attach a file shortcut&nbsp;into an email instead of the entire file? (much the same as sending it to the desktop creates a shortcut).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This would be for sharing files internally without clogging up email with the entire attachment and avoid versioning issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hold Shift while you right-click the file, and you'll see a new option on the menu called
<b>Copy as Path</b>. &nbsp;Choose that, then paste into your email to give the recipient a one-click link to the file.
<div><br />
<div>Among the other advantages, this also means that you're sharing a single copy of the file -- so if the other person makes any changes, you'll see them without having to get emailed an updated copy.</div>

            There is no such thing as "the&nbsp; creator owner section." CREATOR OWNER is a security principle. It's similar to a user account, except that it's used exclusively by the operating system.

<h2>            Can&#39;t get into windows 10 because of disk check &#40;chkdsk&#41; at startup</h2>
                    <p>A couple of days ago, I was having an issue with my laptop (Sager) being slow. So, I tried a few possible solutions. I ran a virus scan with defender and a malware scan, but neither of those turned up anything. I also set up a disk check through cmd on startup
 (couldn't do it at that moment because the hdd was in use). Also went to check if my drivers needed to be updated through sdi-tool, and they did (they were very outdated). So, after waiting a few hours until they were done, I finally restarted my laptop. I
 left it for a little bit then came back to see it "scanning and repairing drive (C:): 15% complete". I figured it would take a while, so I went to bed. When I woke up, it was still at 15%. When I tried a hard restart, instead of "scanning and repairing drive",
 it started "preparing automatic repair", "diagnosing the PC", "attempting repairs", and ultimately, it said "automatic repair couldn't repair you PC" and brought me to the Windows 10 boot manager (so now, every-time I restart the pc from boot manager, it does
 the "scanning and repairing" thing then it gets stuck at 15%; when I hard restart it, it does the "automatic repair" thing, fails, then brings me to the boot manager. In that order. Every single time).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after restarting a few times, I tried starting the pc in safe mode, but when it restarts, it scans and repairs then gets stuck at 15%. I tried going into the cmd and using&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">chkntfs
 /x c: to disable auto disk check, but that did nothing (scans and repairs, gets stuck). While I was on cmd, I ran a disk checkup (since the hdd seem to not be in use, I was able to run it through cmd). After that was done, it said that there was no issues
 with the disk. I tried canceling auto disk check using regedit through cmd, but</span> that didn't work (scan and repairs). I tried system restore, but it said that there were no restore points that have been created (which is odd since sdi-tool automatically
 created one before updating the drivers and I'm pretty sure malwarebytes also created one before doing a deep scan). I even tried skipping the scanning and repairing process when it gives me the option before it starts (press any key to skip), but that does
 absolutely nothing. I even tried to extend the 8 second time before it starts the process through cmd (chkntfs /t:), but that changed nothing. I read somewhere that a possible solution was to put the hard drive at the top of the boot priority list in BIOS,
 but when I went to do that,&nbsp;<strong>my hard drive didn't even show up on the list</strong>. This was really weird since I have no issue at starting a disk check through cmd and it still attempts to scan and repair C: and makes it to 15%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I have not tried was reinstalling windows 10 ("Reset this PC"), but that one is truly a last resort since I currently don't have access to a external hard drive/flash drive large enough to back up all my files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the very long entry, but I figured the more details the better. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello <em>jayville74</em>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We have to run additional tests in order to identify the root cause of the issue. But apparently, it shows that the system is no longer able to boot completely to your Windows, only until the recovery environment. It was good that we're still able to access
 the command prompt over WinRE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried booting on Safe mode? To do it: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Start up the the PC. </p>
<p>2. Cancel the auto-repair and click on <strong>Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt;
<p>3. When you see the Startup settings screen you will be prompted to proceed and the system will restart. Now, it will bring you the Startup options:<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/427673db-2f98-4ecb-a5ea-080bd1b62f6d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/427673db-2f98-4ecb-a5ea-080bd1b62f6d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>****Inform us right away if booting on Safe Mode did not work</strong><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>If the system successfully boot on Safe Mode</strong>, this will be our environment of troubleshooting. Try performing
<strong>Disk cleanup</strong>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Search for <strong>Disk cleanup</strong> from the taskbar and select it from the list of results.</li><li>Under <strong>Files to delete</strong>, select the file types to get rid of. To get a description of the file type, select it.</li><li>Select OK.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p><strong>To delete system files</strong>:</p>
<br />
<ol>
<li>In Disk cleanup, select <strong>Clean up system files</strong>.</li><li>Select the file types to get rid of. To get a description of the file type, select it.</li><li>Select OK</li></ol>
<br />
<strong>Next, run System File Checker</strong>:&nbsp;Open an <strong>elevated</strong> CMD (Command Prompt Admin) type
<em>sfc /scannow</em> and hit Enter to run the System File Checker. Once the scan is completed, restart your computer. This time, you may now try to run
<em>chkdsk</em>.&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>We're hoping that this will help.&nbsp;<em>If you would like me to provide additional advice, simply respond to this thread. I will get notified and I’ll reply to you as soon as I can.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind regards.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plug your Flashdrive into a USB port, and wait for windows to detect it.</p>

            <p>I have just had the same problem within the last 12 hours. My wireless adapter Realtek RTL8188CE wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E NIC was disabled, as I discovered in the end, Murphys Law was operating, as&nbsp;it was the last thing I checked and reset&nbsp;:(. All had
 been, for 6 months,&nbsp;and was working well up until 21:45 and then it failed. The drivers are up to date and I am running windows 8.1 with IE11.0.23 with update KB3087038 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am loathe to install windows 10 at this stage, albeit continuing MS subtle and not so subtle pressure to do so, there are very many reasons, least of all the lack of lessons learned in the past from all the updates, in particular security ones, that had
 to be released after previous OS releases, usually to patch holes that had been already been fixed by patches in the prior OS and then come back again.</p>
<p>I have already had to override security, in 8.1,&nbsp;in order to reset defaults, sound in particular,&nbsp;in games apps from the store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an ex systems programmer such things didn't happen on my watch&nbsp;and I want to have more control over what is going on, not less.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway back to the original problem, it has gone, for now, but I am intrigued as to what caused it in the first place. I did notice an additional network card, while I was trying to fix it, I cannot remember the details, it may have been Ethernet, as it
 is not listed under device manager this morning. I did have a new&nbsp;RJ45 to&nbsp;USB connector in place at the time and it is still connected currently.</p>

    <title>Windows Resume Loader problem - Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffnolastnameneeded  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Resume Loader problem - Windows 7</h2>
                    Windows 7 - during boot process I am asked to either "Continue with system resume", or "Delete restoration data and proceed to system boot menu"... At that point, my keyboard is dead... period.&nbsp; To be clear, the keyboard is dead, so please do not instruct
 me to use the arrow keys or to press ENTER, and I do know that the keyboard works because I can set my BIOS options, including creating/changing startup passwords, etc.<br />
<br />
Previous threads on this subject have suggested to press F8 for Advanced Boot Options... if I press F8 during BIOS startup, I still get taken directly to the same screen that asks the same question and subsequently kills the keyboard.&nbsp; Scratch that option.<br />
<br />
I have changed the boot order and inserted the Windows 7 (from Vista) upgrade disc that I used 10 months ago to do the original OS upgrade.&nbsp; Again, I get taken back to the same screen that asks the same question and subsequently kills the keyboard.&nbsp; Scratch
 that option.<br />
<br />
This is not not my first rodeo as I started working w and building PC's back in 1989, and right now, I wish that I still had that level of control of my hardware.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
As you can tell, I am quite frustrated, as I'm not only trying to solve this problem on my daughter's laptop, but losing another battle on my son's laptop that will not boot due to a "winload.exe 0xc00000e9" problem.&nbsp; And yes, I am sending this email using
 the only working laptop in my home... My MacBook Pro.&nbsp; Not a dig, just a statement of fact.<br />
<br />
Please help.&nbsp; Thank you!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer to the following link for how to troubleshoot the hibernation and standby issue.</span></p>

            I sincerely appreciate the timely reply.&nbsp; Thank you.<br />
<br />
Please <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">re-read my original post</span> as I cannot boot my laptop under any of the scenarios that I described because it is
<br />
Therefore,&nbsp; I cannot:<br />
<ul>
<li>boot my laptop in Safe Mode to attempt to delete the hiberfil.sys described in Method 2<br />
</li><li>enter the WinRE to create a System Repair Disc, or any other option that was described in the "WinRE" link that was also described in Method 2</li><li>use the Vista-to-Windows 7 Upgrade disc that I purchased 10 months ago when I originally updated this particular laptop.<br />
</li></ul>
That all said, what <span style="font-weight: bold">new</span> avenues can I explore to solve this problem?<br />

            <p>I have this exact same problem on my Windows 7 Media Center PC from time to time. And the only solution that have worked so far is to plug in an old PS2 type keyboard (USB wont work) in the computer to be able to press enter. Though this will not work on
 a laptop.</p>
<p>I just don't understand why Microsoft didn't use the same countdown timer here as when booting a multiboot setup, that way this problem with getting stuck would not be present.</p>
<p>I saw someone explaning a solution where you would press and hold FN and ALT and then type 013 and release FN and ALT, which is actually the same as pressing&nbsp;ENTER It could not hurt to try.</p>

<h2>            Audio broken &#47; not working for everything excluding windows itself &#40;startup, explorer, etc&#41;</h2>
                    Hello. Recently, sound for video games, media player, and Google Chrome have ceased to work since my computer did a system check on startup. I would have avoided this check but I started up my pc and then left it for about an hour so I didn't really have
 a choice. I use a realtek high definition audio device. I have tried updating my drivers but nothing seems to work. I have tried disabling any sound enhancements, this also did not work. I'm at a total loss here. Based on what I have don and what I ahve found
 out, directsound is broken.<br />
<br />
Help me Microsoft Techies, you are my only hope.

<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What exactly you mean by ‘system checkup’? Are you referring to startup repair?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What was the result of system checkup?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on your computer prior to the system checkup?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In order to diagnose the issue, you may </span><span>check in device manager if there is any error code for sound card.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Type ‘devmgmt.msc’ in <b>Start Search</b> box and press <b>Enter</b> on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In device manager, expand the <b>sound card</b> in the device list.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Double click on it &amp; check the information in device status.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s methods &amp; check if the issue persists:</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Method 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>You may run the Playing Audio troubleshooter &amp; check if the issue reoccurs:</span></p>

</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b></p>

            Sorry, by system checkup I mean the checkup that starts sometimes by itself when my computer is starting up. I would say its start up repair but I didn't ask for it. I guess you could call it something that should repair my computer when it needs it, but
 instead it just pops up after some windows updates, scans the hard drive, and always breaks something unless I stop it.
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Also, sorry, I was tired so I typed up my question quickly. I did everything involving the sound card. I uninstalled it. I disabled it. I tried updating. I googled as much as I could. And I even tried doing this in mixed orders (disable, then uninstall,
 then install, then update. etc.)</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Same with the troubleshooter. Didn't help. Audio and Video is fine by itself. On Internet Explorer, all sounds work. Youtube, flash games, java games, anything. Chrome, nope. Firefox, for some reason won't even start.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Minecraft. Sound works. It's java based. Games that use directsound. nope. I tried installing direct x and c++ again. Nothing. I didn't think that would have done anything anyways.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Although, I might have an idea of whats wrong. Maybe the directsound is pointed in the wrong direction. Maybe games can't play sound because they can't find where to play the sound anymore. Every game (excluding source engine games and of course java games)
 say something about not being able to detect or play the sound. Audiosurf tells me "failed to init playback 0000X (x as in a number i cant remember, i think 3 or 9.) &nbsp;Warband and many other games pop up with a window that says "C:\Windows\system32\AUDIOSES.DLL
 is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error"... oh. Well I would still love to know what to do about this before I touch it because I THINK I know what to do but it could do absolutely nothing or even make it worse. &nbsp;Many thanks Debleena.</div>

<div>Thanks for the additional help on the checkdisk. Still, sound broken. Feels like the solution is near.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Oh and also, i checked up on how to fix the audioses.dll but it could not be fixed the way one answer said how to and the other way i tried was the same result. I could not replace the AUDIOSES.dll because it is always ALWAYS in use. I even stopped&nbsp;unnecessary&nbsp;processes
 but it still said I couldn't replace it because it's in use.</div>

            Alright I managed to fix it myself.
<div><br />
<div>I used Teamviewer file sharing to take the SysWOW64 Audioses.dll from his windows folder and replaced mine with that. I tried playing windows media player and it worked. I played TF2, it worked. Fantastic.</div>
<div><br />
<div>HOWEVER</div>
<div>The next morning a windows update was released and it broke my audio again, this time the System32 audioses.dll was changed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I moved the fixed audoses.dll from SysWOW64 to my external hard drive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did system restore to August 21st (furthest back i could go) and used the Audioses.dll I got from my friend again, replacing my old SysWOW64 audioses.dll &nbsp;A SECOND TIME.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the help but as we all know, the simplest answer is always the answer when it comes to computers. It's just a matter of trying everything simple before getting complex.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In the case of my audio breaking again, i have copied both audioses.dll's to my external hard drive. ( I HIGHLY recommend this)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you. Also, I noticed that this is the only fix for Windows 7 64 bit for this problem.</div>

    <title>Mixer&#47;Microphone cutting out randomly while in use - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmotion  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mixer&#47;Microphone cutting out randomly while in use</h2>
                    First off, here's a video with a direct demonstration of the issue in action, as well as my hardware:&nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLc_oPZUfU8<br />
<br />
As you can see, I've got a Rode NT1 studio mic connected to a Xenyx 802USB mixer that connects to my PC via a USB 3.0 cable (I said USB-C in the video, I meant 3.0). For no reason I can see, in the middle of being used for recording or even while just in idle,
 the USB feed with cut off on me, leaving me without a working microphone. There's no apparent trigger that causes it to stop working, and theres no tell tale sign that it has just cut out. I can monitor the audio through my mixer, but the issue is happening
 after the signal leaves the mixer, so while the sound may not be making it to the PC, I can still plug some headphones into the mixer and hear myself just fine. I've checked drivers, I've reinstalled the device, I've switch USB ports, I've rebooted the PC,
 I've checked for viruses and found nothing, I don't know what else to do.<br />
Other microphones are fine from what I know. My brother uses a headset and never seems to have issues, and he would normally ask me to have a look at it if he had a problem like this that was consistent. I'm sure it can't be an issue with power supply, we've
 got more than enough room to work with on that front, and the mixer only came with the one USB cable type, so it's not like I'm trying to use a USB 2.0 cable and not giving it sufficient power. As I said in the video, some days it doesn't cut out at all. I
 can have a 3 hour Discord call with a friend while playing a game of Overwatch and there'll be no issues. But other days I'll have OBS running to record a video, or I'll have Audacity up to just record my voice, and it'll either not be working as soon as I
 go to use it, or it'll work for 5 minutes then start cutting out frequently.<br />
Note that it also never fixes itself. It only ever cuts out, and not back in. I HAVE to disable and re enable it in the recorder settings in order to get it to work again.<br />
<br />
I will also see if I can get a hold of Xenyx customer support as well, on the off chance this happens with other of the same mixer, but given the popularity of the product and the lack of information I've found on this topic, I'm not sure if they'll be able
 to help me.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the information you have provided, this is most likely a hardware issue. Perhaps a damaged chord, or wiring inside the microphone/mixer due to wear and tear. To verify this, we suggest using a different microphone/mixer and observe if the same issue
 occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly update us.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Update: I replaced the cable with a spare I managed to find that came with a printer from a few years ago. I still had at least one time where the issue happened, but soon after I went through my startup apps and disabled all the useless stuff that just
 wastes resources, incase something might have conflicted with it. One of the programs I disabled was an Elgato Sound Capture program that came along with my Elgato HD60s capture device. The program runs in the background and serves a purpose I'm not too sure
 about, since the device seems to work just find without it. Whatever the case, I've had no issues since then. I just switched on my mic after about 3 or 4 days of it being inactive and my PC is still getting the signal just fine. Switching the mic off and
 muting the channel basically just cuts the power to the mic and sends a mute signal through the USB. So there's almost always a live audio signal being sent to the PC (since the mixer has no off switch and just sits there with everything mute when not in use),
 and for the past 3 or 4 days, while the mic has been off, the mute signal has still been running through to the PC with no disconnections or malfunctions. To my knowledge at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had one sessions of recording since posting the thread, and I had no issues then. And as of now, still nothing abnormal going on. So it was either a faulty cable, or more likely, software interference causing issues. If anything else happens, I'll be
 sure to check back and leave and update, but otherwise, everything seems fine enough now.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.</p>
