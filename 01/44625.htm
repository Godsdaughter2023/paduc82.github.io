            Best thing to do in this scenario is to just wait it out a while. If the points aren't added to your account by the end of the week, then I'd look into contacting support. Also, take screenshots of everything just to be safe!<br />

Hope this helps.

<h2>            Need help, after last Windows 10 update i have been left with a black flickering screen, no access to any recovery options</h2>
                    After the most recent Windows 10 update/upgrade i was experiencing problems with shockwave plugins when browsing. I hit update and restart to try to fix this and when i returned to the computer all i had was a blinking black screen, there is the faintest
 colour change. I cannot access the Bios, recovery options, anything!! All i have is the power button, to hard reset and power up. I have created a copy of windows 10 through the media creation tool and put that on a USB. Nothing happened when i followed the
 instructions on how to boot!! Any help would be appreciated.

            <p>Hi thanks for your post.</p>
<p>You could try this, press the power button and hold for 20 secs then remove battery, leave off for 30 mins, switch bk on holding button for 10 secs and should have option repair this computer or reset.</p>
<p>I tried repair first but no joy then reset and no probs since.</p>
<p>Other option is safe mode which on windows 10 via the power button on screen on bottom left just before log in or bottom right.</p>
<p>HOLD MÒUSE OVER RESTART&gt;HÒLD DOWN SHIFT AND CLICK RESTART.</p>
<p>A menu with options should appear which will help you with your pŕoblems.</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<p>When you get into your computer, run it in Safe Mode to disable all but basic functions and if you have an automatic update app from the maker of your video device, please uninstall it. Also temporarily uninstall Shockwave, refer to Adobe for support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What has been suggested and documented is that a tug of war between Microsoft's automatic updates and your manufacturer's driver updating could be causing some of the problems. There is a solution and it's available on this site if you search, hundreds,
 even thousands have asked similar questions and they are there for you.</p>

            Ok I will stick to one thread. The reason for duplication is due to the frustration of having , an 8 month old Lenovo laptop, completely bricked by a windows 10 update! I can return the computer to the dealer, but it's not really their problem. It's Microsoft's
 update that has caused the problem, so who do I need to contact to get an answer to my predicament! Thanks to everyone for their time, however I cannot access any screen at all.

            Thanks for your time, I will do as suggested if I ever get back into the laptop. However I can do nothing as I can't see anything other than a black flickering screen. Who do I contact at Microsoft about it?

            <p>This is a common problem as I understand. Do some searching here and try terms like 'black&nbsp;screen' or'no video after update'. The problem has a solution or two if you read. I honestly don't know much because I returned to 7 and never had the problem when
 I used 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think you really contact anyone at Microsoft in the sense that you might think of, this&nbsp;is the support site. for what it's worth. However, pulling the batteries, CMOS battery (the CR2032 coin cell that&nbsp;keeps the BIOS/UEFI set)&nbsp;and RAM after you unplug
 WILL reset your computer. If you can get BIOS back you will probably have SOME video for the POST sequence (before Windows starts and you are into full VGA)...try to break into setup...it may take time but hit that key from the moment it's turned on and keep
 at it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But let's also be honest and say I've been up all night and don't want to run searches right now, I need to sleep, you understand. Give the search&nbsp;window at the top of the pages a workout if you will.<em>&nbsp; I KNOW there are solutions here.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">BIOS - How to Enter the BIOS and Change Boot Order To Boot From CD/DVD</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>The computer may need to be set to boot from the DVD drive.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Every computer is different, when you first turn on the computer it should tell you what button to push to enter the BIOS. It's usually one of the following and you must push
 it within the first 5 seconds: </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>F1 &nbsp;F2 &nbsp;F10 &nbsp;F12 ESC &nbsp;DEL
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Once in the BIOS you have to find the menu with the boot order and change it so it boots from the CD/DVD drive first. Every computer is a little different for this process
 as well so I can't give exact directions. </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If your BIOS settings are correct and if you have a DVD drive, when the computer restarts if there is a message to "press any key to boot from disk" you must press a key on
 the keyboard to boot from the DVD. </span></p>

            <p>The BIOS helps to load Windows from the hard disk or if you are installing Windows 7, it helps to load it from the installation DVD or other medium such as a thumb drive.</p>
How to Change Boot Order in BIOS
<p>Depending on the brand or how your computer is configured, loading the BIOS might be different. In this article, I will show you on a standard configuration.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image17.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb17.png" /></a></p>
<p>First, start your computer then press F2 function key as noted on the BIOS screen above, you will have to do this quickly as the BIOS loads very fast. Some BIOS configurations might require a different key combination such as F1, Tab, F12 or F11. Consult
 the owners manual that came with your computer for instructions or watch the display closely when it starts.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image18.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb18.png" /></a></p>
<p>Now we are inside the BIOS, of course yours might look completely different as the interface is not a standard across manufacturers, but the same philosophy is there. The BIOS will list information such as your primary boot device, along with other attached
 storage and secondary storage devices such as your DVD drive and connected peripherals such as your keyboard and mouse. The above screenshot displays the main page of this BIOS screen.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image19.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb19.png" /></a></p>
<p>Navigating your BIOS requires that you use the four way navigation arrow keys, there is no support for using a pointing device such as your mouse. It’s a very simple, as you can see, I am on the Advanced screen of this BIOS, I navigated to it by using the
 right arrow key.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image20.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb20.png" /></a></p>
<p>Here we see the Boot Configuration screen. Yours might vary depending on the Brand and BIOS version. On this screen we can change the first device that is loaded. If your intention is to boot from a device, you will have to change it to be the first one.
 The above screenshot shows that the first boot device is removable, this can either be a DVD or a thumb drive. If you would like to edit this, look for the instructions on screen.</p>
<p>As you can see in the instructions provided, to move a device up or down, you use the plus and minus keys. devices that have a plus sign beside them mean they have information that can be displayed for additional configuration purposes, pressing ‘Enter’
 key will reveal this information.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image21.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb21.png" /></a></p>
<p><em>Using the plus sign on my keyboard to move the CD-ROM Drive at the top to become the first boot device.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image22.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb22.png" /></a></p>
<p>I now have my CD-ROM as the first boot device. If you are using a laptop, use the minus key to place each device down one level until the CD-ROM is the first device.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image23.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb23.png" /></a></p>
<p>After you have made your changes, the next step is to save the changes you have made. This is normally the F10 function Key, press it and your changes will be confirmed. This option will also be combined with an option to also exit the BIOS.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image24.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb24.png" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image25.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb25.png" /></a></p>
<p>To exit the BIOS, you can press the ESC (escape key) on your keyboard or use the navigation key to go to the EXIT menu if one is available and select the appropriate option and press Enter when prompted.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/image26.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fimage_thumb26.png" /></a></p>
<p>You should be prompted to boot from your desired device which in your case would be your Windows 7 DVD. The Windows&nbsp; installation will now begin.

<p>Hello Paul Feltham <br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers</p>
<p>Help me with some more information to help you better.<br />
1. What type of sync are you trying to setup on a shared drive?<br />
2. Which edition of operating system are you using?<br />
3. How are you trying to setup sync on a shared drive?</p>
<p>(A). Try these steps.<br />
1. Right click on the drive<br />
2. Click on the properties,<br />
3. Select security, <br />
4. Click on edit button, <br />
5. On the next window click on add button, <br />
6. Type everyone and click on check names, <br />
7. Once every one is added give full permission to everyone, <br />
8. Restart the computer and check if you can sync the drive.</p>
<p>(B). Check to see if the file is encrypted. Here's how:<br />
1. Right-click the file, and then click Properties.<br />
2. Click the General tab, and then click Advanced.<br />
If the Encrypt contents to secure data check box is selected, you need the certificate that was used to encrypt the file to open it.
<br />
1. You should get the certificate from the person who created the file. <br />
2. Encrypting File System (EFS) is not fully supported on Windows Vista Starter, Windows Vista Home Basic, and Windows Vista Home Premium. For those editions of Windows, if you have the encryption key or certificate, you can do the following:<br />
3. Open Command Prompt and decrypt files by typing Cipher.exe /d at the command prompt<br />
(advanced users).<br />
4. Modify an encrypted file.<br />
5. Copy an encrypted file as a decrypted file to a hard disk on your computer.<br />
6. Import EFS certificates and keys.<br />
7. Open Command Prompt and back up EFS certificates and keys by typing Cipher.exe /r at the command prompt (advanced users).</p>

<p><span>Hi</span><span>
</span><span>Parth,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you not using the network sharing feature in Windows Media Player?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using that service then this service is necessary to run to check for the network computers or devices with which you are sharing your music. This service also indexes/updates
 the library that is being shared.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are not using this service and still it is using the CPU you may change the type of start up to manual (that is has to be started by the user).</span></p>
<p><span>To disable the service temporarily</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open up Services from Control Panel, or type
<strong>services.msc</strong> into the start menu search/run box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Double click on
</span><strong><span>Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service</span></strong><span>, and then change the service start up to
<strong>Manual</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>This has now temporarily disabled the service unless you manually start the service. You may restart the computer and check if the service has been stopped and the CPU usage had come
 down.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.

<h2>            Display Dock &#40;Pro 4&#41; Detects Monitor but Won&#39;t Display</h2>
                    <p>Following a weekend away from home, I came today to&nbsp;find that my display dock no longer will connect to an external display, although it can detect it. I can change all the driver and settings for the monitor connected through the dock&nbsp;in the device manager,
 in fact, but I cannot display on it.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>If I plug the monitor directly into my surface, it connects and displays right away.</li><li>I have uninstalled the dock's "Surface Dock Integration" driver and restarted the computer and plugged back the dock.
</li><li>I have manually updated the Intel driver to the Beta version. </li><li>I have deleted the surface display cache. </li><li>I uninstalled the latest windows 10 update and then re-updated with the auto&nbsp;windows update tool in settings</li><li>I have reinstalled all the latest Surface Pro 4 drivers and firmware. </li><li>I have plugged my tv into my dock and the surface will detect it but wont connect</li><li>I plugged the same tv directly into my surface and it connect instantly.</li><li>I downloaded the surface dock updater and it says the firmware is up to date.</li></ol>
<p>I am getting frustrated. I have no reason to believe that something happened to the dock. I don't want to wait for a new one if I have to claim warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further suggestions?</p>

    <title>How did Incredibar MyStart infection get into my computer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frankymacky  say:</h3>
<h2>            How did Incredibar MyStart infection get into my computer&#63;</h2>
                    So I picked up the subject infection today.&nbsp; It happened right after a reboot after upgrading Adobe Reader.&nbsp; From the waves of this infection that I'm reading about on the web, it likely has nothing to do with Adobe Reader.&nbsp; However, it does raise the
 question of exactly what mechanism allowed it into my laptop.&nbsp; Any comments on this?<br />
<br />
P.S.&nbsp; Spybot Search &amp; Destroy got rid of it, but I did a full scan with MSE and am doing a full scan with MalwareBytes.<br />
<br />
24 June 2012: The subject line got changed when this thread was migrated to this forum.&nbsp; I've revised the changed subject line to make it clearer.&nbsp; Please note that this thread is about specifically the vector for incredibar, not general infection mechanisms.<br />

            Have you installed Incredimail or other program by the same company?&nbsp;
<div>Have you installed some sort of free game, program , codec, toolbar ?&nbsp;</div>
<div>These 2 vectors are the most typical. On itself, it is non-typical for incredibar to be distributed through trojans or vulnerabilities, and do not think it would be installed by existing malware.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you haven't removed it, there are easy ways to check, as typically bundled software is installed to different location and no uninstaller is provided. If it was installed with some sort of their own company product, uninstaller should be there... &nbsp;</div>

            Could I please ask that moderators refrain from marking questions as being answered too soon?&nbsp; This was not a question about general knowledge regarding the vector of this kind of malware.&nbsp; As I mentioned, I did web-research this.&nbsp; It is a question specifically
 about this malware, which seems to afflict even the most careful of users.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I do appreciate the responses, and I am happy to report that MSE, Spybot S&amp;D, and MalwareBytes all came up clean.&nbsp; Also, I never permit such add-ons, and I never dealt with the organization or site in the past.<br />
<br />
I am still curious about information about the infection mechanism for this malware when it becomes available.&nbsp; Cleaning a system doesn't seem to be all that reassuring if one never knows when one will get the same infection again.<br />

            <p>Your question was marked as answered because this is a forum for Microsoft Security Essentials. You were given direction on how to deal with it and the explanation is that this adware (not malware) is bundled with other products. I realize that you report
 that you don't allow add-ons like this, but the suspicion is that this one slipped by.</p>
<p>Since your quesiton is now of a more general nature, I'm moving it to the Windows Security forums.</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you get infections in the computer, you can always use the Microsoft Safety Scanner from the link :</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/security/scanner</a>
<div><strong>Note</strong>: If any infections are detected during the scan, there might be a chance of data loss as the infected files will be deleted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A malware could get into a computer mostly when the virus definitions of the Security program in the computer are not as up to date as the virus or malware program. For more information on different aspects of a malware infection and how to prevent it
 from getting into a computer, please go through the contents described in the following links:</div>

            Thanks, Winston.<br />
<br />
Is that just another AV (since I already run MSE, MalwareBytes, and Spybot S&amp;D) for an added layer of protection?<br />
<br />
I'm not really trying to de-infect at this point, just hoping to get any new info on the infection mechanism.&nbsp; I run a pretty clean laptop, as I have described.<br />

            Hi,
<div>Which is the operating system that you are using? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>MyStart by Incredibar is a browser hijacker that will alter Internet browser settings on the infected computer. This threat also drops certain files and registry entries that are essential to complete its tasks.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to refer the article below and check if any of the symptoms are displayed.

            Winston,<br />
<br />
I appreciate that you've put the time into responding to this thread, but it should be apparent from the thread that I do my web research.&nbsp; In the interest of saving you time, could you please read the thread before trying to help?&nbsp; It would also help in maintaining
 the focus of the thread, which I'm constantly trying to re-establish.<br />
<br />
As I've mentioned, I'm not trying to de-infect.&nbsp; There are plenty of other resources on the web (likely even in this forum) that address that question.&nbsp; As I have mentioned, this thread asks about the mechanism for this malware specifically.&nbsp; You suggested
 an alternate antimalware, which is a sidebar to the topic, but I was curious as to why Microsoft has two different products for antimalware.&nbsp; You posted the definition of the alternate product from the web, which is one of the first things that people will
 see from a web search.&nbsp; However, it doesn't answer the question of whether it is just another AV for an added layer of protection, which was the question posted in response.<br />
<br />
I suspect that I didn't articulate my question to the sidebar clearly enough.&nbsp; There is no end to the products that one can throw at malware with the hopes that one of them will catch and dis-infect, either partially or completely.&nbsp; However, I was wondering
 why Microsoft would have the extra product.&nbsp; Why not just fold the functionality into MSE?&nbsp; Is it simply because Microsoft is so big that separate antimalware product efforts naturally emerge?&nbsp; Are they so different in functionality that it would be difficult
 to combine the two?<br />
<br />
This is somewhat of an important question because I suspect most Windows users rely on the stock MSE, and the existence of the other Microsoft Safety Scanner raises questions of what standard operating procedure should be.&nbsp; Should we now maintain updated databases
 for two different Microsoft products?&nbsp; Or is the latter only for disinfection after the malware has entered the system?<br />

    <title>Cannot remove lock screen password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lailars  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot remove lock screen password</h2>
                    <p>I just downloaded Windows 10, and everything has been working well so far... except this: every time I turn my screen off on my Surface pro 3, no matter what I do, I cannot stop the password prompt from coming up in the lock screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 8 before I upgraded, I had it set to lock only after the screen had been off for 10 minutes, which I really liked. I want that back.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, since I couldn't figure&nbsp;<em>that </em>out (not for lack of trying), I decided to remove the darn thing altogether. Which has failed. Here's what I've tried:</p>
<p>I changed the sign-in options in settings to 'never' require a password. I selected 'don't require a password' in the 'password protection on wakeup' in control panel power options. In user accounts settings I deselected 'users must enter a user name and
 password to use this computer'.&nbsp;<em>And</em> I went into the 'local group policy editor' and enabled 'do not display the lock screen'. I restarted my computer after each change, just to make sure it stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It didn't. After all that, I turn the screen off and on again only to find - you guessed it - a place to enter my password. I was so frustrated last night, I almost switched back to windows 8.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody please help before I throw my computer across the room.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem on two computers that I upgraded over the past couple of days.&nbsp; Strangely, I have one machine that has been participating for the past several months in the "Insider" program and it does not have the problem even with the latest Win10
 stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that helps a little at this point is assigning a PIN to the account.&nbsp; Then the logon is just 4 numbers and you don't have to hit Enter at the end.</p>

            <p>This is terrible!&nbsp; This is a huge problem and I am thinking of going back to 8.1.&nbsp; I click the screen off for 30 seconds and I have to enter my password again!&nbsp; Please, Microsoft, fix this issue! I have tried all the different settings and some work for
 a little while, then its back to signing in.&nbsp; Why have settings that don't work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get that I have to sign in when I reboot/turn the power on, I'm OK with that.&nbsp; But I have a Surface Pro 3, which is way cool, but I should not have to input my password every single time I shut the screen off! Seriously.</p>

            <p>Here in our home we are not business users, don't have company come over that uses the computer, and don't care who in the family sees what each of us is doing or has done. That said - we, all 5 of us, use the same "account" on our only desktop computer.
 Trying to get this point across to Microsoft desk jockeys......I DON'T WANT THIS D**N LOCK PASSWORD ON MY COMPUTER. I really DON'T want my computer linked to my MS account anyway. OMG but I am giving critical thought to reverting back to my previous Windows
 version. At least THAT one I don't have to enter a frickin' password or pin or pick a picture to sit down and start working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We already have a tight lockdown on our wi-fi here so unless the NSA is listening in then no one but us can use our wi-fi anyway. Not ALL of us out here in fly-over-land needs this "extra layer of security". Just put the option back in to either enable it
 or disable it. Jeesh. Is it really that hard?</p>

<div>Hi TheWolfer,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. When exactly does the issue occur? Is it while using the computer or when you leave the system idle?<br />
2. Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</div>
<div><br />
<div>This might happen if the display settings are incorrect or the display driver is malfunctioning.</div>
<div><br />
Try the following steps and check the result.<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Apply best display settings<br />

<div><br />
<div><strong>Step 3:</strong> Check if there are any errors in device manager</div>
<div>a. Click Start, type devmgmt.msc and hit enter.</div>
<div>b. From the list of items, expand Display adapters and check its sub item to see if there is any bang on it or any of the items in the list.</div>

<h3> skrawn  say:</h3>
<h2>            KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE BSoD on RNDIS Device After Feature Update 1709</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a device that uses RNDIS to communicate with a desktop application. The driver for it has been working for years, including on Windows 10. The driver is simply an INF file that calls rndis6.sys with the correct fields changed for the USB vendor
 and product ID, as well as device name. After installing Feature Update 1709, when the device is connected to a Windows 10 PC and turned on, the device starts to enumerate with Windows and then a BSoD happens with the error KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE. I've
 rolled back Windows to just before the update and confirmed that 1709 has broken the driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What changed in 1709 and what do I need to do to fix this?</p>

            There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability. 
<br />
<br />Just to touch back on why I personally think it might be broken. When Microsoft starts preparing for a new release, it goes through a process called refactoring. It seems this is introducing some significant code changes that breaks certain protocols and API's required by older apps and drivers. Considering the Windows Driver Model has not changed much in its near 30 year history not mention the application programming interfaces such as Win32, this might be culprit. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft might be making plans to leave behind WIN32 soon, as evidenced by the edition called Windows 10 S which only uses Store apps.

<br />
<br />You can download your Windows 10 ISO by using the Media Creation Tool through here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />You will need a flash drive of 8 GB or larger in capacity, and a computer to do this on. After you prepare the flash drive using the Media Creation Tool, use it with your computer. Make sure you have your product key handy.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.

<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Starting the Upgrade

<h2>            Windows 10 not remembering default audio player after last update</h2>
                    <p>Ever since Windows 10 is did the major update about 2 weeks ago my laptop/HDMI screen setup keeps defaulting to the HDMI speakers instead of the external speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The minute I go in and change the speakers to external speakers the sound works fine.&nbsp; I tell it that I want the external speakers set as default and it still works fine until I reboot and then have to go and change the settings to external again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has only been doing this since the last upgrade.&nbsp; WHY???? What can I do to fix it so that every time I login I don't have to change my speaker settings.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that the user profile has been corrupted that's why the settings are not being retained. Can you confirm if you have tried to reinstall the drivers for the device that you're trying to use? If that doesn't work, try to create a new account and
 try to set it up in there and see if it helps. For the steps in creating a new account, kindly refer to this link

            Hello SeaCos, <br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are being advised this is not compatable with Windows 7 you will need to contact HP support to see about drivers compatable. Are you following the steps below to set up your printer? Please let us know status. Thanks!
<br />
<br />
http://www.hp.com/sbso/bussupport.html <br />
<br />
Windows 7 Install a printer <br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Install-a-printer <br />
<br />
Open Devices and Printers by clicking the Start button , and then, on the Start menu, clicking Devices and Printers.
<br />
<br />
Click Add a printer. In the Add Printer wizard, click Add a local printer. On the Choose a printer port page, make sure that the Use an existing port button and the recommended printer port are selected, and then click Next.
<br />
<br />
On the Install the printer driver page, select the printer manufacturer and model, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;If your printer isn't listed, click Windows Update, and then wait while Windows checks for additional drivers. If none are available and you have the installation CD, click Have Disk, and then browse to the folder where the printer driver is located. (For
 additional help, consult the printer manual.) Complete the additional steps in the wizard, and then click Finish.

<h2>            VB6 will not load MSCOMCT2.OCX on Windows 7 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to transfer an old item of VB6 software from a (broken) Windows XP system to a 64-bit Windows 7 system, but I am having problems getting the IDE to load mscomct2.ocx in order to rebuild the program.<br />
<br />
On selecting it from the Components dialog, I get a simple message saying "'C:\Windows\SysWOW64\mscomct2.ocx' could not be loaded". Other modules, such as mscomctl.ocx, appear to load without error.<br />
<br />
The new system is running 64-bit Windows 7 Ultimate SP1.<br />
<br />
The new system has VB6 SP6 on. The mscomct2.ocx module in SysWOW64 has been successfully registered. The IDE is running as Administrator.<br />
<br />
The mscomct2.ocx that I have on the new system is file version 6.1.97.82 (product version 6.01.9782) and is 646KB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked in various forums across the Internet but none of the suggested fixes seem applicable.</p>

<p>I guess there are no experts left for this area.&nbsp; :-)<br />
<br />
The cause was not obvious, but UAC settings definitely had an effect. As I said in the original post, VB6.EXE was running as Administrator, but it was also running in XP compatibility mode (forgot to say that) which is an acknowledged requirement.<br />
<br />
Setting my UAC level to the bottom (Never Notify) and rebooting the machine made the IDE error disappear, although it had still occurred (quietly) because the relevant classes of the control (e.g. DTPicker) were inaccessible and it wouldn't compile. Oddly,
 though, restarting the IDE made it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't believe this as I had made no changes in between. I pushed my UAC level back up a notch and rebooted. The error came back, so I lowered it back to the bottom setting and everything seemed to work OK the next time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand this. If anyone else tries to follow my sequencing then don't be alarmed if you find occasionally that the IDE won't uncheck mscomct2.ocx from the Control list because it is "in use". The symptoms seemed to vary as I made these changes,
 and when I tried to reproduce things to publish a write-up here, nothing seemed to behave as it did the first time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now running with UAC at its lowest level and mscomct2.ocx loads OK in the IDE. As far as I can see, this was the only control that was experiencing this issue -- the code uses quite a few others and they were loaded OK by the IDE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone else finds this valuable. Without an explanation, I am still a little concerned</p>

<p>The "Installing features and drivers" phase is the trickiest part of upgrade. If you see a failure c1900101 x300xx, it means we failed during this phase. The most common failure is x30018, which generally means a driver crashed when we loaded it for the
 first time. Any driver could cause the failure, but it may not crash 100 percent of the time. If you try again, it may just work.</p>

<p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em> diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without </em>quoting my post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you&nbsp;get the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Was it a brand-new computer or used computer when you got it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Is it a Vista 32-bit or a 64-bit computer?&nbsp; See <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827218" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/827218</a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<br />
</span>3. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed? What third-party firewall
 (if any)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em>s ince you got it</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">when</span> it was brand-new?</em> (Doesn't matter if it was&nbsp;never used or Activated.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Is SP2 being offered via Windows Update or have you been attempting to install it manually?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Is Internet Explorer 7 (IE7), IE8 or IE9 installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Have you ever had occasion to do a Repair Install or a clean install of Windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic;
<strong><em>System Mechanic</em></strong>; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; PC Doctor; TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo
 System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer; CCleaner <em>Registry Cleaner</em>)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: Support for Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1) ended on Tuesday, <em>12 July 2011</em>.
</strong>Computers still running Vista SP1 "will no longer receive software updates [i.e., updates released after 12 July 2011

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Do you get the error message after the computer wakes up from sleep?<br />
<br />
If yes, install this <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/982046" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
hotfix</a>.<br />
<br />
I'd recommend you reinstall Bluetooth drivers from device manager and check if that helps.<br />

            <p>Hello mohamed85555555,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In regards to the hotfix, I would verify that you are installing the proper version of it- 32 bit vs. 64 bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's attempt the following operation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the latest drivers from the manufacturer's site.</li><li>Uninstall the drivers currently in Device Manager.</li><li>Reinstall the latest drivers which you downloaded.</li><li>Reboot.</li></ol>
<p>See how things work after that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, take a look at the following blue tooth informational articles&lt;unrelated, but here for informational purposes&gt;:</p>
