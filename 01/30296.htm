<p>It really depends on what kind of screen you have.&nbsp; Some models have to use the buttons on the side of the monitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a laptop, you can probably do it using keyboard buttons on your keyboard (every laptop uses different ones, so check your instruction manual).</p>
<p><br />
If your laptop was built to allow it, you can also adjust it from the Power Settings in Control Panel, or the Display Settings (Windows 10 Settings).</p>

<h2>            Error DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL when Windows 10 update Failed</h2>
                    <p>I have tried a half a dozen times to upgrade to Windows 10 unsuccessfully. The Control panel says "Windows Update ran into a problem" and shows an error code of C1900101-30018. When I followed the whole process, everything was configured 100% after the download,
 my computer restarted and Upgraded to Windows 10 until it got to about 30% - all the files were copied and it was working on installing the drivers. At that point a frowny face Blue screen popped up with the message: "Your PC had a problem and needs to restart.
 We are collecting some error info and then we'll restart for you." Then, "If you'd like to know more you can search online later for this error -&nbsp;DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL {CHDRT64.sys)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is frustrating, can someone please help? I am updating from Windows 8.1 on a Lenovo Yoga 13 Laptop&nbsp;</p>

            My husband gave me the idea to try the Windows 10 update again with all external devices (USB hub, Bluetooth mouse) unplugged from my laptop. It worked!! I should have thought of that, but it was not mentioned as part of the update. Anyway, I am glad to
 have successfully installed Windows 10 and am now getting to know it.&nbsp;

<h2>            I literally cannot print screen on my laptop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I bought a Toshiba C50-B-14D windows 8.1 laptop, tried to print screen a couple of times now and still can't for some reason. Looked at previous posts about pressing the Windows button+PRTSC (print screen button), or ALT+PRTSC... and nothing works?
 When I try and do it on the internet the page just suddenly automatically scrolls to the bottom of the page and doesn't screenshot, same happens with my mates laptop who has the same laptop as me.<br />
<br />
Tonight I then tried to take a screenshot from a video clip on windows media player of one of my gopro clips, still couldn't print screen/screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how to screenshot on this laptop, as honestly, I've tried what seems like everything and still no luck... Confused. Tried just pressing the&nbsp;print screen&nbsp;button, tried pressing the windows button on the keypad and the&nbsp;print screen&nbsp;button at the
 same time, tried ALT+print screen&nbsp;button, tried shift+print screen. Someone pleassssse help, it's driving me nuttttsss!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks :)</p>

 for more memory, but I can't move any program files or apps onto the SD card off the OS/C drive.&nbsp; I am the administrator of the account, but it won't let me move any files onto the SD Card. How can I ever get the windows 10 upgrade if I will never have more

            Solution works for most of users. 
<br />
<br />As per the disclaimer, I personally tested this site several times and, while I cannot give 100% guarantee that is safe (I do not manage it, this is the reason for the disclaimer), if you just follow instructions you won't have issues.
<br />
<br />The reason why I do not post a solution direcly here is not lazyness, but using advanced formatting - images - links - etc. is not easy with experts platform, so complex solutions (as this is) are more readable for yourself using the link.
<br />
<br />If you still think that you want it here, please just let me know and I will adapt it for you here (just allow me some time for doing it).

Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

            Hi Sandra,
<br /> 
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of Windows 10 - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next 2 years of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything ! 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>Original title: <span>systempropertiesadvanced.exe &amp; other things</span></p>
<p>Working on mom's laptop, Vista Hm Prem SP2 (64bit), have experienced several issues in last few days.&nbsp; Cannot update, stays at 0%, applied hotfix default &amp; aggressive, reinstalled update, etc, no benefit.&nbsp; System Restore is intermittent in allowing access
 and/or creation points.&nbsp; Optional features does not populate via control panel or cmd line.&nbsp; Have MSE &amp; Defender installed, both report being up to date and scans are negative.&nbsp;&nbsp; Can't install antivirus due to errors, msi files give errors as well.&nbsp; Have run
 a few anti-malware scans but all report system to be clean.&nbsp; Have uninstalled a few riskier 3rd party apps and run LSPfix with a few corrections.&nbsp; Java, flash and anything I could think of have been updated.&nbsp; Server is disabled in Services as well as any other
 that I could think of which might possibly lessen security or be uneccessary.&nbsp; Cannot uninstall windows live or portions of it without their inevitable return and usually with additional addons. All non-essential apps disabled in startup of msconfig.&nbsp; Safe
 mode has little effect on improving capabilities.</p>
<p>Now, clicking on Advanced System Settings in System/control panel returns <em>
"Windows cannot find 'C:\\Windows\\system32\\systempropertiesadvanced.exe'. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again."</em> (double backslashes not a typo).&nbsp; Attempting via cmd line returns cmd as unrecognized.&nbsp; Using SET i see a bunch of
 irregularities, pasted below.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know how to correct them and am hoping you can help. &nbsp; Thanks so much, my apologies if this is *way* too much informationor if I've left out anything vital.</p>

            <p>Had the same issue with my Asus. I reverted to 8.1 and downloaded all the networking drivers. Then re-installed Windows 10. Once complete, I uninstalled any networking driver from the device manager, restarted, then reinstalled the driver from what I downloaded
 earlier. After a second restart, I was able to connect to the network. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems there's an issue with migrating the driver during the upgrade process. Hope his helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The issue for me was caused by the global sonicwall VPN client. When Windows 10 upgraded, for whatever reason it replaced my network adapters with the sonicwall VPN adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution was to revert to 8.1, uninstall the VPN client, and re-upgrade windows 10.</p>

</p><p>It's a known bug with the upgrade process and has happened to all of my colleagues.</p>

<h2>            XP home - computer freezes while idle processes run</h2>
                    Windows XP home edition - computer freezes for about 30 minutes soon after start-up while the following applications run wuauclt.exe, svchost.exe, khost.exe and ccsvchst.exe. Any way to disable these until the computer is actually idle or is the answer
 to add more RAM? Problen seems to get worse with each new update.

<p><span>Did you make any recent hardware or software changes on your computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>Check if the issue persists in safe mode (Step 1). If the issue does not persist in safe mode then, perform clean boot (Step 2) on your computer.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>1. Restart the computer</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Start tapping F8 key</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Starting your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. This kind of startup is known as a "Clean boot."</span></span></p>

            <p>Thanks for this - no no changes in hardware or software, the problem has just gradually got worse with time. Safe mode appeared to sort it so I tried a clean boot. Not being very confident I opted for the Guided Help. Unfortunately that just brings up a

<h2>            Windows Vista 32-bit gets BSOD when 4gb of RAM inserted&#63;</h2>
                    I'm running Windows Vista 32-bit and until recently ran fine with just 2GB of RAM. I used Crucial to order new compatible memory so that my computer could run at the max of 4GB of RAM. After inserting the new RAM, I started to get the BSOD on startup,
 and if it got through somehow, it would BSOD again a few hours later. I have since removed the RAM because I am now aware that Vista can't handle the 4GB. I heard that there is a fix to stop the BSOD from happening, can someone please show me this fix so that
 I can just try to run my computer again?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Your new ram is not matched to the old ram. Try the new ram by itself and see if the computer<br />
runs ok. If it does then either the memory is not the same (even memory that has the same<br />
specs can be off enough not to work since high speed memory has tight tolerances). Another<br />
rarer possibility is that the motherboard has a problem.<br />
<br />
Check with the System maker (or motherboard maker if&nbsp;a custom built computer). There may<br />
be BIOS, low level chipset drivers or other changes than help.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Another trick is to put the new memory in the first slots. If the memory can exist together the<br />
fastest has to be installed first. Of course there could be issues that would not help.<br />

            All 4 sticks are 1GB sticks, so none are better than the others. I am currently running the 2 new sticks just fine. They work fine separately. I can even run the computer with 4gb, and my computer will recognize that on the "My Computer" window. I simply
 get BSOD occasionally, and it bothers me because sometimes it is difficult to start up again after it BSOD's.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Its not being better, its being identically the same including the tolerances allowed. As I said, even<br />
memory that appears to be perfectly matched may not work together since the tolerances can be<br />
off. Try the newer memory in the 1st slots and the older in the last slots. <br />
<br />
Check with the System maker and even the memory maker.<br />
<br />
===============================================================<br />
<br />
Pretty much expect the problem to be a slightly off memory match. If you want to troubleshoot the<br />

<p>I just have a hard time believing that Crucial would pair me with incompatible RAM. That is, after all, the purpose of that site, to scan your computer and existing RAM and slots and make sure you have compatible RAM for the existing slots that you're looking
 to fill. I believe this problem would be solved with KB929777 or whichever update that is, however when I try to install it, it says that the update does not apply for my computer. I have tried every method that I have read online to make it install correctly
 to no avail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One method involved using only 3GB of RAM, which caused my computer to fail starting, regardless of the order of the RAM (of course the likes were together). This prompted 2 long beeps during POST. With 4GB of RAM, my computer started to what it is now,
 but seems to be glitchy, laggy, and is having some errors running certain programs, which isn't surprising based on how many times I've had to do a hard shut down. The update that I've been trying to install hasn't failed yet, but it has also failed to find
 any update. I have yet to experience BSOD though.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>They did not purposely give you ram that is incompatible. The tolerances are so tight that even<br />
taking ram off the same production run may not work well together. This is a known issue when<br />
dealing with memory upgrades. As memory gets faster this problem might and likely will get<br />
worse.</p>
<p>Check with the System maker since if there is any fix they should know about it.</p>
<p>This is KB929777 if it applies to your system. Download link is included.<br />

            I'm definitely trying to run Vista with more than 3 GB of RAM, so I believe that update applies. However, it seems impossible to receive that update. I can't install it with 2GB of RAM, I can't install it with 4GB, my computer won't start with 3GB, and
 this seems to be a common problem. It's not like the cards don't work together, they do for several hours before crashing. However, trying to install this update always results in, "This update does not apply". I've downloaded it just fine, but it refuses
 to install because it claims it does not apply. It most certainly does though, as this fix supposedly fixes the BSOD resulting from running Vista with more than 3GB of RAM.

<p>Yup, I got the 32-bit version. I am the only account on this computer, it is my own, so I am by default the admin. I have also tried in Safe Mode. In Safe Mode I am allowed to download it, but I am not allowed to install, as it says that I "Cannot perform
 this action in safe mode".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have all other drivers and updates completed, the only other problem I can think of would maybe be the BIOS. It's listed as Phoenix Technologies, LTD ro1-b4 2/9/2007 on my system information. Acer's website shows only drivers and a BIOS update for my computer,
 all of the drivers I have currently. The BIOS update I am... holding off to get, as I hear that can be risky at times.</p>

    <title>Microsoft How to stop Windows 10 upgrade&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft How to stop Windows 10 upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    Why did you want me check those when I already read them and no replies to deal with the problem. I have Window 7 64bit and I have no intention of upgrading. But yet today I found $Windows.~BT installed on computer. I have not opted to reserve Windows
 10. I also have a problem with the OS trying to configure my system by moving files around. I was working on a project and the whole Download was copied to favorites which by me looking in windows event viewer the data was sent to Microsoft. You will notice
 the Download folder is not a shortcut but a exact copy.&nbsp; Now I have the same problem with My Document folder being copied to My library folder, which also gathers the data to send data by WMC.&nbsp; This is getting to be too intrusive. The data I want to collect
 and manipulate to my preference and not classify to Microsoft liking. Now call me old school but I do know how to set up directory structures and like to keep them a certain way as this is a ongoing project mine it is constantly changing so it is not set.
 Also some programs I use do not come from a apps store and because they don't you should not prevent them from running. Sorry to say that Windows 10 in its current state does not belong on a Desktop as it hinders productivity when working with files and folders.
 It's great for portable devices but I thinks it goes to far when it comes into your home. Especially when WMC is not included which is one reason I can not upgrade and 30 days is not enough time to install programs and data and compatibility, (last time it
 took me 7 weeks). So I am asking how do I stop theese updates from downloading Windows 10 and its security features. Is there a way to opt out of upgrading or installing its
<span><em>prerequisite</em></span>. Now I am afraid to install any updates as they are not security features but a way to collect more data or obtrusive advertising. So how can I clean this up?

 need to get my computer back to a working state before all this intrusion and reconfiguration took place. It will take me close to 8 weeks to configure windows from scratch.&nbsp; What updates should I avoid. KB3035583 is not the problem the KB2952664 is the problem
 as I can not remove or uninstall it.&nbsp; This would be classified a trojan if it did not come from Microsoft (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_%28computing%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_horse_%28computing%29</a>).
 Even though I tried to find its location but can't because it renames itself. The very thing that Microsoft updates are supposed to protect me from are now changing the system files and configurations. It would seem that Windows 7 is becoming like Windows
 10 without Cortana, Directx 12 and its interface. (As most desktop users do not want it contrary to the media) As a support engineer (aka just a title) what actions can I take to prevent this? Is there a list of updates that I should avoid.

</p><p>PS: A word to the wise As by upgrading to Windows 10 it you relinquish your rights by doing so. Microsoft owns it.</p>

            <p>I found a reliable way to prevent Windows 10 update from installing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.ubuntu.com/</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I have done it on one of my machines. When my family gets comfortable using it, I will upgrade the rest of my computers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 was the last drop in the bucket of my patience. I missed the 30-day period to roll back to the infamous 8.1 because I rarely use my home computers and my family did not report the issues but kept rebooting all the time.</p>

            <p>The FIRST thing that needs done is to set Updates to "Check for updates, but let me choose whether to download and install them", as opposed to Automatically install. KB3035583 and KB2952664 are persistent, and are re-released by Microsoft every month.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are using Windows Update, look at <strong><em>installed updates</em></strong>, you can search by KB number, right-click - uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the updates return again, right click them and click "hide", that will keep the updates from installing this time around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are also quite a few updates that add Win10 telemetry to Windows7 and 8/8.1. Those too, should not be installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a list I've been compiling since March 2015 when I started testing Win10 (Too bad it seems as though Win10 is still in Alpha testing phase). DO feel free to copy this list and distribute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB's to NEVER install. The Malicious update KB's need to be ripped out by the roots if already installed!!<br />

            <blockquote>Why did you want me check those when I already read them and no replies to deal with the problem. I have Window 7 64bit and I have no intention of upgrading. But yet today I found $Windows.~BT installed on computer. I have not opted to reserve Windows
 10. I also have a problem with the OS trying to configure my system by moving files around. I was working on a project and the whole Download was copied to favorites which by me looking in windows event viewer the data was sent to Microsoft. You will notice
 the Download folder is not a shortcut but a exact copy.&nbsp; Now I have the same problem with My Document folder being copied to My library folder, which also gathers the data to send data by WMC.&nbsp; This is getting to be too intrusive. The data I want to collect
 and manipulate to my preference and not classify to Microsoft liking. Now call me old school but I do know how to set up directory structures and like to keep them a certain way as this is a ongoing project mine it is constantly changing so it is not set.
 Also some programs I use do not come from a apps store and because they don't you should not prevent them from running. Sorry to say that Windows 10 in its current state does not belong on a Desktop as it hinders productivity when working with files and folders.
 It's great for portable devices but I thinks it goes to far when it comes into your home. Especially when WMC is not included which is one reason I can not upgrade and 30 days is not enough time to install programs and data and compatibility, (last time it
 took me 7 weeks). So I am asking how do I stop theese updates from downloading Windows 10 and its security features. Is there a way to opt out of upgrading or installing its
<span><em>prerequisite</em></span>. Now I am afraid to install any updates as they are not security features but a way to collect more data or obtrusive advertising. So how can I clean this up?

<p>Here is an error I get:</p>
<p>USB composit Device is an older USB device and might not work with USB 30.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, Can i just go out and buy a USB 3 plug for the printer and that will solve the problem.&nbsp; The plug I have now is Philips 374374 200736</p>

<div>All is now good. I also recommend right clicking and changing the 'Printing Preferences'. Page size should be A4, and not 'Letter'. This solves the issue of the printer only printing the first page of a document.&nbsp;</div>

            Hi Manish.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What is the Activation Status and Edition showing at the top of the page at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?  
<br />
<br />Run the Activation Troubleshooter in the same location and report back its findings
<br />
<br />If you have not reinstalled Windows then you can install ProducKey:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a> to read the Product Key.   You can copy and paste that key in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change Product Key.   It may or may not be the default version key which many retail keys convert to and only uses the Generic Version key here:

            Hi Manish
<br />
<br />If you have not already activated Windows, there is not much we can do, because that licence key will not have been stored on the Microsoft activation servers . . .
<br />
<br />Did you at any point use that product key to activate your Windows 10, and if so, is Windows now showing as not activated:
<br />
<br />If so, Click your Start Button, type cmd then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator' 
<br />
<br />Run or paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />slmgr.vbs /dlv 
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of the resulting dialog . . .

<h2>            Virus posing as Windows disk fixer....</h2>
                    I had a virus that hid all of my desktop shortcuts, all of my internet favorites, all of my saved documents...how do I unhide all of that ?&nbsp; I know the docs exist as I can pull them up on "recent items" and they still exist...I know my favorites still
 exist as I try to resave sites under favorites and it asks if I want to overwrite the favorite already in existance....

    <title>Windows 7 doesn&#39;t remember folders views. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 doesn&#39;t remember folders views.</h2>
                    <p>original title: Windows 7 doesn't remember folders views. Pathetic Microsoft.</p>
<p>Once again I find it totally pathetic that Microsoft Windows 7, like Vista, Like Windows XP and all the other operating systems M$ has developed can't EVEN remember the layout for folders.<br />
<br />
What is THE POINT of even having customization options in Explorer for the users to set, if your STUPID explorer code doesn't even BOTHER to remember them. Users go to the trouble of customizing their desktops and folder layouts only to discover that their
 work is undone as soon as the PC reboots or Windows 7 decides to forget or overwrite the stuff in the registry.<br />
<br />
It's also pathetic that M$ has removed most of the "individual" folder customization options from Windows XP now opting for a "one view fits all approach!". (I.E The removal of the folder option "View Tab / Remember this folders layout"). I can't decide if
 one folder when opened should have the "Navigation Bar" on the left. Now if one folder has the navigation bar, hey look, ALL MY FOLDERS open with the navigation bar now! Yay! NOT.
<br />
<br />
Even with this, IT STILL forgets every customization that you've made to your folders!<br />
<br />
Things that go through my head when I'm using Windows 7:<br />
<br />
Mmmm. I'd like my folder to have this icon or bitmap picture please. There we go, very nice. Reboot. Mmmm. Why's it gone back to showing all the file type icons in that folder again! Oh god, even worse! NOW ALL MY FOLDERS HAVE REVERTED TO DETAILS VIEW!!!!!
 B*llocks, I only spent many, many, many hours (over time) setting that lot up! Gee thanks for screwing me over M$. You obviously spent lots of money and many, many hours asking your BETA users what would p*ss them off the most when using Windows Explorer.
 Geeky beta tester voice: "Erm yes, I think I'd be very p*ssed if all of a sudden it reverted to details on all my folders in explorer". Microsoft: "OK, we'll be sure to include that then... Anything else that would p*ss you off". Geek: "Yes, while your at
 it, if the navigation bar appeared in EVERY folder and didn't even have a shortcut key so I had to reach for my mouse and go to a menu rather than quickly displaying and hiding it when needed, that would probably p*ss me off really badly". Microsoft: "Hey
 that's a great idea!".<br />
<br />
<br />
Folders view settings should be remembered INDIVIDUALLY for god sake, on a folder by folder basis.<br />
<br />
I think the removal of this option and the fact that Microsoft have removed code rather than actually fixing the code in the first place is a sign of how pathetic Microsoft software is becoming.<br />
<br />
I hope that Apple start developing their operating system for PC's rather than just Apple Mac's one day in the future.<br />
<br />
It will finally be the nail in the coffin for Micro$ and personally I'll be glad to see the back of them.<br />
<br />
<em><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I'm a PC and I'm pissed off that Microsoft Windows Explorer doesn't bother to remember how I laid out my folders.</span>
<br />
</strong></em><br />
If you want to know what I'm talking about M$ look at the Apple Mac operating system and copy what they're doing (you know, the usual).<br />
At least they seem to know what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
If you think I'm the only one who's pissed at this by the way: http://www.google.co.uk/#hl=en&amp;source=hp&amp;q=windows+7+remember+folder+settings&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;meta=&amp;aq=0&amp;oq=Windows+7+remember+folder&amp;fp=a60718907b4ba39b<br />
<br />
21 million 500 thousand users would disagree with you.<br />

            <p><strong>DESIRED EFFECT </strong></p>
<p>To have a folder and its subfolders all use the same view template AND to have that view template reflect the layout of one of the folders.
</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU NEED TO DO </strong></p>
<p>First of all, you need to realize Win7 treats these as two very different requests:
</p>
<p>1. Make subfolders use the same view template as the parent folder. </p>
<p>2. Configure how a view template is laid out. </p>
<p>My confusion was that I thought that by changing the layout of the parent folder and clicking "Apply to subfolders" it would apply the LAYOUT of the parent folder, but all it's doing is saying "Make them all look to the same view template as the parent folder."
</p>
<p>Understand that when you say "Optimize this folder for: *Music*" IT DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY CHANGE THE LAYOUT of the folder! It is ONLY telling it that it is a Music folder (or General or Pictures or whatever) and ANY TIME FROM NOW ON when the *Music* template
 is changed (via&nbsp;Right Clicking on any *Music* folder &gt;&nbsp;Organize menu &gt; Folder and search options &gt; View tab &gt; Apply to folders ) ONLY THEN will the LAYOUT update.
</p>
<p>So unfortunately Xaero_Payne's solution by itself will result in the "problem" that everyone here seems to be having. You need to do BOTH steps to get it to work. (I know it's easy to rant about M$, but rather than pi$$ into the wind at them we may as well
 get into their heads and figure out how to use what we've got.) </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>STEP BY STEP</strong> </p>
<p>You can do these two processes in any order but I like to do it as presented because I can then most easily see the changes. For the example below I'm going to make them Music folders and I'm going to apply the Details view template.
</p>
<p><strong>Process A: Make Subfolders use Same View Template </strong></p>
<p>Right Click on the Parent folder that contains all the Subfolders &gt;&nbsp;Properties &gt; Customize tab &gt; check Also apply...subfolders &gt; select *Music* (for this example) &gt; Apply then Okay
</p>
<p><strong>Process 1: Customize and Apply the Music view template layout </strong>
</p>
<p>Find or create a folder of the view template you want to use.</p>
<p>Select the *Details* view (or List, Large Icons, etc.) and then customize the layout the way you want it. Add new desired columns and reorder them as you like.
</p>
<p>Organize menu &gt; Folder and search options &gt; View tab &gt; Apply to folders. THIS MAY BE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS PROCESS because otherwise it doesn't know you want ALL the *Music* folders to be like this one.

<p>Did a computer reset and deleted all data because I was going to sell the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll need to look up the build but all updates are done so when I check for updates in the system it says it is up to date,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I hit the top button (eraser button) it brings up a note pad but the other pen buttons won't work and when I get the pen close to the screen there is no curser and it never writes on the pad or does anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It picks up the pen in bluetooth and says it has paired ok and the driver says it is the correct one but there must be a conflit or incompatibility between the computer and pen or devices are conflicting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In win 8 I had to download a fix to get the pen to work but I haven't found one yet for win 10.</p>

<h2>            Issues with ad-hoc internet sharing</h2>
                    hello! im trying to set up a wireless internet connection to use on my ipod touch. ive set up a ad-hoc network connection before. but for some reason, this time when i want to set it up, and there is no option for sharing internet connection. i go through
 the whole process of setting up the name and type of security. ive tried using no security, wep, and wpa. but every time i creat it, it never ask for the option of setting up a shared internet conection. and the ipod recognises it, but it cant get an internet
 connection. like ive said, i have done this before, so i know its possible. but i dont know why i cant this time. ive reset my computer. i also tried turning off and on the wireless. i have a good connection through a clearwire modem. my laptop is a fairly
 new hp. if you could please give me some tips i would apreciate it so much.<br />
thankyou

            <br />
<p>Hi Kalvin,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Windows Vista forums.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Things you have to check: <br />
</strong>- Make sure that any other network cards that pertain to this matter are enabled (such as broadband ports / cards if you're connected via. ethernet cable to the internet)
<br />
- Make 100% sure that it's not just because your computer has not been restart.<br />
- Check your IP settings make sure that they're set to the defaults of "obtain address automatically".<br />
- Make sure your computer is clear of viruses, Trojans or other forms of malware.<br />
- Make sure the connecting computer (not the host) has the requirements to connect to an Ad hoc network (such as software compatibility, hardware compatibility and sufficient hardware).<br />
- Make sure the other computer has default settings enabled, such as: Obtain IP address automatically unless you really know what you're doing and are a networking guru.<br />
- Make sure that you're connected to the internet on the host computer in the first place.<br />
- Make sure that Sharing is enabled on your internet connection in "manage network connections" &gt; Properties &gt; Sharing *tab* &gt; Enable ICS and user control over ICS. Make sure also in the [Settings] button on that page that all of the things are checked so people
 have the permissions to access HTTP's / FTP's / E-mail, or whatever.</p>
<p><span>If you share your Internet connection on an ad hoc network, ICS will be disabled if:</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span>•</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span>You disconnect from the ad hoc network.</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span>•</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span>You create a new ad hoc network without disconnecting from the ad hoc network for which you enabled ICS.</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span>•</span></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><span>You log off and then log back on (without disconnecting from the ad hoc network).</span></p>
<p>The problem supposedly lies within your "Internet Connection Sharing" service, which you can easily find when clicking start and running "services.msc". It will open a window with all the services on your computer which you can either
 turn on, off manually or set to automatic + change other settings.<br />
<br />
1) Make sure that you delete all existing Ad Hoc networks saved by going into "Manage Wireless Networks" and make sure you disconnect from any existing Ad Hoc networks<br />
2) Go down the checklist above.<br />
3) Go into your 'Services.msc' and find "Internet Connection Sharing" service. Right click this and see if you can restart it, (disabling / reenabling), if there is a "restart" option, try that. If none of that works, use "automatic".<br />
5) When you see that this service has been "STARTED" (it will show up in the Services window that you opened by going to services.msc, then attempt to create a new Ad Hoc network., ICS should now be working since you enabled all of it manually.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br />
<strong>Make sure all the services mentioned below are started: <br />
</strong><br />
Go to start, run, and enter services.msc. Make sure all<br />
the following services are turned on. To turn on a service, click to<br />
select the check box. Also see if they are set to manual or auto<br />
start. If manual, after a reboot the service will be off again<br />
<br />
<br />
. Application Layer Gateway Service<br />
. Network Connections<br />
. Network Location Awareness (NLA)<br />
. Plug and Play<br />
. Remote Access Auto Connection Manager<br />
. Remote Access Connection Manager<br />
. Remote Procedure Call (RPC)<br />
. Telephony<br />
<br />
Let us know if you get any error message or if the services tab is grayed out<br />

<p>As you are in the Windows XP forum, I'll assume that your pc is running XP (not Vista or Windows 7).</p>
<p>Go into Control Panel &amp; open the "Folder options" icon.</p>
<p>When the Folder Options window opens click on the "View" tab and tou will see a scroll bow labelled "Advanced settings" in the bottom part of the window.</p>
<p>Part way down the scroll box, under "Hidden files and folders" there are 2 options - you should click the "Show hidden files and folders" option.</p>
<p>Then open Windows Explorer and go to your pc's system drive (usually C:). Click on the Windows folder and you will see a number of sub-folders labelled "$NtUninstallKBxxxx$. These are the uninstall files for the various Windows updates that you or your pc
 have downloaded and installed. If you have never deleted any of these folders &amp; had automatic updating enabled, you will find quite a number of them.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that you will need to use them because your pc is presumably running OK after they have all been installed - so delete the uninstall folders &amp; release some space on your system drive.</p>
<p>Secondly, while in Windows Explorer, right click on the system drive name and select "properties" from the drop down box that opens. You will see a graphic showing the drive capacity &amp; free/used space. Click the Disk Cleanup button &amp; Windows calculates how
 much space you could free-up on the drive. A Disk Cleanup window then appears with a scroll box showing tick boxes against a variety of file types. The ones you should tick are the "Downloaded Program Files", "Temporary Internet Files", "Recycle Bin", "Temporary
 Files", "WebClient/Publisher Temporary Files" and "Temporary Offline Files". Then click the OK button &amp; Windows will remove the files in the categories you chose.</p>
<p>It will also offer to free up space by Compressing old files - but you don't want to do that until other avenues have been exhausted.</p>
<p>Thirdly, do you have another drive (D:, say)? - this is usually a separate partition set-up on your hard disc for data storage, etc - but people tend not to use it. If you have one, you will see it in Windows Explorer. If you right click on the drive name
 and select "properties" in the drop down box that opens, you will be shown information on the capacity &amp; used/free space on the drive. If you were not aware of it or haven't used it, you will find quite a bit of space available.</p>
<p>Under Windows XP, applications don't have to be installed on the system (C:) drive - although do so normally by default. Whenever you install a new application you are given the choice to "browse" to a location where the software is to be installed. If you
 have installed a number of applications without telling the pc to install them on a drive other than the system drive, this software &amp; related data will have contributed to filling-up the system drive.</p>
<p>Fourthly, Windows uses a "Swap file" - usually an area of the system drive to which it can copy portions of the operating system or other software when it starts to run out of system memory. By default the swap file is managed by Windows on the system drive
 &amp; takes an area of the system drive varying from the system memory size up to 1.5 times the system memory of your pc - so if you had 512Mb system memory, the swap file size could be around 1.5Gb - however, because Windows manages it, when your system drive
 free space gets a bit low, you start getting messages from Windows saying that you have no available memory space. This is because Windows treats the swap file as part of your system memory.</p>
<p>There are several ways to get over this - the first, of course, being to get rid of some of the rubbish that has accumulated on the system drive (see above). The second, if you have another drive (D:, say), is to move the swap file off the system drive and
 onto that other drive.</p>
<p>This can be done by going into the Control Panel and clicking on the "System" icon. A System Properties window opens - click on the "Advanced" tab and then on the "Settings" button in the "Performance" box. Note the comment at the top saying that you need
 to be logged on as an Administrator to make most of the changes.</p>
<p>When you click the settings button a "Performance Options" window will open - click on the "Advanced" tab and at the bottom will be a box labelled "Virtual memory" giving you information about the paging file (the swap file by another name). Press the button
 labelled "Change" and a window labelled "Virtual Memory" opens with a scoll box showing the paging file size set on each of the drives in your pc. It will probably just show a paging file set on your system drive (C:). At the bottom of the window is a box
 labelled "Total paging file size for all drives", which gives the minimum size allowed, the recommended size and the size currentlu allocated.</p>
<p>What you do now is to select your D: drive in the scroll box and then in the box below labelled "Paging file size for selected drive", select the "Custom Size" option and&nbsp; type into the 2 boxes (Initial size) and (Max Size) the same figures - which should
 be just above the "recommended size" given in the box at the bottom of the window. Then press the "Set" button and the paging file size will appear in the scroll box above. By having the same initial and max sizes, Windows will set aside that specific area
 of the drive &amp; won't manage it up &amp; down - thereby reducing fragmentation on the drive.</p>
<p>Next you select your system drive (C:) in the scroll box and in the "Paging file size for the selected drive" box select the "No paging file" option. Click the "Set" button and you will have told Windows to move your swap file from the system drive to your
 other drive. Press the OK buttons to get you out of all the windows &amp; you will need to reboot your pc to start the new configuration.</p>
