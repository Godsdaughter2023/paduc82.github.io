                    Hey there.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My wireless printer is having problems connecting to my computer. I've gotten it to work before, but I don't remember how. The printer is connected to the internet just fine and my computer is as well, but it says it's offline on my computer. Any ideas?</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Controllers always &#34;forget&#34; the console - XBox One</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Just curious if I'm the ONLY having this issue.&nbsp; Every once and a while my Controller will forget what Console they are sync'd to.&nbsp; I've made sure the Controllers are all up to date with firmware and have tried it with the controllers linked to my account
 (one me who uses the console).&nbsp; No matter what I do I find eventually I press the XBOX button on the controller (both - 1, after market original Controller and a Day One controller which came with the console) and the light simply blinks, the console doesn't
 turn on.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my suspicions tho - I use rechargeable batteries (AA) and it might start to happen when the batters get low.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been doing it for months now.&nbsp; Absolutely no other issues once the Controller is Sync'd to the console although it sometimes takes</p>
<p>several tries to get the 2 sync'd - again not sure why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wondering if it is a "It's only YOU" type thing.</p>
<p>
<br />

<h2>            MS Sudoku freezes in Windows 10</h2>
                    MS Sudoku repeatedly freezes in Windows 10 (on Surface Pro 3). It appears to happen when the ad box is black. This is frustrating in a timed game: the clock is running when the screen is frozen. This has been going on for several days -- probably since
 last update. Anyone have a fix?

            Turning off WiFi makes this game playable again, presumably because it prevents ads from loading.

    <title>Screen dims randomly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> holmes61  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen dims randomly</h2>
                    I have a brand new Surface rt. The screen keeps dimming and then brightening every few seconds as if it hasn't been touched for a while and so goes into power saving mode. It then randomly brightens again after a few seconds. This happens when using the
 battery and when using the mains. I set the power options to dimming after 5 minutes but it made no difference. My surface is still within 21 days since purchase. Is it faulty and should I return it and swap it? Apart from this I am very happy with it.

            It sounds like the Surface is trying to adjust its brightness level to match the light around you.<br />
<br />
Personally, I find that feature irritating, so I turn it off by following these steps:<br />
<br />
1. From any screen, open the Charms bar and tap the Settings icon.<br />
2. When the Settings pane appears, tap the words Change PC Settings from the bottom edge.<br />
3. When the PC Settings screen appears, tap the General category.<br />
4. In the General category's Screen area, tap to remove the checkmark from "Adjust My Screen Brightness Automatically."<br />

            <blockquote>
<p>Windows accepted the inf mod, but the Nvidia &amp; Intel graphic combo aren't working anymore. I used two ways to mod: 1st as described in the video, and 2nd by changing all 0440 entries into D440.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, the Intel HD graphic unit is constantly running afterwards without an option to switch to the Nvidia graphic card. I guess the mod would have worked with a discrete Nvidia solution, but not with the switchable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay it was worth a try. Switchable graphics are more problematic. There is an unofficial&nbsp;project to make a driver set for switchable graphics when OEMs abandon them:</p>

</p>
<p>Unfortunately I think its only for Intel/AMD and not Intel/NVIDIA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also its perhaps worth posting on the Dell Community Forums about it. Some of the Alienware enthusiasts are pretty good at modding NVIDIA drivers.</p>

<p><strong>Hello,</strong></p>
<p><strong>i have done a fresh install of windows 7 and for some reason, I have lost my Default User Profile in c:\users directory. It is not in a hidden folder. It's definitely not there. Is there a way to re-create the default user profile?</strong></p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
Are you sure that you have enabled to view hidden system files and folders?<br />
<br />
Also, did you install the OS to the C Drive, and not another partition perhaps?

<p>It makes the folder, but you still have the "the user profile service failed the logon." error when a new user tries to sign on.</p>

<h2>            Install Windows alongside linux systems</h2>
                    Hi i have a computer that originally ran with windows 7, but i bought a new 128Gb SSD (the original died) and i tasted several Linux systems after i couldn't install windows again because i have to buy it, linux has a very friendly way to install more
 than a copy on the same computer, i tried some of these systems, as a programmer, linux help me a lot to learn one or two tricks, now i am planning to buy a windows 8 copy but without remove my other linux system i have been using last 2 years<br />
I have the next questions... <br />
<br />
- If i buy a copy of windows, can i reinstall it in my computer many times? i mean if i remove it, can i reinstall it many times
<br />
<br />
- I have not much disk space... will windows 8 work with only the 20Gb it asked in the minimum requirements or that is the size of the windows installation, linux uses only 2 so 20 looks so much, i have only 40 gb available
<br />
<br />
- will it run on my computer? i have a 2.6Ghz intel core-i5 processor, 6 Gb of ram, and intel hd 3000 for graphics<br />

<p><strong>Yes, more than meets the requirements, I would suggest you create a bigger partition though, at least 60 to a 100 GBs. you need to prepare for future needs such as applications, software updates etc.</strong></p>

However it's almost<br />never necessary to remove and reinstall it, and doing so is a lot of<br />work and causes problems for many people. I strongly recommend against<br />it unless you have to.</p><blockquote><p>- I have not much disk space... will windows 8 work with only the 20Gb it asked in the minimum requirements</p></blockquote><p>Will it work? Yes. But you almost certainly not be able to do much<br />with it. Installing applications, saving data files, etc. eats up disk<br />space and you will soon run out of disk space. Hard drives are very<br />inexpensive these days, and you should buy a larger one; you can buy a<br />new 500GB drive for under $50.</p><blockquote><p>- will it run on my computer? i have a 2.6Ghz intel core

<h2>            System Setup files are not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi.<br />
<br />
I have a strange Problem here. Tried to upgrade to windows 10 and got error&nbsp; 0x8007005 Event id 20 (Access denied).<br />
<br />
So i tried to make a inplace upgrade (Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit SP1). So i started setup from the medium, a windows appears with Files will be copied and then.... Nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Starting other programs or installing Updates with windows update works fine.<br />
<br />
If I start&nbsp; setup from the real Administrator account: same problem.<br />
<br />
I tried to boot from the setup medium of W7SP1 and there it works fine. unfortunately no upgrade could be made this way.
<br />
<br />
Every time I start a program which wants to upgrade the running OS it stops working (Upgrading to W10 with above mentioned error, Inplace Upgrade stops after copying files without any errormesssage and only the start window will be displayed.<br />
<br />
So I tried sfc /scannow with no errors as well as DISM /Online /Cleanup.Image /Scanhealth: no errors.<br />
<br />
It seems that either access rights are wrong or some options belonging to run OS setup routines.<br />
<br />
Antivirus programs are deinstalled. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Media Creation Tool also does not work.&nbsp; A message appears that setup couldnt be started successfully and i shall restart the pc and then restart the setup program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All Attempts have been made from an account with administrative rights.</p>
<p><br />
The directory&nbsp; with some files will be created but something other is wrong.<br />

            <p>Thnx for the answer.</p>
<p>But thats exactly the problem: Media Creation Tool does nothing, even after reboot. Malwarebytes i ran several times as well as spy and destroy: nothing found. And i created a Setup-DVD from an iso downloaded by media creation tool on another PC. If i start
 the setup from this media nothing happen than a small purple windows appears with the windows 10 logo for about ten seconds, then it disappears and thats all.
</p>
<p>Same happens whe i start an inplace Upgrade. After copying some files (52,6 mb) appears "setup will be started"&nbsp; and then the big window disappears and the small start-window remains, but nothing happens.</p>
<p>Updates or other setup progs are running fine.... Somethings wrong with setups regarding the OS</p>
<p>

            <p>No. The machine was setup with an original Setup Disc from MS. All updates have been installed through the years.</p>
<p>And thanks again for the link, but all of the tips there i already read and tried out. Result: No Setup file regarding OS does work except of updates downloaded by Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Media was created with Media creation tool on&nbsp; another pc, already running windows 10 same architecture (64 Bit) using the option in the wmct "create a medium to upgrade another pc".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Next point: Yes, all my user accounts have admin rights (crazy, ah, but i know what I'm doing and I'm simply tired to click away the stupid messages from windows, that somebody tries to start this or that&nbsp; and tries to change this or that parameter.&nbsp; Its
 my pc, i had no virus for the last ten years or any other malware.)&nbsp; So every time i start the pcs&nbsp; I am Admin, and when this is not enough I change to the "real admin".&nbsp; And I will not loose all programs&nbsp; and installation by doing a clean setup. Somethingmust
 have changed some parameters that normal setup routines regarding the os do not work. And somehow this must be changeable backwards to the properly parameters. If MS detects such errors and brings error messages, then they also should know how they will be
 caused and how to repair them. </p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>Answers after &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exactly how was the media created? <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Started the Creation Tool on a second PC, running it as administrator (from a an account that IS Administrator) and chose "create a media to update another PC". All worked fine the iso was created and burnt on a DVD<br />
<br />
Did you right click media's&nbsp; Setup file to Run as Administrator? <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;As I wrote in my last Answer, I always run it as Administrator. <br />
<br />
Once you restarted as requested from Media Creation Tool, did you go back in and search for it to try to open it again?
<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Again:I restarted the PC, startet the creation Tool as admin. Result: The same Message. So I restarted the machine, this time as real admin and started the tool as admin.Result: The same Message<br />
<br />
Have you turned off everything at Startup except Defender? <br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;All&nbsp; turned off. Logged in as real admin. Started Creation Tool:Same Message. Started&nbsp; Inplace Upgrade:Files are copied, the start screen from the Setup program. Started W 10&nbsp; Upgrade&nbsp; from the created Media: Windows Logo appears, then nothing happens.<br />
<br />
Spybot hasn't been recommended by anyone in the top tech forums since Windows 7 release, just after it bloated up and became buggy.&nbsp; The only time it even comes up is when it causes problems with those still running it.
<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;I have deinstalled it already.<br />
<br />
I outlined the most recommended scanners.&nbsp; Try running those followed again by System file check (SFC) Scan and Repair System Files - Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Done. Nothing found. Malwarebytes, AdwCleaner, SFC and DISM: No Errors found. checkdisk:no errors.<br />
<br />
Is this factory presintalled Windows, the worst possible install one can have and always an impediment to an in place Upgrade?&nbsp; I can help you Clean Reinstall Windows 7 while deleting all partitions during the booted reinstall to get it cleanest.&nbsp; This is working
 for most failures on preinstalls.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;No. It has been a clean setup with an original MS Setup-DVD. <br />
<br />
There are some suggestions by a MS Engineer for the error which ended your log here:&nbsp; Error 80070005 when trying to update to Windows10 - Microsoft Community<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;This site i already had found and all measures which are posted there i already implemented point for point. Result: Same Message and no Setup-Programs regarding the OS&nbsp; are working.<br />

            Just to make sure we're on the same page, were you referring to running as Admin the Setup file from the installation media which is the only way to do the Upgrade from media, or to running Media Creation tool to create the media in the first place?&nbsp;

            <p>None of the answers and tipps worked for me. Additionally i found in Dcom Config&nbsp; that My Computer was marked with a red arrow. All hints i found with google i tried, nothing worked. And when I tried to rebuild the dcom base and restartetd th machine it
 does not boot any more. So I made a fresh setup of windows 7 and the the upgrade to 10. Something during all the update **** had damaged seriously DCOM and ACLs.</p>

    <title>Family Tree Maker 2010 on Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Family Tree Maker 2010 on Windows 7</h2>
                    Just purchased FTM 2010 for my 1 week old windows 7 PC.<br />
It installs all ok, but as soon as i try to import my family tree from Ancestry it stops working and i get 'Family Tree Maker needs to close'.&nbsp; Once this happens the program will not run at all.<br />
I have tried running it in the other modes, ie XP sp2 and XP sp3 etc but get the same problem.<br />
I have also fully uninstalled, re-started and installed again a few times, but, the same problem occures.<br />
<br />
Have also tried to run with the program updates and without the program updates.&nbsp; Followed some instructions on the Ftm website also.&nbsp; But the same problem is happening.<br />
<br />
Does any body have any ideas or fix's for this?&nbsp; Many thanks<br />

<p>Method 1. Realtek does not pop up in the device manager, that is the problem. It isn't on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2. I have tried this and it doesn't work. Installing the Realtek software on my PC gets overwritten by the HD Audio, even in safe mode.</p>

<p>The Blue Snowball is my Microphone which works. The HD Audio stays on my PC even after uninstalling it. Those are the only two in the device manager.</p>

<h2>            Will win 10 technical preview expire when final version comes out&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>hello everyone:</span></p>
<p><span>I have Windows 8 release preview dual booted with Windows 7 and since missing out on the $40 windows 8 student sales never got around to upgrading the release preview. While it still works better
 than win 7 because my PC has low spec, it shuts down every 2 hour. I am wondering will Win 10 technical preview expires just like the win 8 release preview and shut down every certain period &nbsp;when the win 10 &nbsp;final version comes out. This concerns me because
 win 7 users can now try win 10 through Win 7 upgrade without messing with ISO images, what would happen when win 10's final version comes out, would they have to re-install win 7 to avoid shutdowns at certain interval if they choose not to upgrade? That may
 defeat the purpose of users not having to utilize ISO images if they indeed need to clean install to get ride of win 10 preview. I know we are told not to install win 10 technical preview on our primary PC, but there are always some not very smart people (me
 for instance) who are too eager to try out new things but lack the resources to run virtual OS or experiment on a older PC, and end up with something that they love yet hate at the&nbsp;</span><span>same</span><span>&nbsp;time(an expired

</p><p><span><strong>Yes, it will expire. Current previews of Windows 10 such as Windows 10 Technical Preview build 9841, 9860, 9879 will all expire April 15th 2015.</strong></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Microsoft officially made a tweet making it known their intention is for users who upgrade to current preview releases of Windows 10 that they want users to be able to upgrade from those previews to the final release.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Please note, this is this their intention, anything can happen between now and the final release, so it is still recommended you do not replace your production installation of Windows 7, 8/8.1, Vista with Windows 10. Please note also Windows
 10 makes recovery partitions inoperable if you upgrade, requiring that you use recovery media to actually reinstall your original copy of Windows if you need to return to it.

<h2>            The banning on xbox live is broken and unfair</h2>
                    <p>The Xbox live bans are broken, you don't even get a say or to defend your self in these cases. I've had my Xbox live&nbsp;for four years and never once was I banned from&nbsp;Januray 18 2017 to February 1st or 2nd,&nbsp;for god knows what, all it said on my email was banned from communications. Like what and now as I write this now I've been banned till March 28th, would you like to guess what it said, communications ban. First off I haven't used my mic to talk anyone else other then my girlfriend and a few friends in the past 3 to 4 weeks&nbsp;and messaged one other after a For Honor match. So why am I banned? Well&nbsp;that's what I want to find out,&nbsp;so maybe you guys have the same problems and could get this around cause I've just abou had it with Xbox. My Gamertag is The Demonic But, and yes I know butt I spelt wrong, but if an Xbox live service member sees this could receive a&nbsp;message through Xbox live and an email to my mircosoft account so we can possibly discuss this m

<h3> erikvinoya  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade from 8.1 to Windows 10 is asking for activation code</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have downloaded an ISO of the Windows 10 RTM. After creating a bootable usb drive with it, I have successfully upgraded one of my laptops from Windows 7 to Windows 10. The problem is, on my newer laptop with a Windows 8.1 (genuine, came with the laptop),
 I am stuck on the screen where it asks for an activation code. I don't remember having this screen when I upgraded my Windows 7 laptop.</p>
<p>When I tried a clean install of Win10 on my Win7 laptop, that screen showed, but it had an option to skip; on my Win 8.1 laptop, it does not have that option.</p>
<p>I even tried using the same usb drive on my Win7 machine at work, and it did not ask for the activation code (I had to cancel the installation though since the OS is not eligible for upgrade).</p>
<p>Also, both my Win7 and Win8.1 laptops have reserved for the GWX app, I just decided to download an ISO so I won't have to download the same installer twice.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You use the free Windows 10 upgrade as an UPGRADE not as a clean install.</p>
<p>You have clean installed on 7 so you will soon have problems.</p>
<p>You only press Skip if the upgrade had been installed correctly the first time; the first time install of 10&nbsp;has to be&nbsp;an&nbsp;UPGRADE to be free.</p>

            <p>Actually, I upgraded my Windows 7 laptop first, acquired a proper activation key from Microsoft, then did a clean install. On the screen where the installer asks me for a activation code, it had the option below to skip. I skipped and when Windows 10 started,
 it received the product key and activated on its own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, my problem here is with my 8.1 machine. The <strong>upgrade</strong> asks for an activation code. I don't plan on trying a clean install first as I am aware of the proper process of acquiring the free Windows 10 license.</p>

            <p>Yes, I have read that and I am aware that that's the "normal" way that Microsoft wants the upgrade to be installed. But I have 4 windows machines at home, all elligible for the upgrade, and living in a country where ISPs impose a strict and low limit on
 downloads, I cant afford to download the same 3GB installer 4 times. Even without download restrictions, I dont understand why anyone would do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is why that ISO was able to upgrade my windows 7 laptop but asks for activation code on my 8.1 one. Yes even without choosing the&nbsp;<strong>Upgrade This PC
</strong>option, I was able to <strong>Upgrade </strong>my windows 7 laptop using the ISO installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using the Single Language edition of Win 8.1 btw. Does Windows 10 have a different version for that? I am under the assumption that all OS'es except Pro versions would be upgraded to the same Windows 10 Home Edition</p>

<h2>            Shrink Partition Access Denied-both cmd and diskmanager</h2>
                    As Vista is soon no more supported and I still have an old buggy vista standing around in the house, I hope to shrink the D partition and put OpenSuse on it. It says 99gb available and it would let me shrink it in disk partition manager tool thing by 56000
 and i tried to for 45000 until it gives me there an access denied error. So i launched cmd.exe as admin and tried to shrink it by 40000. Again I recieved an access denied error. Maybe this is a known windows bug which might have been fixed in a patch after
 2013 but I cant connect my windows update for some reason either.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5bd68f00-8efa-4a9b-8814-c72067e1878c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5bd68f00-8efa-4a9b-8814-c72067e1878c" /></a>

<p>XBOX ONE MISSING WINDOWS MEDIA CENTER EXTENDER!!!</p>

<p>This is crazy! This system is supposed to bring media entertainment &nbsp;more easily to our fingertips, but it instead pushed it so far away when it comes to streaming our home media and recording tv capability through the Windows Media Center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just bought my Xbox One and I am so disappointed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I set up this thread so I can get everyone's opinion on this issue as to bring this to the attention of XBOX so they could possibly bring an update to our consoles that would bring Windows Media Center Extender back!!!</p>

<p>Please voice your concern to get Xbox to create a fix!</p>

<p>I could never get it to work properly either; every time I set it up it would either go painfully slow from 1 thing to another or it wouldn't even register half of my content (pictures, movies, etc.). IMO, it wasn't really worth it &amp; I think you'll find
 that the majority of people will agree with me (or at least not care enough to post here) - it simply wasn't that popular, so Microsoft saw no need to keep it. Keep in mind that nothing lasts forever; just be glad that you were able to make the most of it
 while it was available.</p>

<p>People that actually do their research knew that there would be no WMC functionality on the xb1. Microsoft will be stopping support for WMC all together soon because it is not worth it to them. Very few people use it.

<p>Sorry, but that's&nbsp;a pretty ridiculous solution. You can't use SkyDrive to watch live TV, set recordings, or any of the other features WMC offers.

<p>I just wanted to agree that I did my research before hand...But the Wife and Kids knew I Needed it. :) But I'm still just as upset now that I'm actually trying to figure everything out...My original Elite Xbox360 is noisy as all heck, WMC works awesome (As
 well as just Video, just to throw that in, that you didn't need WMC to stream on the 360...)</p>
<p>This was very strategic of MS to think that I would go buy all my DVD movies AGAIN on Xbox Video. I own them, I ripped them...I'll stream them!!! :)</p>

<p>I'm almost in the same boat, but our XBox One purchase was centered around added Skype functionality since Video Kinect plus messenger was removed from the XBox 360. While Skype does work with XBox One, without the ability to tune through WMC, I have no
 more TV. Running my XBox 360 through my XBox One isn't acceptable from a power perspective.</p>
<p>My wife is already ready to return the XBox One, but the Microsoft technician said to wait a few weeks so I'll give them another week or two before I start the return process. No harm no foul. My XBox 360 still works. I'll also have to find a different method
 for video chat but since we're investigating different solutions, I've heard Google Hangouts(sp?) works pretty well.</p>
<p>Like these guys say though, I'll do a little more research (even though never supporting WMC could be a little clearer) when buying my next console. If the console that promotes itself as the center of your living room can't do TV better (only differently)
 than their old product, what hope do I have that the performance for games will be any good?</p>
<p>I do need another windows media center extender for another room which was supposed to go to the Xbox 360 but once I return the XBox One, I won't have that luxury anymore.
</p>
<p>It would be interesting to know how Microsoft decided that the hook that was Windows Media Center was no longer worth it. Anybody with some technical skill and an XBox 360 for games should have stumbled onto dumping their cable boxes for a &nbsp;Windows Media
 Center /DVR solution/cable tuner by now. If not blame marketing. </p>
