<p>
</p><p>I acknowledge that I am far from 'tech savvy' but am i doing something really stupid....?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>The .wlmp format is *not* a movie; it's a project file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each movie you are creating starts as a .wlmp project file and then when you are done with it, you use the project file to create a single movie (in .mp4 or .wmv format).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to string together several projects into a single movie, you need to first save them as individual movies (.mp4 or .wmv format). Now you can start a new project, add the *movie* files and then save that as one complete movie file. But no, you
 can't join together several *project* files the same way.</p>

<h2>            Updating a Windows 8.1 tablet to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Can anybody tell me if I can upgrade my tablet running 8.1 to Windows 10&nbsp; via a USB port?&nbsp; I bought a new copy of Win 10 online not realizing it was loaded on a USB stick.&nbsp; I think it should be okay but the paranoia in me says to check first.&nbsp; I can't upgrade
 via a CD Drive because there isn't one to use.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />Sure, that is the way to update Windows, a USB flash drive is much faster than a DVD for updating or installing Windows

<p>Yes, if Windows Modules Installer service is consuming 90% CPU usage for almost an hour after boot up, the best way to prevent it is to set the service to manual mode (even though we can say that your issue is just a normal behavior of Windows Modules Installer
 service since it is a part of Windows Update service which is responsible in checking and installing available updates in the background).</p>

<p>Hi Mauricio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you redeem the code to your account? On your Xbox check your settings and go into Account. From there you can select Subscriptions and see if it is active for sure in case it was redeemed on another account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That message usually indicates that your profile doesn't have Xbox Live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do,&nbsp;Go ahead and do a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since when are you facing this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might experience network or Internet connection issues in <span>
Windows</span> for a number of reasons. Some common issues that can cause these problems are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A wireless network adapter switch that's not enabled</p>
</li><li>
<p>WEP, WPA, or WPA2 security key or passphrase issues</p>
</li><li>
<p>Cables that aren't connected properly</p>
</li><li>
<p>Corrupted or incompatible drivers</p>
</li><li>
<p>Missing updates</p>
</li><li>
<p>Network connection settings</p>
</li><li>
<p>Hardware or software problems</p>
</li></ul>

            <p>Apparently your system seems to have a large boot load, at start-up the program get loaded into the RAM and prevent it from loading other programs Therefore I recommend you to &nbsp;perform a clean boot by following:</p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the&nbsp;<strong><span>Start</span></strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type&nbsp;<strong><span>msconfig&nbsp;</span></strong>in the&nbsp;<strong><span>Start
 Search</span></strong>&nbsp;box, and then press&nbsp;<strong><span>ENTER</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the&nbsp;<strong><span>General tab</span></strong>, click&nbsp;<strong><span>Selective
 Startup</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Selective Startup, click to&nbsp;<strong><span>clear the Load Startup
 Items check box</span></strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click the&nbsp;<strong><span>Services tab</span></strong>, click to&nbsp;<strong><span>select
 the Hide All Microsoft Services</span></strong>&nbsp;check box, and then&nbsp;<strong><span>click Disable All</span></strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click<strong><span>&nbsp;OK</span></strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you are prompted, click&nbsp;<strong><span>Restart</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><font>This will hopefully resolve the issue also I suggest that you download and install cCleaner and run diagnosis and fix them.</font></p>

 they also refer to earlier versions of windows. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried the reset this PC option in the recovery menu in settings. At first this seemed to fix things but the 1719 error has returned.</p>
<p>

            hi Divya, thanks for the help, but this edge takes over most operations I'm trying to achieve, like pdf files and others and opens them on the net , my worry here is am I the only one that can see them. and I don't think this window 10 is as good as windows
 7 for pc.s , like windows 8 and 8.1&nbsp; windows 10 is built for mobile devises (phones and pads&nbsp;) maybe windows 11 will be for pc.s I can wish I suppose!!. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>hi all, I ended up taking windows 10 of my system and went back to windows 7 and low and behold every thing back to normal. I had to recover my system back to factory settings as reverting form 10 to 7 don't work very well and 10 interferes with 7 after
 the revert. I have ask different&nbsp;IT experts about windows 10 and been told that windows 10 is just windows 8.1 with a start menu&nbsp;and is designed for mobile devises not PCs.&nbsp; ok that said I will wait for windows 11 and hope its done for PCs and not mobile devises.</p>

<h3> skullriot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Logitech G110 &#43; Headset &#61; I am a chipmunk&#33;</h2>
                    <p>
(reposted from logitech forums, as I understand the drivers this uses are windows default device drivers)</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Hi all. In terms of gaming, hardware and things like that, I am pretty experienced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This one has me stumped. I have searched places I know that might have a fix, but found nothing helpful.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I recently purchased a Plantronics Gamecom headset, and am really enjoying it, but there is one serious issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I have a Logitech G110 keyboard, and plug my Gamecom into the input ports on the keyboard. Whenever I talk into my mic when its plugged into the keyboard, I sound like a chipmunk, super sped up.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
This also happens with my C310 webcam, but when it happems with that all I have to do is disable and re-enable it from the recording devices panel, and then it works fine. I attempt this with the g110, which is listed as "USB PnP Sound Device" in my recording
 devices, but I am still a chipmunk. The only way I have been able to fix this is by going into the device manager and uninstalling the "USB PnP Sound Device" driver, and allowing it to reinstall itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
Obviously this isn't an option for continued use, as the fix takes too long to apply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
The mic works fine from the mic inputs on both my front and back panels without needing any fixes applied, and also works from my mbox profire, an audio interface.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service modifying media - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trekker99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service modifying media files&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently noticed something strange that some of my media files get modified for no reason in Windows 7 Home Premium x64. I figured this out by the change in the last modified time and the fact the checksum is different. This morning, after I renamed a
 file I saw a new file of the same name with a tilde in front and a tmp extension created. Soon after that file disappeared and my original file became modified. An experiment with another file showed it happening again and i tried deleting the tmp file with
 Windows Explorer blocking that attempt by stating the file was in use by Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service.</p>
<p>I have now removed my media files from the Videos library and this "feature" disappeared. My question is this... Why the hack is Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service modifying my files and what is it being changed? I don't expect a sharing service
 having to modify my files without warning me first.</p>
<p>The videos in question are Matroska files.</p>

<p><span>Hi trekker99,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you check for the issue with a wmv\wma file?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check to see if the following helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: &nbsp;</span></strong><span>Run a system file (SFC) scan to check if there
 are any system file corruptions.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start, All programs and then Accessories. Right Click Command Prompt and select Run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the Command Prompt window type “sfc /scannow” (without quotes) and then press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>After
 the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check for the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>For additional information, you may refer the following article:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or
 corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: &nbsp;</span></strong><span>You may follow the steps mentioned in the
 link below to resolve Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service issue. (Article applies to Windows 7 as well)</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/webhelp/default.aspx?&amp;mpver=11.0.6001.7000&amp;id=C00D0FF4&amp;contextid=233&amp;originalid=C00D0FF4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Microsoft

<p>I don't have any wma/wmv files handy to test this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With regards to Method 1, sfc says everything is fine.</p>
<p>With regards to Method 2, the sharing service is running. So I am not sure how that link will help me.</p>

    <title>What is an ergonomic placement of the &#39;Ctrl&#39; &#38; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thinkingbots dot com  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is an ergonomic placement of the &#39;Ctrl&#39; &#38; &#39;Alt&#39; key&#63;</h2>
                    Is there a better idea than my observation below?&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Which key is more frequently used with Microsoft Office during School days and in Work?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>For me, the “Ctrl” key e.g. for “bold” or “undo” commands in Office software is frequent used.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Instead of moving you entire hand with more effort into a awkward position to execute the keyboard shortcuts, would reversing the position of “Ctrl” and “Alt” keys provide a least effort and more ergonomic way of executing Computer commands?</div>
<div><br />

    <title>Power Consumption after upgrade to Win10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthonyteo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power Consumption after upgrade to Win10</h2>
                    <p>I've just made the upgrade to Win10 from Win8.1 on a Surface Pro 3. &nbsp;The big change was the way Win10 consumes power. &nbsp;On Win8.1, my Surface can last until the afternoon. &nbsp;Now, on Win10, the power is &lt;10% before 11am! &nbsp;Usage is about the same and I have
 been monitoring it over several days. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it gets hot when I'm transporting it from home to work. &nbsp;The power drops from about 100% to about 85% during this journey of about 1.5 hrs, even though it is not in use. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, something is running in the background. &nbsp;I've closed all programs and disable the background apps, but it does not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have the same problem? &nbsp;Anyone can help?</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply, Jesson.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have issues with turning on, starting or charging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is with the power consumption. &nbsp;I find that on Win10, the system is consuming more power than when I was on Win8.1, leading to a much shorter battery life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if on Win10, some processes/apps (which I can't turn off) were activated to run in the background even when the machine is on sleep or hibernate state. &nbsp;This could account for the shorter battery life and why the machine is hot.</p>

<p>I've just made the upgrade to Win10 from Win8.1 on a Surface Pro 3. &nbsp;The big change was the way Win10 consumes power. &nbsp;On Win8.1, my Surface can last until the afternoon. &nbsp;Now, on Win10, the power is &lt;10% before 11am! &nbsp;Usage is about the same and I have
 been monitoring it over several days. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it gets hot when I'm transporting it from home to work. &nbsp;The power drops from about 100% to about 85% during this journey of about 1.5 hrs, even though it is not in use. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, something is running in the background. &nbsp;I've closed all programs and disable the background apps, but it does not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have the same problem? &nbsp;Anyone can help?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I have upgraded several laptops and desktops from windows 7 to 10. Don't know any simple way to gauge the desk top power usage. However, it is fairly straightforward to tell how long it takes for a battery to go flat on a portable device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would appear that the power requirements due to the Windows Ten upgrade have at least
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">doubled</span></strong> the power required to run the devices after the upgrade.&nbsp;Machines get hot&nbsp;and cooling fans&nbsp;never cut off even on AC power. I have read other user comments with regards to Windows phones
 who report the same issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering the millions of these upgrades going on a this time, the number of kilowatt hours of electricity used in the US has probably spiked due to this&nbsp;additional amount of power being consumed. No doubt another example of unintended consequences.</p>

            <p>Yes, I said effectively, there is always a right way to do something and installing Windows 7 is no different. I have discussed many times the virtues of using system imaging in Windows 7, but sometimes you just want to start things from scratch with a clean
 slate.&nbsp;This can be beneficial by removing any gunk that has built up in the OS since you upgraded to it, especially if it’s an in place upgrade from a previous version.</p>
<p>For me personally, I decided to do a clean install on my laptop since I have been beta testing the Service Pack 1 release of Windows 7 for a while now. Instead of restoring my Windows 7 RTM image, I would instead create a Backup and a Windows Easy Transfer
 .MIG file with all my personal files and settings. For me this was also an opportunity to re-evaluate my current setup. Do I need all the applications I now have installed? For you, it could be a great way to setup Windows 7 the best way, configure it the
 way you want to and create a nice backup of the installation for future purposes. Well, lets jump into it!</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Find all those applications disks, serials and hardware drivers</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_0197.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fIMG_0197_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><em>When planning a reinstallation of Windows, gather all important software first</em></p>
<p>This is a common mistake people make when they decide to reinstall Windows. They often just pop the Windows upgrade disk in and blow out the current installation, call it a day then complain the next day that Windows lost all their programs and they can’t
 get their current programs and hardware to work.</p>
<p>The first thing you should do before&nbsp;starting&nbsp;a reinstallation is to make a small inventory of all the current applications you have installed, the ones you use the most and the ones you think you can discard. You can use Programs and Features in Windows
 7 to see a list of all the applications you have installed, then you can categorize by Last Used On, see below.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image47.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fimage_thumb47.png" /></a></p>
<p>Right click the Column bar, then click <strong>More…</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image48.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fimage_thumb48.png" /></a></p>
<p>Then click the check box for <strong>Last Used On </strong>then click <strong>
OK</strong></p>
<p>The next step is to click the Last Used On header column to show a list of all your most recently used applications. You can make an exception for driver related software such as Modem or Video driver utility programs. Select the programs you no longer need
 and click <strong>Uninstall/Change </strong>on the command bar.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image49.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fimage_thumb49.png" /></a></p>
<p>A list of all my most recently used programs.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image50.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fimage_thumb50.png" /></a></p>
<p><strong><em>Common locations on the system unit where you can find your Windows product key</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1A: </strong>In regards to Windows, if you purchased an Upgrade license and not the full version license, you might need to reinstall the qualifying license first. For example, if you upgraded from Windows Vista, you will need to reinstall Windows
 Vista then upgrade to Windows 7. It’s a chore because Windows needs to do a validation check to see if you qualify for the upgrade rights. I will be looking at a workaround in a future article. If Windows 7 came with your computer or you need to find the qualifying
 product serial, look on the chassis of the machine, either side, the top or the bottom (for laptops).</p>
<p>The same principle applies to software such as Microsoft Office. If you purchased a Microsoft Office upgrade license, when you decide to reinstall it, you will need to present the qualifying product as proof of purchase to qualify for the upgrade. So if
 you were previously running Office 2003 and purchased an upgrade license for Office 2007, you will need to have that Office 2003 disk nearby to do the validation check. Another common mistake users make is thinking that you can use a Windows product key to
 install and activate Microsoft Office and vice versa. You cannot do this, Microsoft
<strong>Windows</strong> and Microsoft <strong>Office</strong> are two distinct products developed by Microsoft Corporation. Both products use their own unique product keys for activation.</p>
<p>If you use programs such as Adobe Creative Suite or Apple iTunes, you should consider deactivating and deauthorizing each respective program first. Also, make sure your iTunes Library is backed up.</p>
<p>To deactivate an Adobe program, open the application, click <strong>Help &gt; Deactivate…
</strong>follow the on screen instructions</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image51.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fimage_thumb51.png" /></a></p>
<p>To deauthorize Apple iTunes, open the application, click <strong>Store &gt; Deauthorize This Computer…
</strong>follow the on screen instructions to complete the deauthorization. The reason why you should do this, iTunes might think you have installed iTunes on another computer. The software provides up to 5 authorizations, not deauthorizing can cause problems
 when you decide to authorize additional computers in the future since there will be no way authenticate that previous systems are no longer being used.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image52.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fimage_thumb52.png" /></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Where to locate product keys?</em></strong></p>
<p>Product keys can often be found inside or on the back of the product packaging. If you purchased Microsoft Windows or Microsoft Office digitally, check your email since it would have been emailed to you. If you have somehow lost the email, you will need
 to <a href="http://store.microsoft.com/help/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact the Microsoft Store</a> to find out if they have a record of your purchase. If the programs are installed and you had entered your Windows product key during activation, you can use one of the
 following programs to retrieve the product keys before you attempt the reinstallation:</p>
<p>Here are four utilities, all of which will may display your product keys if they are still there:</p>
<li><strong><a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Belarc Advisor</a>
</strong>-&nbsp;It does a good job of providing a wealth of information.</li><li><a href="http://www.magicaljellybean.com/keyfinder.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Magical JellyBean Keyfinder</strong></a></li><li><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Nirsoft CD Key Viewer</strong></a></li><li><strong><a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/download4138.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">RockXP</a> – </strong>
Includes many additional features.
<p>If none of these options are available to you, then the unfortunate truth is, you will need to purchase a new full version license.</p>
<p><strong><em>Where to locate Hardware Drivers?</em></strong></p>
<p>A very important part of setting up Windows successfully is having the right drivers. Windows 7 installs the most common out of box drivers, but if you have unique hardware devices such as a multi-function printer or other&nbsp;devices, make sure you have drivers
 on hand to reinstall when needed.</p>
<p>Some common drivers I recommend you obtain prior to reinstalling are Network Interface Card
<strong>(NIC)</strong> drivers such as Ethernet, Wireless Adapter, Wireless/Wired Router, Video Drivers and Audio Drivers.</p>
<p>After you setup Windows, you will most likely need to connect to the Internet to download updates for Windows and your programs. Ethernet and Wireless Adapter drivers may be needed in this case which is why I recommend putting those on &nbsp;a thumbdrive for
 easy access.</p>
<p>To make sure you have the right version, check the manufacturer’s website. If you are using a name brand laptop such as a Dell, just go to the manufacturer’s website, look for the Drivers and Downloads section of the website, enter the computers model number
 or service tag and click search. This will present all the drivers for your system model. Download all necessary drivers and store them safely until needed.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/IMG_0198.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fIMG_0198_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p><em>Examples of popular driver disks you will need</em></p>
<p>Other drivers such as your chipset driver might be handy too, especially if you are using integrated graphics, network and onboard audio, the chipset driver provides the communication between all the components in your system with processor and memory such
 as your audio device, video card and network interface card. You can often found this on the motherboard or recovery disc that came with your computer. If you are not able to find updated or Windows 7 native drivers for some of your hardware components, you
 can also try Windows Vista native drivers which will work most often.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Do some house cleaning.</strong></p>
<p>Over the years, we tend to store a digital copy of&nbsp; almost everything we own. While we enjoy archiving and having instant access to the information from years ago, sometimes its best to re-evaluate the need to have it all stored on our hard disk. Instead,
 storing some of those old documents you rarely access or those old digital photographs you only look at once in a while on an external hard disk might be best.</p>
<p>This is also a good time to look for redundant files. Do you need to have 4 different versions of your resume? My recommendation is to just delete the older ones and keep the latest version. Another area to look at is email, do I need to have 10 years worth
 of email on my hard disk? Do I need to have all those contact files? What this also does is reduce the complexity and time it takes to backup your most important files which we will discuss next and guarantees that you will restore just what you need after
 setting up Windows.</p>
<p>Duplicate files are also an issue, I use this handy program called <strong><a href="http://www.bigbangenterprises.de/en/doublekiller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DoubleKiller</a></strong> to weed them out.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Backup, Backup, Backup!</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Image125.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fImage125_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>An External Hard disk is an important investment when planning a backup</p>
<p>I can’t stress enough how important a step this is. Losing access to programs or drivers can be an inconvenience, even a temporary one, but to lose years of work such as documents, photos, videos, emails is not a good thing. Make sure you have all that information
 backed up safely.</p>
<p>The best way to do this by using an external hard disk. Just leave CD’s and DVD’s out of the options for backup, they are inconvenient, unreliable and can be easily damaged. External hard disks are affordable, robust and offer lots of storage to backup GB’s
 or even TB’s of data you might have accumulated over the years.</p>
<p>There are multiple methods of doing a backup in Windows 7. The first one I recommend is the standard
<a href="http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Backup</a> which backs up all your personal files and settings. The next one is <a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System Image</a>, another reason why External hard disks are recommended because what it does is creates an exact replica of your installation. So, if something goes wrong with the reinstallation, you can always restore your backup and you are back in business.
 The other option is Windows Easy Transfer, this is quite similar to Backup, but is narrow in its capabilities. I have also discovered it has issues backing up Microsoft Outlook .PST folders and you cannot specify specific locations in the system you want to
 backup, it only does common directories such as the User folder and shared folder. I recommend you use both Backup and Windows Easy Transfer to compliment each other. For instance, you can use WET to do the backup of common user folders and Backup unique directories
 where you might have data stored.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4: Decide which architecture of Windows 7 you want to install (32 or 64 bit)</strong></p>
<p>Like I have been saying, the opportunity to reinstall Windows 7 gives you some choices. If you initially installed the 32 bit version of Windows 7, you might have upgraded your installed memory since then or plan to. If you are running 4 GB or more RAM,
 you can effectively take advantage of it by using 64 bit Windows 7. First you must ensure that all your drivers and applications are compatible.</p>
<p>To determine this, use the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
free Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor</a> provided by Microsoft. Also check the manufacturers/developers website for all your applications and hardware devices. If your computer came with 64 bit Windows 7 installed or you installed that initially, you might not be
 seeing the immediate benefits and would prefer to downgrade to the 32 bit architecture. This is especially true if you only have 1 to 3.2 GBs of RAM installed. It’s also likely that system performance can greatly improve running the 32 bit version.</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If you do decide to downgrade to Windows 7 32 bit, you will need to backup your files manually to an external hard disk,
<strong>not </strong>by using Windows Easy Transfer. This is because Windows Easy Transfer backups from within Windows 7 64 bit are not backward compatible with Windows 7 32 bit.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: Starting the installation.</strong></p>
<p>The first thing you should do is disconnect any non-essential devices. This might interfere with setup. So things such as printers, external hard disks, scanners or any other device that is not needed (apart from your mouse and keyboard) should be disconnected.
 If you plan on moving from one architecture, 32 to 64 bit or vice-versa, insert the Windows 7 disk, restart the computer, make sure your DVD drive is set to boot from the disk.</p>
<p>In this case, I will be reinstalling the same edition and architecture.</p>

<p>Click Start, type: <strong>reinstall windows</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image54.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fimage_thumb54.png" /></a></p>
<p>Hit <strong>Enter </strong>on your keyboard</p>
<p>This will open the Recovery Control Panel item.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image55.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fimage_thumb55.png" /></a></p>
<p>Next, click the link <strong>Advanced recovery methods</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image56.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fimage_thumb56.png" /></a></p>
<p>Click the option ‘<strong>’Reinstall Windows (requires Windows installation disc)’</strong></p>
<p>This process will do a standard clean installation, I won’t go over the entire process since Notebooks.com has already documented the process
<strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/06/how-to-install-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. Our intention though is to do a clean install, which means, nothing will be left on the drive. To be clear Programs, Drivers will need to be reinstalled and your
 personal files and settings will need to be restored. If you have not backed up your files and downloaded your drivers, please go and do it first and remember, back up to an external hard disk.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Reinstall-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fReinstall-1_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>Make sure you have your Windows 7 installation disk, insert it when prompted, then click Yes.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Reinstall-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fReinstall-2_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>You will be asked if you want to backup your files first. Windows 7 will intelligently detect if there were any backups done as you can see in the above screenshot.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Reinstall-3.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fReinstall-3_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>When you are ready, click Restart to begin the reinstallation process.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Reinstall-Windows-4b.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fReinstall-Windows-4b_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>When the computer starts, you will be prompted to boot from the Windows 7 DVD, click any key to do so. Windows 7 will load files on your hard disk to assist with the installation.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Clean-Install-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fClean-Install-1_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>We have now arrived at the Setup screen, here you will select your Language if the option is available, time and currency and keyboard. After doing this, click Next.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Clean-Install-2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fClean-Install-2_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>To begin the installation, click <strong>Install Now</strong></p>

<p>Click the <strong>Custom (advanced) </strong>option, we will be configuring the hard disk.</p>

<p>Select the partition on which Windows 7 will be installed, then click <strong>
Drive options (advanced)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Clean-Install-6.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fClean-Install-6_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>If there is more than one drive listed, it likely means, one is a Recovery partition and the other is the System Partition. Avoid formatting or deleting the Recovery partition, select the system partition where Windows 7 is installed and click
<strong>Format. </strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Clean-Install-7.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fClean-Install-7_thumb.jpg" /></a></strong></p>
<p>You will be warned that all data on the drive will be destroyed. Again, make sure all your files, settings are backed up. Make sure you have downloaded all necessary drivers, have all application disks near by. If you are unsure, click cancel, and then click
<strong>Next. T</strong>his will do is create a Windows.old folder with the previous installation still intact so you can recover any missing files.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Clean-Install-8.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fClean-Install-8_thumb.jpg" /></a></p>
<p>The installation is now in progress. Once complete, you will go through the Out of Box Experience which involves joining a wireless network, a homegroup if available, entering your user name, password, name of computer, date and time and configuration of
 common settings. Please see previous Notebooks.com article for instructions <strong>
<a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/06/how-to-install-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>After installation is complete</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>The first thing you should do is&nbsp;install an Antivirus Utility. I personally use the free
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Security Essentials</a>, but there are others out there such as AVAST! Home or AVG. Make sure it is the most up to date version.</div>
</li><li>
<div>If you are unable to connect to the Internet, make sure your Network Interface Card, Wireless Adapter, Router drivers are installed. Again, these drivers should have already either been downloaded or you have the driver disc ready for reinstallation.</div>
</li></ul>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/image57.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f01%2fimage_thumb57.png" /></a></p>
<p>Run <strong>Windows Update, </strong>a fair amount of updates have been released for Windows 7 since it came out. I recommend, just for convenience purposes, if you must reinstall Windows 7, wait until Service Pack 1 is released which should be very soon.
 This can reduce a significant amount of downtime, since all you will need to do is reinstall Windows 7 form your disk, then install the Service Pack.</p>
<p>Avoid installing driver updates for hardware, just install security updates first. If you encounter problems installing updates, you can learn more about resolving it
<strong><a href="http://notebooks.com/2010/10/25/how-to-manage-configure-and-troubleshoot-windows-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>Finish installing any addition drivers needed to have a functioning system. I would recommend you do next after this is to create a System Image of the installation. What this will do is create a backup of the installation, so you could use it in the future
 as a way to reinstall Windows 7 quickly without starting from scratch. You can learn more about doing this
<a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>here</strong></a></div>
</li><li>
<div>After you have backed up the installation, you can start restoring your personal files and settings, either from a Backup or from a Windows Easy Transfer file, whichever method you used. Windows Easy Transfer should give you a report of which applications
 you will need to reinstall. Learn more <strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></div>
</li><li>
<div>Reinstall your applications. I suggest you try creating system restore points in between each configuration. So, after you had installed the drivers successfully, restored personal files and settings, create a new system restore point each time, it can
 be a life saver, trust me.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Reconnect any external devices you were using, try doing it one at a time then restart, just in case one causes a system instability. If it does, it likely means you need to update the driver.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Reactivate Windows, this can be done by Internet, especially if you are reinstalling Windows on the same machine, the same applies for Microsoft Office. If you encounter any problems reactivating Windows, please review the following Notebooks.com article
<strong><a href="http://notebooks.com/2010/12/28/how-to-resolve-common-windows-activation-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>
</strong>for tips and solutions to common activation problems in Windows.</div>
</li></ul>
<p>Now, this is a lot to digest when considering a reinstallation, so its best you don’t do this when you are in the middle of a project or working on something important. Do it when you have some off time, focus on certain things over a period of time such
 as gathering reinstallation disks, drivers, backing up files and settings. It is also best if you can have a backup system on hand you can use during the down time. With careful planning, this should be a fun and easy to do project itself and it will save
 you some money compared to carrying your computer to a repair company and it will enhance your computing skills.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Windows will automatically detect the dual core without your having to do anything.&nbsp; Then remember that you can accomplish the same thing as far as installing by just booting from the install disc.</p>
<p>&nbsp; If you want to try it with Windows running, you can click Start -&gt; Computer and then open the DVD in the left pane.&nbsp; You'll see a SETUP.EXE program on the disc which you can double-click and start it that way, assuming your existing Windows 7 isn't too
 badly messed up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

            Hi SBoden, were you using Homegroup functionality on your home network&gt;
<br />
<br />If so, click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what version of Windows 10 is reported?
<br />
<br />If it is version 1803, Microsoft removed the Homegroup functionality in that version from Windows 10, without any warning
<br />
<br />Click the link below for an alternative to Homegroup, written by Kapil

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to xbox live</h2>
                    
<p>I have been using xbox live for 4 months now and have had no problems connecting.&nbsp; Now today my xbox will not connect to xbox live.&nbsp; I am using a wireless router and have changed nothing.&nbsp; My internet still works just can't connect on my xbox all of a sudden.&nbsp;
 Any ideas what might be the problem why it would work for 4 months then all of a sudden not work?&nbsp; I've tried reseting my router but that does not work. I've turned off the xbox and back on that does not work.&nbsp; I have re entered my WAP password for my wireless
 network but that does not work.&nbsp; When i try to test my connection on my xbox it doesn't even get past the first step before failing.&nbsp; The message says there's a problem with my connection and says to select more info to see how to fix it.&nbsp; Thats all i get
 it doesn't tell me what is causing it to not connect or anything.&nbsp; I am using an xbox slim 4gb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            Well, that looks <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yH97lImrr0Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<i>abby-normal</i></a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/yH97lImrr0Q?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/yH97lImrr0Q?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>, and since it doesn't make sense to troubleshoot problems on a system that might be afflicted with malicious software, I would first start with a scan for malicious software, then start troubleshooting remaining issues:<br />
<br />
No matter what else you are using for malware protection, perform the following scans for malicious software, then fix any remaining issues:<br />
<br />
Download, install, update and do a quick scan with these free malware detection programs (not at the same time):<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a><br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br />
<br />
SAS will probably report a bunch of tracking cookies and you can just let it delete them.<br />
<br />
They can be uninstalled later if desired.<br />
<br />
Post back if you still have the issue (or even if you don't) and someone that actually knows how XP works can help you.<br />
