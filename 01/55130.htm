    <title>Boot_Error issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Boot_Error issue</h2>
                    <p>Hey, i own a 5 year old OEM machine. Recently i suffered a blue screen crash in windows, no error number was given, data was collected and the machine rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After rebooting and the manufacturers splash screen was displayed, a simple "Boot_Error" message appeared on a black screen - nothing else but this message. If i hit return twice the machine will boot in to windows fine and seems to operate normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question has two parts -&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Has the boot manager file become corrupted? Or has something else happened?</p>
<p>2) How do i fix this on an OEM machine where i don't seem to be able to run the fixBoot dos command - getting access denied?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-chris</p>

<p>Hey, i managed to fix the issue. Turns out the motherboard battery had died causing the BIOS to lose its boot settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I replaced it yesterday and voila - no more boot error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your responses Efraim.</p>

    <title>File Copying Error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            File Copying Error</h2>
                    <p>Good day to all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider myself not expert but intermediate computer user. Would highly appreciate if anyone could help me with below issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>one day my windows 10 laptop got hanged while I was copying some big size files form my laptop to my 4TB seagate external HDD; (UHD Movies: 25 to 40GB per file)&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I waited for almost 30 to 40 minutes for windows to respond back but no use.</p>
<p>as a last resort I had to force restart my laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>after that I ran scandisk &amp; repaired both my laptop C: drive &amp; my External HDD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>now whenever I try to copy any huge file size above 5GB from laptop to external HDD or from seagate HDD to my laptop I get below error:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Could not find this item. this is no longer located in C:\windows\downloads</p>
<p>verify the item's location and try again."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did basic search on internet and apparently a lot of people faced the same error while deleting files or folders.</p>
<p>Whereas in my case I don’t want to delete any files; I just want to copy from laptop to External HDD; which still has almost 3TB of free space that I can’t utilize.
</p>
<p>I’m pretty frustrated due to this silly error.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please accept my sincere gratitude &amp; Thanks in advance for assisting in this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards, </p>
<p>Muhammad Shahzad.</p>

            <p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, yes I can play the files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are video files with *.mkv file extension.</p>
<p>Laptop files I can play them but can't copy them to external HDD.</p>
<p>Similarly I can play video files on external HDD but can't copy them to laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every single time I try to copy it get "item cannot be found" error.</p>
<p>But for smaller size files I can copy them without any problem.</p>
<p>Issue seems to be with only larger files.</p>
<p>Any solution/work around will be a great help.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>this error can be caused by software glitches. </p>
<p>Try to recall any recent occurrences with software, just prior to getting this error, and uninstall the software.</p>
<p>I have solved this on my computer by uninstalling software called Mktoolnix. Through sloppy installation I somehow ended up with two copies of a tool .exe application&nbsp; called Mkmerge or Mkextract , not sure which one.&nbsp; They were installed a couple of years
 ago and rarely if ever used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had just&nbsp; recently installed a video conversion&nbsp; program called MkvtoMp4, which also contained codecs and applications mkmerge/mkextract.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I ran mkextract from the original location it flashed briefly into running and then disappeared in the flit of any eye.&nbsp; Then I did a file search to find mkextract on my system, found a copy in the program file directory of MkvtoMp4, and tried to use
 mkmerge/mkextract&nbsp; from the&nbsp; MkvtoMp4 directory , and got a confusing error message which said basically that the copy of mkmerge that I was trying to use was conflicted with another copy of it on my system improperly installed,&nbsp; but would not be blocked from
 use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AFter using that application to extract an audio&nbsp; file from an mkv video&nbsp; under those terms, the problem with the error message "Could not find this item. this is no longer located in C:\windows\downloads</p>
<p>verify the item's location and try again." began happening when I tried to copy the extracted file to a USB hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am&nbsp; not a techie by any means , so I cannot explain what occurred , but the glitch caused other problems too. I had trouble accessing the USB drive,&nbsp; the entire computer would hang for minutes, the system would tell me that the USB drive was empty, when
 it wasn't, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution to the problem ...I uninstalled Mkvtoolnix , and it solved the problem immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my recommendation is to uninstall any recently installed software which could be conflicting with your computer's previous configuration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Downgraded from Windows 10 to Windows 8.1 and now can&#39;t boot due to INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE BSOD</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downgraded from Windows 10 to Windows 8.1 due to various issues I was having. It completed the first reboot with the "Restoring Your Previous Version of Windows" . However when it rebooted again it failed to boot successfully (Didn't make it to the logon
 screen). Instead after about 10 seconds it BSOD with the error INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE. It didn't attempt to revert the downgrade and Startup Repair just says that "This PC did not startup correctly" and doesn't attempt or is unsuccessful with any repairs.
 chkdsk doesn't flag up any problems either. I have a lot of programs installed so I wouldn't wish to reinstall windows and have to reinstall all my programs</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to access the computer through ubuntu if i need to download and transfer any files and I also have a Windows 10 Installation Media on my USB so I have access to the Recovery Environment.</p>

            <p>Hello Matty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE </strong>bug check has a value of <strong>
0x0000007B</strong>. This bug check indicates that the Microsoft Windows operating system has lost access to the system partition during startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>perform startup repair from Windows recovery environment
</strong>and check if it helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't start (boot) your PC, follow these instructions to get to the "Windows Recovery Environment". You may need to connect a keyboard to complete the steps. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>• If you have installation media for Windows 8.1, start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>",
 do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, tap or click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>"
 to start the "<strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>• If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the "<strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the "<strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong>", on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Startup repair</strong>" and follow on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may <strong>create Windows installation media using the following article:</strong></p>
<p>Refer:<br />
<strong>Create installation media for Windows 8.1</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional Information:</p>
<p><strong>Bug Check 0x7B: INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559218(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559218(v=vs.85).aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: <span>While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>

            <p>Hi Ratandeep,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help so far, however I can't access the recovery environment on my Windows 8.1 Partition anymore. I think that the Recovery Environment is not accessible at all because after two unsuccessful starts it pops up with the first image in this link:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://onedrive.live.com/?id=462DAB7508F1FD6F%21171242&amp;cid=462DAB7508F1FD6F&amp;group=0</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i press F8 it pops up with advanced options but nowhere does it let me get the recovery environment, not even pressing f10 to view more options shows any more options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also unable to download the windows 8.1 media creation tool because the only OS i have access to is ubuntu and the media creation tool doesn't work even when using wine to emulate windows 8.1. Unfortunately I &nbsp;won't be able to access another windows
 device to create a copy of windows 8.1 for another month however as i stated in my first post I do have a usb device with Windows 10 Installation media with access to a recovery environment if that is helpful at all in anyway. I did run startup repair from
 that media but it didn't work, I assume that's because it's a different build of windows though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If its crucial to have the correct version of Windows Installation Media to fix this problem then I could overwrite a different partition with this window 10 installation if need be to get the windows 8.1 media, However I would prefer to avoid this if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other steps I can take to try and fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Matty</p>
<p />

            <p>This is usually controlled by your laptop, not windows. You cannot select the graphics driver unless you have switchable graphics on a $$$ high end model. The AMD kicks in when needed for extra graphics power like when playing a graphics intensive game.
 Go to your manufacturer's support site for more info. Here how HP explains--&nbsp;</p>

<p>When ever i start up my computer and log into my, or any account there are no icons, background or start bar. I have to navigate to get to anything using using task manager. I believe it has something to do with windows explorers registery. This is what
 comes up when i first log in....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unsupported 16-bit Application</p>
<p>The program or feature "\??\C:\windows\explorer.exe" cannot start or run due to the incompatibility with 64-bit version of windows. Please contact the software vendor to ask if a 64-bit windows compatible version is available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing is that i have windows 7 ultimate 64 bit. This all happened when my graphics card died, and i had to stick a really old pci card in (fx 5200) until i got the replacement. A few days ago it stopped showing anything related to explorer. So when i
 got my new cards (gts 250, and 4890) they both did the same thing. I updated my graphics&nbsp; drivers for both ati, and then nvidia but it did not fix anything. I have even tried system restore, and the program it runs to try and fix things before it loads windows.
 I have scanned for viruses and found nothing. sorry if this seems long winded but a lot has happened please help!</p>

            Hi AB
<br />
<br />The installer for that software will check to see if your hardware is supported on their software, if it is not, you will not be able to install their software on that system!
<br />
<br />Possibly go over to their forum and see if there is a previous version of that software that may install on your system, but I doubt it because your processor does not support virtualization
<br />
<br />The only other option would be to replace your processor
<br />
<br />This processor could replace your current one and does support virtualization and is much faster:

            Hi Syafiqah, if all the recovery steps above fail, (which I think is likely), it looks like your only option will be to re-install Windows 10, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<div><br />
</div>
<div>i had a program called FREEOTFE (encryption software) but when i tried deleting it just came up with not sufficient access to install on the control panel so i deleted the program files fully and emptied my recycle bin and went back to control panel and
 tried to delete it from there. It just said path not found do you want take out of list i clicked yes. Later when researched does deleting program file delete the program people/forums said no the code can still be on the PC which i dont want because i want
 the program on my system. &nbsp;So how do delete this program fully? Or has it deleted?</div>

            <p>When a program is installed in most cases the program executable will be placed in its own directory normally within the Program Files directory. However this is not the only task carried out by the installer. It will create the shortcut to the executable
 in the start menu and can create additional ones on the desktop and in the Quicklaunch menu. It will register any DLLs used by the program and can create numerous entries in the registry.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The only safe way to uninstall a program is to use the link in the Programs and features utility. This should reverse all the changes made by the installer based on script it creates. If it had its own directory you probably have removed the program but
 you will have left numerous other parts on the system.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may have to reinstall in order for the uninstall script to be able to run and fully clean up.</p>

<br />Try this.
<br />Go to start and search for troubleshoot and open it.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Suggest you to skip that section and move on. After installation completes, see if you can connect to network now.
<br />
<br />Else run Network Adapter troubleshooter from Settings app &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot. See if it helps you. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

            <p>Windows 10 will be free for the first year to all Windows 7, Windows 8.1 and Phone 8.1 users. This means, as long you upgrade within the first 12 months (July 29th 2015 to July 29th 2016), you will not have to pay for Windows 10 at all.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Wow, thats cool, but does that mean, I will have to pay for Windows 10 after the first year?</strong></p>
<p>No. Its a promotion to get as many users to upgrade their existing Windows 7 PCs and Windows 8.1 devices to Windows 10.
<strong>Once you upgrade within the first year for free, its yours forever at no additional cost.</strong>&nbsp;As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>

</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">I heard Microsoft representatives mention they are moving to a servicing model for Windows 10, does that mean Windows 10 is going to require a subscription?</span></strong></p>
<p>No, Windows 10 remains a perpetual license, which means, you can upgrade to Windows 10 and use it forever without it expiring or going into any reduced functional mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Are you saying there will be no more versions of Windows after Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft is moving Windows to a servicing model with Windows 10. The days of major revisions or what are called big bang releases are no more. As Microsoft Program Manager for Windows&nbsp;Terry Myerson&nbsp;described it:</p>

</span><span>–</span><span> in fact, one could reasonably think of Windows in the next couple of years as one of the largest Internet services on the planet.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>And just like any Internet service, the idea of asking "What version are you on?" will cease to make sense

<p>
</p><p><strong>Why is Windows 10 free, is there some catch?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>No, its not a catch. We are computing in different times. Windows 10 is free so app developers can standardize on one platform and reduce the fragmented market of different versions and editions of Windows that have been an issue in the past. When everybody
 is on the same platform, it means better quality apps, a healthier ecosystem and more advances in hardware and software innovation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Can I uninstall Windows 10 if I do not like it or something goes wrong?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can see the following: <a href="https://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/how-to-rollback-to-a-previous-version-of-windows-from-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Throughout the history of Windows revisions, Microsoft has included an option to uninstall the operating system when you upgrade to a newer version. My recollection of this capability goes back to Windows ME which included the option to uninstall the operating system and restore to a previous version of Windows (I was running Windows 98 SE at the time). Microsoft has supported this functionality in its NT based versions of Windows too, albeit not in a seamless way. The ability to restore a Windows 8.1 installation to Windows 7 required knowing some command line operations that in some instances didn't guarantee the process would go according to plan. With Windows 10, it seems Microsoft has listened and has provided a welcome option to its recovery tools to make it easy to uninstall Windows 10 and go back t

<h2>            Background Intelligent Transfer Service &#40;BITS&#41; Errors connecting to Internet Gateway Device &#40;IGD&#41;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have two Windows 7 machines (Ultimate and Pro) and one Windows 8 machine in a Windows domain for which a Windows Server 2003 R2 S2 serves as the sole DC,AD, DHCP, and DNS provider. The server performs no other services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows 7/8 machines were all generating these error messages several times daily prior to my attempt to install Windows Intune on all these devices. Once I installed Intunes, which relies heavily on BITS, the error frequency increased to every five
 minutes&nbsp; on all of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The error message generated is always the same one -&nbsp; Event ID 16393, which says, "BITS has encountered an error communicating with an Internet Gateway Device.&nbsp; Please check that the device is functioning properly. BITS will not attempt
 to use this device until the next system reboot. Error code: 0x80040501." Intunes works ok on only the Windows Ultimate machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite these error messages, Windows Update, which also relies on BITS,&nbsp;works fine on all these machines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have run SFC on all these machines to make sure there's no BITS related file corruption. Doesn't fix anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas/suggestions to fix would be much appreciated!</p>

<p>Thanks I know what they say, so I used Ookla to test it (thanks). I did a Cntl/Alt/Del and watched the packet speed under "Performance" in the Task Manager screen. Both helped me to determine what up/download I was getting as well as what was taking the
 most bandwidth</p>

                    This morning at about 07:45 AM, February 10, 2010 my wife turned her computer on and went to the internet to do some quick work on her work related home site. When she turned off the computer, it began automiatically installing 12 newly downloaded updates
 from Windows. Immediately afterward, I turned on her computer and I ended up on a bright blue background page that began "A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down&nbsp; to prevent damage to your computer" After a three paragraphs of suggestions
 of what to do, including trying to estart in Safe Mode and try to&nbsp; (1) disable or remove any newly installed software, (2) diasble any BIOS options such as caching or shadowing (none of which worked, I kept ending up on the same page when I tried to start
 in SAFE MODE).<br />
<br />
At the end of the warning page, it gave:<br />
TECHNICAL INFORMATION:<br />
***STOP: 0X00000050 (0X80098004, 0X00000001, 0X80515103, 0X00000000)<br />
<br />
I have tried to get a person on the phone at Microsoft. I did connect with one, who took my information and passed it on to a tech person. I stressed the need for a telephone response for help, since the computer has been totally disabled. I got an email response
 direcing me to a FAQ page or to this forum. The&nbsp; FAQ in NO HELP. (IS&nbsp;ANYONE AT MICROSOFT LISTENING???)<br />
<br />
Does anyone else have any help to offer?<br />
<br />
Since my computer was turned onn a few minutes ago, the new updates have been automatically installing themselves. I am afraid to shut down this computer; I may then be totally disabled unless I get a phone call from Microsoft with definitive help.<br />
<br />
My wife and I are each running Windows XP Home edition. Hers is from 2003 (SP 1? or 2?), mine is Service Pack 3.
<br />
<br />
While typing this, my computer has already finished installing the updates. It WILL shut down at some undefined time in the future, like it or not, unless I can sit here and keep telling it not to shut down each time it asks, until I get an answer that works
 on my wife's computer.<br />

            Here's a temporary fix, which removes the offending Windows update; worked for me.<br />
<br />
<strong>1. Boot from your Windows XP CD and start the recovery console (press R when prompted to press Return for setup or R for the recovery console). You may need to press F6 while RC loads in order to load SATA drivers; you will then have a c:\WINDOWS console
 prompt.<br />
<br />
2. Type: CD $NtUninstallKB977165$\spuninst (this is the update I had to uninstall to get out of the boot loop, other updates may be uninstalled by changing the directory name to $NtUninstallKBCODE$, where KBCODE is the KB code)<br />
<br />
3. Type: BATCH spuninst.txt<br />
<br />
4. Type: exit</strong> <br />

<h2>            Windows Mail Security Popup</h2>
                    Suddenly, I get a Windows Security popup asking for user name and password every time I try to send or receive email in Windows Mail.&nbsp; This information is in the account profile, the remember password block is checked, and it has never been an issue before.&nbsp;
 I fill in the security popup and check the remember block to send or receive.&nbsp; I am then able to send or receive OK that time, but I get the popup again when I try to send or receive again.&nbsp; Has there been a recent update that has created this problem?&nbsp; How
 do I get back to normal email without this irritating popup every time?

            Hello JCSTE,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for your reply back!<br />
<br />
&nbsp; I would first try to test this by creating a new user account with Windows Mail and see if you duplicate the issue when sending/receiving mail.&nbsp; If you do not have the same problem then it could possibly be a corrupted account.&nbsp; In most scenerios where I
 see this happening the user will create a new user account and then remove the previous one.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;With using the system restore this might or might not solve the problem, especially if the account is corrupted.&nbsp; But since this is a recent problem and hopefully you haven't added any new software or programs in the past few days so you wouldn't lose anything.&nbsp;
 Please let us know status.&nbsp; Thanks again!

            <p>Hi Aleperk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you have experienced upon upgrade to Windows 10 and I regrets the same. I<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ssue you have experienced might due to incompatible drivers. I can understand that it must be difficult for you when things
 are not working as it should. Let us try these methods and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Update Sound drivers from Device Manager manually and check if this helps. </p>
<p>a) Open run command by pressing <strong>Windows key + R</strong> and type “<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong>” (without quotes) and hit Enter. Or Right-click on the Start button and select
<strong>Device Manager </strong></p>
<p>b) Click <strong>View </strong>from Menu bar on top and select <strong>show hidden devices&nbsp;</strong>in Device Manager</p>
<p>c) Spot and expand the “<strong>Audio inputs and outputs</strong>”</p>
<p>d) Right click on the driver and select “<strong>Update Driver Software</strong>”
</p>
<p>e) Click "<strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>". Once it's done, restart the computer to check if problem fixed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Check and install latest windows 10 audio drivers from manufacture's website. If there are no updated drivers available on the computer manufacturer’s website, then trying installing it in compatibility mode. Compatibility mode runs the program using settings
 from a previous version of Windows. </p>
<p>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.
</p>
<p>a. Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website. </p>
<p>b. Right-click on the driver setup file and click on <strong>‘</strong><strong>properties’</strong>.
</p>
<p>c. Click on the ‘<strong>compatibility</strong>’ tab and check the box ‘<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for’
</strong>and select <strong>Windows 8 or 8.1</strong> operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will address your query.</p>

<div>I can start the Dragon software if I run it in a compatibility mode (for Windows 8). The troubleshooting diagnostics from Dragon indicates an incompatible program but nothing else in the way of information.</div>

<div>Each day I have to start up Dragon and the compatibility mode. It apparently works fine in this mode, but something weird happened and I like to resolve it is possible.</div>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Important Note:</strong> <span>Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers and updates installed after the restore point was made.
