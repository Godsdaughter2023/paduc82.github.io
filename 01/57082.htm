<p>Looks like this game is going to be pretty stellar. I know people have heard about it, but I don't know if many have seen the trailers. Here they are for your enjoyment, though!</p>

            <p>Thanks Steve ... using these W10 settings is an absolute failure as I DO NOT have access to them ... thanks MS ! ... ( maybe MS WILL change THEIR policy regarding users choice as to when &amp; which updates shall be installed ! )
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I hunted around thru' C: and found "Component Services" then went to "Services (Local)" .. scrolled down to "Windows Update" then over on Right to "more actions" then clicked&nbsp; "Properties" which brought up a new page "Windows Update Properties (Local
 Computer) then on the "General" tab it shows "Startup Type" with choices .... currently mine is set at "Automatic" .. others being "Manual" or "Disable" ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 ... if i set it to either Manal or Disable will i be able to switch it back to Auto whenever withoutmy system causing crash or any other unseen dramas ... ? ?</p>

            <p>I expect that if you set it to manual, it will get started somehow, so disable would be the way to go, if it worked.&nbsp; I don't know what that would do or what kind of impact it would have.&nbsp; I don't imagine it would break the computer though.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 0">
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I have an error while installing Visual C++ Redistributable 2015.</p>
<p>First of all I need this accordin to this article to fix a problem.
</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.spreendigital.de/2015/09/01/how-to-fix-the-api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0-dll-is-missing-error-for-delphi-10-seattle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blog.spreendigital.de/2015/09/01/how-to-fix-the-api-ms-win-crt-runtime-l1-1-0-dll-is-missing-error-for-delphi-10-seattle/</a></p>
<p>The error is the same at me but it occurs when I try to start Apache server from Xampp.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error that I met is this
</p>
<p>Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Setup Failed error 0x80240017.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I mention that I can install instead Visual C++ 2013 but the error while starting Apache remains.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My log file is here:
<a href="http://pasted.co/6f937063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pasted.co/6f937063</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I did till now:</p>
<p>I followed the instructions from here
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQZNEQAV49g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQZNEQAV49g</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/lQZNEQAV49g?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/lQZNEQAV49g?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>Those meaned:</p>
<p>1. Troubleshoot Windows Update.</p>
<p>As result I got this report
<a href="http://pasted.co/fbcbac12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pasted.co/fbcbac12</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I stopped Windows Update service, deleted SoftwareDistribution folder and started the service again.</p>
<p>3. I ran sfc/scannow command from CMD as Administrator and there was NOTHING to be repaired.</p>
<p>4. I restarted Windows on clean boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After restarting Windows on clean boot Windows Updates found new updates (took it very long till the search was over).</p>
<p>I looked only at whatever update was saying something about Visual C++ 2008 and I only installed it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I mention that the first two pictures I posted link to may NOT be relevant to my problem, but I said to be 100% sure that there is NOTHING I may miss.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked this post before writing this one&nbsp;
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-winapps/cant-install-microsoft-visual-c-2015-runtime/af86f27b-229a-415c-be94-63042823c68d">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;And from this answer</p>
<p>"(i) <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49093" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Update for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB2999226)</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(ii) <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/kb/2999226" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Update for Universal C Runtime in Windows "</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked that update for install but it happens that this update is NOT available for my Windows 8.1 Pro x64 version (only for x86 version which WON'T install on my computer).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I considered an option to get All the updates (except one for Office) but it happens I have limited internet trafic on my mobile phone. And besides that I don't know if even I will install all those
 updates my problem would be solved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope all this information is helpful for my troubleshoot. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>
<p>I'm very sorry that my post is so long but I really need help to fix this error, because I work with Apache. And I am very willing to reply to ANY answer that could help me.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>unins000.dat contains informations what files has been added and what changes have been made to your computer. Uninstallers use this information to clean up your system. If you lost the file, you might need to delete all files belong to that program in Program
 Files folder and deep searching in Windows Registry to clean them up. Since this action is too risky, there are many uninstaller softwares avaliable, whether commercial or freeware. An example is Total uninstall (<a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Uninstallers/Total-Uninstall.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Uninstallers/Total-Uninstall.shtml</a>).</p>

<p>Try this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://download.cnet.com/Revo-Uninstaller-Pro/3000-2096_4-75016166.html?tag=mncol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/Revo-Uninstaller-Pro/3000-2096_4-75016166.html?tag=mncol</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does the registry and associated folder scanning for you, and lets you pick what you want to delete or not. &nbsp;Often times after you delete the data associated with the program, Control Panel Uninstall will still have the listing, but usually has an option
 to remove the invalid entry, not always. &nbsp;Revo fixes that, and has a free version and a 30 day free Pro version, which just stops working after 30 days.</p>

<h3> thomasadkins64  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error code 0xc000012f on playing games that work fine on Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have numerous games installed via the Steam application I have running on my Windows 8.1 machine.&nbsp; I have never heard of any weird incompatibilities for games or other applications when transitioning from Windows 7 to Windows 8.1, but I have experienced
 a number of problems myself.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I try running the game after installing on Windows 7, and it runs fine.&nbsp; But then, when I install on my Windows 8.1 system, it gives me this strange error code.&nbsp; I only get the code when I start the executable from the command line, otherwise Windows just
 tells me that my application has stopped running, and offers to "Check online" for solutions -- which is completely useless.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have tried reinstalling the application (after cleaning it out completely) numerous times.&nbsp;
</li><li>I have used the FC utility to check whether the DLLs in the Windows 7 directory are really the same as in the Windows 8.1 installation, and they are.&nbsp;
</li><li>I have tried changing the path from a fairly long one (I do some programming as a hobby) to just a dot, to ensure nothing is being executed that I am not expecting.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>There are about&nbsp;7 different games that all give me this same error, so I'm asking what can I try next?&nbsp; For example, is there a way to get a command prompt to automatically use Windows Compatibility Mode.&nbsp; That would be useful; perhaps I would learn something
 about my problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>

<p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must have been&nbsp; a problem with the component of Virtual C++, thus you're experiencing the issue.&nbsp; We suggest doing the the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Programs and Features </strong>under the <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Look for <strong>Microsoft Visual C++</strong>... and right click on it.</li><li>Choose<strong> Repair</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Once done, please check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're here for your feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you so much for suggesting something new.&nbsp; I tried your suggestion, and this is how it went.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, there are a number of Microsoft Visual C++ versions, so I repeated the same process for all of them.&nbsp; On version 2010, the only option available under the context menu was "Uninstall", but starting with 2012, I had the option to "Change", and then
 a nested option to "Repair".&nbsp; </p>
<p>So this, I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went through all of the versions 2012 and later, repeating the same technique.&nbsp; They would either report "Success", with no further comment, or report "Success", and mention that a restart would be needed before the software could be used.&nbsp; I went ahead
 and restarted each time I was prompted, but when I was done, the game software still gave me the same error as before.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've mentioned previously that I've reinstalled the game several times and also verified the digital content of the game using the Steam utilities, again, several times, and also it works fine under Windows 7.&nbsp; Also, I've verified the DLLs involved are identical
 by using the command-line utility FC.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the thing: when I went back to repeat the process of right-clicking and choosing "Repair" on one of the versions, specifically version 11.0.61030, it
<strong><em>again prompted me with "Success", with a request to reboot before the software could be used.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, no, it didn't work.&nbsp; But I have a new clue, since if it worked the first time, it darn wouldn't need to reboot the second time, would it?&nbsp; Something seems to be preventing this version's repair option from working properly, and it seems to be associated
 with Windows 8.1. </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on, guys!&nbsp; Are you kidding?&nbsp; I have to point out a couple of things:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I did do a clean install when I first installed Steam and the games.&nbsp; These games didn't work from day one.&nbsp; The only other applications I installed at that time were Java development tools (you're not going to try and blame *those*, are you?), and Microsoft
 Visual Studio 2015.&nbsp; </li><li>I tried running the program with an empty PATH string, to prevent any installations from intercepting commands with similar names.&nbsp; Not that it truly matters, escalated (Admin) changes, always changes the default path to the Windows system directory.
</li><li>The whole purpose of having a modern operating system (Read: everything after XP) is so that one application will have a very difficult time interfering with another, or interfering with the operating system.&nbsp; Windows 8.1 has so much technology from previous
 server operating systems that it isn't funny?&nbsp; What's the good of having all that separation of concerns, if I have to worry some sort of
<strong>"software conflicts that could be causing the issue"</strong>?&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm old enough to know where that comes from guys, and we don't assign interrupts to peripherals, anymore!&nbsp;
</li><li>And this is the big one!&nbsp; The reason for having error codes is to return some sort of clue as to why things have gone wrong.&nbsp; Clearly,
<em><strong>very clearly, </strong></em>the error I'm getting back is nonsense, since it is the exact same executable that works in Windows 7, verified by the built-in FC utility.&nbsp; How can it be a "bad image"?&nbsp; This is an example of crappy coding, where Windows
 is simply returning some kind of default error.&nbsp; </li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">How many times have I seen Windows DLLs or executables returning these stupid codes that are meaningless for the situation?&nbsp; Worse, really.&nbsp; Unhelpful, misleading, time and resource-wasting.&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Really, what exactly would you say if I actually took a spare machine and did a clean install of Windows 8.1 and reinstalled all the same software and it *still* didn't work?&nbsp; Just shrug your shoulders, I'm guessing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Here's my real suspicion: I suspect that Windows 8.1 simply has "features" in it that make applications which used to run fine on Windows 7 not work.&nbsp; There is no stated obligation from Microsoft to ensure that all applications from
 earlier versions actually do work, just the clear pressure to "modernize" our software, whether it's really good for us, or not.&nbsp;
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I appreciate the effort, guys, but I'm disappointed that even you could not come up with anything better than the old "maybe start over with a clean machine?"&nbsp; But I realize that maybe you can't, because maybe there's just a lot
 of software that won't run when it's installed to newer versions of Windows.&nbsp; Any idea what the statistics of that are?&nbsp;

<p>Thanks for the explanation, Thomas. We understand that this is an unusual behavior for Windows 8.1&nbsp; and we'd like to request for the event logs of your computer so we can better identify the possible cause of issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows + R </strong>button.</li><li>Type <strong>compmgmt.msc </strong>and hit Enter.</li><li>Click on <strong>Event Viewer</strong><strong>&gt; Windows&gt;logs&gt; Application.</strong></li><li><strong>On the right pane, click on Filter Current Log</strong></li><li>Put a check mark on the <strong>Critical, Warning, </strong>and<strong> Error
</strong>options. Hit <strong>Okay.</strong></li><li>On the left pane, right click on<strong> Application.</strong></li><li>Click on<strong> Save Filtered Log File As.</strong></li><li>Save the file in your PC.</li><li>Upload the file to<strong> OneDrive</strong> and send us the link.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We will wait for it.</p>

<p>I now have an additional issue complicating things.&nbsp; It would be naïve to continue trying to diagnose as long as the other issue persists, so I will get that resolved first to give us a clean playing field.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope to have this resolved pretty quickly, then I will conduct an experiment where I try to run several of the offending games around the same time, just before I filter and grab the logs.&nbsp; This way, we might easily search for similar occurrences between
 these games giving very similar symptoms.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Will respond with the logs soon.&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Windows 10 automatically disables Video Card. What do I do&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 automatically disables Video Card. What do I do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I am using my longest-lived laptop (just under 5 years now!) and I'm starting to get some annoying errors. I think it's going to die on me soon. But I want to extend it's life as long as I can, so can someone please help me?</p>
<p>My specific issue:</p>
<p>About 4 or 5 months ago my laptop fell while running a video game. Understandably, the computer crashed (blue-screen error) I forget the specific error code or details. I wasn't paying too much attention because I was like "oh, well, that was not unexpected"
 you know?</p>
<p>Now, just over a month ago, I started getting blue screen crashes twice a day. I had been without internet access for at least 3 weeks and therefore, without any driver or OS updates. Anyway, after a few days of troubleshooting, I figured that my NVIDIA
 GTX 760M video card was malfunctioning. After about 5 blue screen events, Windows had automatically disabled this video card -- and in doing so, the blue-screen events stopped.</p>
<p>A week or two later I was able to get this laptop connected and updated. It took at least 4 attempts to successfully update due to another problem of mine (in short: my power supply has issues, so often if/when my battery is low which is about 90% of the
 time since my AC adapter doesn't charge my battery - except maybe about 10% every 24 hours or so - my laptop runs only on about 25% CPU power, which causes issues with starting, shutting down, installing updates since it takes forever on the reduced CPU power
 ... anyway, back to the current issue.) After looking at the details of the blue screen events, some things didn't add up though ... because the details of the crashes seemed to indicate issues with power supply, not with my video card. Well, as I briefly
 indicated, I know I have problems with my AC adapter ... but once the NVIDIA video card was updated and re-enabled, my laptop at least wasn't crashing every other time I tried to use it, so all was fine. Until 2 days ago - I again dropped the laptop while
 trying to pick it up to use it. It wasn't in active use when I dropped it, only sleep mode - and it was a less-than-2ft drop. When I got set up and tried to wake it up, another blue-screen event.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I didn't look into the issue, only assuming it was another 1-time thing like it was 5 months ago when it crashed after it fell.</p>
<p>Well, it was (so far) only a 1 time event - I assume because now the NVIDIA video card doesn't even show up in my device manager. There's no indication that it is even installed on my laptop, except I can still dig into my program files and see the folders
 and .exe's for NVIDIA. I haven't touched them though, for fear of causing another problem and actively causing damage to my system.</p>
<p>I didn't notice the NVIDIA driver was missing until a few hours ago when I tried to play a video game, it was too choppy to play so I suspected it was due to my power supply problems reducing my CPU power ... but no, somehow it was actually running on full
 power (well, not 100% uninterrupted - every 10 seconds or so, the CPU speed would drop from it's normal 2.7 GHz to it's 25% state - but only for about a second.) Then I noticed in the task manager that my GPU graph was missing it's NVIDIA card (obviously,
 I have a default Intel graphics card - not nearly powerful enough for games) ... so that's when I noticed it was entirely missing from my device manager (instead of just disabled.)</p>
<p>So I tried to manually update the video card via the GeForce Experience program that comes with my NVIDIA product -- but the update is unsuccessful "this video card is unsupported by the OS" or something like that.</p>
<p>I tried getting support from NVIDIA, but they're not willing to dig deeper into my issue: After telling me to update ... lol, of course I know I need to first update Windows and/or my graphics cards! and restart - LOL! They told me I'd have to re-install
 WINDOWS to fix the issue --- yeah, obviously they aren't willing to look into the issue!</p>
<p>So, does anyone have any ideas? Help? Suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop works *fine* right now I guess, I just can't really play any games (not really important in the big picture) due to the 2 reasons I've given above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, I'm using Windows 10 64 bit, 16 GB RAM, Intel i7-4800MQ CPU (2.70 GHz)</p>
<p>(I don't know why, but most of the time when my CPU is running full speed, the task manager will say it's running at anywhere from 3.3 to 3.8 GHz speed ... unless I'm playing a video game then it's usually stuck at around 2.7 GHz)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks in advance for any help</p>
<p>

<p>Hello x797DRU,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recent drop might've affected the hardware components of your laptop. Blue screen errors not only occur due to software issues, it can also be caused by a faulty hardware component. You can run the troubleshooter for hardware and devices to check for
 issues with your display adapter driver. Make sure that you're signed in as the administrator to run the tool.</p>

<p>Thank you Devlin Sco for your suggestions!</p>
<p>1) Troubleshooters do not detect anything of any value - besides for a years-old malfunction of "Realtek PCIE CardReader" ... I have no idea what that is, but since it was first detected years ago, I've seen no problems crop up for my normal or even abnormal
 use of my laptop, so I've never looked into it.</p>
<p>2) Scanning for hardware changes does not detect my missing graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I read PaulSey's forum article that you linked, and after also reading the first few pages of comments I see that it's fairly common to have failures and errors on top of whatever the procedure is intended to fix. Or even if it's not common, the number
 of warnings for everyone to see in there is enough to give me pause. Right now the "medicine" seems worse than the disease - or at least the risk of the medicine is too high for my non-fatal errors. I can live without playing video games obviously.</p>
<p>Is there any reassurance I personally have that if I were to go through with the procedure, I also wouldn't get even worse problems for my laptop than what I have now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks for the suggestions! Anyone, keep them coming as I'm out of ideas - well, besides taking my laptop to a repair shop and spending $$$ (I'm broke!)</p>

<p>Thank you for the quick response. The issue might really be due to a faulty hardware component if the driver is still missing after performing the steps above. If you're worried about your personal files, you can always manually backed it up before performing
 an In-place upgrade. Refer to this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-manually-backup-and-restore-your-files/45859954-c9c3-403f-b997-e96c8e001963" title="How to manually backup and restore your files">forum
 article</a></strong> for the steps on how to manually backup and restore files in Windows 10. The procedure is mainly for reinstalling Windows 10 on your laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your laptop has an extended warranty, you can get in touch with the manufacturer to perform a hardware check. As a last resort, you can bring it to your local repair shop to have it examined.</p>

                    Figured out how to change settings and initially deal and hand.&nbsp; Now that I'm at the end of the game can't find out where to end that game and re-deal a new one.&nbsp; When I close it out and come back, it just comes back to where I left it, at a dead end in
 the game.&nbsp; Does anyone know where the controls are to end the game and have a new one started?&nbsp; Windows 8 is definitely not user friendly....

                    Been using Windows 10 for a while.&nbsp; Just started getting stopcodes and Windows restarting. Seems to only happen when running a website with graphics.&nbsp; Using an older laptop with Mobile Intel 4 Series Express Chipset Family WDDM 1.1 which has been discontinued

            Hi Suzy.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br /> 
<br />Prepare and submit the BSOD crash report back here for a BSOD expert's analysis following these steps:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode shown here:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            HiSuzy
<br />
<br />Most likely you are correct about your chipset, however, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

 was my undoing because now I can't go back to an older version of Windows.</p>

            It appears this system is not certified compatible with Windows 10. All the drivers pre-date Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce an incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include: rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />If you need help with downgrading to the original working version of Windows you had prior to upgrading to Windows 10, do let us know. 
<br />
<br />You might want to consider downgrading or rolling back to your previous version and stay with that version for the time being. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:

<h3> qekmike  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Still no answer just recommendations. &nbsp;I'm trying to upgrade to Windows 10, &nbsp;but I get the message NVIDIA GeForce nForce 430 The display manufacturer hasn't made your display compatible with Window 10. &nbsp; &nbsp;I've updated all drivers and the default resolution
 is set at 1920x1080. &nbsp;The monitor WORKS on a different computer with Windows 10, &nbsp;so I know it works. &nbsp;I am trying to download the upgrade for windows 10. &nbsp;My computer is an HP CQ 5604F AMD Atholon II 2GHz 3GB ram w/Wndows 7 64 bit. &nbsp;The monitor is a DELL
 E2414Hm . &nbsp;I've connected another monitor to it and I get the same message. &nbsp;So how can I download the upgrade for Windows 10??? &nbsp;DELL says change the resolution(which I have done), &nbsp;someone else said to update the drivers(done), &nbsp;and Best Buy says it is compatible
 and if my computer will run 10 it will work. I guess what people are missing is that I cannot download the upgrade!!! &nbsp;Microsoft won't let me get past the message...</p>
<p>MAIN QUESTION: &nbsp;How can I download the Windows 10 upgrade &nbsp;after I receive the message: &nbsp;Your monitor is not compatible with Windows 10??? &nbsp;Can anyone HELP me? &nbsp;PLEASE!!!</p>
<p>Answer to your first question : &nbsp;I don't know why, &nbsp; I had a $tupid moment and bought a DELL monitor. $hould have stuck with HP.$$.</p>

            <p>The monitor is compatible, ignore that pointless wrong error message. Its even listed on the Microsoft Store shown displaying Windows 10:</p>

<p>

    <title>Microsoft Money files lost with windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidbothell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Money files lost with windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded to windows 10 from windows 8.1. Dell laptop 4gigs ram, 500gigs hard drive.</p>
<p>I use an old discontinued program called "Microsoft Money" to keep track of my checking account, and other money accounts. These files were kept local on my computer.</p>
<p>My bank statement came in this month and when I tried to open Microsoft Money, a pop up on the screen said I had to re-install IE version 6 to make the program work. I did clone my hard drive to an external 500 gib usb drive before I installed Windows 10.
</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be appreciated, as my checking records since 1989 were all on that program. If I have to I'll use the cloned drive to wipe out windows and put Windows 8.1 back on the internal hard drive. My financial records are more important to me
 than the latest Windows upgrade.</p>

<p>Hello Anony_moose, <br />
<br />
<br />
To better manage this thread regarding the camera of your Surface Pro 4, I'd like to verify if the issue persists. If so, I'd like to ask you a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does this issue occur to all of the camera app that you're using?</li><li>Which Windows build and version are you currently using? To check, type <strong>
<em>winver</em></strong> in the <strong><em>Search</em></strong> box and press <strong>
<em>Enter</em></strong>.</li><li>Have you made any recent changes prior to this issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far to resolve your concern? </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting steps, I'd recommend following the methods below:
<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Method 1:</strong></em> <em><strong>Make sure apps can use the cameras</strong></em>.
<br />
<br />
To do this, go to <strong><em>Start</em></strong> and select <strong><em>Settings</em></strong> &gt;
<strong><em>Privacy</em></strong> &gt; <strong><em>Camera</em></strong>, and make sure that the
<em><strong>Let apps use my camera</strong></em> is <strong><em>on</em></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Method 2:</strong></em> <em><strong>Update the camera drivers</strong></em>. Updating driver would keep your computer's performance at the optimum level. Also, it would replace the outdated one that can cause this issue.</p>
<p>

<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>.</li><li>In the results, expand <em><strong>Imaging devices</strong></em>.</li><li>Right-click on the camera that's having a problem (look for <em><strong>Microsoft Camera Front</strong></em>,

<em><strong>Microsoft LifeCam Rear</strong></em>) and select <strong><em>Update</em></strong>.</li><li>Select <em><strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong></em>, and then follow the on-screen instructions.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Method 3:</strong></em> Run the <em><strong>hardware and device troubleshooter</strong></em> to diagnose and repair any broken components that's causing the issue.To do this, download this troubleshooter on this

<h3> coreyyjacksonn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Asus Laptop&#58; Trackpad does not work and Asus Smart gesture unable to install</h2>
                    <p>So my Asus laptop is having a few issues. First issue is that my trackpad is not working at all. Even reinstalling the driver, it works for a few minutes until it starts flipping out when I move it like if I move it to the left it'll start freaking out and
 jump to the other direction and installing other drivers does not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other issue is that Asus Smart Gesture is unable to install saying: There is a problem with the windows Installer package. A program run as part of the setup did not finish as expected. Contact your local support or package vendor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Conclusion: Mouse issues are my main problem as of right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and the things I tried were: Resetting it to factory settings including wiping everything out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>reinstalling drivers for trackpad including trying the synaptics brand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>reenabling it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would like some help to fix this issue, unless it could be the actual trackpad itself and I might need to bring it to somewhere to get fixed?</p>
<p>

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. 
<br />
<br />Since you reset Windows and that did not help then it has to be a hardware problem. Check with ASUS Support or a real computer shop (one that does its own in-shop service on ASUS laptops).

            It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work, well, we need to try something else. Try resetting the BIOS:

            Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the ASUS computer?
<br />
<br />1b. Where or from whom did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />1c. Was the computer sold to you as a brand-new, never-been-used-by-anyone-else computer or as a used (refurbished) computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. When (exact date) did you "reset to factory settings?"
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.

            You cannot trust the security of ANY used computer unless &amp; until YOU have formatted the HDD and then done a clean install of Windows (or pay someone - not the seller - to do it for you).
<br />
<br />See if the behavior persists after (a) formatting the HHD and then (b) doing a (literal) clean install of Windows 10 Version 1709. See this tutorial =&gt; <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1950-windows-10-clean-install.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1950-window...</a>

<br />Good luck!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First check the free space on this volume by following the following steps:</p>
<p><span>a. Start -&gt; Computer -&gt; Right click -&gt; Manage<br />
b. Select Storage -&gt; Disk management.<br />
c. Verify that you have a System Reserved partition of 100 MB size.<br />
d. If yes, right click on this volume and select Properties.<br />
e. View used and free space.</span></p>
<p><span>Because the default System reserved partition cannot be extended, creating a new system volume is the workaround.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2:
</strong>These are the steps to move the system volume to any other volume:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Choose where you want to have your system volume. Few things you need to keep in mind:<br />
b. System volume can only be created on a primary partition of MBR disk.<br />
c. If system volume &amp; boot volume are together, then BitLocker feature cannot be used to encrypt volumes on your machine.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Suggest creating a new volume (say F:) on the same disk that contains the boot partition of size of about 490 MB (be
 careful to keep it less than 500 MB).</span></p>
<p><span>e. Assuming Windows 7 is installed on C: on your machine. From an elevated command-prompt run: bcdboot.exe /s C:\Windows
 /s F:.</span></p>
<p><span>f. From elevated command-prompt run: DISKPART</span></p>
<p><span>g. From the disk part command-prompt:<br />
DISKPART&gt; select volume F<br />
DISKPART&gt; active</span></p>
<p><span>Finally now you can reboot your machine and F: will become the system volume. You can undo this by repeating the same
 steps using the original system volume (you have to assign drive-letter to it) to revert to your previous configuration.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 free space report bug&#47;problem for my system SSD</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>I have win7ultimate installed on my intel SSD 80gb. Have as well 2 HDDs for 500gb and 1.5 TB.</p>
<p>If i select my SSD, which is system disk c:, then select all files and folders (ctrl+a) and check properties, then it says that total size of all files and folders on disk c: is 21gb.</p>
<p>But the problem is that win7 reports me that I have only 3 gb left.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning it was 14mb, i run clean (deleted 150 mb trash items) then defraged and magically got 46gb free space. But today win7 reports that i have 3 gb free space left.</p>
<p>I use my SSD only for windows and programs run. I have checked that page files for scratch disk used by all programs is not SSD. System backup, system restore option, shadow copy - all disabled. Just don't get where my free space disappears?</p>
<p>I'm have looked in many forums and posts regarding this problem, but there is no clear answer or solution.</p>

                    <p>Hi guys, I recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I game lots, and my laptop isn't very good, so I read on a website that removing thumbnails of pictures would help. (And other options like that) So, I followed the tutorial, and sure enough, the thumbnails were gone (together with the other options.
 (That was back on Windows 7)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I upgraded, I realised that the thumbnails still weren't there, so I tried to look for the tutorial again, but I couldn't find it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I decided to come on here and ask for help.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>With all due respect, you should have mentioned the "Out of memory" message in your initial post. It would have told respondents far more than your rather generally worded question about freeing memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Out of memory" usually means that you have a misbehaving application, one that causes a "memory leak" by demanding increasing amounts of memory until none is left. You could easily find out by clicking on the
<em>Working Set</em> column header so that the application with the greatest memory demand floats to the top. By observing this display over a few hours you will soon know where the leak occurs.</p>

    <title>Why disable SuperFetch on ssd, if RAM is much faster than ssd&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leventisioannis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why disable SuperFetch on ssd, if RAM is much faster than ssd&#63;</h2>
                    It is stated by Microsoft that SuperFetch and PreFetch should be disabled, if the OS is installed on a ssd, according to article
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2727880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2727880</a>. But SuperFetch is used for loading data parts of applications, which have been used very often, to RAM. Although ssd is faster than a hdd, is not faster than RAM.
 So, i don't understand why Microsoft suggests to disable that feature. The only reason i would understand, it's because of a limited RAM. If the RAM is sufficient, above 6GB, if we disable SuperFetch, then the boot time and loading time of the most used applications
 will be increased. Do i miss something here?<br />
<br />
The other question is regarding PreFetch. I have the impression, maybe wrong, that it does the same thing with SuperFetch, with one major difference. It loads all the necessary data information onto the ssd or hdd, instead of RAM, in order to speed up launching
 applications and booting time when the OS is installed on a hdd. So, if i 'm right, we have to disable PreFetch as it stores data information to an ssd or hdd, while SuperFetch stores data information to RAM, which is much faster and therefore it must be enabled
 if there is an adequate RAM.<br />
<br />
I look forward to read the opinion of a Microsoft software engineer.

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Prefetch copies frequently accessed files together into a contiguous area on the disk so they can be located and loaded faster.&nbsp;Which is very much required in old HDDs for faster data retrieving.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>SuperFetch predicts which applications you will run next and preloads all of the necessary data into memory. It also does that with boot files. And for every three days it sends a Defragmentation command to the OS drive which will cause issues in the SSD
 drives.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In traditional hard disks (HDDs) the data is scattered across the disk, in order for the operating system to access them, it will take more time. So it is suggested to perform Disk Defragmentation. But the storage technology is
 different in SSDs, where in, it dynamically saves data and retrieves it faster. That will low down the burden on the RAM and this RAM can be utilized for other purposes like for opening High End Graphic Games, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Oh and the chat log is amazing, "And unfortunately, you were transferred incorrected, twice. First was from the Windows phone, second you were handed to us instead of the Microsoft store. We are truly for the inconvenience.".

<p>I don't know if I would go for the Chat Service in strange issues like this where it might be more helpful to talk directly to someone. You might have a better time getting the extent of the issue across to a phone rep, and I think they have a better ability
 to transfer you to an escalated support rep. If you have the documentation from Amazon showing your purchase, there should be no reason why they can't get it taken care of for you. It definitely sounds like a serial number issue (i.e. possibly when someone
 else bought their console, the serial number was entered wrong at the register and ended up registering YOUR console's serial, thus starting your warranty early.)</p>
<p>Sorry to hear you're dealing with this! Unfortunately, we can't do much here on the forums, but "I don't know what to do and I didn't transfer you correctly" are not acceptable responses, you definitely need to keep contacting them until someone gets you
 to a supervisor.</p>

<p>If I've time to call I will, between work and house chores it's not top of my agenda right now.</p>
<p>But I am sad to see how horrible the chat service is, to the extent I wonder if I should have gone with Sony this generation. Time will tell on that though.</p>
<p>Kind of shocking that none of them even addressed the fact my warranty was back dated. As in they 100% ignored it, to their credit they really wanted me to buy the extension so at least they're trying to sell products. Even if offering no meaningful support.</p>

<p>I can say, for what it's worth, that I know of a number of people who have both systems (or switched) who indicate that the PS4 is comparable on both the issue of technical problems and that of customer support. I think everyone's experiences vary and unfortunately
 some are just unfortunate to have a bad experience. I just know of a few guys who specifically mentioned their disappointment because they thought switching would be the "magic bullet," only to run into a different set of issues common to the other system.</p>
<p>Hang in there and keep on them, and someone will be able to solve this warranty issue for you. Aside from the support problem, as far as the quality of the system and games go, I don't think you'll be disappointed!</p>

<p>If I can't get a warranty from Microsoft I'll just get one from Squaretrade, bit of a hassle but I'd rather have it covered for 3 years.</p>
<p>I wonder why service seems to be poorer now than in years gone by. I had my RROD, they bloody sent a guy to pick it up the following day, had it back in two weeks, and included a 3 month extension and €20 voucher.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's a cost cutting measure? Less support so lower price tag, or better bundles?</p>
