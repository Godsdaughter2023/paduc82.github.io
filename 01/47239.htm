    <title>Fixing Preview Pane, File Explorer, and Control Panel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Fixing Preview Pane, File Explorer, and Control Panel</h2>
                    <p>Okay. I have windows 8. Entirely new to it. Yesterday - actually, earlier today - things were working fine. When I opened the file explorer, it filled the whole screen and
<em>showed the boundaries on all four sides. </em>It no longer does that. It cuts of the boundaries on the right and left. Same issuse with the control panel. These I can work around, but I don't want to. My bigger issue is the preview pane in the file explorer.
 I use it a lot to read over things - I'm a writer. Before, it would fill the preview pane and let me scroll through the whole document. Now, it goes over the width of the screen (and I tried messing with the setting - I put that side as far as possible and
 it still cut off text) and I can't scroll at all. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a big problem for me. And it just started all of a sudden after working fine. So how do I fix it?

            Hi Pat!<br />
<br />
To access&nbsp; <em>AppData</em> folder, simple type the following variable either in Windows Explorer’s Address Bar or from Start -&gt; Run (WinKey + R):
<blockquote>
<p>%appdata%</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Make sure you include both "%" symbol at the front and the end, as it’s the symbol that tells the system to go into the folder you specified.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I ask this so that my friends and clients can add the number to my contact card and then know that it is me that is calling?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lot of tele sales and scammers use Skype, so most people ignore the calls. I want then to know its me so that they answer.</p>

            Skype number is only for receiving calls. People call you up on your Skype number and you receive the call in your Skype client on computer / tablet / mobile.
<br />
<br />You can feed your Skype number in your caller ID. Hence, if you make a call from your Skype client on computer / tablet / mobile, the number which will be flashed will be your Skype number (as that sits in your Caller ID).
<br />
<br />Hence, your clients/friends can add Skype number in their contact list. But you need to make a call using your Skype client on computer / tablet / mobile.

            Subscriptions are one, three or 12-month calling plans that let you make minute-limited or unlimited* calls to selected countries, so a subscription is perfect if you want to make a lot of calls.
<br />
<br />Subscriptions offer the best value for calling mobiles and landlines from Skype - you'll save up to 60% off our standard calling rates.
<br />
<br />With a Skype Number (previously known as an Online Number), people can call you from mobiles or landlines and you can pick up the call in Skype. It’s perfect if you have friends, family or colleagues who don’t use Skype. Anyone can dial your Skype Number from any mobile or landline and you simply pick up the call on Skype.
<br />
<br />
<br />How do I set up caller identification using my mobile number?
<br />
<br />To set up caller identification using your mobile number:
<br />
<br />    Sign in to your account.
<br />    In the Manage features section, click Caller ID.
<br />    Select your country from the drop-down list.
<br />    Enter your mobile number in the text box and click Verify number.
<br />    You will receive an SMS text message on your phone containing a confirmation code. Enter this code in the field displayed.
<br />     Click Verify.
<br />    If you entered the code correctly, you will see a confirmation message, and your Caller ID will be activated in 24 hours.
<br />     
<br />

<h2>            Unable to kill process, program &#34;soft locks&#34; computer when crash</h2>
                    <p>
Hi, I have a program currently to where whenever I play the video game, "Total War: Rome II", to where a majority of the time it would crash and "soft lock" my computer.<br />
<br />
I would be unable to close the program through any means. Task manager would instantly freeze and not respond to any of my actions as task manager itself would not show any activity going on and will not highlight any of my selections nor will it change tabs,
 as though the program was just a still image on my screen.<br />
It is only happening with this game/program.<br />
<br />
I have downloaded a third party program called Process Explorer to see if I could close the program that way, though it seems like anything that has to do with processes gets instantly frozen.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know anyway to force kill a process when something like the examples listed above makes it so I cannot?<br />
<br />
Command prompt also does not work, cannot open it nor can I bring it to the front as all things windows stop responding.<br />
<br />
The only solution that I have found is to FORCEFULLY restart my computer.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend that you boot the computer in clean boot state and check the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow the steps to reset the computer to start normally provided in the section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists in clean boot state as well, you can try to <strong>update the graphic card drivers
</strong>from the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information provided helps, do let us know the results so that we can assist you further.</p>

            <p>I don't know how to create the minidump file, , I have clicked OK on small memory dump, though there is no folder in %systemroot%\minidump.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the minidump only get created when the system fails completely and restarts on its own (like a BSOD)?</p>
<p>If so, that is not possible for the current problem i'm experiencing as the system still "works", it doesn't fail completely or restart by itself.</p>

    <title>RAID error, foreign disk - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            RAID error, foreign disk</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been searching for information, found some but looking for a bid more. So here is the case:</p>
<p>RAID 0 data partion, software raid under windows 10, dont ask why raid 0.</p>
<p>Was trying to configure automated sleep and wakeup times and during this configuration the RAID 0 crashed. I thought disk failure Bye Bye data. Changed the SATA and power cable on one drive an poof it was back online, only in foreign disk mode under disk
 manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the original 2 disks from the raid 0 are still running, 1 is shown in the PC as active (other partitions can be reached on the computer) and the other is a foreign disk. The striped volume states FAILURE and the original disk, which is now foreign, is
 still shown as missing. I tried using every SATA port on the MOBO but that didnt help. So my question now is what is my best option:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 1: Import foreign disk on the machine where the RAID 0 setup was running.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 2: Deactive the " live" disk on the running system and attach the 2 disks of the raid on another system and import the RAID setup at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this was clear enough, since I live in Europe I will go to sleep now but will check in the moring!</p>
<p>Hope you guys can help and no, i do not have a back up, and yes i know foolish.....</p>
<p>

    <title>blinking or flashing wall paper after boot .........operating system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> questions_  say:</h3>
<h2>            blinking or flashing wall paper after boot .........operating system failure</h2>
                    <p>The operating system on my notebook is now blinking the image or wall paper that windows 10 professional produces on the desktop. &nbsp;Today it is a tree with lizard. &nbsp;The other information displayed is 5:20 Wednesday, February1. &nbsp;It had rotating dots, then
 made the windows sound and then booted to the desktop wallpaper which is flashing or blinking. &nbsp;I had attempted to boot clicking the f8 key to get into safe mode. &nbsp;There is no log on screen and only the blinking or flashing wallpaper time and date. &nbsp;Clicking
 on the enter key makes the time and date move up on the screen. &nbsp;When the enter key is release it falls back to its typical position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>History: &nbsp;There were windows update problems that were fixed or finally updated on January 31, 2017. &nbsp;The last windows update was done about 12:30 AM today and there were no updates. &nbsp;It indicated that your computer is up to date. &nbsp;The left lower corner
 windows icon was clicked and then the restart was clicked. &nbsp;It then displayed that windows is updating and not to shut the computer off. &nbsp;The dots were rotating on the screen. &nbsp;This message persisted on the screen for more than thirty minutes. &nbsp;At about forty
 minutes I powered off the notebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When powering on it indicated that windows did not shut down correctly. &nbsp;It then booted to the desk top. &nbsp;After clicking enter it displayed the password box. &nbsp;The password was entered and it booted to the desktop. &nbsp;Administrative command prompt was then
 opened and sfc /scannow was ran and it did not complete. &nbsp;Dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth was ran and it too did not complete. &nbsp;There was corruption noted. &nbsp;The event viewer had NTFS A corruption was discovered on the file system structure on volume
 C. &nbsp;The Master File Table (MFT) contains a corrupted file record. &nbsp;The reference number is 0x400000008124a. &nbsp;The name of the file is (unable to determine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The CBS log, DISM log, MSINFO32, eventvwer, windows defender scan, malwarebytes scan, windows powershell windows update log, etc were posted in another link seeking help to fix the findings in administrative command prompt. &nbsp;At that time there were no new
 performance problems. &nbsp;The computer was then turned off and booted to the bios. &nbsp;There the hard drive was checked and the quick tests passed. &nbsp;With power on it made it to the wall paper but it did not display the time, date or allow clicking enter to display
 the password box. &nbsp;It was frozen with an image of a tree and lizard on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need the information from administrative command prompt, sfc, dism, defender, malwarebytes, powershell etc they are all easily available in the other link or via one drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system was then powered off. &nbsp;The battery was removed. &nbsp;It was unplugged. &nbsp;The power button was then held down for approximately one minute performing a factory reset. &nbsp;The system was then powered on and this time it did not present an image. &nbsp;It was
 then powered off and on this time clicking the f8 key attempting to get into safe mode. &nbsp;Eventually it booted to the wall paper, had the time and date displayed and made the windows sound. &nbsp;The screen though started flashing or blinking and clicking the enter
 key only made the time and date rise on the screen. &nbsp;Clicking escape or control alt delete also made the time and date rise. &nbsp;When the keys were released the time and date would then descend to the typical position on the left lower side of the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system was just powered off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The notebook has an internal hard drive and a flash cache. &nbsp;It is not a SSD drive but only flash cache. &nbsp;The drive size is 750 GB. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files and software programs on this computer are very important. &nbsp;I don't think I can replace the software programs and would like to do whatever may be possible to save them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the computer that I am using now to submit this question there is an empty second hard drive bay. &nbsp;When the drive from the problematic computer was inserted into the second bay it was not recognized by the windows 10 operating system. &nbsp;It was not recognized
 by disk management, windows explored, device manager then disk drives. &nbsp;It is recognized by the bios. &nbsp;The problematic hard drive came from the factory with windows 7 professional with upgrade rights to windows 8. &nbsp;It had been upgraded from windows 7 professional
 to windows 10 professional in July, 2016. &nbsp;It was then updated to version 1607 in August 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other computers that have second bays and so far two won't recognize the internal hard drive in the second bay. &nbsp;Approximately three to six months ago I had also tried to move data from one internal hard drive to another but this internal hard
 drive was not recognized by the computers with windows 10 professional. &nbsp;I think the problematic drive was upgraded in legacy where as the other internal hard drives were upgrade in a UEFI mode. &nbsp;I don't remember the details now but I had made the inquiries
 months ago in another link and no-one was able to figure out why the internal had drive was not able to be recognized by the windows 10 professional operating system in other notebooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows easy transfer was available with windows 7 professional but disappeared with windows 10 professional. &nbsp;I don't know how to save the software programs or files. &nbsp;At one time years ago I had had a hardware enclosure but don't have one now. &nbsp;Also I
 don't have any special cables to connect to transfer data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With empty internal hard drive bays in other computers I can check another one or two to see if the drive can be recognized. &nbsp;These are all windows 10 and none are windows 7 or 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please indicate all of the possible methods to save the software programs and files on this 750 GB internal hard drive. &nbsp;Which is simplest? &nbsp;Which is the hardest? &nbsp;Please provide any links so that even a novice could save the important information on the
 internal hard drive.</p>

            yes the computer belongs to me and i need help with the boot or recovery now. &nbsp;There were two windows 10 professional updates that had failed to update that somehow worked or got installed yesterday. &nbsp;Then very early this morning there was a problem rebooting.
 &nbsp;It took more than thirty minutes at 100 MB/sec displaying windows is updating. &nbsp;After power down then boot it initially worked without any new performance problems. &nbsp;Routine checking with sfc /scannow and dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth revealed
 new corruption. &nbsp;A lot of time was spent gathering the information for the post and I reported a lot of logs to get this fixed. &nbsp;Need help as soon as possible.

            <p>The 750 GB internal hard drive is now in the second bay of another notebook. &nbsp;In an earlier post no one knew how to get windows explorer, disk management, or device manager then disk drives to recognize the internal hard drive in the second internal hard
 drive bay. &nbsp;This was when there were normal boot in the notebook. &nbsp;The drive is recognized in other computers by the bios. &nbsp;The drive is also recognized by Intel Rapid Storage Technology as SATA disk (699 GB). &nbsp;I had not used this software until yesterday
 and don't yet understand how to utilize it. &nbsp;Under manage disk it displays:</p>
<p>Port:4</p>
<p>Port location: Internal</p>
<p>Status: Offline (there is a blue link"Clear metadata"</p>
<p>Type: &nbsp;SATA hard disk</p>
<p>Usage: Unknown</p>
<p>Size: 715.405 MB</p>
<p>Serial number:</p>
<p>Model:</p>
<p>Firmware:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on advanced displays a chart for each of the above disk properties. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For Status Offline it displays status offline indicates that an array disk is locked, that the recovery volume is in on request update mode, or that your computer is running on battery and data updates to the recovery volume are not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a yellow triangle with exclamation mark warning: &nbsp;Assigning an available disk to an array or marking it as a spare will permanently delete any existing data on that disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Usage Unknown it displays the disk is available but contains metadata that cannot be displayed in the operating system. &nbsp;Even though the disk is reported as normal, you will need to clear the metadata to make the disk available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I don't understand why the internal hard drive disk that had factory installed windows 7 professional with upgrade rights that was upgraded to windows 10 professional in July 2016 is not be recognized in the secondary internal hard drive bays of other
 computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program software and files are very important and I need help fixing the corruption as soon as possible.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>There were boot problems and now I don't know how to view any of the information that is on the internal hard drive. &nbsp;I've moved the internal hard drive to other computers and none of the other computers are able to find this internal hard drive in windows
 10 professional in either disk management, device manager, or windows explorer. &nbsp;The bios is able to see the internal hard drive in all computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The information about the windows updates that is currently available is on the one drive links above or possibly a prior link. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the notebook that I am using to write this post I viewed windows updates and clicked on updated history. &nbsp;There it displays four updates. &nbsp;The last one was on 1/24 and was KB3211320. &nbsp;When I clicked on uninstall an update and entered KB3211320 it indicates
 installed on 1/24. &nbsp;On the other computer I did not know about checking to see if it was able to be uninstalled. &nbsp;So it was checked only in update history and that was posted in one of the links during the troubleshooting. &nbsp;Would it typically or atypically
 appear in the windows updates history and not be able to be uninstalled? &nbsp;Would you always attempt to uninstall a windows update to see if it were installed and not rely on the windows update history?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you recover the files and software programs on the internal hard drive that is no longer booting to the windows log on screen? &nbsp;How come the internal hard drive is not being recognized in the secondary internal hard drive bay of other computers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel has software named Intel Rapid Storage Technology. &nbsp;This had been installed on another computer and was just installed on this computer. &nbsp;When the internal hard drive is installed into the secondary bay of this computer it too is not found by the windows
 10 professional operating system in disk management, device manager or windows explorer. &nbsp;However the Intel Rapid Storage Technology finds the internal hard drive. &nbsp;So windows 10 professional is not finding the internal hard drive and the software from intel
 is finding the internal hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On this computer it indicates that the internal hard drive is incompatible. &nbsp;On another computer is had a different displayed result for the internal hard drive in the secondary bay. &nbsp;I contacted intel and the support technician did not know how to interpret
 the displayed results. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I don't know what to do now as the internal hard drive files are not accessible when in the secondary internal hard drive bay. &nbsp;If you get an external hardware enclosure would it make it compatible? &nbsp;Would an external cable that allows the transfer of
 files make the incompatibility moot and allow the transfer? &nbsp;How would you recover the files? &nbsp;I guess the software programs are lost?</p>

<h2>            Crunchyroll issue, PLEASE HELP</h2>
                    So a long time ago when I had an Xbox 360 I also had Crunchyroll downloaded as well, but now I have a problem. Well I got rid of my Xbox and Crunchyroll overtime and just recently got an Xbox One and a new Crunchyroll account, I still have the same XBL
 account though. My issue is this, I have a newely made Crunchyroll account (paying from premium too :/ ) and I would like to be able to take advantage of using the App on my Xbox but for some reason my XBL account is still insisting I'm using the other Crunchyroll
 account. How do I connect my new Crunchyroll account to my account on my Xbox One? I've looked everywhere in the App (phone and Xbox) for a "logout/sign out" button and there's nothing, and I can find NOTHING on google or anything! HELP ME PLEASE SO I CAN
 WATCH MY ANIME T_T

<h2>            Pairing Mouse with Surface</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to pair the Microsoft Wedge Touch Mouse with a Surface RT running Windows 8. It takes a very long time to show up in the list of devices to pair. On the rare times it does show up and I hit pair, I get the message: "This didn't work. Try again
 and make sure your device is still discoverable." I've been on hold with Microsoft tech support for half an hour and I'm still listening to crappy music.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any advice for me on how to fix this myself? Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hi Reynardo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the version of audio driver which you are trying to install on the laptop is not the latest one or isn’t compatible with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you trying to install the latest driver update for the sound card from Asus's website?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot the issue, if you haven’t tried installing the latest version, refer to the link to download the latest audio driver from Asus website and then install it on the laptop:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/X502CA/#support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.asus.com/Notebooks_Ultrabooks/X502CA/#support</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Asus hasn’t released the audio driver for Windows 8.1. So, you will need to download the latest available Windows 8 driver and install it Windows 8 compatibility mode. Click on
<strong>Driver and tools</strong>, choose <strong>Windows 8</strong> from the drop down menu and download the audio driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth USB Adapter Not Recognizing Devices</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to connect bluetooth audio devices to my computer (Windows 10 updated on 07/22/17) via a Satechi Bluetooth USB adapter.&nbsp; When I try to add a device(I've tried a Leophile Eel, the Sony SRS-XB10 speaker, and my iPhone) to the computer via bluetooth,
 the only device that appears is "unknown device."&nbsp; All of the drivers are up to date.&nbsp; The hardware listed under the bluetooth devices are Broadcom BCM20702 Bluetooth&nbsp; USB 4.0 Device, Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator, and Microsoft Bluetooth LE Enumerator.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Thank you for the quick reply.&nbsp; Windows is up to date.&nbsp; I tried using the dongle after updating Windows.&nbsp; This is the first time using a dongle, so I have no comparison.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried updating the drivers under the device manager, but the manager says all of the drivers are up to date.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trouble shooter says the dongle is operating fine.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I click on the add a device button, there is always an "unknown device" even if there no device in pairing mode. Finally, I was able to successfully connect my iPhone, but not the headphones or speakers (both are bluetooth capable).&nbsp; The headphones
 and speakers connect my iPhone via bluetooth without problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            We appreciate you sharing with us those information.<br />
<br />
However, have you tried uninstalling all the drivers under your Bluetooth? Uninstalling these drivers can eliminate the duplicate drivers being registered in the Device Manager.<br />
<br />
You can also check the other troubleshooting steps for Bluetooth problems in Windows 10 from on this

Update us on the result of the steps above.<br />

<p>Why can't I activate Windows?</p>
</b>
<p>If you received a message saying that Windows couldn't be activated, here are a few reasons why it might not have worked, and some things you can try to fix the problem.</p>
<b>
<p>You upgraded to Windows 8, but didn't have a previous version of Windows installed (error 0xC004F061)</p>
</b>
<p>If you see error 0xC004F061 when you try to activate Windows 8, it means that you're using a product key for an upgrade version of Windows 8 and a previous version of Windows wasn't on your PC when Windows 8 was installed. To install an upgrade version of
 Windows 8, you must already have Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP installed on your PC.
</p>
<p>If you formatted the drive before the upgrade version of Windows 8 was installed, you won't be able to use your upgrade product key to activate Windows 8. To activate Windows 8, you'll need to install your previous version of Windows, and then reinstall
 Windows 8. For help with the activation process, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=260480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u>contact support</u></a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>A different version of Windows or product key might have been used as part of a repair</p>
</b>
<p>If you took your PC to a repair shop or to a friend who builds and fixes PCs, it's possible that a different version of Windows was installed to complete a repair. Or if the repair shop or your friend used a different product key for your PC, that key might
 be blocked if it was used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow.</p>
<p>If Windows was activated before you took it to the repair shop or your friend, then re-entering the product key that came with your PC or original copy of Windows might solve the problem. You can also try reinstalling your original version of Windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>One copy of Windows might have been installed on multiple PCs</p>
</b>
<p>If you have one copy of Windows and installed it on more than one PC, activation might not work because the product key has already been used on another PC, or it's being used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow. Normally, the rule
 to follow for most copies of Windows is 1:1, meaning that one copy of Windows can be installed only on one PC.</p>
<p>If your product key is being used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow, you'll need to buy a product key for each one of your PCs in order to activate them.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>Counterfeit software</p>
</b>
<p>If you have a counterfeit copy of Windows that wasn't published and licensed by Microsoft, activation won't work because Microsoft won't be able to create a match between your PC's hardware profile and your 25-character product key.</p>
<p>Microsoft's <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=71144" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>How to Tell</u></a> website can help you figure out if your copy of Windows is counterfeit. If it is, you'll probably need to buy a new copy of Windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/l%20TopOfPageTarget"><u>Top of page</u></a>
</p>
<b>
<p>Used PC</p>
</b>
<p>If you bought a used PC with Windows already installed on it, it's possible that the product key is being used on more PCs than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow.</p>
<p>You might need to ask the seller you bought the used PC from for the original Windows DVD and product key. If the DVD and product key aren't available, or if you tried them and still can't activate, you might need to buy a new key.

<p>Thanks for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How did you purchase Windows 8? Through online&nbsp;store through Microsoft or any other third party store or a retail copy from a shop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do you mean by "<strong>I have activated windows with a genuine key. Its not working out."
</strong>You mean to say you activated Windows 8 and it's working fine for some time and asking you to activate again?</p>

            A problem I'm having is that I have bought windows 8 from Tesco. And have had a new PC custom built for Christmas. Which previously had no operating system on it. The same message is popping up every time I log on and it wont let me personalize any features
 of the computer. I made sure when I was installing windows 8 onto the computer that it was not a update (Windows 7 &gt; Windows 8) Just from No OS to windows 8.

            <p>I have installed the upgrade to windows 8 onto a formatted drive.</p>
<p>So I am not surprised having read above that I get the message that the key is in use already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there not a way to key in the vista key then once that is accepted, key in the upgrade key.</p>
<p>It should be made an option in the future as more people use the upgrade discs to save money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really cannot face another reinstall at this time.</p>

            <p>That sounds awful familiar.&nbsp; Don't know details, but here's what ya do.&nbsp; See if you can use the windows 8.1 product key&nbsp;&nbsp;and download from&nbsp;Microsoft , that will validate if its a valid key, done.&nbsp; Microsoft will know if that product key has already been
 used.&nbsp; Than depending on what happens the finger will be pointed&nbsp;to where you purchased it from.&nbsp; Was your key printed or hand written, hand written room for error "sloppy writing/ illegible".&nbsp; Also is it a full version or an upgrade, that's pertinent "very".&nbsp;
 Because if its a upgrade it has to be loaded over a valid copy of earlier version of windows that 8 will aloud.&nbsp; Is it a upgrade or full version?&nbsp; Those are all the vulnerabilities "for now".&nbsp;&nbsp; Product keys are associated with a particular version, period,
 the key&nbsp;should be assigned to you "no duplications", that would be pirating and would not allow you to download to your pc, its unique.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What is the make and model of the computer? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This device cannot find enough free resources that it can use. If you want to use this device, you will need to disable one of the other devices on this system. (Code 12)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It looks like you might be using more than one network device at the same time and it may create conflicts. You may check the status of network drivers in device manager.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key + R.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>b. Type <strong>'devmgmt.msc'</strong></span></p>
<p><span>c. Expand <strong>'Network adapters'</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let us know the drivers installed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to perform the steps provided. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1: </strong><span>Perform Network adapter troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span> </span></span></span><span>Press <b>Windows + W</b> key on the keyboard..</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span> </span></span></span><span>Type <b>troubleshooting</b> in the search tab and press
<b>Enter</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span> </span></span></span><span>Click <b>View all</b> on left panel<b>.</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span> </span></span></span><span>Click <b>Network Adapter</b>, new window will popup.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span> </span></span></span><span>Follow the on screen instructions.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: <br />
</strong></p>
<p>Many network connection problems are caused by hardware that isn't set up properly. It could also occur if the wireless adapter is not compatible with Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform the steps provided in the article. </p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>Code 12</strong></p>
<p><br />
This device cannot find enough free resources that it can use. If you want to use this device, you<br />
will need to disable one of the other devices on this system. (Code 12)<br />
<br />
<strong>Cause<br />
<br />
</strong>This error can occur if two devices that are installed on your computer have been assigned the
<br />
same I/O ports, the same interrupt, or the same Direct Memory Access channel (either by the
<br />
BIOS, the operating system, or both). This error message can also appear if the BIOS did not
<br />
allocate enough resources to the device.<br />
<br />
<strong>Recommended resolution</strong> <br />
<br />
You can use the Troubleshooting Wizard in Device Manager to determine where the conflict is,
<br />
and then disable the conflicting device. <br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Disable the conflicting device</strong><br />
<br />
1.On the device Properties dialog box, click the General tab.<br />
<br />
2.Click Troubleshoot to start the Troubleshooting Wizard. The wizard asks you some simple questions and provides a solution to your problem based on the answers that you provide.
<br />
<br />
3.Follow the resolution steps provided by the wizard to resolve the problem<br />
<br />
==============================================================<br />
<br />
Check with the System Maker for updated drivers. Then check the actual device makers for even<br />
newer versions. Be sure you are running the latest versions. Ask support and forums (if any) about</p>
<p>any known issues with solutions.<br />

            did both new drivers from marvell/Atheros and fujitsu drivers still the same error. down right makes no sense that it stops working when updated to windows 8.1, tried troubleshooting with the utility. disabling the conflicting device by irq. still nothing.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes it actually does since their drivers were probably not fully compliant and now need to be<br />
for Windows 8.1. Do not fail to ask Fujitsu, Marvell, and Atheros Support (email them) as there<br />
may be stable versions available or other solutions.<br />
<br />

            I just fixed my old laptop yesterday and I installed windows 8.1 on it and discovered I have problem with CODE 12 for my network adapters..<br />
<br />
After some digging , I am able to get it working by disabling "PCMCIA Adapters" on my old laptop ..<br />
<br />
Not sure if you have it , but if you have you can try my temporary solution

            thanks for the fix it worked I can live without the pcmcia adapter for now. I knew it was problems with windows 8.1 guess will have to wait for another patch for them to fix it.

            <p>Has everyone checked for BIOS and chipset drivers as well USB card drivers? And network drivers?<br />
<br />
Those, if available, might resolve the issue without disabling the PCMCIA adapters.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Surface pro 3 battery problem &#40;Please help&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello please bare with me, i like to explain to the best that i can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i bought a Microsoft surface pro 3 (i5 256gb 8gb ram) from ebay, when i bought it was roughly about july or june (can't remember) when i got it it would not turn on at all (unless the charger was plugged in) i tried updates on it to possibly fix it, but
 i could not fix it,so i contacted the person i bought it from ,and he said he's not used the warranty yet, so i set up the device on my account. and spoke to microsoft live support, and they tried to help me to the best they could, but i was still having problems
 with it, so they got me to get this device exchanged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i sent it away took 3days to reach them and i got it back within another 2-3days (so it was a pretty fast service) so as i turned on the microsoft surface pro 3 (without the charger) omg it worked and i was so happy... But that would be about to change.
 Because it seemed like the battery had draining issue's. and would drain really fast. so as you may know by now i got even more frustrated as i would expect something i sent to microsoft to exchange and make sure its fully working, to not do this. (i contacted
 live chat again) they were helpful about it like usual) but it came back to getting it exchanged for the SECOND time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summary I get from ebay &gt; i send to microsoft &gt; i get it back &gt; send to microsoft for a 2nd time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i got it back, and seems its still having issue's with battery being drained (I've checked for all updates / Battery report /firmware. and someone on support even suggested me to refresh/reset the PC and even make a recovery Image. Which i've tried all
 of that. and now, When my microsoft surface pro 3 is on. its battery % jumps randomly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm writing here because Live chat is closed. and i think i know what is going to happen. they'll do ANOTHER exchange for the 3rd time. and I'm scared i'll keep having to do exchanges with microsoft... I really don't understand how this would happen to me
 2 times in a row. as the person on live chat reassured me this does not normally happen, when they do an exchange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feedback on how i should handle this would be highly appreciated!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Battery draining as in, When I &nbsp;was on the default operating system i got with the microsoft surface pro 3, (win8.1) the battery would drain doing nothing. and then when i updated it to windows 10, i could see the battery bar, and it kept jumping randomly
 sometimes it would be at 50% battery saying 51minutes left, then when it goes to 48% battery it would say 1h-26 minutes This is the 3rd device this is been happened on. &gt; I''m going to send it away for a 3rd exchange... but i think 99.99% chance when I get
 it back it'll be like the other 2, since microsoft who send replacments don't seem to look at devices they are giving their customers or I'm very unlucky getting a battery problem'd device for the 2nd time in a row. from the first exchange. I've not had time
 to exchange it due to a busy work schedule.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You don't know how many times I've reformatted it / reset the PC / Factory resetted the PC &gt; Done ALL windows updates. and still having this problem, I am very disappointed. I'd rather get a refund on the amount and just buy a brand-new one that won't have
 ANY issues (I hope)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What will happen when i send this away for the 3rd time, and it has another battery problem what will i do then? i know i can exchange it unlimited times because of my warranty, until that expires, but what the hell is the point of me doing that when all
 i want to do is have a device I PURCHASED to work for around 9hours as stated by the company roughly 7-9hours &gt; wheni don't even get 1-2-3hours out of it because its always messing up the %...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>

<p>I've got a real laptop G750 18gb ram i7 1tb ssd / I just wanted a Microsoft surface pro for other stuff lol&nbsp;</p>
<p>I purchased this on ebay and thenIi found out about the unused warranty so i made it into my hotmail account an if i sold it on ebay, and the person who buys it hates the battery issue then they would try to get their money back.<br />

<p>Hi. I bought surface pro 3 2 weeks ago. It was working fine until 2 hours ago when it showed the same problem. Won't turn up until I plug in charger and would turn off immediately after I remove charger. Battery level is stuck at 70% (not charging). I checked
 and latest 29.08.2016 firmware is already installed. I removed it and reinstalled it. Still problem persists. Any help??</p>

<p>The snapshot button inside the red&nbsp; lines looks more like "take to full screen" symbol.&nbsp; When&nbsp; you take a pic and get a split screen showing YOU and the person you photographed avoid this by deactivating your webcam and just end up with a pic of the other
 person. Resume webcam.</p>

    <title>Would upgrading my processor and ram void my windows 10 activation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Would upgrading my processor and ram void my windows 10 activation from the free upgrade offer&#63;</h2>
                    I'm wanting to upgrade my ram from 4 GB to 8 GB and my processor from a core 2 duo to a core 2 quad. I have Windows 10 because I used the free upgrade offer but I was told if I make significant hardware changes that I won't be activated anymore and I'll
 have to call Microsoft to reactivate it but I don't know if upgrading the processor and the ram counts as significant hardware changes. Does it?

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that ideally changing processor and RAM should not lead to activation issues, but if you face issues with activation, you may do phone activation. See this link for reference:</p>
