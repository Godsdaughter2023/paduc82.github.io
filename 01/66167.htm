<h2>            The &#34;disease&#34; is apparently an Epidemic Across Platforms &#38; Manufacturers</h2>
                    <p>I've spent the last little while searching the Support and Community neighborhoods for problems with keyboards "acting up," to be polite. In reality, these numerous keyboards are going crazy! And my research here indicates that the problem is not endemic
 to a certain model or manufacturer. What is similar is that the vast majority occur in Windows 10 operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, I thought it was happening just with my 2014 Lenovo ThinkPad Edge 535, after I upgraded to Windows 10 last August. Please note that while I occasionally use a keyboard shortcut, i.e. CTRL-C, CTRL-X, CTRL-Z, SHIFT-F7, etc., I have not built any
 complex macros using the CTRL, Alt, or SHIFT keys. Then, while typing in Word, One Note, Outlook 2010, or almost any other software which will accept keyboard entries, I suddenly will have numerous windows open up all over the screen. Through trial and error,
 I've found the only solutions are to perform a simple restart or a complete shutdown, power and battery removed and capacitors emptied, followed by a new boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I began to notice that the same thing began happening on my 2013 HP Pavilion Desktop after upgrading it to Windows 10. And - the same thing has begun to occur on my wife's 2015 HP laptop as well. If it was as simple as your thumb or palm-heel accidentally
 rubbing across the mouse pad, I'd get it. But this is much more than that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first search a few moments ago in the "Support" window, "Keyboard Going Crazy," returned over 285,000 results! A similar search in Bing returns over 365,000 results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Knock, knock Microsoft. Anyone home? Anyone listening?</p>

            Hi YLIN0625,
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<h2>            Monitor Speakers Making Loud Buzzing Noise</h2>
                    Hi, I have a BenQ XL2411P hooked up to my Xbox One S and I am using Astro A40TR with the mixamp. The A40 require that you have you HDMI and Optical audio set to Bitstream out. The issue I have is whenever I switch inputs from something else to my Xbox
 I get a horribly loud buzzing noise and the only way I can get it to stop is by going to my Audio Output settings and switch my HDMI Audio from Bitstream out to any other setting and then back to Bitstream out and it will stop, until the next time I switch
 inputs to something else and then back to my Xbox and I have to do the fix all over again. I can't find anything online about this issue, if anyone has any suggestions or answers they would be greatly appreciated.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post! This sounds like an issue regarding the Xbox's operating system, to troubleshoot this, try a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Soft Factory Reset</a>. This will reset the operating system for your console while keeping games and applications installed, hopefully removing and fixing any software issues causing the problem you are experiencing. To perform the reset correctly, be sure
 to select "Reset and keep my games &amp; apps" to not remove content from your console for the reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

</p><p>Looking thru CoreInfo, I see PAE, NX &amp; CX16 (CMPXCHG16B) all being supported so not sure why I'm getting stuck.&nbsp; Here're the specs of the setup:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We appreciate your earnest effort for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on your description, it is possible that what you’re experiencing can be software related. Incompatible driver, outdated driver, and hardware malfunctioning are a few of the reasons why your Windows
 10 won’t boot and gets stuck on blue screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Booting in safe mode would allow Windows to start using the basic set of drivers and startup programs. To start Windows 10 in safe mode, you can follow the instructions provided in this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your computer is working properly while in safe mode, we can proceed with either updating or uninstalling the hardware driver that was recently installed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a> for steps on how to update or uninstall
 the driver.</p>

<p>Hello JericDale,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.&nbsp; &nbsp;First, I want to clarify that I did NOT get the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).&nbsp; &nbsp;It's rather the Blue windows logo screen upon booting from the win10 installation disc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now as per your instructions on booting into safe mode, are you suggesting I go into my current w10 32bit which is working perfectly fine, follow the instructions according to this article:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if my understanding is incorrect:&nbsp; When I tried to boot from the win10 64bit installation disc, I would enter the w10 installation process straight after BIOS so it doesn't get thru the current HD which presumably got the instruction of loading
 w10 32bit in safe mode?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Possible reason why it’s getting stuck at blue logo screen is because the installation disc that you are using is damaged or corrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Migrating to Windows 10 64 bit from 32 bit operating system requires installation, that means all files, data and applications will be deleted, we suggest to create a backup before the
 installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the meantime, we recommend to create another installation media using Media Creation Tool and check if issue still persists.</p>

<p>Hello JeriDale,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the response.&nbsp; &nbsp;Damaged media was also my initial suspicion so this is already my second DVD created from Microsoft's mediacreation tool (mind you it's also the latest version!)&nbsp; &nbsp; For both discs, I've opened different folders and checked
 out the files randomly and they all read correctly and didn't look corrupted.&nbsp; &nbsp; Discs are of different brands and both were created/burned with no error message so I guess the chances for BOTH of them being corrupted are probably on the low side.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestion?</p>

<p>There’s an alternative way of upgrading your operating system manually by downloading the Media Creation Tool for Windows 10 on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After downloading the Media Creation Tool, right click the
<strong>MediaCreationTool.exe</strong> file then click <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>. Accept the
<strong>End User License Agreement</strong>, then proceed to the following steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the option <strong>Upgrade this PC now</strong> if you want to upgrade right away, then click
<strong>Next.</strong></li><li>If you want to download a particular edition or both architectures, uncheck the Use the recommended option for this PC.
</li><li>Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Select ISO file, then click <strong>Save</strong>, Select your location then click
<strong>Save</strong>. </li><li>Wait while the .ISO image is created. </li><li>After downloading the Windows ISO, mount it.</li><li>There are number of ways to work with an ISO file using File Explorer. However, the easiest way to mount an ISO image is by double-clicking the file.</li><li>You can also right-click the .iso file and click the Mount option.</li><li>Once you mounted the file, you'll notice that Windows 10 will create a virtual disc drive that you can use to access its content from the left pane.</li><li>Run the “<strong>setup.exe</strong>” to start the upgrade process.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this helps.</p>

<p>First off, I selected upgrade this PC now and it took me straight thru some download process without asking about edition list.&nbsp; &nbsp;Then it went thru some more downloading and verifications and finally nothing happans, believe it or not.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected the other option "create a media to be installed at another PC", selected the edition, then downloaded and saved the file.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I right click on it, I can't find the 'mount' option.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I double clicked it and it opened into a bunch of directories and a few programs, including setup.exe.&nbsp; &nbsp; When I double clicked setup.exe, it complains that this app can't run on my PC.&nbsp; &nbsp; At
 this point I'm not sure whether it's a problem because it's not mounted or somehow the setup doesn't seem to be working...</p>

<p>Since you have done all the troubleshooting steps above, we would like to have additional information so that we can provide the best possible resolution:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>How are you installing the DVD media for Windows 10? Are you trying to install the media through boot menu or you’re installing it inside the operating system?</li><li>Kindly check the boot settings on your BIOS and provide the following information:<br />
<ul>
<li>What is your BIOS Boot Mode set to? (Legacy/UEFI)</li><li>Secure boot – is it enabled or disabled?</li><li>What is the boot sequence on your BIOS settings?</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 1.25in">
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the step by step procedures you have taken installing the DVD media for Windows 10?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep us posted so that we can continue working on your concern.</p>

<p>Sorry for not clarifying earlier but yes, I was definitely installing the DVD via boot menu.&nbsp; I.e. I specified the DVD drive to be the 1st boot device BEFORE the HD.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My BIOS does NOT have secured boot option.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To re-iterate: I downloaded the media creation tool and then subsequently the windows 10 64bit ISO, burned that onto two different DVD, just to ensure there's no media error.&nbsp; &nbsp;I booted straight from the DVD, right after the BIOS and all I get is the blue
 windows logo w/ black background.&nbsp; &nbsp;I tried that on BOTH discs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Hide pointer while typing won&#39;t turn off</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have been having issues on Windows 10 with the pointer disappearing / showing as fuzzy and changing position whenever the system is thinking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the answer to this on other forums may be to turn off the 'hide pointer while typing' option. I did this and the problem was solved for a couple of days but is now back (I've tried turning back off and on a couple of times but no improvement).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another fix to this that anyone knows?</p>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Last night I had a failed attempt at cloning my drive to a ssd. &nbsp; The clone worked, however I could not boot into it. while fighting with the bios on a my Dell OptiPlex 790 I deleted something and could not reboot into the old drive. reinstalled windows
 on ssd and now I want to transfer files, apps and settings to the new hard drive as I can still access the data. Any help would be appreciated.

            Hello Scott,
<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />No automatic procedure can be applied.
<br />As you reinstalled W10, you have to configure your settings again and to reinstall your apps.

            Hi Scott.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can slave the drive to the new SSD to copy over Data, but your apps will need to be reinstalled and settings one freshly since importing old settings is a corruption path into a clean install.  
<br />
<br />There are many other tips and optimizations here in this tutorial that compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>You didn't tell us how you attempted to clone your drive. Windows 10 has not had a supported cloning utility for more than a year, so what application did you use?</p>

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />You have reinstalled windows on SSD.
<br />
<br />Applications also need to be installed on SSD, if they are not portable apps.
<br />(Since Registry keys and file associations are depending on installation).
<br />
<br />Use this tool to install quickly:
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/168581/4-ways-to-quickly-install-your-desktop-programs-after-getting-a-new-computer-or-reinstalling-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/168581/4-ways-to-quic...</a>
<br />
<br />You can try using portable apps for easy transfer in future.

<p>In that case you may have a problem to discuss with EaseUS. I used EaseUS ToDo Backup for about a year and it never failed for me. (I'm a backup geek.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you were 'fighting with the BIOS' and 'deleted something' it sounds like you didn't really understand what you were doing. A clone or an image (you only needed an image) includes the metadata at the front of the drive, so if the drive
 booted before the clone/image, it boots after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apps and settings can't be transferred from one computer to another. They have to be reinstalled and redone, respectively. I think you need to take a few steps back and start over.</p>

<h2>            How can I get Windows Store and Xbox app to connect online using my 3G internet service&#63;</h2>
                    I have a slow 3.1 Mbps 3G internet service that works fine with Edge and Chrome browsers but neither Windows Store nor my Xbox app&nbsp;will connect online. Have already tried to reset the store but&nbsp;did not work. Xbox would not let me sign in but would connect
 &amp; let me use&nbsp;the guest account until I&nbsp;installed 3 updates today:&nbsp;(KB3176493), (KB890830) &amp; &nbsp;(KB3172729). Now all I get is&nbsp;We Couldn't&nbsp;Sign&nbsp;You Into Xbox Live 0x80131509. Does anyone know how to fix&nbsp;either problem?

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the issue description, I understand that you are experiencing issue with Window store app and it’s not connecting online. I will certainly help you to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>However, I would appreciate if you could help me with more information to better understand the issue and provide you a solution.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you receive any error message while connecting to Windows Store?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1 </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to place the computer in clean boot state to rule out the possibility of any third party programs conflict.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is a process of starting your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your computer performance.</p>
<p>Please refer the Microsoft article below to get more information on this. <br />

            <p>The error code for Windows Store is 0x80072F30. Just performed clean boot and now I am unable to connect to internet at all. My Novatel wireless device just says please wait. It is plugged into computer via USB and now all it says is "Please wait..." I followed
 instructions on services but did notice it included disabling wireless internet, and start up included disabling &nbsp;Novatel Wireless. Somehow clean boot erased my ability to go online so of course Windows Store is still not able to connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to Xbox live instructions you gave, l must not have been clear. I do not have an Xbox console. I have an app on my computer for Xbox. The app was never able to allow me to sign in to get my gamertag but was able to connect and let me play the Xbox Solitaire
 game already installed on my game as a Guest and earn points for playing games and download new themes for cards. Now it just says can't sign in for gamertag and has no option for playing as Guest after installing the latest updates for Windows 10. And since
 clean boot erased my internet connection there is no point trying to sign in.</p>

 Had to follow instructions to reverse the boot. Got my Internet access back after that but I have no idea why a clean boot meant no internet.</p>

            Try using Easeus instead, its much easier:

<p>Thanks for your feedback Andre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link below contains a video I was using to try and convert my MBR to GPT on my system drive..</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/mbr-to-gpt</p>
<p>
</p><p>The video explains that the methods used in your suggestion will destroy data and that is why the new utility MBR2GPT is the recommended solution. Since this utility is new with the latest Fall Creators Update, it may need updating. I hope someone has more
 experience with it and can shed some light on why it fails for me.</p>

<h2>            keyboard problem dell inspiron 3670 windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp; I am posting this to see if anyone else has had a similar problem.&nbsp; I have a new&nbsp; Dell Inspiron 3670 desktop and am using windows 10.&nbsp; I have had lots of problems but this is&nbsp; a new one.&nbsp; Three days ago I turned on my computer and when I went to enter
 my password the line was full.&nbsp; Apparently my keyboard was entering characters.&nbsp; I don't know what they were.&nbsp; I could not log on.&nbsp; I unplugged the keyboard and shut down the computer and plugged my keyboard back in.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I logged in my computer was fried.&nbsp;
 I contacted dell support but my computer was so fried (everything was very very slow) that I could not connect with them.&nbsp; My keyboard was a microsoft ergonomic keyboard.&nbsp; I had recently bought a new microsoft ergonomic keyboard because I had had a similar
 experience&nbsp; before (keyboard entering random characters at start up.)&nbsp; To&nbsp; fix the computer I installed an other keyboard (Belkin) and did a system restore.&nbsp; I had to reinstall&nbsp; windows updates because my backup was before the latest windows update.&nbsp; My computer
 is fine now except I do not like the keyboard (like typing into a pillow.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only thing I can think of is that I put a piece of cardboard in my keyboard so I would not hit the caps lock key.&nbsp; Sometimes I hit it by mistake and type unwanted capitals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Perhaps it held the shift key down although the cardboard (actually stiff
 paper) only touches the caps lock key.&nbsp; I also put an piece of cardboard in to prevent my hitting the flock key.&nbsp; I hate that key as sometimes I hit it by mistake and messes up my programs.&nbsp; (I wrote my own dos programs for writing math papers and I use the
 function keys all the time.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am reluctant to return to the microsoft ergonomic keyboard but I hate my other keyboards (all of them are ergonomic as I am addicted to them.)&nbsp; My question is if I do not use the cardboard is it safe to return to the microsoft ergonomic keyboard.&nbsp;
 Has anybody had bad experiences with the keyboard entering entering characters so you can not log in.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp; thanks for listening.</p>

            Hi Trebor.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />System Restore is your first line of defense if Windows ever malfunctions as it can run even from recovery media to get your back before a problem started.  It should always be turned on C drive with plenty of disk space (5-15%) configured.   Then set a Restore point before using your MS keyboard again.
<br />
<br />Make sure to expedite Updates after you plug it in for any drivers or enabling software.  You can also look here for driver software:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi TreborPowers,
<br />
<br />It is unlikely that piece of cardboard is the cause of this, that, if stuck would just result in capital characters . . .
<br />
<br />More likely, this is caused by a known issue in Windows 10:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot 
<br />
<br />Run the Keyboard troubleshooter 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this for you 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager 
<br />
<br />Expand the Keyboards section 
<br />
<br />Right click your keyboard and choose 'Uninstall' 
<br />
<br />Then restart your PC       
        </p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;&nbsp; I have fixed my computer and&nbsp; have reinstalled the Microsoft ergonomic keyboard.&nbsp; I have spent considerable time trying to figure out what happened.&nbsp; I do not know but this is&nbsp; my best guess.&nbsp; I think it was the card board.&nbsp; What I think happened is
 that the cardboard had the effect of holding down the shift&nbsp; key.&nbsp; My understanding is if the shift key is held down for more than 8 seconds other things start happening.&nbsp; (I have disabled this along with the sticky keys</p>
<p>options and messages.)&nbsp; What I am concerned about is that it appears my computer was messed up before I logged in.&nbsp; If so this means it is possible to mess up someone's computer without logging in.&nbsp; If I were Microsoft I would check this out.&nbsp; My experience
 with windows 10 has been very bad.&nbsp; I have had 4 major melt downs since Aug 2018.&nbsp; Every time I turn on the computer I wait in dread fearing another.&nbsp; I have written my own programs and I know what it takes to really debug a program (years of fixing it when
 something bad happens.&nbsp; Often it takes a week just to figure out exactly what is causing the problem.)&nbsp;&nbsp; I used to use&nbsp; windows 7.&nbsp; If I was the President of the U.S. I&nbsp; would consider forcing Microsoft to keep supporting windows 7.&nbsp; To force us to use an
 unreliable operating system is wrong.&nbsp; Thanks for listening.</p>

    <title>GPU enabled only when HDMI connected - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tobymathews  say:</h3>
<h2>            GPU enabled only when HDMI connected</h2>
                    Hi there,<br />
<br />
&nbsp; I previously posted about DirectX not utilising my laptop's NVIDIA GPU:<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/directx-dxdiag-only-lists-integrated-gpu-not/c5701178-baae-4be6-b9d4-0eff56634c74<br />
<br />
(it would only 'see' the lower powered Intel GPU).<br />
<br />
&nbsp; I have a little more information now. I can see that the NVIDIA GPU is enabled, but only when the laptop is connected to a display via its HDMI port. Neither Dell nor NVIDIA have been able to rectify this yet, I'm posting here on the off-chance someone has
 encountered something similar? I have installed a huge number of different drivers, to no avail.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Any help would be much appreciated, thanks,<br />
<br />

            It's awkward bouncing between threads. Better continuity with one thread on what is<br />
basically the same topic.<br />
And what were the results of the suggestion on your other thread ?<br />
<br />
This has potential to&nbsp; just makes things worse. Some drivers may have a particular bug
<br />
( which can be found in the drivers release notes), but the full driver is never a problem.<br />
Use a WHQL from within the last few months, get it installed correctly and stick with it while<br />
troubleshooting.<br />
Have you been getting the drivers from Dell or Nvidia ? With laptops it's best to get<br />
the drivers from the mfg of the laptop.<br />
<br />
What have they suggested up to this point ?<br />
Is there a problem with using HDMI&nbsp; vs mini display port ?<br />

            Thanks for responding.<br />
<br />
I started a new thread as the previous one, as described by me, appeared to be about DirectX - I've subsequently discovered it's a more general issue.<br />
<br />
I have installed various versions of the NVIDIA drivers, some from Dell and some recommended by NVIDIA. However, I've cleaned up in between each new set of drivers. The NVIDIA installers additionally come with a 'clean install' option, that removes any lingering
 traces of previous versions.<br />
<br />
Dell and NVIDIA have mostly suggested trying different driver versions, although there has also been some suggestions pertaining to the Optimus software NVIDIA use for switching GPUs (between integrated and NVIDIA GPUs) on laptops. As yet nothing suggested
 has made any difference at all.<br />
<br />
I didn't quite understand your final point? Modern Dell laptops only have an HDMI port, I believe (definitely the case here anyway).<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

Didn't read that correctly did I ( must have been visualising PC outputs for the two gpu options) ?
<br />
So your laptop monitor is not working with the dedicated card, but the HDMI to an
<br />
external monitor is ? It does sound like a problem with Optimus. <br />
Is there no manual option for selecting Integrated or Dedicated graphics ? Possibly a BIOS<br />
setting to switch off the integrated graphics that you can use at least temporarily ?<br />
According to what I read about your laptop it also has a mini-displayport graphics output.<br />
<br />
The clean install option does not remove 'lingering traces' of the driver, only your various<br />
Nvidia Control Panel settings.<br />
it can be useful on occasions where there has been a corrupt driver install.<br />
<br />
.<br />

            Ok, well I <i>have </i>been removing the drivers myself before new installations, and I have also tried using another driver removal program (can't remember the name).<br />
<br />
NVIDIA's Optimus software is supposed to automatically select the NVIDIA GPU for programs that it recognises will benefit from it (games etc). You can also configure it to enable the GPU for any program you want (by identifying the relevant executable). Additionally
 there's a context menu item added to Windows, allowing you to select which GPU should be used when starting any program. I cannot get the NVIDIA GPU to be enabled using any of these methods
<i>unless </i>the laptop is connected via HDMI to an external display. When connectected via HDMI everything starts working as expected, I can switch between GPUs at will.<br />
<br />
There doesn't appear to be any reference to the GPUs in the BIOS (latest version).<br />
<br />
I'll check the ports tonight, it could be that I'm forgetting a display port - I guess if there is it would be interesting to know if that has the same effect as the HDMI port.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

            I just uninstall the drivers via Programs and Features. Never bothered with the Nvidia uninstaller,<br />
but it should do the job, you would think.&nbsp; On the rare occasions I do use Driver Sweeper<br />
I run it after uninstalling the drivers and rebooting Windows.<br />
<br />
Does sound like a problem with the Optimus program.<br />
What happens if you uninstall the drivers for the Integrated graphics ?<br />

    <title>Why is scrolling speed&#47;amount inconsistent across apps&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rishisanyal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is scrolling speed&#47;amount inconsistent across apps&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've noticed that trackpad scrolling, including the speed and number of lines scrolled, varies wildly from app to app on Windows 10 on a Surface Pro 4 (precision trackpad). It's different going from Microsoft Edge, to Google Chrome, to Windows File Explorer,
 to Adobe Lightroom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also different scrolling using the trackpad vs. scrolling via touch on-screen. The rest of this discussion will talk about the precision touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge feels the best, with a very nice accelerated scroll that really 'rolls off' at the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chrome is very literal: scroll exactly these many lines (dictated by your setting in Touchpad settings), and then stop when your fingers stop. Enabling the smooth accelerated scrolling in Google Labs makes it nicer, but it's still very different from Edge:
 with the acceleration seeming to last a much longer time than with Edge. And with this Labs setting off, it's still very different from Edge (being more 'literal' and less 'smoothed acceleration').</p>
<p>
</p><p>File Explorer is much worse than either internet browsers, being very 'literal' with really no feeling of acceleration and, instead, constant speed scrolling. But worse: it's like constant speed scrolling that continues after I've stopped moving my two fingers
 for the scroll. I feel like this is trying to simulate accelerated scrolling, with a 'roll off' at the end, but doing a really poor job of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, Adobe Lightroom scrolling is terrible: no matter what my 'choose how many lines to scroll each time' setting, it only scrolls a tiny bit per two-finger movement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, Lightroom and Explorer both appear to ignore the 'choose how many lines to scroll' setting in Windows, whereas the browsers' behavior changes based on this setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Photoshop, activating scrolling at all sends the picture literally off the screen so you can only see one corner of it, and you can't recover from this state until you zoom back out (usually using the keyboard). So you have to be very careful *not* to
 touch scroll at all. This is productivity killing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why this inconsistency across apps? Apple has nailed down consistent scrolling behavior across most/all apps, which is very important b/c our brains tend to learn an 'expected scrolling speed' when using a laptop, which allows us to kind of predict the speed
 of scrolling and compensate for the motion in our heads, allowing us to read/follow text as we scroll. This completely falls apart when using a Surface Pro 4 with Windows 10, since the scrolling varies so much from app to app. I can tell my brain's 'expected
 scrolling speed' is working, if that makes any sense, but when the actual scrolling speed isn't matched, I suddenly sense a 'disconnect' and my eyes don't follow the scrolling to keep up with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to set a 'global' scrolling speed/amount, and acceleration/smoothing, across all apps on Windows 10? Is this a Windows 10 thing or a Surface Pro 4 thing or a precision touchpad thing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>This is indeeed a real and very annoying problem. I've recently moved from an old 2011 macbook pro to a Surfacebook and honestly, i regret not buying another, newer macbook pro. Even the old one had the basics on point. Surfacebook has problems scaling its
 apps along with its higher resolution, the trackpad seems precise but it's so inconsistent it's a pain to work with.</p>

            Yes, I have a Dell Inspiron 5559 with a precision TouchPad and vertical scroll lags big time in Chrome browser, just right in Edge and a bit too fast in Internet Explorer. I've read similar complaints from Surface users using touchpads. Have tried some
 of the suggestions from disabling smooth scrolling in Chrome, and reinstalling touchpad driver. Another suggestion was trying Chrome Canary which is the Chrome beta. I did not see any change with that beta version. Firefox also seems to do much better with
 scrolling speed than Chrome. too me, this is certainly a Chrome issue for sure. I have seen several Chrome bug reports about this especially with Dell XPS notebooks, but I think it affects many precision touchpads. Not sure if Google is just ignoring this
 or if they are saying its a Microsoft Windows issue? For myself, since every other application works fine with scrolling, I am thinking Chrome has some sort of compatibility problem with Windows precision touchpads than other browsers. I prett

            <p>I have a similar problem with chrome on a Dell XPS 15, I'm pretty sure it's impacting everyone using this laptop but most users don't care/know enough to report it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify, the touchpad scrolling is not slow performance wise (it's smooth and not laggy), but it's slow as in low sensibility, you have to swipe your touchpad full height multiple times to scroll one page height. In others apps or browsers the scrolling
 is working fine (probably around 3 times more sensitive than Google Chrome).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem is related to the Microsoft Precision Drivers (and Chrome obviously).</p>

</p><p>I have a new Surface Book, and am researching this horrible Trackpad performance in Adobe Bridge CS6. Scrolling with the mouse wheel works great, and using the trackpad on my old Lenovo X220 tablet works just fine as well. While I love the feel of this trackpad,
 it just doesn't work consistently across all apps, and is especially apparent in one of my main go-to apps, Bridge. I have to flick quickly up the whole trackpad to get a response, which doesn't work when I want to move just a little bit. When I move just
 a little bit, I may or may not get a bit of motion, and then it just stops. Why?? Very frustrating, and no apparent control in the driver settings or anything.</p>

<p>I find that I have two distinct speeds for scrolling on my Lenovo Flex 3. Also note that I only use the touchpad, and don't have a mouse. It's either smooth or incredibly fast. In Microsoft office apps except OneNote 2016, as well as web browsers (edge and
 chrome), surfing my files, etc., it is controllable and smooth, like I have it set to be. It is also responsive to changes made in settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in OneNote 2016, Spotify, iTunes, musescore 2 (a composition software online that's free), and other software, the scrolling is outrageously fast and uncontrollable. When I scroll the smallest amount possible, maybe an eighth of an inch or whatever
 the smallest recognizable amount is for it to register, it scrolls an absurd amount. If I go at the smallest increment, it goes about a page and a half in length, but if I slide any more it usually goes all the way to the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a factory reset, as well as updating all drivers. Nothing has changed since I've owned the laptop since August of 2016. I'm stumped. Microsoft please patch this or help!</p>

<p>Just bought a Lenovo idea pad 720S 15" with Windows precision touchpad which starts to lag in response when I'm using Microsoft edge browser. When it's not lagging it feels great and natural. Already spent 2 days and couldn't trace anything as to what is
 causing this behavior. A lot of ppl suggested they killed a &nbsp;background process called fmapp.exe&nbsp;</p>

 it scroll way past the screen I need. ANNOYING!!!! Please change it back or tell me how to change it back.&nbsp; Thanks!

            Hi 
<br />
<br />The Photos App in Windows does not really rotate images, it just marks them as rotated, please try this:
<br />
<br />On your PC, right click that image and choose Open With - Choose another App - Paint
<br />
<br />In Paint rotate that image 90 degrees to the left and save that as a copy of the original file
<br />
<br />Then upload that rotated image to your account

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are getting the error message while installing .net.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you&nbsp;made any changes to the&nbsp;PC prior to this issue? </p>
<div>Is the issue specific to this update?</div>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Try to run the Windows update troubleshooter:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp;Press Windows key+X.<br />
b.&nbsp;Click on Control Panel.<br />
c.&nbsp;Click on Troubleshooting.<br />
d.&nbsp;On the left pane, click view all.<br />
e.&nbsp;From the list, click on the Windows updates.<br />
f.&nbsp;Run the troubleshooter.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Try to perform clean boot:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,
 or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />

<h2>            Do deleted files from windows media player go to recycling bin &#40;win10&#41;</h2>
                    Hi. I might have deleted some files not only from the app, but from the computer as well. In order to be sure I need to know whether once deleted through the app the files are permenantly deleted or merely go to the recycling bin. I know not too many people
 use windows media player anymore, but I don't know where else to ask this question.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 update fails</h2>
                    I have a 1 month old Dell notebook with windows 8 updated to windows 8.1. I have been trying to run windows update for three days. The update starts and stalls. Not sure why. I have rebooted several times but the update will not complete. No errors shown.
 Tried one fix from Microsoft but no change.

<h2>            Open Nat - Still No Party</h2>
                    
<p>I believe I have opened NAT finally. When I test my connection it shows it connects to live and no longer gives the strict NAT message. But it also doesnt have a Open NAT message either. Not sure if it should.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I'm still having issues connecting with my friend via party invite. He can't connect to me, I can't connect to him. He also claims to have open NAT. I only have to Live buddies and the other friend doesn't play very often.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hate to ask, but I was wondering if someone could invite me as a friend and try to invite me to a party? Someone who knows their party usually works.
</p>
<p>We are trying to play castle crashers.&nbsp; :)</p>

<p>Paperjoex2, I read a few FAQ/Help me's and all of them said to disable UPnP. The guide you posted says to enable. So I tried that and it seems to be fine now.

<h2>            Cannot Install .net framework 4 and 4.5 nor can i install windows updates.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, When i try to install .net frameworks 4 + 4.5 i get "A fatal error has occured" i have followed all the trouble shooting guides i can find on the MS forums about it and still no fix. I looked at the logs and it says I have the version or a version
 above already installed when i dont as when i try to run programs such as the CSGO CEVO client it says I need to install .net framework 4 or above. I have tried the MSI fixer (didnt work) I have looked at the registry keys and theyre correct. I ran the MS
 net framework cleanup tool and that didnt help either. Here is a pastebin link to the error log:&nbsp;http://pastebin.com/z5wSFpy6</p>
<p>Here is a pastebin link to the MSI.txt:&nbsp;http://pastebin.com/VzXPNhCh</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if i try to install the .net frameworks through windows update I get fatal error 643.</p>
<p>When i try to upgrade to windows 10 i get the error&nbsp;Code 8024201C</p>

<h2>            broadcom 802.11n Wireless SDIO adapter and bcmfn2 Device</h2>
                    <p>I just got bricked by a Win10 update.&nbsp; I didn't get to see which one and I don't know if it was an Insider preview or not.&nbsp; Hopefully whatever it is the Insiders can help with the resulting issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On reinstalling Win10 Home&nbsp;my Wifi adapter is not working "This device cannot start (Code 10)".&nbsp; In addition the bcmfn2 device is unable to start as it&nbsp;is dependent on the Wifi adapter (SD\VID_02d0&amp;PID_a9a6&amp;FN_1\4&amp;32d17375&amp;0&amp;0) "Code 51".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I immediately got an update to the version I now have, but the issue persists. &nbsp;After going on numerous forums I find that this is happening to hundreds or people over numerous brands of computers, mostly tablets and some laptops.&nbsp; It is happening with a
 variety of Win10 versions and no one can find a resolution for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is why is no one at Microsoft doing anything about this.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the forums I've been on are Microsoft forums so I assume Microsoft is aware of it...maybe not. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed and reinstalled the drivers (the most recent and one previous without a change in symptoms...as have most of those I have observed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a NuVision TM800W610L with Win10 Home 64-bit v1803 build 17134.112.</p>
<p>The Broadcom 802.11n SDIO driver is 1.596.12.0</p>
<p>The bcmfn2 device driver is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance will be appreciated by many.</p>

            Can you try downgrading to an earlier version of Windows 10 to see if it resolves the problem?
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>

<p>Thank you for the specifics. &nbsp;Just for the record i just let the updates do themselves as i am curious as to whats next. &nbsp;My main machine is much more stable as i am more careful, if being an insider can be consudered careful. &nbsp;At any rate a ‘downgrade’
 is not a problem on the tablet in question as it was an impulse, and wasn’t fully populated as yet. &nbsp;What is on there now is a clean load with one update. &nbsp;I will be putting a clean load of 1703 and shutting off the auto update functions. &nbsp;I doubt i will have
 it as an Insider machine...at least for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i will follow your advice where it applies and let you know hiw it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks again</p>

<p>i'm about to try this driver. i just bought this tablet and going back to a previous version of windows means back to windows 7. i've been using 1803 for almost 2 weeks and didn't encounter this driver problem until today. will update you if this works..
 i have to sideload it to the tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;&lt;UPDATE&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>The driver version you suggested worked like a charm. AND i wanna add that the ping and throughput times are both WAY more consistent with this version as well. kudos and thank you.</p>

    <title>How to remove album art from music folder&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to remove album art from music folder&#63;</h2>
                    How to remove album art from music folder?&nbsp;
<div>I save my songs in the music folder in my hard drive but since past 1 month there is these Images that before the songs. They are the album arts of the songs in my Library. The number of times i deleted those album art images, the number of times they
 came back.</div>
<div>Looking for the solution on this site i came across This method in which i had to uncheck the "Retrieve information from the internet" Box in WMP. Well i did that too. It worked for 3 days and then again the images came back. Its a bit annoying and i have
 no idea how to delete them permanently.&nbsp;</div>
<div>If somebody could help i would be glad.</div>
                </div>

            You don't really need to because the album art takes surprisingly little place in an mp3 of 3Mb. Unless you're adding hi-res photos !
<div><br />
<div>I believe in WMP there are 2 options that need un-checking to stop it connecting to the net.</div>
<div><br />
