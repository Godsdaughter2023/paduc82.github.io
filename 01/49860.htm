<h2>            Cleaning my 360 S.</h2>
                    
<p>So I have my 360 slim sitting in an area that collects dust rather easily (I cannot move it). I know that the dust can clog up the fan and my Xbox has been showing the effects of the dust recently. It has been heating up insanely fast. I want to know how
 I can clean the dust out without opening up my Xbox 360 Slim. Is it possible for me to use an compressed air can to spin the fan up and clean it off without damaging the console?</p>

<p>Microsoft specifically states to not use compressed air to clean your console. &nbsp;It can cause damage to the console. &nbsp;They recommend just using a vacuum at the vents with the console completely disconnected. &nbsp;</p>

<p>HomegrownSilky, that is 100% incorrect on Microsofts part. An Xbox 360 is using components that pretty much match those found in a PC. Plus, I use compressed air to clean both of my consoles that I've had for the past year. No problems at all.</p>

<p>xTye - On a PC you can open up the case and be sure to blow all the dust out. &nbsp;You can't do that to your console so you can end up lodging chunks of dust into places that you won't ever be able to get to. &nbsp;That is why Microsoft doesn't want you blowing anything
 into it. &nbsp;If you could open up the case like a PC then I'm sure it wouldn't be a problem but you can't. &nbsp;Just because you have had no problems doesn't make Microsoft wrong.

<h2>            Dark Blue Desktop Background with small white dots, can anyone explain this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The problem began when my screen resolution kept decreasing automatically every time after reboot. I fixed this by dusting my computer. But shortly after my background wallpaper became automatically replace with the image attached. Dark blue with lots of
 small lighter coloured dots. Any ideas what could be causing all this? Feedback much appreciated.</p>

<p>Black screen with white dots overlaying my desktop background happened to me after last Windows 10 update. All my icons were still there just the background was hidden behind the overlay.
</p>
<p>Thank you zachd for the hint to check wallpaper settings.&nbsp; For some reason they were reset to slide show and tile by the update.&nbsp; Very Strange! :)</p>

            Go to Display Settings and click Display adapter properties. Under Adapter type select properties. Under the Driver tab you will be able to find a Disable device option. Click on it and it should positively restore your Desktop background.

<p>Yes, I was signed into both the app on my phone and on my laptop. Signing out of the app on the laptop did not fix the push notification issue.

    <title>ipv6 &#34;No network access&#34; after Windows 10 install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sml1226  say:</h3>
<h2>            ipv6 &#34;No network access&#34; after Windows 10 install</h2>
                    <p>After installing Windows 10, I no longer have ipv6 access. I had proper "Internet" status on ipv4 and ipv6 both in Windows 8.1 prior to the change, but now am unable to use ipv6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a clean install of Win 10. Fresh drive, no 8.1 data on the drive. Ethernet drivers have been installed and reinstalled multiple times. Never had an issue prior. Even with the drive being transplanted into new hardware forcing new drivers and new
 configurations onto everything, 8.1 handled ipv6 without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had proper ipv6 connection prior. A test at test-ipv6.com would produce a 10/10 in readiness. Now, for whatever reason, I'm stuck with Teredo and tunelling instead, which I don't even remember seeing in my connections lists in 8.1 while trying to solve
 a different issue before (while ipv6 was showing Internet access). <br />
</p>
<p>I have had errors related to router configuration back in 8.1 that produced a "No Internet access" status, but this "No network access" status is new to me. With zero hardware changes and no changes elsewhere in the network since it last worked, I fail to
 see why changing to 10 has magically broken my ability to use ipv6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And please do not tell me ipv6 is not necessary and that I should not worry about it. That is in no way helpful in solving this issue. I keep seeing that as the answer to this (apparently common) issue. I am here right now despite it, but I don't want things
 that I know can, and should, work, not to.</p>

<p>I appreciate a concise list of things to try, but there's nothing new there for me. I've done all of it on the advice of others with the same or similar issues. Releasing and renewing leases was all I hadn't tried before, yet is completely irrelevant with
 a static ipv4 ip and no ipv6 configuration working anyway, so wouldn't accomplish anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting to run "netsh int ip reset" is the only legitimate error I ever see:</p>

</p><p>Of course this is run as an administrator, as it shouldn't do anything without those permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've even attempted disabling teredo entirely in hopes that the issue was arising from the presence of a pointless tunneling service when native ipv6 should work here. All that did was break what ipv6 access I do have. At least with it on, ipv6 works, albeit
 in a roundabout way that shouldn't be necessary.</p>

<p>Other than leaving my ipv4 set to a static ip, but wiping the actual settings, leaving me with no network access on ipv4 and ipv6 both after the restart, that did nothing. I still have ipv4 access, and ipv6 is still showing "No network access" as before.</p>

<p>Fully updated and the only antivirus I ever run is Windows Defender. Nothing there to cause trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned initially, this has been the case since the day I installed 10. The current hardware had no issues in Windows 8.1, both missing updates (thanks to the wonderful decision not to allow updates on 7th gen Intel CPUs, even when they are
<em>required</em> to be able to run the installer for 10) and having run fake network connections and even swapping NICs along the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I have limited knowledge of the configuration used on it, the brand new Win 10 desktop at my work, set up by someone else so I'm sure the issue is not a unique case on my end, also displayed the "No network access" message with regard to IPv6 Connectivity.</p>

    <title>How can I do an incremental backup on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charleslarimer  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I do an incremental backup on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm not the only one searching for an answer to this. There's lots of individuals who would like to utilize software that includes Incremental and differential backups. So I made it my business to find out if there are any software packages to fulfill this
 need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Windows does not provide this service. I've talked to Microsoft Answer Tech's who say Microsoft is thinking about including these services. But how long will it be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the interest of Transparency, I have no connections with the&nbsp; AOMEI Company I am about to give you the information of what I've found after diligent searching of the Internet. I wouldn't give up until I found a solution to my issue and those of you who
 are looking for the same type of Software. I had what I thought were some possible solutions only to determine they did not meet my requirements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first found a site advertising the AOMEI Backupper Software only to find out it was just a phone bank of individuals taking orders. I questioned them as best as I could due to difficultly in understanding. For every question I asked, I was told they did
 not know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For about 3 minutes I put on my thinking cap and the obvious path was to find out if there was an AOMEI corporation somewhere on this Earth. And I got a hit. All I searched for was 'AOMEI Company'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started reading the website for this company and clicking though every inch of the window. Finally I came across what I was looking for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For businesses, for the many different packages the were selling them for $45 to $499 to business entities because they were making profit off of the AOMEI Software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AOMEI is based in Hong Kong and the software looked very Professional. In the URL, at the bottom is to a AOMEI website where you can Download this Freeware to your Windows Platform right now. I have but I haven't had time with other things I'm working on
 to do it. I will be doing so soon because I really want to see how it works. I am of the opinion, at this point in time, it should work nicely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is for Home users only, It can not be utilized to make any profit on. If you want to make $s with this Backup, Incremental or Deferential Backups then you will have to purchase this product form AOMEI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Professional Software has a lot of additional functions the Standard version has.</p>
<p>

            Windows DOES have a file backup feature called File History. It only backs up files that have changed each time it runs. Check it out in Settings -&gt; Update and Security -&gt; Backup. It's completely free for all users and you don't need to download a thing.
 Please note that File History only backups the user's personal files, and does not back up apps or other system files.

<p>I was looking for this same type of Software. Downloaded this Software to my PC with Windows 10. Now to selecting what to download so I picked the first one. How bad could a System Backup be? I found out the hard way. Creating this first Full Backup and
 4 Incremental Backups I had a situation where I had to do a Restore of the Full and Incremental Backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is where everything went South. I started to restore the Full Systems Backup (had to run in Restart mode) and once I got to the end the Software automatically did a Restart. What I found out was the files and folders were somewhat restored but the Windows
 10 Software did not happen and I was left with a non-working Boot file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve this I sent an eMail to AOMEI Support gave me instructions on How to run&nbsp; a few things each of which was not successful and they said they don't know what to do. I felt like I was being abandoned. I know one thing I learned from this experience,
 I will never attempt to do a Backup using the System Backup ever again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took my PC to Best Buy Geek Squad for analysis of this issue. They came back with The Hard Drive has some issues. This PC is over 8 years old compared to the usual life of a Mechanical Hard Drive is about 4 years so with this I was blessed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, considering how advanced PC hardware has progressed compared to my original PC. Old PC with 1 TB Mechanical Hard Drive and 3 MB of Ram. The new one I purchased had&nbsp; 1 TB Solid State Hard Drive (Never De-fragment Solid State Hard Drives because
 it will not increase the speed up the retrieval process any faster. The other thing with this new PC it contained 12 MB Ram. It is so much faster than my Old PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how I did it but I was finally able to get the Full Backup recovered and am working on the Incremental Backups.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the AOMEI Restoration, after resewing the options available for Backups, I will be selecting AOMEI Files and Folders Only which I should have done in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Support from AOMEI is Sketchy at best. </p>

            Hi GreySilence 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />How to Boot from a USB Flash Drive in Windows 10 - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Hi GreySilence
<br />
<br />Unplug your PC and remove the battery 
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Power button for 30 seconds 
<br />
<br />Plug your PC back in and replace the Battery 
<br />
<br />Start your PC and see if it boots into Windows 
<br />
<br />If not, let's see if we can get into the Windows Recovery Environment: 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

                    <p>Until now, i have never configured windows built in mail app, I have always just setup outlook, and life was good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, on my new laptop, MS saw fit to automatically setup the noddy mail app with my email without my asking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I get a new email, both mail and outlook notify me - I have duplicate email programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This must be a very common problem? &nbsp;If so, why, when you install outlook, does it not automatically neuter the built in mail app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know how do i "unconfigure" or otherwise get rid of the mail app? &nbsp;I see that people are saying dont get rid of the now useless mail app because it breaks other stuff?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Using two email app at the same time may sometimes cause issues such as synching problem. You may remove your account in the Windows Mail app and continue using the Outlook desktop app as your primary email client. To remove/delete an account from the Mail
 app, you can refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Delete-an-email-account-from-Mail-and-Calendar-apps-dba65c49-648d-4d76-9f88-b7bc22a2cc3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.<br />

<p>It only takes 15-20 minutes to factory reset Windows 10.&nbsp; Even if it took 2 full hours to install your favorite apps and Office or whatever, that's still a lot less time than trying to fix this unknown issue that you may never fix.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Its a random virus which creates an autorun registry at&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor<br />
<br />
Just open Registry editor and delete Autorun Key at the above location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this repeats then go to YOUR_USER_NAME/APPDATA/Roaming/Microsoft and delete a folder named SoundMixer.</p>

You have to run IE as the administrator (right click and select "run as administrator").&nbsp; When you run IE as an administrator, the "Upgrade" box is no longer grayed out.&nbsp; Thank heavens for Google, which is how I found the answer.&nbsp; The movie I was trying to

<h2>            Skype not working between phones.</h2>
                    I have updated Skype on both of Samsung S7 phones and can call other devices ( Samsung tablet and HP laptop) but cannot call between the phones them self's. Both the tablet and laptop have wifi turned off so there is no cross communication. How do I get
 Skype to communicate between the phones?

<h2>            Windows Meta Files &#40;WMF extension&#41; thumbnails</h2>
                    How do I get Windows 7 Explorer to create and view <strong>thumbnails</strong> for my Clip Art which are in the
<strong>Windows Meta File </strong>format (WMF extension)? In Windows 7 one can view WMF clip art by clicking on it and getting a full view but no thumbnails are produced. Windows 7 produces thumbnails&nbsp;for clip art in other formats. Windows XP produced thumbnails
 for WMF clip art. How do I get these thumbnails in Windows 7?

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>WMF files are vector based, so there really is no image from which to make a thumbnail from. A vector based image is nothing more
 than a mathematical set of instructions to remake some image, similar to MIDI files on the audio side don't contain any<br />
waveforms.</span></p>
<p><span>The reason that you can't&nbsp;view&nbsp;.wmf thumbnails is because&nbsp;the file format&nbsp;been recognized as a&nbsp;serious security threat, thus Microsoft
 disabled this feature in Vista and windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>If you still wish to view the thumbnails you will have to get a 3rd party software from the web.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the links below for more information on this.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/717705f0-d044-43cd-9ac8-27b387188e76" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/717705f0-d044-43cd-9ac8-27b387188e76</span></a></p>

    <title>Caret browsing on or off&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ramone899  say:</h3>
<h2>            Caret browsing on or off&#63;</h2>
                    I am using windows xp home edition. when I get the pc up and running (very slow), within minutes whatever page I'm looking at (via Firefox browser) suddenly drops down to the bottom of the page and cannot be brought back up to the top. I've been advised
 to use PF7 when this occurs, and to choose "no" when asked if I want to turn caret browsing on. This works, but only for less than a minute or so, then the page drops down to the bottom again.
<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what else I can try to stop this page-drop-to the-bottom once and for all?<br />
<br />
thanks a lot.

            Please start with the basics:<br />
<br />
The First Question Of Troubleshooting: If the problem is new, what changed between the time things worked and the time they didn't?<br />
<br />
The Second Question of Windows Troubleshooting: what is the malware/virus status of the machine? If you think it is clean, what programs (and versions) did you use to determine this?<br />
<br />
Be sure the computer is clean:<br />

<br />
<br />
Come back with answers/results if you need more help.<br />
<br />
If you can't do the work yourself (and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea), take the machine to a professional computer repair shop (not your local equivalent of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad). If possible, have all your data backed up before
 you take the machine into a shop.

<h2>            MS Money Deluxe Version 14.0.120.1105 or MS Money 2007 and Windows 2010</h2>
                    I've seen various forums about MS Money and Windows 2010 where people are saying there needs to be registry change to get around IE6 not being installed (Ps. I know nothing about registries!) but what I would really like to know is whether the incompatibility
 problem is only when people are trying to use MS Money "online" for syncing with banks etc? I have only ever used MS Money manually ie. offline. I enter my finance data manually (yes , very tedious!) and work with the software without asking to retrieve information
 from the internet. Would I therefore be able to use MS Money the way I use it, on windows 10? and also MS Money 2007?
<br />
I presume the compatibility problem relates to the problems with not having the right version of internet explorer, which of course is not needed for software which doesn't need the internet? Until I can be sure this will work, like many others I won't be able
 to upgrade to Windows 10 ever! Thanks for any advice on this.

    <title>Xbox Live Update Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tracyg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live Update Issue</h2>
                    
<p>I just had the update issue tonight. My call reference number is: 1154679228. I recorded my exchange with support and was advised the recording of my support call would be escalated and I would be personally contacted in 24-48 hours.</p>
<p>In essence I advised that I have purchased 5, maybe 6 XBox 360s. I always buy them in pairs, usually a few months apart. My XBoxes always fail, some generations fail consistently and the failure pattern is the same - Pair 1: Box 1 dies with RROD, Box 2 dies
 with the same problem a few months after the first - send em in for repair - get em back, box 1 dies with cd failure, a few months after - box 2 dies with same issue. Buy new pair of XBoxes. A few months after warranty expires (I think the first one was about
 a month after) CD Drive fails. A few months after that Box 2 pair 2 dies with same issue. Thats 4 Xboxes with 4 CD failures - 100% failure rate - really - what are the odds?</p>
<p>Had Pair&nbsp;1 Box 1 CD Repaired locally - worked fine. Had Box 1 Pair 2 repaired locally - worked fine. Neither have broken after repair. Pair 2 Box 2 sits on a shelf - dead as a doornail - bad CD drive. Side note - Microsoft employee advises they had their
 Xbox for 6 years no problem - I'm left wondering why non Microsoft employees get the hardware with deficiencies - with a 100% failure rate how can this be?</p>
<p>Had the repair done locally cause well........... I'm upset that Microsoft keeps selling me what I consider to be defective hardware - I'm tired of sending hardware in for repair and getting it back and having another part break after I send it in for repair.
 Today 1 box is upgraded and refuses to connect to Xbox Live. I'm advised repaired box is considered "MODDED" and is a complete loss because of a driver issue. I'm an IT systems administrator - I'm insulted by that comment - I have to repair driver issues all
 the time on Windows servers - the servers are never a complete loss. I explained that if Microsoft competed on cost, quality of repair, and turnaround time no one would use anyone else. From my perspective this is anticompetitive behaviour. It was suggested
 my next step for escalation was to complain in a forum. I advised I've read the forums and consider that recommendation emotionally abusive.
</p>
<p>I advised I would not have any issues if Microsoft sold hardware that is reliable and I consider it a terrible disservice to tell customers who spend over $1000.00 on hardware for personal use - only because it keeps breaking to try putting it writing so
 someone can respond in effect - its hopeless. I asked.... really?&nbsp;Why would anyone make that kind of recommendation to a customer?</p>
<p>It was explained to me that hardware does not last forever. I noted that I've bought at least five of these things (because of repeated hardware failures) and four have failed (the fifth is less than a year old) - some repeatedly. I noted that I have also
 purchased a PS2, a WII, gameboys, Computer Displays, a PSP, Computers etc. etc... and lets see.... in the last 15 years I had one display adapter and a power supply die. I've never had a hardware failure on any gaming system but Microsoft's. I cant give my
 working displays away - I have to pay someone to take&nbsp;them - same with the computers. One the other hand I've had all the XBOX failures noted above and now Microsoft is starting to make my working one's&nbsp;unusable.
</p>
<p>I had adised the support rep - hey Microsoft - your not listening (let me repeat that) - hey Microsoft - your not listening - how bout you sell me something I dont need to keep getting fixed - how about competing on value? Dear Microsoft - Please listen
 to me. Please sell working hardware. Please compete on repairs based on cost and value - your a million times bigger than Joe Blow - there is no reason you cant do it faster, cheaper, and better. No one would use anyone else for repairs if you were competitive
 - you don't need to make systems unusable to justify inflated repair costs.</p>
<p>Please don't apply this update to my other boxes and screw them up. Please defer the update indefinitely. Please leave them just as functional as they were before you decided to improve them. Please return my XBox that is broke to its former working condition
 and again - defer this upgrade indefinitely (all of them appear to work just fine when you dont update them. Please leave them just fine. Here is a suggestion - if you think everyone wants this update - sell a new version of the Xbox that has this update on
 it - there is no reason they cant both work and the one with all the new value just does a little bit more. Leave everyone else just as functional as they were.</p>
<p>Please listen to my support call (1154679228), please listen to&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm not making excuses for MS, nor am I a "fan-boy", just an explanation.</p>
<p>To get a 3rd party DvD drive to work with your 360, the firmware must be flashed, (modded).</p>
<p>Which is what was done when you had it repaired by a local shop.</p>
<p>No matter the &nbsp;reason, this violates the Terms of Service.</p>
<p>One of the purposes of this update was to reflash/update the 360's DvD firmware for the new disc format, (as well as security issues).</p>
<p>Any "modded" DvD drives were rendered useless.</p>
<p>Sorry, that's the risk taken when getting unauthorized repairs.</p>

<p>I still have the old drive - that does not work. I assume its not useless? Kinda Sorta. The failure rate is still unnacceptable to me. I don't have an inate interest in flaunting non-compliance - I have a significant interest in buying hardware that fails
 at a rate lower or equal to competitors or alternatively - not going broke trying to keep it running.
</p>
<p>I have never ever bought any electronic device in my lifetime that fails as quickly, or as frequently, or in so many different ways as this Microsoft Product. The whole approach to failures and repair expenses reminds me of Tobacco companies and smokers
 - these failures cannot possibly be unintentional - not 4 out of 4 - not 100%. </p>
<p>Bill should be reading this - we need a vaccine against buying addictive products that appear to be built with a goal of sucking money out of the buyer through repetitive hardware failures. Not to mention the impact of all the trashed hardware on the environment
 . Hey Microsoft - want to save the earth? - build products that require fewer repairs and provide a fix for the one's your breaking to keep them out of landfills. You might even save a life or two.</p>
<p>I'm still waiting for my follow up return call from Microsoft promised me by support contact.</p>

<br />
<br />If you still continue to experience problems...
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.
<br />
<br />If you still want to troubleshoot the problem:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv

            Ok, lets hope the next cumulative update succeeds KB4284835 works better.

<br />In the mean time, I recommend you use the opportunity file a bug report so the Windows engineers are aware of the issue:

<h2>            Frequent BSOD - IRLQ_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL - tcpip.sys</h2>
                    <p>I've been seeing more and more frequent BSODs this past week with error code IRLQ_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL and citing tcpip.sys as the fault. I updated every driver I could think of, no dice. I tried driver verifier, and it crashed before boot about a dozen times
 pointing at a different driver each time I would remove a program - mostly virtual devices (cyberlink, daemontools, and then virtualbox) until it got to my wifi card. I tried several different versions of drivers for that card, but it continued to happen,
 and WhoCrashed was also now indicating my WiFi driver as the likely fault. so I removed it entirely and switched to an Ethernet cable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it's saying that it's my ethernet adapter driver (which I also just updated), and I find it
<em>highly</em> suspect that both hardware components and/or drivers are bad. I've done everything I can think of to do, and I'm really hoping someone can find something in my crash dumps to point me in the right direction before I pull my hair out.</p>
<br />
<p>Last memory dump and all minidumps from today are in here: <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!Ahm5P_BkILbR0RRD7R3WR2XdLlq7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I've tried it with three different driver versions already. I also tried the wireless card with four. I'm pretty certain that it is not actually related to the ethernet adapter or wireless card at this point.

            I actually have my wireless adapter sitting on my desk next to me right now, I took it out last night so all three of those crash dumps are without it being installed in the system. The Intel is the ethernet adapter, the wireless is a TP Archer T9E that
 uses Broadcom drivers, the last one before I removed it was bcmwl63a. I unfortunately didn't have the foresignt to save any of the crash dumps before today.

<p>Alright, I have been on an <em>adventure</em> with Driver Verifier. I enabled it on all non-Microsoft drivers and let it do its thing, then reset it, unchecked whatever driver was blamed by WhoCrashed, and have repeated that process until I got to the point
 where the computer would actually function with it running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of the Minidumps are in <a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!Ahm5P_BkILbR0RRD7R3WR2XdLlq7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://1drv.ms/f/s!Ahm5P_BkILbR0RRD7R3WR2XdLlq7</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>According to WhoCrashed, the drivers that caused the BSOD during boot were:</p>
<p>-lgbusenum.sys (Logitech driver component)</p>
<p>-lgjoyxlcore.sys (Logitech driver component)</p>
<p>-trufos.sys (BitDefender component)</p>
<p>and drivers that caused the BSOD after boot (this starts with 082118-14890-01.dmp):</p>
<p>-atc.sys (BitDefender component)</p>
<p>-lgvirhid.sys (Logitech driver component)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I unfortunately didn't think to save all of the MEMORY dump files and some of the Minidumps are just pointing to ntoskrnl.exe - I know for sure the time that trufos.sys was the reported cause it was ponited at in the Memory dump and the Minidump said ntoskrnl</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this means I should assume it's the Logitech device, BitDefender, both, or some other underlynig cause that's doing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: For what it's worth, I did try the Driver Verifier strategy before posting, too, and it did crash and blame the Broadcom driver of the wireless card when I did then. None of the attempts today blamed the ethernet adapter, though, but every BSOD I've
 gotten that was from 'real' use has said tcpip.sys was the fault (and then blamed the network driver for whatever mode was being used in WhoCrashed).</p>

            Well, I uninstalled BitDefender that night and I'm still using the Logitech headphones, but I haven't had another BSOD since, so I have to assume that was it.<br />

<h2>            Harassment, Identity Theft</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;A gamer online had a childish rage over my Minecraft world, threatened to hack my account (but nothing ever happened of course), sent harassing messages on xbox live, trying to still my identity on social media, and sending harassment through a website
 i have created for xbox gaming. This is more than just simple anger issues and its childish and pathetic. As far as I know, trying to steel someones identity on social media is a form of Online Identity Theft. I have blocked him and Filed a Complaint on his
 profile of course but In this case, blocking communications on xbox live can only do so much. Is there any way he can get banned from xbox live since all of this mess originated from there?</p>

<p>The enforcement team will investigate him since you've filed a complaint. It would be up to them to determine if he will banned or not.

<p>OK. Well im not questioning there authority if they CAN ban him or not. I would like to know if he can be banned for harassment, Yes or No? and If Yes, then i would also like to know what the consequences would be as a gamer, be it banning for a limited
 time, forever, or some other form of consequences. I believe gamers have the right to know if we do something wrong on xbox live that we will know what would happen. As far as I've read so far on other forums, i havnt seen much action taken against trolling
 gamers. If there is a File Complaint Option on Xbox Live, I would like to know if it actually works or not. If any other gamers have an answer to this question then please reply. If not then please do not reply just to add on to the subject. I would like an
 answer, not a blog.</p>

<p>Yes, they can be banned for harrassment. Thought the punishment depends on how severe the enforcement team determines it to be. Suspensions can start at 24 hours and increase to 2 weeks with multiple enfractions, and then a permanent ban after the 2 weeks.
 If the harrassment is severe enough, they will permanently ban them immediately instead of just suspending them.

<p>When I checked Local Services in my system, I always see TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper Local service is set to Automatic from the time i installed Windows Operating system (any windows OS).</p>
<ol>
<li>I want to know why it is set to Automatic. </li><li>If any application is depented on that service why can't it turn on when it eneded and turn off after the task completes?</li><li>If it is importent to start that service, why it is need? What programs by default use that service from first use of Windows OS?</li></ol>

Hi Aditya,</p>
<p>The TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper Service provides support for the NetBIOS over TCP/IP (NetBT) service and NetBIOS name resolution for clients on the network, therefore enabling users to share files, print, and log on to the network. If this service is stopped,
 these functions might be unavailable. If this service is disabled, any services that explicitly depend on it will fail to start.</p>
<p>If any other services depend on TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper Service, its startup type is set to Automatic. The networking programs use this service.</p>
