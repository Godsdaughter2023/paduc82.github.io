                    <br />
I read in&nbsp;some forum&nbsp;article about resource monitor, but there was no explaination. So I thought Microsoft guys could throw some light on it.

<p><span>Resource Monitor is a tool that you can use to monitor the usage of CPU, hard disk, network, and memory in real time.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can use the Performance tab in Task Manager to see how your computer's CPU is being used by Windows<span>&nbsp;</span>and other programs running on your computer.</span></p>

            Open the TaskManager and go to the performance tab and there you can find a link to the resource monitor. The resource monitor is an advanced Task Manager.<br />

    <title>Scans freeze at sysWOW64&#92;mode.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cammac725  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scans freeze at sysWOW64&#92;mode.com</h2>
                    I'm using Vista 64-bit OS. The system will freeze up regularly. When I run Windows Defender scan, it freezes at C:\windows\sysWOW64\mode.com. Malwarebytes scan freezes at the same file. So does McAfee scan. Sometimes the scans freeze at syswow64\modemui.dll.
 What are these files? any idea what is going on? Any help would be very appreciated.

            Hi cammac725,<br />
<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Vista answers Forum!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
WoW64 (Windows-on-Windows 64-bit) is a subsystem of the Windows operating system that is capable of running 32-bit applications and is included on all 64-bit versions of Windows — including Windows 2000 Limited Edition, Windows XP Professional x64 Edition,
 IA-64 and x64 versions of Windows Server 2003, 64-bit versions of Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, as well as 64 bit editions of Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. WoW64 is designed to take care of all the differences between 32-bit Windows and 64-bit
 Windows, particularly involving structural changes to Windows itself.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The WoW64 subsystem is a lightweight translation layer that has similar interfaces on all 64-bit versions of Windows. Its primary purpose is to create a 32-bit environment that provides the interfaces required to allow 32-bit Windows applications to run unmodified
 in the 64-bit system. Technically, WOW64 is implemented using three dynamic-link libraries (DLLs): Wow64.dll, which is the core interface to the Windows NT kernel that translates between 32-bit and 64-bit calls, including pointer and call stack manipulations;
 Wow64win.dll, which provides the appropriate entry points for 32-bit applications; and Wow64cpu.dll, which takes care of switching the processor from 32-bit to 64-bit mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
You may want to perform the following to resolve the issue :<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Sfc(System File Checker)scan :</span></strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
The System File Checker tool<br />
<br />
To determine whether the issue that you are experiencing is caused by one or more system files that are used by Windows Vista, run the System File Checker tool. The System File Checker tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files
 by using the correct versions. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps: </strong><br />
<strong><br />
</strong>1) Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then type <strong>cmd</strong> in the Start Search box.<br />
<br />
2) Right-click <strong>cmd</strong> in the <strong>Programs</strong> list, and then click
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
3) If you are prompted for an <strong>administrator password </strong>or confirmation, type your password or click
<strong>Continue</strong><br />
<br />
4) At the <strong>command prompt</strong>, the following line, and then press <strong>
ENTER:</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>sfc /scannow</strong><br />
<br />
When the scan is complete, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved. If the issue that you are experiencing is not resolved, use the procedure that is described in the "<strong>The System Restore tool</strong>" section.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Does&nbsp;your anti-virus scan system files? If yes, try to not scan these items and see if you still&nbsp;have the same issue<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hope this information helped!<br />

    <title>Windows 8 &#58; Random BSoD-ing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blademaverick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 &#58; Random BSoD-ing</h2>
                    No idea why, my 6 month old laptop has been blue screen-ing on a random basis.<br />
<br />
System Specs :<br />
<br />
Manufacturer : ASUS<br />
Model : K55A-HI5014L<br />
Processor : Intel iCore i5-3210M @ 2.50 GHz<br />
Graphics : Intel HD Graphics 4000 (Embedded)<br />
RAM : 8 GB upgraded from 4GB<br />
OS : Windows 8<br />
<br />
RAM chips have both (two 4GB sticks) been tested on an identical computer system. Same manufacturer/model/specs. No issues under the same conditions. This has occurred in the past prior to the addition of the second 4GB stick, both of which have been swapped
 out for other sticks, tested, replaced the two primary sticks and continued on.<br />
<br />
All drivers are up to date according to the manufacturer.<br />
Intel HD Graphics 4000 (64 MB default) has been updated with generic drivers from Intel.com.<br />
^ Has been increased from 64 MB to 512 MB dedicated RAM using stock BIOS<br />
<br />
BIOS is up to date according to the manufacturer.<br />
<br />
Laptop sits atop of a laptop cooling pad - connected via external power - on a constant basis. Only time it is not on pad is when I am away from my desk, at a friend's, or traveling.<br />
<br />
Only peripherals in use is a Logitech wireless mouse (mini-dongle is not removed unless being stored in bag, in which is stored inside of the mouse itself), Samsung Galaxy S II SGH-T989 and OEM micro USB cable, and Microsoft brand Wired Xbox 360 controller.
 Headset I use draws power from a spare USB slot on laptop, and has separate mic/headphone 3.5mm jacks. Have tested with USB power being drawn from external and from spare slot. No difference in when BSoD happens.<br />
<br />
CPU Fan only turns on and starts "working hard" when playing graphic-extensive games. Web browsing, chatting on Skype, watching videos (Youtube/Twitch.tv/whatever), the system remains cool - even while not using the cooling pad - for an extended period of time
 (5 hours on and off battery)<br />
<br />
Power Plan is set to Power4Gear High Performance while plugged into an external source, and P4G Power Saver while on battery.<br />
<br />
Not really sure what more to say, my laptop just suddenly BSoDs out of no where. There's been times when I'm watching youtube videos or casual browsing for hours on end with Firefox and all of a sudden - BSoD. Several other times I've been in the middle of
 a game (Dead Space 3, Prototype 2, Team Fortress 2, to name a select few) and a skype call with a friend when all of a sudden - yeah.<br />
^Firefox is up to date, and to my knowledge - Flash is also up to date. I do not use Internet Explorer, nor Chrome.<br />
<br />
Temperature wise the underside of the computer is ice cold thanks to the cooling pad, and the CPU fan isn't overworking.
<br />
<br />
I even leave my computer on in the middle of the night to let it update Windows as needed with the periodic BSoD - just out of no where. (Waking up to the lovely sound of BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR isn't exactly an alarm clock I want to hear before it restarts itself
 at 03:45 in the morning). Mind - I keep my laptop on in the middle of the night - sitting atop of the laptop cooling pad - regardless in case someone needs to get a hold of me through Skype, as I can hear the tone in my sleep.<br />
<br />
Around the 5th of this month (August) I have tried reformatting (Not with Win8's Refresh) with ASUS' recovery partition, but unfortunately this continues, as it has happened 8 times in the past month. I do have the 8 minidumps available if requested.<br />
<br />
I have tried using a spare copy of Windows 7 Ultimate in the past on the same computer via multi-boot and have had no issues with BSoD for a full month until I switched back to Windows 8.<br />
<br />
To my knowledge Windows 8 is up to date from auto-updates, and most of the optional updates are installed sans Bing Bar and Bing Desktop. Along with that, Malwarebytes reports nothing wrong with a full and fast scan.<br />
<br />
Probably a bit too much info needed, but may as well get the details worked out. Got this laptop in February as a replacement laptop for my previous one. Performs well. Only stickler is Windows 8 Blue Screening out of no where.<br />
<br />
Not really sure what else to say. Really would like to have an answer besides to reinstall Windows 7, which right now looks to be the only other choice.<br />
<br />
Edit : <br />
<br />
Forgot to mention : Recent BSoDs have been SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED, along with a select few others that I cannot recall of the top of my head.<br />
<br />
Along with the recent BSoD that I captured, was a rather long list of errors of programs (Bing/Weather/Photos/Zune Music/Zune Video/Xbox Live Games, etc) - Programs I don't even USE - along with a Kernel-Power (41) (63).<br />

                    <p>&nbsp; print files will not print to my Dell Photo AIO 966 printer. Following troubloshooting instructions I found in this forum to "delete the

<p>&nbsp; found my driver there. When I click on the printer, the display window says the device is working properly.
<strong>But,&nbsp; in the details tab under</strong></p>

<h2>            How to install a device for a Jabra Classic v0.5.0 headset on my Windows 7 Home Premium&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a Jabra Classic v0.5.0 Bluetooth Headset and tried installing it on my Windows 7 64bit Home Premium and it comes up not able to find drivers for it. Where can i find the drivers for it?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a <span>waste of time contacting </span>Jabra support team, as they just answered "<span><span>&nbsp;</span>If your computer will require any kind of driver it will pop up a warning message letting you know
 this information. For that matter you should contact your PC manufacturer directly". (Thank you for nothing, guys)</span></p>
<p><span>Can anyone help me?</span></p>

            <p>I don't think it matters what your Windows operating system version is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What matters if the make and model of the computer you are using and if it supports Bluetooth connectivity so you need to tell us the make and model of your computer and if it is a Dell computer the Service Tag number (so we can look up the specs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your computer of unspecified make and model have Bluetooth capability built in or are you using some kind of Bluetooth adapter?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you ever been able to connect/pair any Bluetooth device with your computer of unspecified make and model?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the problem confined to just your computer of unspecified make and model?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To verify the Jabra device Bluetooth is working properly is it able to be detected and connect to any other Bluetooth capable device (iPhone, etc.)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tell us what "comes up with not able to find drivers for it" means exactly.</p>
<p>If you are getting an error message exactly what does it say?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Jabra support FAQ has a section describing how to connect to a computer with Bluetooth capability:</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are unable to use Night Light feature after updating the computer to 1903 build. I would
 like to inform you that, we are aware of this issue and working on it to resolve it as soon as possible.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, we have a workaround for this, and the workaround is to restart the PC. I would also suggest you to keep your PC updated by using Windows
 Update to make sure you receive all the latest updates and fixes. <span>
&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<p>Logging off and back on will enable Night Light again, and is faster than restarting the machine.

<h2>            Account still Permanently Suspended.</h2>
                    
<p>My account was recently under an Unauthorized Access Case Investigation because my account that was permanently suspended. I gave Xbox multiple examples on how my account has been hacked, and my credit card has been spent. (not by me.) My account was hacked,
 and someone Changed my Avatar's skin all green and I couldn't change it. My Gamer Zone was labeled "Cheater" and my 24,000 achievements were gone. And every time I tried to earn and achievement back, it wouldn't. To prove my account had been hacked, we even
 have an investigation going to find out who is spending our money. (from different states). I have more than enough evidence to prove my account was hacked, and modded, and I couldn't do anything about it. I called Xbox repeatedly asking for help on how to
 change my Avatar back to normal, but they said they couldn't do anything. Three days later my account was permanently suspended for reasons I had no control over. Now I just found out that the investigation is over because they couldn't find signs that my
 account was hacked, which is obviously not true, otherwise I wouldn't have lost money, and would still have my account. I don't care about getting my account back, but I do care about getting the games and game add-ons a downloaded from Games On Demand from
 the Dashbord. I told that to Xbox, so they transferred me to Licensing to transfer my games to my new account, then once they learned about my account being falsely suspended, they escalated the investigation to an Unauthorized Access Case, and now I'm back
 to where I started. All I want are my games. I did nothing wrong. I have proof that I was hacked, and my account was modded, I had no control over anything, and yet I was still Banned. I know there is a way for me to get my games back, so help me get them,
 because I did nothing wrong.</p>

<p>Sorry to say that the only two places that can provide you more information on your problem is this board of the forum
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/41.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums.xbox.com/.../41.aspx</a> but they are likely to tell you to contact your local support line
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/pages/call-us.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/pages/call-us.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not to doubt your story that remember that Microsoft can tell on what consoles your account has been used on, so only the whole truth has any chance of getting your account back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully I am just a sceptical so and so and you will soon be able to resume gaming with your account.</p>

            Hi S1N1STERSHADOWS ,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />This driver is for providing wireless capability i.e. wifi to your computer. 
<br />
<br />If you need this, you can download it from computer manufacturer's website
<br />Go to the website of the driver's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if this driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that and install.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>When you go into your network settings does it say you are on a strict NAT?&nbsp; You mention changing ISPs recently.&nbsp; Did this all start when that change had taken place.&nbsp; It would seem odd, but i wonder if some port is being blocked causing those notifications
 not to come accross.&nbsp; SInce it is accross all accoutns, it is either a console setting, or something to do with your network&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Elite Hybrid Drive, will flash memory only apply to the internal hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello! A first post and not so experienced looking to hear other opinions. With the Xbox one elite console, they are excited about the flash memory partition of the internal hard drive. Saying with the frequent files saved&nbsp;of both start up files as well
 as the games you are playing more often to give a small decrease of waiting time. In my case I am planning on getting an external hard drive with the 360 emulator coming out, I'm nearly maxed out now. My question lies to if you think the games that are on
 the internal drive will be the only games to receive a place in the separate partition for the quick start up. If so, kind of burns the excitement of having a boosted system with an&nbsp;external hard drive for my games.&nbsp;I will still enjoy the boost, just have
 to prioritize what games to keep on the system itself.&nbsp;Any reply of thoughts or experiences would be appreciated.</p>

<p>umm don't quote me on this but you may find they use for the most part the solid state partition mainly for the Xbox Ones O/S and Apps to help keep the Dash Board snappy, the thing with SSD is they have a limited Read/Wright life time. and use the Hard Disk
 for main storage and game cache, although saying that there is no reason they wont use the SSD part for game cache, but not sure how this will effect the life time of the SSD part ..
</p>
<p>I think my ssd is rated for around 20TB worth of read/wright's its 6 months old and done 2TB so quite heavy use will wear it quicker.</p>

<p>just add my thoughts after using SSD's for a while.</p>
<p>I would not want anything to do with any SSD parts being internal to my Xbox One, its probs because I have had 3 SSD fail in the past with PC's</p>
<p>1 failed after 1 hours use (stopped being detected by motherboard) 2nd replacement failed 2 after weeks use (stopped being detected by mother board)</p>
<p>3rd lasted about 3-4 month's use, the forth has lasted about 1.5 years and my lastest which is a Samsung evo 840 had been trouble free for 6 months, but the computer started acting weird so I stop using that now (yes it has all it latest firmware updates)</p>
<p>so gone back to normal HDD and the pc (albeit a lot slower after being used to SSD drives) has been 100% reliable and strange random issues are all gone.</p>
<p>Me I'm happy to wait a little longer for load times, rather than all the issues that can arise after sometime using SSD's</p>
<p>I'm not saying anyone else will have these issues so don't let this put you off SSD's, it's just I have and I don't fully trust them long term like I do HDD's ... I have never really had an issue with an HDD so that's my pref.</p>

<h2>            Win 10 Update stuck in continuously repeating reboot at 30&#37; complete</h2>
                    <p>PC starts hard boot, then a blue screen with Update 30% complete message flashes on the screen and then instantly it repeats the hard boot screen and so on..&nbsp; I am pretty sure it was doing the creator update. Its not going into automatic repair mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pc has an SSD and a hard drive. Both with Win 10. The SSD is the one with the problem. I can boot from the hard drive and the SSD was visible. I did run scan on the SSD and it reported no errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Its going to be tedious (if its possible at all) to find a way to boot into safe mode. Is there a simple solution to the broken update if I am able to get it into safe mode ?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Any suggestions ? Worst comes to worst I guess I could clone the hard disk to the ssd.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Wake from hibernate problem</h2>
                    <p>Since the late May updates, my SP4 wake from sleep problems seem to be pretty much fixed (failures are rare), but now I have a wake from hibernate problem - when I press the power button to wake from hibernate, nothing happens for a few seconds, then the
 red camera light comes on for a few seconds, then it goes off again. The screen remains dark with nothing displayed, there's no touch keyboard backlight, and the machine is unresponsive. I have to power-cycle to get it back, losing everything that hibernated.
 It doesn't happen every time, but it does seem to occur more after a long (overnight or longer) hibernation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else see this problem?</p>

            <p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/29c18b2c-4798-46a7-a35d-0b8780251ee1" title="dlorde">
dlorde,</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the Surface community. Sorry to hear you are having issues waking from Hibernate. Have you tried any troubleshooting so far? What are you current power plan settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards</p>

            <p>I've run the power troubleshooter which found no problems. I've also run <strong>
sfc /scannow</strong>, which also found no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as power settings go, I have it set to hibernate after 'closing the lid' and to sleep after a set timeout and when the power button is pressed. I don't have a problem with the sleep settings or function, only when waking from hibernate (i.e. after
 I've closed the lid).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bearing in mind that when hibernating the system is powered off, what power settings do you think might be relevant to this failure on waking from hibernate?&nbsp;</p>

<p>That's an excellent question. There are several ways to turn off apps running in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em>best</em> way is to open the app's settings (sometimes called Options or Preferences) and look for the setting that prevents the app from starting automatically with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em>next best</em> way is to contact the app's developer and ask how to prevent the app from running in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These two methods are best because you have (or will have) a solution that is supported by the developer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next two solutions are effective, but they interfere with the normal functioning of the app, which is something you want to avoid if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Autoruns</a> or a similar program to prevent the app from starting with Windows by editing the Windows registry. Let Autoruns edit the registry - don't try to do it yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, you can use Task Manager [CTRL+ESC+DEL] to&nbsp;<em>End task</em> the app, which will stop it from running in the background, but it will start again the next time you restart your computer. Moreover, killing an app that's running can sometimes have
 unpredictable results, and not always good unpredictable results. </p>
<p>
</p><p><em>End tasking</em> is best applied when you come up against one of the many scams on the internet claiming that your computer is infected or your license has expired. Just
<em>End task</em> your web browser.</p>

<p>When you are logged in after a couple minutes and nothing open or running by you, go to task manager and see what your processor usage is. If it is about low 2% (High end system) to about 20% (cheap PC) then you are probably good. task manager also runs
 up system processor usage while open to view, so deduct that from total CPU usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And maybe your memory usage if you only have like 2GB and most is used at idle and nothing by you running. But you do have a page file (Virtual memory) that runs a lot of system memory processes.</p>

            <p>BSV is "okay" for a quick look at a crash dump file but can often implicate core Windows files as the cause of the crash when core Windows files are hardly ever the real cause.&nbsp; BSV does the best it can but sometimes is misleading.&nbsp; In the BSV documentation
 they even say:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>BlueScreenView tries to locate the right driver or module that caused the blue screen by looking inside the crash stack.&nbsp; However, be aware that the driver detection mechanism is not 100% accurate, and you should also look in the lower pane, that display
 all drivers/modules found in the stack.</em></p>

</p><p>If BSV implicates Windows files (and even if it doesn't) it is best to use the Windows debugging tools to get a more accurate picture of what is going on.&nbsp; Sometimes you will need to provide a few crash dump files and look for a pattern of failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, the culprit seems to be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably caused by : hardware ( <strong>nvlddmkm</strong>+1bb1f8 )</p>
<p>
</p><p>The nvlddmkm.sys file belongs to NVIDIA and that makes it part of the video system on your ASUS M5A97 motherboard which is curious since ASUS says your motherboard has an AMD chipset or maybe you have a separate NVIDIA card installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you reinstalled Windows, it is always a good idea to visit the hardware manufacturers WWW site to get their latest hardware drivers (audio, video, network) since the ones that come on the Windows installation CD are probably not current.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both NVIDIA and AMD have online scanners that will look at your system and suggest the best drivers for it so it would behoove you to visit their sites and let their online scanners take a look at your system and if they suggest a new video driver, consider
 installing it.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If you can make your system crash anytime you want (say by playing a game) that is good so that after you update your drivers you can see if you can make it crash again (or not) under those conditions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Crashing during gaming are common when there are outdated video drivers installed so that would be the first place to start.&nbsp; Being able to reproduce it is also good so you will be able to tell when it is "fixed" if the problem goes away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also take a look at your system information and see what video system and drivers you have installed now (and write it down) and then after an update, check it again to be sure the driver really did get updated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example you might see something like this for NVIDIA:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Name&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NVIDIA GeForce 6150SE nForce 430<br />
PNP Device ID&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;PCI\VEN_10DE&amp;DEV_03D0&amp;SUBSYS_73091462&amp;REV_A2\3&amp;267A616A&amp;0&amp;68<br />
Adapter Type&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;GeForce 6150SE nForce 430, NVIDIA compatible<br />
Adapter Description&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;NVIDIA GeForce 6150SE nForce 430<br />
Adapter RAM&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;64.00 MB (67,108,864 bytes)<br />
Installed Drivers&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;nvd3dum.dll<br />
<strong>Driver Version&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9.18.13.783</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>or maybe something like this for AMD/ATI:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Name&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;AMD Radeon HD 6450<br />
PNP Device ID&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;PCI\VEN_1002&amp;DEV_6779&amp;SUBSYS_80901462&amp;REV_00\4&amp;468E095&amp;0&amp;0048<br />
Adapter Type&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;AMD Radeon Graphics Processor (0x6779), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. compatible<br />
Adapter Description&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;AMD Radeon HD 6450<br />
Adapter RAM&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(2,147,483,648) bytes<br />
Installed Drivers&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;aticfx32.dll,aticfx32.dll,aticfx32.dll,atiumdag.dll,atidxx32.dll,atiumdva.cap<br />
<strong>Driver Version&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;14.100.0.0</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not sure, you can provide more information about your system like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start orb (bottom left of the Taskbar)and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<strong>msinfo32</strong><br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After checking drivers if the system is still crashing, send the msinfo32 information (before and after) and additional crash dump files.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Check if the microphone is listed on the audio settings on the Skype application.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Try to do a test call on Echo test to check on the issue if you cannot hear you’re recording. Make sure that auto-adjust is unchecked and on high
 volume for microphone sound settings on Skype.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Check on the sound settings of the device and Skype app – possible that the microphone is on muted or on low volume.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Uninstall and Reinstall Skype application with the latest version.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Make sure that the software drivers on your audio device is up-to-date.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. Delete the shared.xml and config.xml on the Skype folder.</span></span></p>

To resolve the issue on how you can enable word wrap in Wordpad, you may follow the steps and see the screenshot below:<br />
<br />
1. Open Wordpad and click View.<br />
2. Make sure that there's a mark on the ruler in order for it to show up in Wordpad.<br />
3. Click Wordpad to see the dropdown.<br />
4. Then, select wrap to ruler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

I had this happen once before-out of the blue it started doing this and out<br />

I guess windows 10 is unstable or there is something in wordpad they need<br />

<h2>            Surface 3 &#91;Window 10&#93; Micro SD Card issues &#91;STILL...Alternate Driver Recommendation&#63;&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Afternoon, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The micro SD card recognition issue is still very present in my Surface 3.&nbsp; I have spent months reading suggestions, and attempting different fixes with no luck.&nbsp; Most recently the card will show after a re-start, and then disappear as I use the machine,
 sometimes not returning even after a re-start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on?&nbsp; This has been a known issue on ASK MICROSOFT since the release of Windows 10 on all Surface models.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of an alternative driver [maybe the Rioch?] that I could install that has better performance?&nbsp; It's pretty obvious that MS has absolutely no interest in correcting, or supporting this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has a better suggestion, please let me know and a please give a quick tutorial on swapping drivers.&nbsp; Whenever I have attempted&nbsp; a swap in the past the OS gives me guff.&nbsp; I would be thrilled to use the MS driver, if it actually worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All firmware updates have been installed including 2/4/2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>
<p>Craig M.</p>

            <p>Craig,</p>
<p>I've had issues with microSD cards as well. NO 128GB cards work for me. I finally got a "good" Sandisk 64GB one that performs as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've escalated the issue in general at least 4 times. The last time I asked about a fix for this and when it would happen, the answer I got was "when it's ready". So basically I'm not expecting a fix at all. Sorry.

            <p>Thanks for reaching out Barb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more I've been reading the more I am starting to see that it may be my 128GB card that is causing the hiccups.&nbsp; I did buy a "brand" name model, but maybe that doesn't matter so much.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll take your advice and grab a Sandisk 64GB and see how it goes.&nbsp; I hope they eventually get everything together for the 128s down the line, but I'll take what I can get for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>
<p>Craig M.</p>

            <p>I know this isn't helpful but I had the same problem. The first card I tried was a Samsung Evo+ 128gb. The second card was a 1 year old Sandisk Ultra 128 and it works fine. Before I found that fix I had posted here and Barb was very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately, the problem &nbsp;was routed to a MS engineer and we spoke by phone. However, the problem for the Samsung card was never resolved. What was troubling about the experience was how poor the customer service was. He could never seem to get it in his
 head that I have an S3 Wifi. So he tried to get me to install a firmware package for the S3 LTE and later a complete install of an OS package for the SP3. It went back and forth like that and didn't instill any confidence. The correct firmware package failed
 to install and crashed the Surface in the process. Given my experience I chose to not install the build that he had me download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In November 2013 I had to replace a Win 7 laptop with a Dell 8.1 and then in Nov 2014 I bought the Surface Win10. Both the 8.1 and 10 units have been far more problematic than the 7 requiring many restarts and forced shutdowns. I have been a PC enthusiast
 for over two decades, but the experience with these two units have soured me on the experience. I spend far too many hours just trying to keep them functioning properly and/or maintaining them. I don't know what the problem is but I would love an opportunity
 to find something that will do what I need and is reliable and mostly trouble free.</p>
