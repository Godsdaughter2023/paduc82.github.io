    <title>Windows 10 restarts after putting to sleep&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomps52  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 restarts after putting to sleep&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi, I am having a problem with windows 10 (the latest update) restarting after I put my pc to sleep. I will put it to sleep, then later on or
 the next day when I go to wake it, it is already awake and I need to login because it has restarted! I have done a SFC and nothing is wrong there. I don’t have any other problems with it but this is just annoying.
</span></p>

<p><span>I do really like windows 10! I upgraded from win 7. I have a fairly nice computer so I don’t think it is hardware related.
</span></p>

<p><span>Another question I have is: there is a Bluetooth highlighted icon in the settings on the task bar and as far as I know I don’t have that on
 this pc, and there is no way to shut it off that I can see. (Nothing big just wanted to ask)</span></p>

<p><span>Thank you for any help.</span></p>

<p><span>RJ</span></p>

    <title>Rubbish Support from Microsoft re Tweaking.com - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geebee8ch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rubbish Support from Microsoft re Tweaking.com</h2>
                    Unable to install all windows 7 updates I contacted MS Support. After 7 hours live chat they gave up but escalated the issue to level 2. They organised a callback at 8 pm the following day. At 1:30 am they called back. Again they connected remotely to
 my PC but kept me on the phone for 2.75 hour while they ran a program called 'Tweaking.com'. At 4:15 am this had reached 21/47 Repair Jobs. Advisor said he would call me again at 8 am and leave the program running. He did not call back, the program is still
 where it was the night before 21/47. I was told that if I stopped the program while it was running it would damage my PC. Now I have been left in the lurch thanks to MS Support. Today I am unable to connect to on-line chat because they are too busy. Can anyone
 suggest what I should now do ?

            <p>I suspect that the people you spoke to were masquerading as Microsoft. The research I have done would indicate that tweaking.com is nothing to do with Microsoft. Plus, your description of the support that you have received does not ring true with me about
 being supplied by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were you I would consider removing this program, using system restore if necessary, and then&nbsp;running a full scan with your chosen malware protection software(s).&nbsp;In addition you might want to also scan with these well respected freebies</p>
<p>Malwarebytes Antimalware (MBAM)</p>
<p>Super Antispyware (SAS)</p>
<p>Do not take trial versions of the full product which you will later have to pay for, just download and install the free versions. I think MBAM prompts you at install time now as to whether you want the trial or free version.</p>

            Many thanks for the advice - I'll get on with the checks. As regards the possible bogus support this all came from MS Support/Chat line. How can I check who is real and who isn't anymore ? What should I ask for as proof of MS ID ?

            Were you contacted by them as an unsolicited call? If so, it was&nbsp;not Microsoft. Microsoft do not do that. If you contacted them, where did you get the number from? Or if it was an on-line chat, what was the url (web address)?

            <p>The live chat was I believe with MS Support. Their url is:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answerdesk.support.microsoft.com/?tenantid=1b4004d8-9048-426b-ad82-94c6ebbb9c76&amp;subscriberid=bd7b8079-19a8-4add-adab-bb1285d36e06&amp;language=en&amp;country=us&amp;locale=en-us&amp;subjects=4&amp;tier=1&amp;channel=chat&amp;selectionmethod=2&amp;numberofagents=6&amp;sessionid=37aa83e2-5764-4bfa-a5c4-6c854425bf0e&amp;id=985157165619874&amp;psrc=ms_smc&amp;entryid=getsupport&amp;prodcat=Windows+7&amp;topic=&amp;subtopic=100100773&amp;stts=otw%7cnopid&amp;entitlementdataexists=True&amp;skuid=1&amp;partnerguid=bd7b8079-19a8-4add-adab-bb1285d36e06&amp;partnerid=getsupport&amp;lndpgvidguid=37aa83e2-5764-4bfa-a5c4-6c854425bf0e&amp;checkedsr=1&amp;productkey=awasachat</p>
<p>
</p><p>They had remote of my PC but could not fix the issue. However, they did constantly ask me to pay for Premium MS Support £65 for a one off fix and £100 for a years cover - I paid them nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These people must have passed my contact details on to the next crowd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I did not ask the question on the Community page was that I tried that with a printer driver issue but was unable to solve that either. I thought this was a MS issue so they should solve it.</p>

            <p>When I tried to get a Microsoft chat by their website I ended up at a url that started</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.awasa.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.awasa.microsoft.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>i.e. not <a href="https://answerdesk.support.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://answerdesk.support.microsoft.com</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you get to your url by starting out at microsoft.com or by clicking a search engine link?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the face of it, if you browse to it,&nbsp;your url looks like a legit Microsoft site but</p>
<p>1. It could be a skillful fake</p>
<p>2. It does not start with the same root as the site that I eventually arrived at</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the info you have given, I am not really in a position to state whether you contacted a legit Microsoft service or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not ring true with me that Microsoft support personel would&nbsp;resort to 3rd party "repair" software. However, I might be wrong. It might be that this is a subcontracted service where the techies are free to use whatever tools they feel are necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe someone else will be able to advise further? Maybe one of the other contributors to this thead?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everyone needs to be aware that there are numerous scams out there perpetrated by people pretending to be Microsoft (and Microsoft are by no means unique in being falsely represented either). Some are telephonic and some internet based. Probably some are
 snail-mail based too, though I haven't come across that myself.</p>

<p>I have looked at that thread and LemP's advice looks good. However, I also note that you have not given any feedback to his most recent reply</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/printer-driver-not-installed/e16d910f-bbe4-4a6b-9fbc-a0183f5f81a8?page=2#LastReply">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/printer-driver-not-installed/e16d910f-bbe4-4a6b-9fbc-a0183f5f81a8?page=2#LastReply</a></p>
<p>where he suggests setting up a new administrative account and trying to install through that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW I share <span>
his scepticism </span>that MS chat will be able to solve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to&nbsp;engage in&nbsp;a bit of research into your printer problem. If I have any suggestions I will post them in that thread rather than this one, but I would not recommend holding your breath whilst waiting for a reply from me (sorry).</p>

<p>Ok folks, with Gamescom kicking off on Tuesday I figured we could have a little fun making predictions. I made a list of various things that may or not happen. Make your choices before the EA press conference that's 7am pst, 9am EST and 2pm BST on Tuesday.
 Winner gets the glory knowing they got more lucky guesses than everyone else :P (I'll post a blank version of the questions without the scoring for you to copy and paste at the end)</p>

<h2>            Moving contents of old PC to new PC</h2>
                    What is easiest and cleanest way to migrate all contents from my old PC ( XP )&nbsp;to my new PC with Windows 8.1. Microsoft says it is making a download available from Laplink ( PCMover Express ). Will this downloaded software do the job if I connect the new
 PC to my router / FIOS network via a Ethernet cable and do the transfer from PC to PC via the network, or would it be more effective to use the Laplink USB cable by buying their software package?

            <p>It depends on what you mean by "all contents."</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, it's easy to move <strong>data files</strong> (e.g., documents, pictures, music, etc.) between machines, and if the machines are all connected to the same network, copying over the network is the best way to accomplish the move (it's always prudent
 to&nbsp; copy, check the new computer to see if all went well, and then delete from the old computer rather than to move, which automatically deletes the original files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some applications, such as Microsoft's Windows Easy Transfer, move "<strong>settings</strong>" as well as data.&nbsp; Mostly, this includes things like desktop customizations and similar personalizations; it may also include browser "favorites," music playlists,
 and so forth.&nbsp; These "settings" are really more data files, but they are located in more obscure places and the average user probably wouldn't know which files to move or where they should go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, you can't move <strong>programs</strong> (applications).&nbsp; These need to be reinstalled (<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">assuming that they are compatible with the new version of Windows</span></em>) using original installation media
 (CD, DVD, downloaded installer file).&nbsp; Laplink's PCMover, however, claims to be able to move programs.&nbsp; I've never used this product and I've seen mixed reviews.&nbsp; So, if you either don't have installation media for your programs or you don't want to go through
 the reinstallation process, read the reviews and decide if you want to take a chance on this program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to whether you should use the proprietary USB cable or your network, apparently PCMover will work with both.&nbsp; The main difference will be the speed of transfer, and that will depend on the type of network you have and the type of USB connection available.&nbsp;
 Typical home networks today have a theoretical max data rate of 100 Mbps.&nbsp; USB 2.0 has a theoretical max of 480 Mbps.&nbsp; Gigabit networks are faster and so are USB 3.0 connections (although my guess would be that the Laplink USB cable doesn't support USB 3.0).&nbsp;
 Here's what one 2010 review had to say on this topic:</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>With a USB2 external hard disk, we found it took around four hours to move 30GB of data, and over 100Mbits/sec Ethernet the same load took more than a day of solid copying. Your best bet is either a Gigabit LAN (if you have one) or the Laplink USB
 cable, either of which should in theory work out around twice as fast as an external drive.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm trying to connect my Lexmark x4690 printer/scanner to my new HP Laptop which runs Windows 8 but while I can print a test page (so it is connected to my network) I can't open the Lexmark Productivity Centre so I can use the scanning facility. It keeps
 popping up a message saying that I need to install Microsoft.net.framework.version 2.0 which I've tried to do but the message keeps returning. I'm not the most computer savvy guy around so if anyone has some simple advice on resolving this problem I'd be grateful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Ross, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like you to add few information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Have you installed latest driver for the printer for Windows 8 on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
As per the error message that you receive, it seems like you may have installed wrong driver package for the printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
You can refer to the link for reference on this issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://support.lexmark.com/index?page=content&amp;productCode=&amp;segment=SUPPORT&amp;userlocale=DE_DE&amp;id=SO5092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lexmark.com/index?page=content&amp;productCode=&amp;segment=SUPPORT&amp;userlocale=DE_DE&amp;id=SO5092</a>
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would suggest you to download and install the latest driver for the printer for Windows 8. If there is no driver available, you can download the latest available driver and install the driver in Windows compatibility mode.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can follow the methods:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can refer to the link to run Printer troubleshooter on the computer and check if it helps:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will suggest you to uninstall the current version of the driver installed for the printer and install the latest driver in Windows compatibility mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can refer to the link to download the latest available driver for the printer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br />
</p>
<p>You can select the operating system and then download the driver.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Uninstall the driver that is currently installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press <strong>Windows and x </strong>key together and select <strong>Device Manger</strong>.<br />
b) Locate the printer driver icon and right click on the icon.<br />
c) Select <strong>Uninstall </strong>and follow the onscreen instructions to uninstall the driver.</p>

<h2>            Continual blue screens and crashes &#40;Win 7 x64&#41;&#59; memory related&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been having BSODs for a while now and I've tried having a few components replaced but I'm still having BSODs and random restarts and frozen screens.
</p>
<p>Original BSOD strings were along the lines of</p>
<p>KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED 0x0000001e<br />
</p>
<p>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA 0x00000050<br />
</p>
<p>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION 0x0000003b<br />
</p>
<p>NO_MORE_IRP_STACK_LOCATIONS 0x00000035<br />
</p>
<p>MEMORY_MANAGEMENT 0x0000001a<br />
</p>
<p>BAD_POOL_CALLER 0x000000c2<br />
</p>
<p>IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL 0x0000000a<br />
</p>
<p>After these crashes I performed memtest on every configuration and received errors in every possible configuration.</p>
<p>Since those crashes (and a lot more) I've had the RAM, the HDD (I had some bad sectors one time), and the CPU replaced.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since the last replacement (CPU+RAM) it went fine for a week and then it gave me a BSOD again:</p>
<p>NO_MORE_IRP_STACK_LOCATIONS 0x00000035 (srv2.sys)<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then again a week later</p>
<p>SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED 0x1000007e (ntoskrnl.exe)<br />
</p>
<p>and then again</p>
<p>NTFS_FILE_SYSTEM 0x00000024 (Ntfs.sys)<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I did sfc /scannow and received no problems.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since those 3 BSODs I've had 1 freeze, no response from anything. After a forceful shutdown and boot it failed to POST. After trying to boot again it beeped once (as it normally does) then failed to get to the boot screen. After that it turned on as per
 usual.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After that freeze I've had one random restart with no BSOD. On reboot after freezing on windows recovery it worked fine.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/f2HQ4j0.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Computer specifications</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there a way to find out which hardware component is causing the problems? (If it is at all now hardware related) My guess would be something to do with the motherboard and the memory slots or something else on the motherboard that deals with the memory
 that is corrupting it and causing BSODs.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Could it be the PSU at all?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>Before reading this post I was on the computer and the screen froze and the computer began to emit a continuous non stopping beep tone until I had to forcefully turn off the computer.</p>

<p>When I booted it it worked fine, and I &nbsp;ran the command and ran the Fix it in the stated KB article.</p>

            <p>Hi Zigzag3143,</p>
<p>After performing the tasks in Gerry's post I started to comply with your post. I successfully downloaded, installed, and updated Malwarebytes and had started the scan when 7 minutes (and 5 seconds) in the screen froze. I don't know if it is of any relevance
 but the file it was scanning when it froze was upsecsvcdll.mui</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I then proceeded to reboot. On boot it froze on the "Loading Asus Express Gate" screen (before the screen that displays the motherboard graphic and before the screen that shows it's loading windows). On the next boot it didn't even reach the "Loading Asus
 Express Gate" page, it was stuck on a blinking underscore in the top left corner.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Third time was the charm, it booted as normal.</p>
<p>I decided to do the SFC /scannow test 3 times before trying the malwarebytes scan as I've done it successfully without freezing in the past. All 3 scans said "Windows Resource Protections did not find any integrity violations"</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I then proceeded to do the malwaybytes scan and it completed and found no malicious items.</p>

                    Window 7 &nbsp;is able to detect my external hard disk&nbsp;Under device and printers, it is able to detect the hard disk and there is no problem to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;but does not show my external hard disk icon under my computer so I cannot drag files in
<div><br />
How do I find that hard disk and put files in? </div>
<div><br />
Thank you</div>

            <p>ok follow the instructions;</p>
<ul>
<li>Click windows icon</li><li>Right click computer &gt; then click mange</li><li>left hand side under storage click disk management</li></ul>
<p>now the hard bit. you need to identify which one is your external hard disk. it should say something like disk 1 - online (if you have other removable things such as memory card readers maybe something like disk5). DO NOT TOUCH DISK 0 (c:) as that is your
 operating system and changing anything may/will kill the system.</p>
<p>It may not have a dirve letter allocated to the external disk so right click it and then left click&nbsp;change drive letter and paths.</p>
<p>Assign it a new letter maybe something like L: as that should clash with anything then ok the windows.... it should now appear.
</p>
<p>Again just to reiterate do not assign it c: or touch disk 0 ! you have been warned.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fanhow.com/knowhow:Assign_Hard_Drive_Letter_in_Windows_7_26243275" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here is a link with pretty pictures to help you a bit</a></p>
<p>The hardest part is finding which one is your harddisk. Good luck. if you worried then you could take a screen shot of the computer management and upload it to your skydrive. We could then advise you which one it is.</p>
<p>Hope that helps....</p>

            Hi Wynn, I absolutely understand your frustration with Windows Updates . . .
<br />
<br />Version 1709 is now no longer the new build of Windows 10 
<br />
<br />1803 is currently being released, your best option to bring your PC up to date is to install that version of Windows 10: 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO 
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading 
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet 
<br />
<br />Disable any 3rd party Antivirus you may be running 
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .       
        </p>

            Hi, 1709 is no longer the latest release. <br />Updating to Windows 10 1803, the latest feature update should resolve your issue.<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.<br /><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a><br />All steps, including upgrading using ISO file and Media creation tool, are covered here:<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2018/04/upgrade-windows-10-1803-using-these-options.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2018/04/upgrade...</a><br />Disclaimer: This is a non-Microsoft website.

            Thank you for that very useful information.&nbsp; I will take your suggestion (thanks to both of you!) and install the ISO next time I'm prompted.&nbsp; That hasn't happened yet tonight (which is very unusual).

<p>I ran the install off the MS website.&nbsp; It "updated" (something it never actually does when I am prompted to restart and do so), then restored the previous Windows version.&nbsp; BTW: Another PC running Windows 10 Pro is also on version 1709, but never bugs me
 to update.&nbsp; The problem one is running the Home version, which I understand should be called the "guinea pig" version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will get the ISO, burn a CD and see what happens.&nbsp; Never had to do that with the free Linux OS (in about 20 years of use).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing it now:&nbsp; Gotta' love Microsoft's presumptuous invitation: "Feel free to keep using your PC."&nbsp; Yes, that's right, it is my PC.&nbsp; MS doesn't really seem to believe that, based on the way they treat my PC.&nbsp; Windows is a service?</p>

<p>Windows just (actually) updated itself.&nbsp; That is I returned to my computer after preparing some marinated meat for dinner tomorrow, and it had rebooted itself and closed all of my apps.&nbsp; Firefox was reopened to a tiny (approx.) 200x300 px window near the
 top-left corner of display 1, as usual.&nbsp; Edge was opened nearly fullscreen (I don't use it).&nbsp; Pretty self-serving, MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't wait until I can get MS out of my life.&nbsp; Windows is <strong>NOT</strong> a service.&nbsp; It's a rent-seeking pain.</p>

<p>I finally ran the ISO setup, requiring about 40 minutes and trashing some stuff (nothing very important, thankfully), and thought I was good-to-go.&nbsp; But this evening when I went to the fridge to pour a glass of cold water, my machine rebooted without warning
 or permission.&nbsp; I returned within about two minutes to find that it was updating again.&nbsp; Then just now (about 6 hours later) I got a BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does my Linux server, which is made by volunteers and runs on an octa-core ARM (Samsung Exynos) processor and consumes about 20W including the attached 3TB HDD, never crash?&nbsp; Why do I never need to reboot it because of instability,
 and only about every 3 months for a kernel update?&nbsp; The nearly daily package updates (including those for security patches) don't require a reboot. It's free.&nbsp; They don't claim it's a service.&nbsp; It just works. Always.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is Windows the consumer OS of choice and Linux is still almost unknown?&nbsp; Marketing budget.</p>

            It just crashed again when I tried to install the update.&nbsp; I went to Settings | Update &amp; Security, it downloaded 1803 (yes, the one I installed from the ISO), then rebooted.&nbsp; While updating, at 65%, it crashed again, then rebooted and crashed for a different
 reason (BSODs).&nbsp; Again, Windows is a service?&nbsp; In fairness, my laptop (which runs the Pro version and doesn't install untested updates, but waits until they've been debugged by the Home version users) is stable.&nbsp; Not sure how fair it is to the Home version
 users to have them debug unstable software.&nbsp; Yes, I am- it's wrong.&nbsp; Home version users are a service.&nbsp; That's reality.<br />

<h2>            Error message &#34;Unsupported 16-bit Application&#34; when trying to print in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: <strong><span>splwow64.exe: "Unsupported 16-bit Application"?</span></strong></p>
<p>Whenever I attempt to print anything from my Windows 7 laptop, I get an error message with the tile of "Unsupported 16-Bit Application" which reads as-follows:</p>
<p>"The program or feature "\??\C:\Windows\splwow64.exe" cannot start or run due to&nbsp;incompatibility&nbsp;with 64-bit versions of Windows. Please contact the software vendor to ask if a 64-bit Windows compatible version is available."</p>
<p>I've navigated to splwow64.exe's location on my drive, and attempted to run it from there, and got this message:</p>
<p>"The version of this file is not compatible with the version of Windows you're running. Check your computer's system information to see whether you need an x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of the program, and then contact the software publisher."</p>
<p>I don't remember changing anything, and the computer gave me no trouble with this the last time I tried printing, about two weeks ago. How can I fix this?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1. On which application do you get this error message when trying to print(eg. Microsoft Word, Internet Explorer)?</p>
<p>2. What is the make and model number of your printer?</p>
<p>Check if there is anything unusual(Yellow bang)&nbsp;in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Device-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
device manager</a> (printer)</p>
<p>In the meantime, I'd suggest you follow these steps and check.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Run <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
printer troubleshooter</a> and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Uninstall and reinstall printer drivers</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel , clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate it, right click on it and select properties.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to driver tab and click on Uninstall button to uninstall the driver associated with the device.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Once the uninstall completes, restart your computer, it'l automatically detect and install it again, and install the new driver which you downloaded from the manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>I'd also suggest you perform <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
SFC scan</a> on your machine and check if it helps</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong></p>
<p>If possible, do a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
system restore</a> to the point it was working fine and check if that helps.</p>

<h3> vendiblebox510  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto created gamertag</h2>
                    
<p>Why is it that when I visit Xbox.com with an unassociated Microsoft Account &nbsp;a gamertag account was automatically generated? &nbsp;I just got done transferring a genuine gamertag off this account &nbsp;to a dummy Microsoft account as suggested &nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-NZ/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/manage-microsoft-account#f406f87ecf864e4fb4b19fd14ad9f23a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>,
 so that after the 30 day waiting period I may transfer my main gamertag to be associated with this Microsoft Account. &nbsp;How can this be deleted? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I already have a hole in my wall because I think I know what the answer is going to be. &nbsp;I just need someone to who knows to reply so that I may confirm and make a second hole.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>when you visit www.xbox.com with an unassociated Microsoft Account, a gamertag (xbox live account) will be generated because it is needed for the xbox.com website, you can adjust the avatar, view your gaming history and achievements etc on this site. So it basically needs the profile to exist.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>You can't delete the xbox profile that is now present on the Microsoft account, you will need to move that account to a different Microsoft account. </p>
<p>So download the profile on a console, wait 30 days, and move the profile to a different Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>So do the same thing again, that you did before, just don't visit xbox.com, use that microsoft on a windows phone or windows 8 pc, because that will generate a profile when non is present.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Sorry, but it's the only way to go</p>

    <title>windows 10 password management - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tarsk  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 password management</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a w10 pc(an upgrade from something)..not sure which version 7 or 8.1,,,,</p>
<p>for a few days all seemed well, but then the pc insisted i open/sign-up for a Microsoft account</p>
<p>the the heartache began, ,i had been in the process of linking my w7 machine to share files/printer</p>
<p>now instead of my simple 4 character password it insists i use the microsoft id/password(much longer).&nbsp;&nbsp; that wouldnt be a killer but i have always made it a point of not storing financial accounts/passwords on the pc,,,they must be hand typed in every time.</p>
<p>alarm when i went to log in to one of them it not only didnt ask for a user name it didnt ask for a password,,,It just opened the account,,i have spent hours trying to find where microsoft has the stored so i can remove and get some of my security,,now i
 prefer firefox as a browser and have always manages site passwords there,,but it isnt listed the,,I tried edge but it is so incomprehensible that i couldnt find the password list. i tried the windows button+R and looked for the suggested userpassword..2&nbsp;&nbsp;
 .but &nbsp; the firle was not found,,tried userpasswoord..1 and userpassword.. blank </p>
<p>even did a complete drive c search for all 3 variants and never found the filed</p>
<p>did a control panel searches for password related and never found a password list</p>
<p>at this point i am not sure that burning the w10 pc will stop this security breach cause for all i know microsoft&nbsp; has this info in the cloud even though i i have never turned one-drive on</p>
<p>any ideas?&nbsp; my simple security method has worked for decades and is now compromised</p>
<p>

<p>Go to 'Settings' &gt; 'Accounts'&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; select : 'Sign in options'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; there you can create a four digit password {Pin}.</p>

<p>Those were nothing to do with Win 7 or 8.1...the picture I posted is Windows 10.</p>
<p>What happens when you try to create a four digit pin....is it greyed out or something?.</p>
<p>You said you bought this computer with Windows 10 ....what makes you think it was upgrade from 7 or 8?...makes no sence...You
<em>can not</em> take owner ship from someone elses upgrade ....you need your own Microsoft account.</p>
<p>Seems your issue started when you were asked for your Microsoft account yes?</p>
<p>and now it will not accept it&nbsp;&nbsp; correct?.</p>
<p>If the pc was an 'Upgrade from 7 or 8.1...I may not be understanding everything here...but it may be that now your system can be considered a pirated system.</p>
<p>Is it 'Activated?</p>
<p>Did you buy the pc new or used?</p>

            <p>used,,,from some one i got a w7 pc that has been running fine for some months,,,just to slow,,so so gt this one from same person,,amd x64 2.5ghz 3gig ram,,gigabyte mb</p>
<p>originally system would boot in&nbsp; under 10 seconds, no password</p>
<p>i added my simple 4 character password,,and all was well for a week,, it also came with ms office 2007 pro,,and edge,,was told it was the free w10 upgrade,,i think from w7</p>
<p>i started adding convenient programs/tools from terabyte storage drives.</p>
<p>after a while i started having trouble accessing the folders i had added,,constantly getting permission errors,,,to folders i had made.so i started fooling with user permissions and ownership,,but to no good results with access ..my son is better at pc's
 than me so when he came over he suggested&nbsp; a w10 reinstall ,,it took several hours and supposedly left a clean install ,,however i was very pissed hen i found i had lost all the installed&nbsp; progys including office 2007,,so i signed up for a microsoft account
 so i could get help(still had access probs) after that my 4 character password would no longer work and had to use the MUCH longer ms password everytime i reboot ,,also so many other problems have come up i am thinking of scrappng the pc</p>

            <p>Hi...as I suspected...a used computer that was upgraded to Windows 10....you/they can't do that ...it makes your windows a pirated&nbsp; version now.</p>
<p>But if you did a clean install {of which version} and <em>was </em>it <em>done

<p>If you lost programs that's too bad because everyone should know when you do a 'Clean

<h2>            How do I change the language in Windows 7 Starter to English&#63;</h2>
                    <p><i>INSTALLED WINDOWS 7 STARTER EDITION WITH GREEK AS INTERFACE LANGUAGE. &nbsp;HOW CAN I CHANGE TO ENGLISH?</i></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I bought a Sony Vaio netbook, and during the initial installation of windows 7 starter edition,&nbsp;I chose the greek language.&nbsp; What I need though is only the greek keyboard, not the greek
</p>
<p>interface, which is unintelligible most of the time.&nbsp; How can I change the interface language to English?&nbsp; If I have to reinstall Windows, where are they anyway?&nbsp; I did not get an installation disk.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Most likely your computer came with a recovery partition. You could reboot into the recovery environment and reattempt the installation.</p>
<p>Start your computer and repeatedly press the F10 key, this will boot into the recovery environment. Follow the onscreen instructions to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>If this does not resolve the problem, you will need to do an upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate then download the appropriate English Language Pack from Windows Update.
</p>
<p>You will first need to do an Anytime Upgrade from Home Premium to Ultimate in German then you can download the English Language Pack through Windows Update.
</p>
<p>To get additional MUIs by using Windows Update</p>
<p>MUIs are available through Windows Update as optional updates. They aren't installed automatically.</p>
<p>Click to type: Windows Update.</p>
<p>Hit Enter</p>
<p>In the left pane, click Check for updates, and then wait while Windows looks for the latest updates for your computer.</p>
<p>If any updates are found, click Select optional updates.</p>
<p>Select the MUI that you want, and then click OK.</p>
<p>Click Install updates. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.

            <p>You would have to request a set of English recovery disks from Sony - for a modest fee.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the language choice is a one-time thing and cannot be undone without the disks.</p>
<p>Go to the Sony website, and select your locality (<a href="http://www.sony.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.sony.com</a>) then select Support and follow your nose from there.</p>

<h2>            Audio Speed</h2>
                    I have an HP Laptop. I have had it for about 10 months. When I play videos on youtube, Netflix, or anything else, my computer starts to play the audio at half the speed. I have no clue what is going on. The speed of the video also slows down but not as
 much as the audio. I normally just close everything I have open and close my laptop. Then, after&nbsp;a while, it is fine until it happens again. This happens a lot. Sometimes I go weeks without it happening. If I keep working on my computer after this happens
 without closing anything, my computer takes forever to load anything.&nbsp;The majority of the time, I watch videos with headphones, and after this happens, if I take them out no audio comes out at all. Please help.
