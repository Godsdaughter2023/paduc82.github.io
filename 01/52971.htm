<h3> onijester  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 automatic recovery loop.</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I was on my PC when it said I had drive errors and to restart to fix them. Did so and now its doing the loop on me. Tried everything from chkdsk to safe mode. Downloaded the Windows 10 MCT to a flash drive but shows as iso and won’t read it on my
 PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the Log file C:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt&nbsp;</p>
<p>when auto repair fails.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I get the command prompt in the troubleshooting under advanced option it says X:\ instead of C:\ and it wont change back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don’t have a windows disk as it was purchased digitally almost 18 months ago. Any help would be good. Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Oni.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi OniJester,
<br />
<br />You will need a tool to make the USB Windows 10 bootable. The following software, Rufus, is a tool I use personally to create bootable USBs from ISO files: <a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rufus.akeo.ie/</a>
<br />
<br />When you use the command prompt under the advanced options, you can swap to the C drive by entering C: and pressing enter.
<br />
<br />In any case, I would recommend following through this article: <a href="https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-automatic-repair-couldnt-repair-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-automatic-...</a> -- Start at the section named "Solution 1 – Use Command Prompt from Windows 10 Boot Options menu"
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need any further help. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan

            I was unable to fix windows on my original C Drive. However I had a small HDD of 60gb's I used as a tertiary drive which allowed me to install windows 10 on it, from the iso on the USB I had gotten. I am still trying now that I have a computer instead
 of a laptop with XP on it so I can try other things you mentioned. However a scan of the former C Drive (now labeled automatically as D Drive) showed no errors and actually completed where as before under command prompt it would not. When I tried restarting
 and using the OS for drive 2 (drive 1 being the new C Drive) it came up with the blue screen giving me the same errors and rebooting once more. Will keep trying what you have told me now that I have this drive up and able to work some but I really want to
 fix this and restore all my files and everything and save this as a backup drive for emergencies now that I have it (this being the new C Drive {60gb} compared to the original which was 500 GB's).

            You need to unplug the other drive and boot the latest, correctly-configured media properly if you now want to install to the storage drive.  Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI. 
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Desktop view has turned sideway.  How do I straighten this out&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use Windows 8 on a Dell Laptop.&nbsp; I accidently leaned on my keyboard while the laptop was on.&nbsp; I don't know what I accidently pressed, but the whole screen Desktop turned sideways!!!&nbsp; I rebooted my laptop, but this did not undo the sideways position!&nbsp; I
 tried dragging the "Start" tool bar from the side of the screen to the bottom of the screen, but this is not working so far.&nbsp; I tried to search for an answer under Windows Help &amp; Support Page, but so far have not found any information on how to resolve this
 problem.&nbsp; It's very hard to work this way!!!&nbsp; Does anyone know how to correct this problem?&nbsp; Thanks very much for any help you can provide, I really appreciate it!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

            <p>This may sound simple, but I'll point out anyway. If you're on a 64-bit version of Windows 7, you may have them in C:\Program Files (x86) for 32-bit files or C:\Program Files for 64-bit. Sometimes this can be overlooked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're trying to find your program location and it's your Start, click the Start menu, find the program that appears to be "hidden" and right click, select Properties. In the Shortcut tab, click Open File Location. Some applications like Google Chrome
 will install in a hidden folder of user account AppData.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

    <title>Edge Browser History - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> roycevan blaricome  say:</h3>
<h2>            Edge Browser History</h2>
                    <p>For the past 2-3wks I have had no browser history showing and continue to see a message that says "You'll see your browser history here once you've visited sites."&nbsp; I've searched for hours for a fix.&nbsp; Only thing I could find was a suggestion to run "sfc
 \scannow" from the Command prompt.&nbsp; Didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've shutdown and restarted and also ran updates and then restarted.&nbsp; There appears to be a new Edge 10532 but even after running updates I still show 20.10240.16384.0 .&nbsp; Does anyone have a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note, I've never had the drop down list from the Back and Forward buttons.&nbsp; Does anyone else?</p>

 and still no HELPFUL solution from Tech support....&nbsp;&nbsp; Bill Gates needs to come back and get his company, because the quality of Windows has just gone to the dogs....&nbsp;&nbsp; PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM!!!

<p>All of the tech suggestions have not helped solve this bug. I have tired everything including a chat with the Answer Desk. NO help!! There are several threads from many others&nbsp;about this bug and there have been ZERO&nbsp; effective solutions to fix it!</p>

            Yeah I also have this same issue. After the 2nd update the browser history would sometimes appear sometimes not. Now after the 4th update ... I HAVE no browser history whatsoever. So good luck finding old pages especially when EGDE usually crashes on me.
 Also downloading when it crashes just totally resets a download and there is no way to restart it or even find out where to restart it without figuring out what the last page was. I would go back to a Different search browser but Windows 10 disabled all of
 them also. So it looks like I reconverting to windows 8 unless they fix this KNOWN issue.

            <p>Yes. They have to know about it as there have been many unhappy posts on several threads. I keep thinking the next updates will correct it but alas, nope! Must not be a priority.</p>
<p>I also would like to see recent pages on the back button so I know how far to back up. Again...zip!</p>
<p>MS could and should do better than allow this Edge browser to be flawed at introduction.</p>
<p>Where are they on this?</p>

            <p>You should notice that I am the Original Poster. &nbsp;I TOTALLY agree. &nbsp;The lack of responsiveness is unjustifiable and inexcusable. &nbsp;I understand it may take some time to solve a problem or even get a response to someone but to just completely disregard and
 fail to respond at all is not right. &nbsp;The only thing it serves to do is show that Microsoft is so big it doesn't care about it's customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question was asked why Microsoft rolled out Windows 10 when it wasn't ready for public use. &nbsp;One answer might be to get feedback from Users to find problems for them to fix. &nbsp;Ok, that's understandable except for 2 things. &nbsp;First, there was a Beta run
 for almost a year and I find it impossible to believe this issue didn't surface during that time. &nbsp;Second, now that the problem is known, why hasn't it been fixed and moreover why isn't there some response as to what is being done, the time it will likely
 take to fix it, etc.? &nbsp;Again, it's the lack of responsiveness that is quite bothersome and inexcusable. &nbsp;Oh, and just try getting someone on the phone to help you! &nbsp;Ha!!</p>

</p><p>One other thing, I mentioned before and I'll mention again. &nbsp;Right clicking the Back or Forward arrows do nothing. &nbsp;No drop down menu anymore to go back or forward to past or previous sites. &nbsp;These are SIMPLE actions that have been with IE forever! &nbsp;How
 is it that these weren't implemented from inception with Edge? &nbsp;C'mon Microsoft, you really need to get with the game or some of us, and hopefully many of us, will finally make the change and shift to Apple. &nbsp;I keep hearing from all my friends how "User Friendly"
 MacIntosh and Apple are. &nbsp;And what's more they constantly laud them for their Customer Service. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft better start focusing on serving the customer better because one does reap what they sow, later than they sow, and much more than the sow!!</p>

            <p>Thank you! </p>
<p>I did notice your original post and that encouraged me to join the discussion.</p>
<p>I have posted on other threads in this community on this same Edge history bug.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;was relieved to learn I was far from alone and that this problem is troubling many.
</p>
<p>Worse yet has been the insufficient response from MS.</p>
<p>A browser w/o a history log?</p>
<p>A browser back and forward w/o a drop down menu?</p>
<p>OK, a bug...but FIX IT!</p>
<p>It is interesting to see the tech solutions offered by MS employees that do NOT work. I have tried them all.</p>
<p>My chat experience with MS Answer Desk was a joke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do expect it to be remedied but apparently on&nbsp;MS's schedule. I think it should have a high priority as browser history and the back and forward drop&nbsp;down menus are fundamental to browser use.</p>

<h3> todd91  say:</h3>
<h2>            Closed Lid Music</h2>
                    I would like to be able to play music from my laptop with the lid closed; I will be using headphones and will only be able to use the battery. I have adjusted the power settings so that the laptop does not , even when the lid closes, however I am still
 having problems.<br />
<br />
The music will continues to play for a period of time between five and twenty seconds and then stops. Sometimes the music will begin playing again after a short amount of time only to stop again.&nbsp;

Thankyou for that, however I have already attempted this. I was wondering if there was another option that needed to be changed.

<span>1 Check that you do not have any PC maker's power management utility running [this is likely to apply to Samsung &amp; Sony Netbooks] by checking the PC manual &amp; the PC itself. Samsung Fast Boot / Fast
 Start stops users changing the lid close action so I don't think [from your description] that you have this complication].</span></p>
<p>
<span>2 If the settings you put in &amp; saved are not shown correctly in the power plan advanced options when you look at them again later on [as your description seems to confirm] then look at this Fixit first</span></p>
<p>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935799" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>When you configure power options for the active power plan in Windows Vista or in Windows 7, the changes are not reflected
 in the Power Options item in Control Panel</span></a></p>
<p>
<span>3 If you still have the problem then run the power troubleshooter</span></p>
<p>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Power-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Power-troubleshooter</span></a></p>
<p>
<span>4 Then run both the Maintenance &amp; Performance troubleshooters at Control panel, Troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>
<span>5 Check the entries in Device manager for any warnings, then try to update drivers -
<b>particularly the video card driver as that accounts for many power management problems.</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>6 Further to the check at item 2 above, if the Power plan Advanced options are showing the correct
<i>do nothing</i> action in lid closing but the system is not actually doing that then run powercfg to see what the system believes its power settings actually are. The output file is quite long but you'll find it easy to follow through [<i>I pasted the results
 text file into Excel to make it easier to work with</i>]. I think the output file contains a sufficient description for you to see what's set up but I've included links to full descriptions below.</span></p>
<p>
<span>In a command prompt, enter</span></p>
<p>
<span>powercfg /qh &gt;c:\users\YourUserName\Desktop\PowerSettings.txt</span></p>
<p>
<i><span>Note A You can see the almost-full syntax using powercfg /? but, for example, the h in qh is not listed [/q gets you the properties, /qh gets the the full list of properties including hidden properties].</span></i></p>

            Thank you for this; I have changed the registry setting and something dawned on me.<br />
<br />
this may sound silly, however, the reason i posted this question was so that i could play music from my backpack. It dawned on me that the reason could be because the laptop is on its side rather than in its natural position. Do laptops have a 'safety switch'
 that stops the laptop from reading the hard drive while in an unnatural position to prevent damage?<br />
<br />
This thought came to me because i was able to play music with the laptop closed as long as it stayed in a natural position, however only very briefly while vertical, is it would be in a backpack

            <p>I don't know of any laptop that prevents use in any position.&nbsp; Having said that, there might be hard drive interuptions &amp; damage from excessive vibration if you are using the drive while moving around.&nbsp; I had a 2 year old drive fail on me a few years ago
 after having often used it while walking so when I replaced it I also invested in an mp3 player &amp; earphones with a volume control.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>What's the state of play with the original question [while the laptop is safely on the kitchen table]?&nbsp; Has the Fixit fixed it?&nbsp; [<em>when you refer to registry changes I think you mean the Fixit in my para 2 above</em>]</p>

            Maybe it turns off because heat which would normally dissipate from the keyboard is being reflected back into the machine.

            Yes I was referring to the Fixit in para 2.&nbsp;<br />
I am not sure if it changed anything, as it was at this time(when I implemented the changes to the registry) the thought that the problem could be due to the position of the laptop.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
When I refer to the 'natural' position I am referring to on a flat surface (such as a table) or a slightly slanted surface (such as my lap).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I checked this theory by using the laptop:<br />
<br />
1st: lid closed on the table (played fine)<br />
2nd: lid closed in the vertical position, as it would be in the backpack (had the original problem)<br />
3rd: lid closed with the registry changes, as in the 2nd para fixit. (played fine)<br />
4th: lid closed with registry changes (had the original problems)<br />
<br />
With your damaged HD, it is possible the that factory that assembled this laptop may have buit something into the system to help prevent that kind of damage) [I don't know too much about technology :P ].<br />
<br />
I probably will buy an MP3 player. Just thought I'd try and be "smart" and save a little cash. :P<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help; I think I'll leave this idea alone for now.<br />
<br />

            That's an interesting thought, however I don't think that it applies in this case as the laptop shuts off quite quickly after having the lid close. The laptop does seem to work as long as it remains in a relatively flat position (not in the vertical position
 that it would be in the backpack).<br />
<br />
Also i have left it one with the hope (haha...as if a laptop understands the concept of hope) that it would 'miraculously' start working. What ended up happening was the battery drained &nbsp;and the laptop got quite hot. This to me signals that the laptop did not
 shut off completely, even while it was heating up.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help though.

            I've found that simply disabling and re-enabling the setting "Hey Cortana" works. A bit safer than force closing an app.

            <p>I'm on my surface pro3 and it seems the same problem I got it working and then it simply stopped at one point. When I tried to relearn my voice, it got to step 5 or so and then it just crashed on it's own with no errors or anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it sounds like it's not quite stable yet. Works great on my windows phone; not so much on windows 10 on a surface pro 3.</p>

    <title>User Accounts in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rbs-jos2500  say:</h3>
<h2>            User Accounts in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm so tired of trying to get anything done on my new computer that had Windows 10 pre-installed.&nbsp; It was purchased on May 8, 2016, and I spend hours everyday try to get it to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried very hard to learn this new, restrictive, and overly complicated program. &nbsp;Windows 10 want your email to be through Outlook. &nbsp;I set up an account through Outlook, but when I was not allowed to block senders, I decided to delete the Outlook mail
 account. &nbsp;I guess that Microsoft won't let me delete the Outlook account. &nbsp;I don't remember what the password was. &nbsp;Why would I need to remember, I don't want the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the settings for user accounts I want to have my Microsoft Administrator Account to be seen in the list and I want it to be the default account for sign-in when my computer is started or restarted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only other account should be my Windows Live Mail account. &nbsp;That is the Microsoft Mail carrier I've decided to use. I can Block Senders, and use the rules in Live Mail to prevent messages from those senders from being downloaded from the server. &nbsp;You
 can't do that with Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My profile information: shows my Administrator account is set as a Local Account. &nbsp;It's a Microsoft account. &nbsp;I want it to be my default account to sign in when the computer starts or restarts, and it should be my default for the responses I receive from
 the Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Email &amp; apps account : &nbsp;Under E-mail, calendar, &amp; contacts &nbsp;-- There's my Outlook account. &nbsp; I don't want that account. &nbsp;I should be able to remove it. &nbsp;The Outlook account is just UNWANTED AND UNNECCESSARY.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Accounts used by other Apps: &nbsp;Show my &nbsp;Windows Live Mail account next to the colored Windows Emblem. &nbsp;It's a Microsoft account too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I ask The Community a question I can't open the response by clicking on words highlighted in blue to read the information because I don't know the password for the stupid account I set up in Outlook, that I won't be using so it should be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is holding up the directions from The Community via Microsoft, with the steps I need to set up My profile and accounts the way I want them? &nbsp;Even in the Microsoft Settings that information is call My profile, not Microsoft's profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does it take for Microsoft, who wrote the codes for the programs in Windows 10 that fix these types of problems? Your customers don't like Windows 10 because of the restrictions you have written into the programs you wrote special for Windows 10. &nbsp;Viva
 La France in the lawsuit demanding Microsoft take their new restrictions out of Windows 10?!?!?</p>
<p>Apparently Windows 10 is very unpopular in on Europe, and from the complaints here, it doesn't seem Americans are very fond of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response, and let's hope I can click on the link and read your response using my Default account which is the Administrator account.</p>

            <p>Fortunately for people like us, the internet is filled with valuable resources to teach you how to use Windows 10. &nbsp;You can get instruction from thousands of websites, videos, blogs, tutorials, courses ... you name it. All it takes a is patience and a willingness
 to learn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I never saw the inside of a computer science classroom, I started off slowly. Very slowly. You will almost certainly progress faster than me. But I stuck with it and now I feel very comfortable working with Windows. You can too.</p>

<p>Download and reinstall</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/install</a></p>
<p>Retry launching iplayer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If unable to do so, check firewall settings and ensure it is not being blocked</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this (dpm9876's resolution from thread:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>•Copy the whole BBC iPlayer folder from C:\Computer\Videos\ to somewhere else on your computer as a backup.<br />
•Uninstall Desktop and restart your computer.<br />
•Rename the original BBC iPlayer folder to something else like BBC iPlayer.old.<br />
•Go to the iPlayer site and choose a programme to download which should prompt you to reinstall Desktop and AIR.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

                    My computer crashed and I wiped it all back to factory settings but now I need to tell it the product key - which is (or was!) on the back of the computer - but has rubbed of with wear and tear. I seem to be going round in circles trying to find where
 I can get the number again. Any help would be much appreciated.

<p>
</p>
<p>
</span></p>
<p>
<p>
<span>Are you using the Windows 7 key that's on your computer/DVD case to activate Office? That will not work - only an Office key will activate Office.

<p>
<span>Some new computers come with Microsoft Office Starter, which is a free version of Office with reduced functions. If you want to add more features you can buy Office.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>Also, some new computers come with a trial of Office, but after X days or X uses it goes to reduced functionality mode unless you buy it. To continue using it beyond the trial
 period, you'll need to purchase a Microsoft Office license. </span></p>

<h2>            Memory keeps disappearing on C&#58;&#47; drive in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Every time I have cleared space on my C drive, which is a 512 GB capacity SSD, it has disappeared at the rate of many gigabytes per day. A software I was using, NTI EZ Backup, was taking up a lot of the space on the C:/ drive, and I thought that was the
 issue, but after completely reinstalling the program, the issue has persisted. My laptop is a Lenovo Yoga. After clearing the C:/ drive so that 165 GB were free two days ago, 126 GB currently remain - the memory is dropping without me saving anything more
 than the typical variety of small files on the order of kilobytes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas for what might be going on? Typical virus checks do not reveal any malicious software causing the issue, although I cannot rule that out. Thank you in advance!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Huawei EM770W not recognized as mobile broadband connection</h2>
                    <p>I saw that my previous question on this topic was posted in the Windows 8 pre release forum. I'm experiencing this issue in Windows 8 Pro as well, so I am really hoping for a solution here!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already mentioned an issue concerning mobile broadband in this topic:<br />
<a href="http://www.eightforums.com/network-sharing/6540-3g-dial-up-connection-properties-changed-no-automatic-connect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eightforums.com/network-sharing/6540-3g-dial-up-connection-properties-changed-no-automatic-connect.html</a><br />

<p>Now I have Windows 8 Pro installed and still have the same issue.</p>
<p>I found the following website:<br />
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/01/20/engineering-windows-8-for-mobility.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/01/20/engineering-windows-8-for-mobility.aspx</a></p>
<p>What I am looking for is my Huawei EM770W to pop up as:<br />

<p>But instead it just looks like:<br />
<a href="http://www.nippyinternet.co.uk/images/vista8.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nippyinternet.co.uk/images/vista8.gif</a></p>
<p>And in the "Networks" charm I see a telephone icon next to the connection of which I think it is broadband. I can't even find that icon on Google.<br />
I can only view the properties of the connection. That brings me to the desktop view and the standard Dial-Up settings.</p>
<p>The main issue is: I have HAD the Huawei EM770W work like that! It just doesn't do it anymore. Now I cannot set this connection to automatically connect. Basically: I cannot use the advantages for Mobile Broadband that Microsoft has built in Windows 8!</p>
<p>I would really appreciate some assistance here!</p>

            <p>I have bought an Asus VivoTab RT and that solved this problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wireless broadband connection is recognized as such. When needed it automatically connects. And Lync and all other apps recognize it as a descent internet connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So all issues regarding 3G connection (not automatically connecting, not recognized as mobile broadband(but as dial up), not recognized as connected to the internet, not possible to set as "don't use for downloading updates" etc.) are all related to the
 specific 3G device one is using.</p>

<h2>            Display full version info, not just build number</h2>
                    <p>Yes I know this is the wrong place to post suggestions. But since Uservoice is no longer the option for Windows and Windows "Feedback" doesn't work on my machine here it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Build numbers can be displayed on the desktop as a "watermark" in the bottom right corner ie</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-remove-watermark-from-windows-10-desktop/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please change that to display the full version info as displayed by the "WinVer" command.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Build number is too generic. We need an easy way to see the current version installed on our computer for trouble shooting.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, it took Windows 3 full months, from Mar 1 to May 31 to automatigically figure out that it was supposed to apply the November update to my machine. Nothing I did would beat it into submission to force it into doing that update.&nbsp; Frankly, now
 I have very low expectations for seeing the July update in a timely fashion. </p>

            <p>Yes, technet is probably a better place, but I can't post there (blocked, am looking into getting that cleared, I HOPE).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The part I am specifically looking at is the OS Build number.&nbsp; The watermark only shows the first part 10586, I would like to see it enhanced to show the whole thing, including the
<strong>.318</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><p>WinVer and Sysinfo show exactly the same info, only in slightly different formats. I am specifically talking about the green and yellow highlights.

</p><p>After posting I thought of one more piece of info that I'd like to see in all three places. That is the MS release date for that specific build.&nbsp; That is the easiest piece of information for users to relate to.&nbsp; That way, the watermark would have been showing
 me that I was using the Sept 2015 (initial GA) release.&nbsp; That would have encouraged me to be more insistent on forcing the November update (Threshold 2) to be applied.&nbsp; But even now, the watermark only showing "threshold 2" part of the build number is misleading.&nbsp;
 The .318 is very important, but hidden ... </p>
<p>
</p><p>For example this site lists all (?) active MS build numbers. Their details for this build number is on this page:
</p>
<p>https://buildfeed.net/build/afd24671-a744-4d7a-8eb7-e6be1a971ea7/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shows a build time of 160505-1801:&nbsp; I am ASSUMING 2016 May 05, 6:01PM (?).&nbsp; Show that in all 3 of the locations so users know more clearly which update they are working with.

<p>Release date is only showing on the watermark though. Some dates have multiple releases, mine being the&nbsp;later one from that day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see a typical user getting much benefit out of having that info on a watermark. Some will even protest it as a desecration of their pristine desktop. :-) I'd rather see a quick reference for the UI changes between versions, especially WRT user selectable&nbsp;options.&nbsp;
 There is already confusion caused by&nbsp;<em>helpful tips</em> posted on the web that are no longer applicable in current Win10 releases. Based on the release above there will be more of that to come.</p>

            <p>Yes, that is the information I would like to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While it is definitely appropriate to show all of that extra info on a Preview release, I would like to see more on the GA release</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't object to tightening it up:</p>
<p><br />
"Windows 10 Pro Insider Preview" is replaced by "Windows 10 Home" or "Windows 10 Pro"</p>
<p>"Evaluation copy" would not be there for a GA release.</p>
<p>Build is OK or could be abbrevieated to "B"</p>
<p>Same with Release, abbrev to "R"</p>
<p>It wouldn't hurt to put the date on a separate line from build so that build info would not spread that far to the left</p>
<p>
</p><p>All in all, the GA version would be much shorter without any extra trimming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I understand that some people would not want to see that extra info, but for the most part, the people who go to the bother turn it on probably would not object to a little extra detail...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course the date in the task bar has noting to do with the build date. I don't have that problem because I default my task bar to the top of the screen, so that ti is closer to the phat ribbon, or the wonderful menu (no UI bias here ....) &lt;grin&gt;</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have just had the above BSOD after I upgraded to Windows 10 on Thursday..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have done a search and checked all my drivers were up to date by going into device manager and update driver.. The only one that came back with an updated driver was my display adaptor... Could this have been the cause?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not see any code, just the above message on a blue screen and it restarted</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already run a cleaner which deleted the DMP file...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does this again, how do I read the DMP file to see the cause?</p>

    <title>&#91;Solved&#93; W10 1803 and 1809 inbox and Intel drivers introduced - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmichael2497  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;Solved&#93; W10 1803 and 1809 inbox and Intel drivers introduced performance issues such as noticeable audio stutter</h2>
                    <p><strong>[Solved] </strong>W10 1803 and 1809 inbox and Intel drivers introduced performance issues such as noticeable audio stutter due to older Intel storage controller (in RAID aka IRRT mode) not being properly supported and solved by manual install of
 older driver (update edit: or by switching out of IRRT mode to AHCI if you aren't really using those special RAID features).</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>ignore all the lazy and ignorant directions to clean install, since that will not fix an obvious system level driver issue</em>, (as verified by all the unfortunate folks who went through the hassle of a clean install). for folks stubbornly skeptical
 like I was, that brush this off because "newer drivers are always better, so older drivers can't be the solution"... well... in this case they are.<br />
<br />
<strong>Symptoms:</strong> after updating from 1709 to 1803 my system performance degraded with the most obvious thing being a strange audio stutter every few seconds (even with usb speakers) with streamed and locally stored content, that I did not realize
 was there before deleting the prior version of windows, (oops run a 3d game to test everything next time), and 1809 did not fix it automatically either.<br />
<br />
<strong>Driver Research:</strong> by manually searching for "compatible ids" in https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/home.aspx got everything updated to final official drivers (often newer versions than windows update for some reason) and still audio stutters
 were happening.<br />
<br />
<strong>Further Reading:</strong> after seeing some mention of drive related issues and windows timers I wasn't really convinced in any particular direction. After one more post about Intel storage drivers dropping proper support for older chipsets from newer
 versions of windows inbox drivers or direct Intel bundles... I saw they mentioned ICH10 chipset and using a much older v11 driver fixed the stutter issue, so time to give it a try.<br />
<br />
<strong>WARNING:</strong><em> changing storage controller drivers could potentially lead to boot problems</em>, so being able to use recovery mode, to rollback to
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>a restore point created before you start changing the driver</em></span>, is essential. I have a habit of cleaning out drivers from safe mode (not really necessary), and I found I had to restart back into normal mode
 after the storage driver change, before being able to start safe mode again. I used the restore point a few times before noticing that (maybe unnecessarily, but it seemed pretty well hung in normal mode... so best to be safe).<br />
<br />
<strong>Final Troubleshooting:</strong> after uninstalling newest catalog v16.7.5, was back to inbox v15.44.x drivers with audio stutter, tried latest versions of each series until I found one that worked (v15.9.0, v14.8.16, and finally v13.6.0 worked). Then
 going back up to test sub-versions in between until it stopped working (v14.0.0 and v14.8.0 and stopped working on v14.8.16 again). Yes it is time consuming (but that is the scientific method) thank wintel for that.<br />
<br />
<strong>Solution:</strong> (that worked for me<strong>) </strong>on Dell Latitude E4300 with Intel Core2Duo ICH9 Mobile Express 4 chipset using SATA in IRRT mode, was to switch to using an older driver from https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/55005/Intel-Rapid-Storage-Technology-Intel-RST-
 (specifically I'm using 14.8.0.1042, but you'll need to experiment to find what works on your hardware).<br />
<br />
hope that helps, enjoy.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update Edit:</strong> later tested and verified switching bios settings for storage controller to change from RAID aka IRRT support mode (if the feature is not actually being used) to AHCI also works, but seems to need at least one boot once into
 safe mode first to get the drivers automatically setup (inbox drivers from MS for standard ATA and AHCI from 2006 v10.0.17763.168) and then works just fine, fixes the painfully slow boot time with the last working IRRT driver on my system, and then just updated
 with catalog (my particular system got Intel 2011 v10.5.0.1029 driver) for thoroughness.</p>

    <title>AMD Driver Install Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adrianroman  say:</h3>
<h2>            AMD Driver Install Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been unable to install any driver after I uninstalled the beta catalyst driver 14.7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver worked fine, I just wanted to roll back to a whql driver. After that, ive tried everything, but the catalyst installer cant seem to be able to install the driver itself. It install everything, the AMD control center, the redistributables, even
 the AMD raptr app, but the AMD Display Driver itself gets a "fail" result:&nbsp;</p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&lt;description&gt;AMD Display Driver&lt;/description&gt;</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&lt;result&gt;Fail&lt;/result&gt;</span><br />
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, inside the report, i get multiple lines that say this: "&lt;error&gt;&lt;msg&gt;Driver Install: Windows® version does not support this operation&lt;/msg&gt;&lt;/error&gt;", which makes no sense, since i've used that exact same driver before(14.4), and i've redownloaded it,
 and its clearly specified to work with windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to manually update the driver by installing it through the update driver option in the device manager, but I always get the same error. It encounters an error because the "system cannot find the path specified".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The weird thing is, if I let windows find a driver on its own, it installs one without any issues. The version windows manages to install is the windows certified one: WDDM1.3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This driver is based off of an earlier version of the catalyst driver. Sure it works, but I get artifacts and flickering in many of my games(though not all, and can fix the issue by running the application in borderless windowed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to be able to install mobility drivers from AMD instead of having to wait. I know it can be done, because i have done it dozens of times before. I think something happened during the uninstall of the beta driver that is causing some sort of
 conflict with the drivers i want ti install, maybe a registry key? I really don't have a clue, maybe i'm wrong and it has nothing to do with the beta driver at all. I've tried everything and writing my issue is my last resort before I try a clean windows install,
 which would probably fix the issue, but I would rather not have to deal with a 700gb backup.</p>
<p>

            This problem is caused by the fact that manufacturers customize laptop drivers. You must use the driver that came with your computer. You cannot install drivers from the video manufacturer. In Windows 8, system files cannot be changed. Reinstall the driver
 that is automatically installed by Device Manager and stop trying to update to different drivers from AMD or Intel or any other video card manufacturer. If your computer maker releases a diff video driver for your exact model, you should receive a notice from
 them. Laptops rarely need or get driver updates as desktops do.

<p>It is my understanding though proxy configuration is available, it is not supported. &nbsp;Due to this, as mentioned in bold in the FAQ link below, &nbsp;I would not expect an official reply from Skype support on the subject. &nbsp;This is more than likely due to the fact
 that Skype is considered a consumer product and those that require advanced features and support for a business would upgrade to a business solution like
<a href="https://products.office.com/en-gb/skype-for-business/online-meetings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Skype for Business">
Skype for Business</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA1017" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Can I connect to Skype through a proxy server?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Right or wrong, they have it configured a certain way and it will either work, or it will not work with your configuration. &nbsp;If you need to whitelist a bunch of IPs or addresses, you are on your own. &nbsp;If it does not work then you are free to try out solutions
 or collaborate with others like the people in this Community. &nbsp;It can only help in case there is something wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to solutions people have tried in the thread you mentioned: They have included whitelisting IPs and addresses. &nbsp;To resolve proxy authentication issues, some have resorted to using a proxy delegate.</p>
