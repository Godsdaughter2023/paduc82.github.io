            <p>Hi NealUtting,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting here. I understand that you are having issues reinstalling Windows Essentials. Since you already tried manual uninstalling, I suggest that you use the CMD Line Parameter to clean uninstall Windows Essentials. This process will remove all
 Windows Essentials components on your computer. Here's how:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note : <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>I suggest that you back up your emails through this
</font></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/mail-import-backup-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>article</font></span></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>1. Uninstall Windows Essentials using

<p>2. Delete the Windows Live folders (if any) found on the following directories:</p>
<ul>
<li>C:\Program Files\Windows Live</li><li>C:\Program Files\Common Files\Windows Live</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>3.

 and install.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly update us afterwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            1. Right click on Word file &gt; Properties &gt; See is something is there under Previous Versions tab.
<br />
<br />2. Also open the file &gt; File &gt; Info &gt; Manage Documents &gt; Recover unsaved documents.
<br />
<br />3. See if there are some temp files in the folder. These will be hidden. To unhide &gt; Open File Explorer &gt; View tab &gt; Check Hidden &gt; Restart File explorer. 
<br />If .tmp files are there, create a copy rename them with extension .docx (or .doc)
<br />
<br />4. Look into Onedrive if you had backed up into Cloud or AutoSave was ON.
<br />
<br />5. Look into below article also

    <title>Windows 10 and Atlantis Word Processing software - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 and Atlantis Word Processing software</h2>
                    I use Atlantis Word Processing software rather than Microsoft Word, etc. I like it because it has a sound package which makes document creation enjoyable. Since installing Windows 10, the sound effects no longer work. I've checked to make sure the sounds
 I want are still activated. I've checked my speaker volume. Everything is as it was before I installed Windows 10. Why can I no longer hear the sounds and how do I fix it?

            <p>Hi Toms,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your interest in Windows 10. We need few details regarding this issue to have a better view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Do you listen to other sounds from the Computer other than Atlantis Word Processing software ?</p>
<p>2. What's the make and model of the Computer?</p>
<p>3. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Have you updated all the drivers in the Computer? If not, I suggest that you do the same through
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is pertaining to only this software, then I suggest that you check for updates/patches for this application and install them. If there are no patches/updates yet available for Windows 10 in the software manufacturer's website, then I suggest
 that you uninstall and reinstall the Software in Windows 7/8 compatibility mode. Refer to the following article to do the same:

<h2>            RISK will not play after last XBOB ONE update.</h2>
                    
<p>After the last XBOX ONE update my RISK game will not play. It gets as far as connecting to the UBISOFT server, locks up, and kicks me back out to the Home screen.</p>
<p>I went through the whole XBOX ONE Game Won't Start trouble shooter, &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/troubleshooting/game-freeze-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/troubleshooting/game-freeze-solution</a></p>
<p>I've Reset My Console, reinstalled the game, deleted all saved content etc. As per the trouble&nbsp;shooter. Even if I select skip, on the connecting to UBISOFT server screen, it locks up on the next screen. I can hear an audio hiss/noise in the background, then
 I'm kicked out to the Home Screen. Monopoly installed on the same XBOB ONE works without issue and connects to the UBISOFT server without issue. Both games were Digital purchases with the same account.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, could you try this please.</p>
<p>On the Xbox go to settings/ all settings/ network/ advanced settings/ alternate MAC address, select clear and then restart. Then try the game again.</p>
<p>As a side note, to edit a post you select the Moderate option and select Edit post, there is a time limit within which you must do that though.</p>

<p>Did that, looked hopeful for a second. I got a “syncing DATA with Risk”, or something like that message, I haven’t seen before. It was only visible for a second or two. Right after that it locked up on that same “connecting to UBISOFT server screen” and
 then kicked me back out to the Home screen. It’s the screen that comes up right after the Who are you / sign in screen. Seemed to take a little longer to lock up though. I’m using a wired connection, if that matters. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess I didn't see my typo fast enough. I had clicked the moderate button. Now I know for next time though, thanks.</p>

<p>Just got a reply from UBISOFT Tech support that appears to work. I got past the screen that locks up and was able to start a game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At this time the team is currently investigating reports of Risk crashing to the dashboard when attempting to connect to online services on Xbox One.</p>
<p>Online play will not be possible until the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>Please try this workaround to play online:</p>
<p>1. Unplug the Ethernet cable or disable your connection</p>
<p>2. Start risk and choose your profile</p>
<p>3. Continue until you get the screen to appear that connections are unavailable and to either retry or you can select the Risk tile in the top right to start offline</p>
<p>4. Once you are playing offline against AI, you can reconnect your connection.</p>
<p>We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Thank you for your continued patience while the team works to resolve the issue.</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 controller won&#39;t work anymore</h2>
                    <p>A while back, when Windows updated, my Xbox controllers quit working on Windows 10. My Playstation controllers and Switch Pro controllers work fine. I'm using an Xbox 360 controller, wirelessly with the dongle adapter that came with the Xbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried finding new drivers for it, but I can only find drivers for Windows 7. The links in the support documentation that Microsoft has provided are broken, and just take me to advertisement pages to buy more controllers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know where I can find the actual drivers, or what I can do to fix the controller? It connects to the computer, and the Player 1 light turns on, but it's not recognized by any games, and sometimes randomly drags my mouse to the bottom corner
 of my screen.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade - Touchpad does not work anymore &#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have an Acer Aspire V3-112P and a Surface pro... I very reluctantly let the 2 machines upgrade themselves to Windows 10 after much hesitation and refusals. &nbsp;Since then, the touchpad on my Acer does not work at all and I cannot find an answer to solve this
 problem!! &nbsp;On my Surface pro different problem... in tablet mode, cannot get the on-screen keyboard to come up when I go in a data entry field... instead it brings up the litte box you use to write in with the pen... I have to click the keyboard at the bottom,
 then select the right keyboard, etc.. a 3 step process... everytime !!! Same story as the Acer, I cannot find an answer for this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a nutshell, all my experiences with Microsoft have been very bad and as soon as those 2 machines die on me, I will switch permanently to Apple for all my IT needs (and share my experiences with as many people as I can). &nbsp;Until then, if anyone out there
 can help me fix what was not broken which windows 10 broke and for which Microsoft does not have the minimal consideration to provide us with an easy fix. &nbsp;Many tx !</p>

 ink panel.</p>

            <p>Many thanks Shawn, </p>
<p>
</p><p>For the surface you were right... If I touch with my finger the data entry field, it opens up the on-screen keyboard.&nbsp; Thus the fix for my problem! Many thanks !!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Message to the designer who brought this change forward...&nbsp;I always used the pen to do that, but now I have to use both the pen and my finger... Furthermore, the small icon at the bottom of the screen is&nbsp;an&nbsp;image of a keyboard so when I touch it with the
 pen and expect an on-screen keyboard to show up (what I've always done in the past) I get the writing&nbsp;pad to open.&nbsp; Sooo... as people would say...&nbsp; I guess it&nbsp;works as designed... I tell the designer that he/she should have just let it alone. Bad move...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the Acer,&nbsp;the 'Acer care center' tells me that my&nbsp;machine is up to date... I'll investigate further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again Shawn ! I have no patience for this kind of nonsense and was about to throw both machines out the window (10) ... You gave them a second life :-) Pierre&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Now that I have resolved the non-existent problem on my surface pro, I tried to fix the real problem that I have with my Acer.&nbsp; I looked for bios updates as suggested above and installed them.&nbsp; This morning, my touchpad is still inoperative but now the cursor
 has disappeared all together !!! My external mouse is now useless !!!</p>
<p>Tried to revert back to windows 8.1 but I know it's been more than 30 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried the fn+f3 and fn+f9 and fb+f11... The left shift+left alt+f11... looked at the mouse configurations according to multiple sites and youtube and nothing works or appear to be the answer !!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should be simple stuff !!! A mouse and a pointer !! Latest Microsoft technology and cannot get this to KEEP on working... I'm at a loss here... anyone has any idea ?</p>

            <p>Good afternoon Shawn.&nbsp; After I sent my update I made a last effort to reset everything.&nbsp; I powered off the laptop, unplugged it and shut down the mouse by removing the battery inside. Bringing up everything, the mouse is now back alive.&nbsp; So I'm back to my
 original problem with the touchpad which won't work even though I installed the bios updates from Acer.&nbsp; Still a problem but at least I can work now with the mouse.</p>

            That's it, I give up ! Somehow installing Windows 10 removed the code that was on my Acer before to manage the touchpad.&nbsp; I visited the site mentioned above and simply cannot figure out what I am supposed to re-install... This is a computer and it should
 figure on its own what's missing and download/install it automatically.&nbsp; Wasted enough time with this.&nbsp; I will use a crippled laptop (Thanks to Microsoft Windows 10) with an external mouse&nbsp;until the technology is obsolete and I will simply move to technology
 that was designed with the end user in mind and&nbsp;which&nbsp;does not cause problems every time you install fixes or upgrade the software.&nbsp;If you do a quick search in google or YouTube you will see that touchpad not working after an upgrade to Windows 10 is quite
 common ! This should never happen.&nbsp; Since I received a surface pro as a gift a few years ago I spent a massive amount of time dealing with numerous problems to a point that I had to go buy an Acer l

            I sincerely appreciate your help Shawn! But I'm of the opinion that I should not have to call the manufacturer of my hardware to request a piece of code that was removed through an operating system upgrade.&nbsp; And if it did remove the code, it should be
 smart enough to re-install it or install a later version of it as part of the upgrade process.&nbsp; I'll take my chance with Apple as Microsoft has been nothing but troubles for me over the past&nbsp;few years... Pierre

            <p>Hi there Sgt Umlaut, thanks for reaching out.</p><p><br /></p><p>To take advantage of Xbox Play Anywhere, you will need to have installed the Windows 10 Anniversary Edition update on your PC, as well as the latest update on your Xbox One console. Then, simply log into your Xbox Live/Microsoft account and your Xbox Play Anywhere games will be available to download. On your Xbox One, games will show as “Ready to Install” under “My Games and Apps”. On your Windows 10 PC, games will appear in “My Library.” You will also need to ensure your PC meets the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/halo-wars-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">minimum system requirements</a> for the game (located at the bottom of that page). </p>

    <title>GPU not detected in Surface Book 2 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            GPU not detected in Surface Book 2</h2>
                    <p>Hello MS support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought surface book 2, 256 GB, NVIDIA GeForce 1050, 2GB model&nbsp; in November, 2017 and it worked pretty well until recently. I don't know why it stopped detecting the GPU. It's not showing up in the display adapters. I tried detaching and attaching the screen
 it gets detected for a moment and goes off again. I tried one solution offered in the Microsoft page to uninstall the driver (checking the delete software ) and restart the PC but with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it a hardware problem or a frequent software problem ? I will be really glad if you can provide me a solution to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rajeev</p>

<p>Hi Robert_at_lane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem as you the last days and I also tried the different solutions posted here in the community I nearly gave up but today I tried it the last time on a different way and it seems like it is working now. Graphics card is still there and
 isn't switching off anymore even if I use programs which need a lot of performance, also waking up is working super fast again without any problem and the power button is working as well. (I guess there is some issue with the power management because when
 my power supply was plugged in the power button and the startup worked, unplugged I could press what I wanted, only the detach button was waking up the device and the Nvidia cards always disappeared after a short time except when I was using Rhino3D plugged
 in with best performance)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe my solution helps you as well....</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Make sure that all windows updates are made and the latest firmware is installed, also the latest Nvidia driver (397.64)</p>
<p>2. Put the power settings to best performance (plugged in and in battery mode)</p>
<p>3. Open the device manager and keep it open</p>
<p>4. Unplug your SB2</p>
<p>5. Detach the tablet and wait for ~10-15sec until the system updated the connected devices (the device manager should flicker once or twice until it stops, maybe there is a sound as well)</p>
<p>6. Reattach and wait until the Nvidia card pops up in the device manager</p>
<p>7. Quickly make a normal shutdown as long as the card is still visible in the device manager</p>
<p>8. When the device is off, do a hard reset by pressing the volume up button and the power button for at least 20 seconds (Press and hold the volume up button before pressing and holding the power button)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
9. The UEFI interface might appear, just exit and let the system restart.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
These steps seemed to work in my case...I hope they help you as well...if there are any changes during the further use of my SB2 I will inform you.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Best regards.</p>

<h2>            Tutle Beach x41 mic so sensitive i CANT USE THEM. A Fix&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I got the turtle beach x41 headset and I like it alot, except the mic is way to sensitive. It picks up everything, even when the volume of the headset is down very low. It picks up the headset sounds through the mic. It was to the point where I had to turn
 my mic on mute during games because peoplke were complaining. Any fixe for this? Or should I return these for a better headset?</p>

<p>return them, the x12 are the same way as for most TB headsets. they arent a good quality headphone company either unless your willing to spend 300 dollars and even then i cant gurantee youll be happy with them. ive owned six or so pairs of TB until i finally
 grew a brain and dropped some good amount of cash on a pair of astros, and its the best decision ive made regarding my xbox. tritons are also a good quality headset. not the cheapest ones. but all the others are good.</p>

    <title>Re-install Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffery cameron  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re-install Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>During initial boot, while at the Windows logo screen with the circling dots, I receive the following message....</p>
<p>"Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart. We're just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you."</p>
<p>An includes the following additional information...., </p>
<p>"If you would like to know more, you can search online later for this error: 0xc0000142".</p>
<p>I think this started after a Microsoft update.</p>
<p>The computer is in an infinite loop of restarting, getting to the Windows logo screen with the circling dots, then displaying the error message, then re-starting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer was originally a Windows 8.0 system, upgraded to Windows 8.1, then finally upgraded to Windows 10 (I think in 2015) during the free upgrade program. The computer had been running great until the recent Windows update (approximately 3 weeks back).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have let the computer go through the fail cycle overnight just to see if something would change.</p>
<p>I have tried shutting the computer down at the Windows logo screen with the circling dots, 3 times (before the error message occurred).</p>
<p>I have downloaded the Microsoft "Windows Media Creation Tool" and attempted all of the options, including using many commands in the command prompt option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now to the point of attempting to re-install Windows 10 from the "Windows Media Creation Tool".</p>
<p>When I get to the point of selecting a drive on which to install Windows 10, I get the following message....</p>
<p>"Windows can't be installed on Drive (drive number), Partition (partition number) (show details)".
</p>
<p>The "details" message is...</p>
<p>"Windows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk has an MBR partition table. On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed to GPT disks."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My question......</p>
<p>Windows 10 has been on this computer since the free upgrade. Windows 10 has been running well for years. Why is it now that Windows 10 cannot be installed on this computer?</p>
<p>How do I get Windows 10 re-installed to this computer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance and best regards.</p>

            Hi Jeffrey
<br />
<br />Your installation media is expecting a GPT drive, you need to convert that drive to GPT
<br />
<br />At the very start of the Installation Process, press Shift + F10, or Shift + Fn + F10 to open Command Prompt 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />diskpart 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />list disk 
<br />(Make note of the disk number you want to convert and enter it into the next command - replace disknumber) 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />select disk disknumber 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />clean 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />convert gpt 
<br />
<br />Then close Command Prompt and restart the installation . . .

            Hi Jeffery, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />This is a commonly seen issue that has a simple fix. You'll need to reformat the drive using a different partition style, namely GPT.
<br />
<br />Here are instructions to do that:
<br />

<br />
<br />Let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

            Hi Jeffrey
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience caused. 
<br />
<br />First...
<br />
<br />Try resetting your BIOS defaults:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 battery
<br />Plug it in again, power up
<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />a
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<p>Greetings All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First...</p>
<p>THANK YOU!!!! for the quick replies!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second...</p>
<p>I first followed the advice to reset my bios to factory default and....WOOHOO!!!! I was able to use the&nbsp;<span>"Windows Media Creation Tool"</span><span>&nbsp;to install Windows 10!!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>YEA!!!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now.....</span></p>
<p><span>Windows does not find my Windows Key and is telling me to enter it manually from my installation media which I no longer have (remember.... this machine started as a Windows 8 machine and graduated to 8.1 and finally
 10 during the free upgrade period).</span></p>
<p><span>Or....buy a new license from Microsoft..</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>During the Windows request for the activation key, there is also a question in regards to whether I have recently changed hardware.</span></p>
<p><span>I have not recently changed hardware so I am very reluctant to select that option.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any suggestions in regards to obtaining a key?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Again, Thanks in advance!</span></p>

<p>Troubleshooting this would now involve manually installing ONE Microsoft patch at a time, restarting and testing the functionality you lost before - PER PATCH.</p>
<p>You will either find it was not a lone Microsoft patch (you will get through them all without ill effect) or you will discover which one caused the issue.</p>

<p>The problem I now have is when the computer boots, a black screen comes up with two options:</p>

<p>Ramdisk</p>
<p>Windows 7 (recovered)</p>
<p>When I choose Windows 7 (recovered) the computer proceeds to boot (slowly) ending with the normal desktop screen.</p>
<p>My question is how do I get rid of this black screen with its two selections when turning on the computer?</p>
<p>The restoration process will not finish because when the computer reboots it hangs up because the reboot process goes to this black screen option.</p>

            <p>My process to-date. I tried almost everything that is possible using the original Win 7 upgrade disk. Installed&nbsp; Win 7 on another computer and made a repair disk. Me error message changed to Hard Disk failure, then I took the Hard Disk out of my problem
 machine and checked it out as a slave disk on second machine. Disk had no problems Ran check disk , then I copied all of my data files to a thump drive. Reinstalled the&nbsp;hard drive in my primary machine, and ran the recovery process &nbsp;with the disks I created
 when I first bought the machine. Once I got all the original software installed, I updated the Vista operating system wih Vista SP1 and SP 2. Then I installed the Win 7 operating system and began to transfer data files and programs. The only problem I had
 was running the backup disks I had created two days prior to the corrupted boot files occurrence caused by the millisecond power outage. Thanks for your continued interest.</p>
<p>I guess my answer to anyone else who might have this problem is, When all else fails go back to square one and run the recovery process.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Security Advisories RSS - No longer updated&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good Morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I've noticed that the RSS security advisories alerts feed from:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/technical-security-notifications?rtc=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/technical-security-notifications?rtc=1</a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hasn't had any new content since January 2018? Obviously there have been a number of vulnerability disclosures etc. since that time.<br />
Does anyone know if there is a different feed for vulnerability disclosures in Microsoft products or is there a problem with this feed?<br />
The feed I am looking at has URI&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/rss/advisory?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/rss/advisory?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I noticed there is an MRSC RSS feed here:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/feed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/feed/</a></p>
<p>This contains a lot more information though like guidance and other info, not just important alerts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I know that on the classic desktop there is a bottom on the bottom to get the virtual keyboard to pop up. is there a way to do it in metro? my keyboard doesn't pop up sometimes.</p>

            <p>I am having the same problem with my Surface Pro. At first, whenever I was in a prompt that required text entry my keyboard would pop up. It stopped appearing yesterday (which was right after an update was installed). I have looked everywhere for a setting
 for this but there is not one. I think it is a bug from the last update? It has also froze up a couple of times since that update and I had to hold the power button for about five seconds to get it to restart. Microsoft help; all of my ipad friends and relatives
 will be busting my **** about this! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE!&nbsp; I think I just found a way around this.</strong>&nbsp; Without the touch keypad I couldn't even log into my computer unless I used a tiny keyboard that you could select from the bottom right corner of the log in screen.&nbsp; Also, if I went to settings
 and touched the keyboard to get it to appear it would&nbsp;dissapear once I left settings and tried to answer an email or go to a web site.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just used the physical keyboard that I purchased to log on, then I went to settings (right swipe) and keyboard and touched the onscreen keyboard (the same way I did when there was no physical keyboard attached) but, with the physical keyboard attached
 it somehow held the setting.&nbsp; Now I have removed the physical keyboard and restarted without it and my onscreen keyboard is coming up as needed to enter text (the same as it was before the recent update).&nbsp;
<strong>Definitely a bug but if you have access to a physical keyboard this should work until Microsoft fixes this.</strong></p>

            Sometimes it takes a double tap to get it to come up.&nbsp; Otherwise if you right swipe choose settings choose the keyboard and click on the touch keyboard icon the keyboard will pop up if you are in a place that needs keyboard input.

<h2>            How to use Microsoft Apps without using Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>I have a desktop computer and have it set up using a local Microsoft account so I don't have to enter a password everytime I open up my computer.. I am the only person using this computer. &nbsp;Can I set my computer up so that I can use Microsoft Apps without
 using my microsoft account.. It seems senseless to me that I must sign in using a password .. and then when I do, it reconfigures my whole PC so that then I must use my Microsoft account to access my computer. &nbsp;I then spend half an hour resetting my password
 trying to figure out how to reset it to a local account again .. It seems a shame that I cannot use the Microsoft apps because I need a password... hope someone can help.</p>
