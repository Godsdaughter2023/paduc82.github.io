    <title>Can I extend a pass-through disk on a Hyper-V VM while the VM is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dupre29  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I extend a pass-through disk on a Hyper-V VM while the VM is running&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to expand a pass-through disk on a VM on a Hyper-V R2 (2008 R2 SP1) cluster while the VM is running?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, what is best practice? I have seen this done, and the other nodes of the cluster do not recognize the expanded LUN without running a rescan - which I don't like doing during the day. However, if the rescan is part of the procedure, I would like to
 know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also - sometimes there are IO errors on the MPIO paths going to that LUN when I have seen pass-through or CSV's expanded while running.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is a best practice for expanding pass-through disks while running, I would love to hear it or see the link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 tried to renew our friendship on xbox. Nothing works. All of us are have xbox gold status.</p>

Hi, I would try this, but I dont do this because, like I mentioned before its also on Windows and android app. i mean, its not a client problem or a problem with the console. There should be a problem with Microsoft backend. Also I can see the online status
 of all my other friends.

<p>Hi. Thanks for Support. Both accounts are adults. Another information: i can see all other friends. All other friends can see the status of my specific friend. And this specific friend can see my status too. But I can see him only as offline. Sorry, its

<p>Scott, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that your profile is being read by your console the wrong way. It has nothing to do with your friends list or any other account but yours. The only way you can get your console to RE READ your profile and assess what your friends are doing.
 You would have to Remove your whole account, from your Xbox entirely. Then you would have to re download your profile to the Xbox&nbsp;again. In order to help you Scott, you would need to try the troubleshooting we recommend to&nbsp;narrow down&nbsp;the problem. Otherwise
 you wont be able to get your friends online status. Make sure you have your email and password to your account before your remove it.</p>

    <title>&#39;&#39;User not found&#39;&#39; on Windows 7 Administrator-account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haaklong  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#39;&#39;User not found&#39;&#39; on Windows 7 Administrator-account</h2>
                    <p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've recently purchased a new Windows 8 P.C. for my father, his old Windows 7 P.C. takes 95 minutes to get started and he was getting pretty annoyed by it, I completely copied EVERYTHING to his new P.C. and it starts up in 2 and a ½ seconds, he uses both
 P.C.'s, but kept the&nbsp;Windows 7 one as ''a back-up'' (as it had all data <em>prior</em> to his Windows 8.1 (Blue) P.C. on it), as I was migrating his Waterfox data to the Mozilla Cloud-servers I put the wireless mouse into his laptop/notebook, I turned on his
 old P.C. (desktop) and it showed me the M.S. D.O.S. screen and said ''mouse not found'' so I booted it as I Always do during that error-screen.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>The problem:</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As I wanted to sing in to his Administator account it said ''user not found'', the password worked and it loaded for 10 seconds (up to a minute sometimes), for some reason I
<em>could</em> sign-into his Guest account and view and edit his main-account's files, but I can't do anything that needs the administrator's permission, if I want to delete an old account or open a new one it asks for the Administrator's password, it recognizes
 it when I make a mistake, but if I type the correct one it, the screen accepts it, but no action is taken.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In fact I can use it as ''a spare computer'', but the main-account doesn't function, though I've put ALL of his files in Microsoft SkyDrive, Google Drive and mostly Dropbox, I don't want to clean-install it as important data like saved passwords can get
 lost and my father doesn't write everything down on paper (he needs Waterfox for that). How can I access his main account without deleting it? how is this error fixed? I've read on other Windows support sites that clean installations are the only answer, but
 there's too much password-related data my father would rather not use.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for your solution, in advance.</p>

            It is a little unclear if you are referring to your Windows Live account/password or to your local Windows 8 account/password. Can you log on to your Windows 8 machine under an admin account?

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade&#47;update nags - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dondraper1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade&#47;update nags</h2>
                    Hi - my laptop came with Windows 10 Home Premium. I've used it without problems for a couple years, but recently I am getting constant and severe nags to update to the latest version of Windows 10.&nbsp; These nags are 'constantly interrupting my work'. They
 are authentic MS nags. The problem is... I run old versions of a couple programs that prevent the updates from completing, and these are old programs that I simply "can not" replace. I MUST continue to run these programs that run fine on Win 10 as is.&nbsp; My
 question: since it's impossible to complete the Win 10 updates with these programs installed... is there ANY way to disable all the nags???&nbsp; If not, I will be forced to revert back to Win 7 with a fresh install.&nbsp; Thanks for any answers!

<p>Hi Leon -</p>
<p>No, I hadn't tried the fix at the link you posted... but I just did.&nbsp; It seems to have eliminated a couple of the update nags, but I'm still getting a bunch.&nbsp; One is when I click to shut down the laptop my only options are: Update and shutdown, or Update
 and Restart.&nbsp; All I can do is close the lid, heh.&nbsp; If I try the update it will take about half an hour, but always ends in a fail saying I'm running an old program, and to uninstall it.&nbsp; I'm not able to do without this program.&nbsp; One thing I haven't tried is
 uninstalling the program... doing the update... and then trying to reinstall the program.&nbsp; I might try that, but I'm assuming the program won't install after the update?&nbsp; Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Don</p>

<h2>            Minecraft freezes after &#38;quot&#59;Initializing Server&#38;quot&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, my problem is that when I try to load my world on minecraft, it will let&nbsp;the loading bars go to the end, but before my physical character enters the game world, It crashes. The Xbox won't respond to any controller input (Home Button) and even after
 the power light turns off, the image will stay on for as much as 7 seconds.</p>
<p>This will only happen on Minecraft, and suspiciously right after an update for Minecraft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Info that might have caused it?</p>
<p>All of the pieces of that game are saved to a hard drive that has 190 GB left.</p>
<p>I am using an HDMI cable and when I have, it has been working fine.</p>
<p>I have tried Deleting and then downloading again to no avail.</p>
<p>I have NOT cleared the Cache. I want input as to whether I should. Last time that has been cleared was probably 3-4 months ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If extra info is needed, please let me know.</p>

<p>Hiya MiddlingKarma4 - You can try to clear the XBOX 360's System Cache, all this will do is remove the last title update and re-download it when you try to re-launch the game. See if that helps first, if that doesn't work, try to remove your XBOX 360's hard
 drive and try to use a USB Flash Drive and download your profile and Minecraft on there and try to launch it and see if all works well with that. Instructions on how to clear your system cache are located

<p>Not a Minecraft expert in anyway but if this only started happening after an update then your update was probably corrupted. If this is the case then clearing the cache and then redownloading the update should fix the problem.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Outlook Express is not available in Windows 8.1. However, you may refer to the following article for details related to setting up email:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Setting up email</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-8/setup-email-contacts-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-au/windows-8/setup-email-contacts-tutorial</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Mail app, which comes with Windows 8.1 and Windows RT 8.1, doesn't support adding email accounts that use POP (Post Office Protocol).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer to the article which would explain you about
<strong>using email accounts over POP on Windows 8.1 and Windows RT 8.1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/pop-email-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/pop-email-accounts</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. If you have any further issues on the computer, please post your question related to Windows and we will be happy to help you.</span></p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Because MS thinks they know what we want and what is best for us. I don't even like Windows Live Mail and have been using Thunderbird since migrating from XP to Win7 in 2009.</p>

    <title>Bluetooth keyboard &#47; mouse not working - not connected - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth keyboard &#47; mouse not working - not connected</h2>
                    <p>This is a new behavior as of today, but some instances were noted previously:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Equipment:&nbsp; Dell XPS Desktop ( MSFT Signature ), Microsoft Surface ergonomic keyboard, Microsoft Surface mouse ( both Bluetooth )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem:&nbsp; On bootup, the computer does not recognize the keyboard and mouse.&nbsp; In the past, the system flashes keyboard failure from the bios but then proceeded to the lock screen, and did work with these devices.&nbsp; Now it simply does not respond to either.&nbsp;
 It is locked in the lock screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a plug in keyboard and plug in mouse, I got the system to boot.&nbsp; Looking at Settings, both the mouse and keyboard are seen as paired in the Bluetooth setting.&nbsp; On the notification screen,&nbsp; Bluetooth is highlighted, but says Not Connected. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem started with Creators update.&nbsp; Even after that the keyboard and mouse were working until Friday but now neither works.&nbsp; The mouse is new, the keyboard is a few months old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using this with the MSFT ergonomic keyboard and mouse that use a dongle will work ... but Bluetooth does not. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>IMPORTANT TO NOTE: &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; 1)&nbsp; The two Bluetooth devices have not failed ... &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2)&nbsp; PLEASE DO NOT tell me to do a full system reset --- that is not an appropriate answer and wastes days of time</p>
<p>&nbsp; 3)&nbsp; This issue has resulted since the last set of updates ... so someone in engineering should have an answer</p>
<p>&nbsp; 4)&nbsp; PLEASE DO NOT tell me to post this in Feedback.&nbsp; They do not provide answers there and make it clear THIS is where we post questions if we want answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that in mind, does anyone have actual answers ( so sorry to be rather rude, but that comes from seeing so many inappropriate answers to posts ).</p>

<p>BEFORE I post a question, I read ALL of the available posts that might relate to the topic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, the problem is not unique, it has been reported, the engineers are supposedly aware of it already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The feedback app, if you read the article by the team that created and monitors it, is a keyword based system.&nbsp; When the keyword comes up often enough, then they look at the posts, and may pass on their findings to the engineers.&nbsp; The factor here is that
 ALL reports on a subject must use the same keyword, and that simply does not occur. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, it's not just he keyboard.&nbsp; In fact, it is a problem across devices, and it is related to the Bluetooth system, and it relates to both Microsoft BT mice, and keyboards.&nbsp; What worked prior to the Creator's Update, has since broken.&nbsp; I'm not the only
 one with this finding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an answer on one post that says to use the Troubleshooting Tool.&nbsp; Well that tool reports, and "fixes" the Bluetooth Radio status ... and when you run it again, it reports the exact same problem and fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other note.&nbsp; I use an Arc Touch Mouse on my SP4, and a Surface Mouse.&nbsp; The Arc is for travel, the desk mouse is for that purpose.&nbsp; Now,&nbsp; connect the Bluetooth Surface Mouse, then later try to use the Arc, and you have to re-pair it.&nbsp; That's also a new
 failure with Creator's update.</p>

<h2>            Recovery options in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am using lenovo Z5070 laptop. i upgraded to windows 10 from windows 8.1, when i tried to rollback to win 8.1 it did not happen since it showed some necessary files were missing. After one month of upgrading, i tried RESET MY PC option in which there was
 another option which stated 'reset to factory settings &amp; will take you back to previous version of windows' . i also have a onkey recovery option so can i use to this to revert back to previous version.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why your files is missing because it was moved from different folder after the update.&nbsp;It would be great if you can provide us more details about this issue:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were you able to search the documents using the file name? </li><li>Is it happening to all files and documents?</li><li>When accessing documents/folders are you getting any error messages? </li><li>If possible, can you send us a screenshot?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hello Dyan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for replying - I really appreciate. I am sorry for the long delay in responding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did locate my files.&nbsp; Almost all my personal files had been moved to a one drive folder.&nbsp; I have not encountered problems so far with my files, apart from outlook emails which have disappeared from the Windows app (another frustration).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have started to get a blue screen when I leave my laptop in sleep mode. I will probably have to raise another request for technical assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving my personal files was done without my knowledge, and presumably I had little choice in the matter.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should not be moving personal files and if I did not have a choice then it would have been good customer service from Microsoft to have a standard email or notification on changes to personal files, etc, following an update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My feedback is probably pointless, and this is not directed at you personally as you are providing assistance, but as an ordinary home user I am beginning to get weary of Microsoft's approach to its customers.&nbsp; From its constant pushing of one drive as its
 default file storage, a service I do not need, to making it difficult setting up guest accounts on home computers (a cynical ploy for garnering new users), and problems with updates, I've lost many hours trying to sort out problems with Windows 10 (on a relatively
 new laptop).&nbsp; Microsoft is not enhancing my user experience by trying to control and restrict my service needs and behaviour.&nbsp; They are doing a good job in pushing me to move to Linux for my next laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help, I am genuinely grateful for you getting back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>Fin</p>

            <p>Hello PamParnell, <br />
<br />
What is the software program you are trying to install? It may be that it is not compatible with Windows 7.
<br />
You can check the following site for Windows 7 compatibility:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also need to contact the software manufacturer for assistance with their program for error code definitions.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />
Marilyn <br />
</p>

    <title>New windows 10 PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donluis  say:</h3>
<h2>            New windows 10 PC</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Just bought new XP8900. So far found out that my Microsoft VX-3000 webcam won't</p>
<p>work on windows 10. Next, tried to print and turns out my Officejet 4500 won't work either.</p>
<p>I have an HP wireless printer and will try that. Looks like I will be returning my PC and look for an older model.</p>
<p>After spending $760 I don't want to go through and replace all my peripherals. Doesn't seem honest to me to not support</p>
<p>older equipment. Any tips on how on can get this equipment working?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Lou</p>

<p>&nbsp;. . . and (at worst) change the compatibility to Windows 8.1 - although I bet it installs natively.</p>

            <p>In addition to what Shenan explained:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft doesn't decide whether to support older hardware; hardware manufacturers decide whether to support the next version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're a hardware manufacturer deciding whether to support the next version of Windows, you're probably asking yourself "which of my products are people likely to continue to buy to use on Windows 10?" They're not likely to buy your older products, so
 you're not going to invest the money to develop Windows 10 drivers for those products. Got it? Just follow the money trail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before thinking about upgrading to a new operating system, it's a good idea to see if all your hardware will work with the new OS. No need to ask me how I learned that lesson, okay?</p>

<h2>            CD playback distortion with certain discs using Acer Aspire 7540, Windows 7, &#38; Realtek Audio</h2>
                    <span>A number of people on here appear to have the same problem but I cannot see a single solution even though the system shows them as having been answered. &nbsp;</span>
                    <span>A number of people on here appear to have the same problem but I cannot see a single solution even though the system shows them as having been answered. &nbsp;</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I&nbsp;have only just realised I have this problem but perhaps it has always been there. &nbsp;I have an Acer Aspire 7540 Laptop using Windows 7 and Realtek Audio, which I bought a couple of years ago and is out of
 warranty . &nbsp;What struck me as I've been reading all the similar entries about audio distortion on certain CDs only, is that the CD I have noticed it with is a Muse CD from Warner music - something others have linked it to also. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>The CD/DVD drive plays DVDs fine, and most CDs fine but with others (in my case Absolution by Muse issued by Warner Music) there is distortion making playback&nbsp;untenable. &nbsp;</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>The import into itunes reflects the same playback distortion, and using Windows Media player makes no difference. &nbsp;I even rebought the Muse CD thinking the CD had warped or something only to find the same
 issue with the brand new one. &nbsp;Suspecting then the CD drive, I tested both the CDs in a different player and they were both fine. Most of my music collection (890 albums) seems fine but there may be other albums I just havent listen to since importing them
 and so dont know they have the same problem, and I rarely play CDs on my laptop after importing them the first time.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I have tried a number of solutions suggested by Microsoft and others (disabling enhancements, mic-in settings, resetting of the default player, using the troubleshooter - nothing found, and reloading the
 device driver) and nothing has fixed it. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>So in conclusion there seems to be a suggestion it is a Windows 7 software issue possibly linked to certain CDs such as those by Warner Music but no solution as far as I can see has been published other than
 buy another laptop lol! &nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Has anyone found a solution given loads of people have had this problem from at least 2 years ago - I suspect at the release of Windows 7 if the truth be known as I would really appreciate fixing this without
 having to go into PC world and pay lots of money? &nbsp;</span></div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; What is the format of the file that you are trying to play?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Have you made any changes to your computer recently?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps and check if it helps.</p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            It's a music CD I was trying to play...not a file. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>No, no changes made to my computer and as I say the problem has probably been there since I first loaded my music into itunes since the ripped version done some time ago was distorted just the same as me trying to play the CD more recently which suggests
 it has always been the case.
<div><br />
<div>I have already tried reloading the drivers - no resolution.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The hardware is all working just fine with other CDs, DVDs and MP3 files &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't fully understand codecs even from that page but I followed the instructions in "How do I tell which Codec was used..." and nothing is shown against any of the tracks on the CD, and given itunes and Windows media should play popular CDs like that
 from Muse - I really dont think this is valid.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The soundcard is just fine...I have already run the troubleshooter and there are no problems as I said with sound coming from other CDs, DVDs and MP3 tracks</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks but none of these suggestions resolve the issue.</div>

            I am having exactly the same problem with playing certain Cds, and with getting any relevant help on this website. You may be right about Warner Music CDs being the issue as I have tried to play Warner CDs by Neil Young and Led Zeppelin and had the same
 problem, however other CDs from Warner work fine. I've heard of protection from copying being written into the discs but with the option to download software which would allow you to copy legitimately bought music onto MP3 players etc.
<div>I am also anxious to get some help regarding this problem as it's stopping me from being able to listen to some of my favourite music as I would wish.</div>

            Bad laptop speakers ? Not a software problem i fear. Maybe certain frequencies are affecting the speakers ?<br />
<br />
Google this : the loudness wars<br />
<br />
You can't get digital clipping (distortion) unless the original files have been "maximised" or "limited" to sound as loud as possible and have been mastered as such. You lose a lot of the different tracks dynamics that way, but they are LOUD (and when you turn
 up the volume) on a mediocre system can become distorted).<br />
<br />
There is no solution, unfortunately, other than play it on a hi fi system and not through crappy laptop speakers (lets be honest here, they're not the best in the world ...... !) and play it at low volume.<br />
<br />
Prolly not what you want to hear (sic), but its a problem in the music business nowadays.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<h2>            Windows Live Mail Crashing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 7 and Windows Essentials 2012 (Windows Live Mail Version 2012 (Build 16.4.3564.1216)).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since the upgrade at the end of last year (2015) WLM has been very fragile.&nbsp; I have followed your advice and run the Windows Essentials repair tool.&nbsp; WLM then works for between a few minute or a few hours before crashing again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also since the upgrade calendars do not [always] sync with mobile devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would appear from your various fora that I am not the only one experiencing this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise if there is a fix likely to be available in the immediate future?</p>
                </div>

            Hi Ralph.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) The most promising fixes for 100% Disk Usage are here: 
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-100-disk-usage-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-100-disk-usag...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-100-percent-disk-usage-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-100-pe...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Disk Read error occurred. Press CTRL &#43; ALT &#43; DEL to restart</h2>
                    <p>Right so my laptop (Toshiba Satellite) is a bit messed up. No idea but I keept getting that it has an error reading the drive press ctrl alt del.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to my other laptop and created a boot disk for windows 7 and put it in this laptop. I changed the boot order in the BIOS so it would pop up. The repair loaded up to a stage where I select my driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>This where my issue lies. I got two choices: select a driver or use a previous image of the PC. The second option did not work. I want to try the first one but i dont know what driver I choose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>run Bootrec commands from Windows recovery environment

<h2>            Change app default installation drive - Greyed out</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I have just updated my aver Ionia 8w to windows 10. I had heard that in windows 10 you can change the default app installation drive. Now, here is the problem, I can see the option to do this , but it is greyed out. Upon searching I read that this
 is not the case and that this option is coming soon. Is this true, or am I missing something here. Is there any way to enable this now or is there a ETA when this will be available as this is the main reason I stayed with windows on this tablet rather than
 looking at alternatives.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help and infomation</p>

 someone on the line also with an Indian accent who said he was a supervisor.&nbsp; The "supervisor" repeated the request for me to run supremocontrol.&nbsp; I requested an email with a way to authenticate the call but he refused to send an email.&nbsp; He gave me this phone
