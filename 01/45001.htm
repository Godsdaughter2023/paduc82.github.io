<h2>            Xbox 360 wireless controller - Win 8.1</h2>
                    Dear All,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a generic xbox 360 wireless controller but I can't get to install it! I tried every method I could find!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p><font color="#000000">You may follow the methods provided to fix the damaged Windows Installer file.</font></p>
<p><strong><font color="#000000">Method 1:</font></strong></p>
<font color="#000000">
<p><br />
Start the Windows Installer service</p>
<p><br />
1.&nbsp;Press Windows key + R, in the search box type Services.msc and press {ENTER}&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp;Double-click Windows Installer&nbsp;<br />
3.&nbsp;Set the Startup type of Windows Installer to Manual&nbsp;<br />
4.&nbsp;Click Start to start the service. Note down the error message if any.&nbsp;<br />
5.&nbsp;Click OK.</p>
</font>
<p><font color="#000000"><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2: Unregister and re-register the Windows Installer to do that follow the steps provided below.</strong></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press Windows Key + R, type MSIEXEC /UNREGISTER, and then click OK. Even if you&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs.&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, click Run, type MSIEXEC /REGSERVER, and then click OK. Even if you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs, or you may briefly see an hourglass.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After you run this command, the operation is complete.&nbsp;<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Try your Windows Installer-based application again.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Then I also tried to install it with my dad original DVD from Microsoft (he has a genuine xbox controller) nothing! I don't know what to do!&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><br />
</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Can anyone help?</font></p>

            <p>I have the exact same problem, the 'Xbox 360 wireless receiver' would not detect under Windows 8.1, the Xbox accessory driver installed fine (even tried installing using compatibility as suggested), once installed and the wireless receiver is plugged in,
 nothing would be shown under device (no new device when plugged in either)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i plug the 'USB cable' to the 'Xbox 360 controller' it would then be detected as
&nbsp;'Xbox 360 via Play &amp; Charge Kit', (which still need the wireless receiver in order to use the controller)&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please fix this Microsoft, the XBox 360 controller is still on sale and does not work with Windows 8.1, I don't even know why you guys keep suggesting to do this and do that, it does not detect under Windows 8.1 at all. Please at least try and see if you
 can get it working yourself. Don't tell me you guys don't have a controller and win 8.1 to test it</p>

            <p>I've tried going through those guide how many time now, the result is still the same.
<strong>Windows 8.1</strong> does <strong><em>not detect</em></strong> the <strong>
W</strong><strong>ireless Receiver</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When i plug the <strong>Wireless Receiver</strong> in <strong>USB</strong> port:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The <strong><em>Green Light</em></strong>&nbsp;of <strong>Wireless Receiver</strong>&nbsp;remain
<strong><em>Off</em></strong> once plugged in.<br />
</p>
<p>2. <strong>New Hardware</strong> is not detected, so there are no usual pop up dialog.<br />
</p>
<p>3. Even after installing driver (<strong>Windows 7 64bit</strong>), <strong>Windows 8.1</strong> still does not able to detect the
<strong>Wireless Receiver</strong>. (Driver are downloaded from <strong><em>http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/xbox-360-wireless-controller-for-windows</em></strong>)</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">4. <strong>Wireless Receiver</strong>&nbsp;device does not show up under
<strong>Device and Printer</strong>&nbsp;or under <strong>Device Manager</strong>. Not even listed as an
<strong>Unknown Hardware.&nbsp;</strong>Only thing that is detected is: <strong>XBOX 360 Wireless Controller Via Play and Charge kit</strong> (Which is the controller plugged in to the
<strong>USB port</strong>, but it would still need the <strong>Wireless Receiver</strong> in order for the controller to work)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. After <strong>Driver installation,</strong>&nbsp;in <strong>Device Manager</strong> under
<strong>Human Interface Devices</strong> there are also no:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>HID-compliant game controller</strong></li><li><strong>USB Human Interface Device</strong></li></ul>
<p>&nbsp; There are also no <strong>Microsoft Common Controller for Windows Class&nbsp;</strong>and the entry:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Xbox 360 Controller for Windows</strong></li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>6. I've tried plugging it under <strong>USB 2.0</strong> and <strong>USB 3.0</strong> port, both have the same result which I've listed above.<br />
</p>
<p>7. The <strong>Xbox 360 Wireless Receiver</strong> and <strong>Xbox 360 Controller</strong> are both
<strong>Genuine Microsoft</strong> product not <em>aftermarket</em> or <em>generic
</em>hardware.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Device is <em><strong>not faulty</strong></em> because it still
<strong><em>function</em></strong> and <em><strong>detect</strong></em> perfectly if I plug it under my sister
<strong>Windows 7</strong> but <em>not</em><strong> Windows 8.1</strong>&nbsp;on my computer. (It also used to be able to detect as an
<strong>"Unknown Hardware"</strong> on <strong>Windows 8</strong> before i updated
<strong>Windows to 8.1</strong>, after the update does not detect at all and this is the result)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So its not compatible with Windows 8.1 right? Please let Microsoft driver team know about this problem thanks, so they can release fix or an updated drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also any thing else i need to check? Like are there any specific Windows services that are required to be running for it to work?</p>

            This is SERIOUSLY making me mad. WHY in world would MICROSOFT NOT allow us to use a MICROSOFT controller???? How does that make sense? Come on guys!!! UPDATE THE DRIVER PLEASE!! It wouldn't even be that hard to do, especially if there's more than one guy
 working on it, it'll get done in a few hours (not including testing time before release). PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE FIX THIS!!!

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This thread is quite old, but as it pop ups in google I think I can provide some help to someone else with the very same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First step is to download and install the driver indicated in the links above, from microsoft downloads page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/es-es/d/xbox-360-wireless-controller-for-windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>This alone will not work, then you have to go to your device manager, and then properties, then when you try to update the driver, indicate you want to choose from drivers in your computer (the option is the small one below the big two ones). Once there
 go to xbox pheriperals, then choose wireless adapter, and that should do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!!</p>
        </p>

            Found the answer by trying to find a generic driver since the ones in Microsoft were not working. Apparently it will not work if u look for them automatically. Go to the option where u browse through drivers in your computer then go to have disk and look
 for the .inf file in the cd or from the folder you download from microsoft xbox 360 controller drivers. &nbsp;Again it boils down to finding the .inf file.

<h2>            Norton Download Manager</h2>
                    



I use Windows Defender as my AV protection.  I DO NOT have or ever had any Norton product on my computer.  After the Anniversary update was installed, I booted up and this Norton Download Manager screen popped up and read "Your current Norton program is not compatible with Windows 10 and you can update it by clicking "Next" below".  There is NO exit  or close icons on this screen, only in the taskbar.  There is an icon to lower the screen to the taskbar and another icon in the "boot-up" section of the taskbar.  There were also 2 icons on the desktop.  I deleted the desktop icons to the Recycle Bin and then emptied it.  I then went to the "Programs and Features" section of the Control Panel and deleted the Norton file listed there.  I then went to "Settings/Taskbar" and discovered it was "Frozen" and I couldn't make any changes to any of the "Start-up" icons there.  The Norton icon was listed there as being "OFF", but was in the taskbar.  I then did a computer search for Norton Download

            <p>There are no third-party programs included with the Anniversary Update, so you didn't get anything from Symantec with the AU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever you install a third-party program, always be careful of other, unrelated software that may be added without your knowledge. When you install a third-party program, always choose the 'Custom' installation, which gives you the opportunity to prevent

<h2>            System Settings to Defaults Without Formatting&#47;Deleting HDD&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Forums,</p>
<p>I am in need of help. <strong>I would like to know how to Reset all System Settings back to it's Original Factory Default Settings without having to format and/or delete contents on the Hard Drive?</strong> Once again I would like to restore all settings
 back to original Factory settings without having to involve the Hard Drive. How can I accomplish this?</p>

<p>I am able to do this on the PS3 by going into Settings &gt; System settings &gt; Restore Default Settings. This in effect restores all settings back to original factory default settings without formatting and/or deleting anything on the Hard Drive. Is there a
 similar option on the Xbox 360?</p>
<p>I have been told to delete the System Update, clear the Cache and finally hold down the power button for a few seconds. I can confirm these options do not work for restoring original factory settings.
<strong>The only option that I know that works IS THE ONE I AM ABSOLUTELY NOT GOING TO DO, which is Formatting the Hard Drive.</strong></p>
<p>Please help me. If you cannot tell by now, I really do not want to have to Format/Delete my Hard Drive just to fix the settings.</p>

<p>The only way I can find to do this is to run the Initial setup.</p>
<p>That's more or less a factory reset that doesn't wipe the hard drive.</p>
<p>Also if you want to do this to go back to the original dashboard software from the factory you can't. It's just not possible to go back to earlier dashboard software.</p>

<h2>            Create shortcut for CD Rom</h2>
                    I am used to ejecting my CD or DVD thru my shortcut on my desktop. I have been unable to find a way to do that in Windows 10. Can someone tell me how to create a shortcut on my desktop for that drive. Thanks

            <p>Okay I was able to resolve this issue by the "hunt and peck" method and I will post this in the event that someone else might have the same "dilemma".</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your task bar and select the folder "file explorer" &gt; left click</li><li>Than with a DVD or CD already in your PC,&nbsp; click on "this PC" (left column)</li><li>Go to BD Rom drive and "right click" &gt; select "pin to quick access"</li><li>Your drive than shows up in "frequent folders"</li><li>You&nbsp;&nbsp;than are &nbsp;<em>finally</em> able to "right click" the BD-ROM drive and scroll down to "create shortcut"</li></ol>
<p>There it is the "new and improved" way to "Create a shortcut"?? Thanks Windows 10 Geeks!</p>

            Put a CD in your drive, then open your File Explorer (right click Windows icon) and your DVD RW drive will be displayed.&nbsp; Drag this "display" onto your desk top and a short cut will be created.&nbsp; Then, all you have to do is right click the short click and
 choose "Eject" when you want to open your drive.

<h2>            Networked &#40;NOT shared&#41; printer goes Offline after reboot &#40;Win7x64&#41; and must reinstall</h2>
                    
<p>I built a new PC for a client using Win7x64, and installed their existing Canon MF4370dn printer on the ETHERNET network (this is NOT shared by windows, the printer has its own print server).</p>
<p>The printer works great until the PC is rebooted. After a reboot, the printer is greyed out in "Devices and Printers" and must be deleted and then re-installed in order to work again.</p>
<p>There is also a Brother networked printer that works fine after a reboot. I'm thinking it's a Canon driver issue, but I have also seen this same problem posted all over the Internet with different printer makes and models, so I just thought I'd ask if anyone
 knows of a Windows issue here.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>As a first step put the two Network printers on a static IP that is out of the Router's DHCP range.</p>
<p>Then install the printer’s drivers and managing software through the printer's configuration utility.</p>
<p>When it comes to Network Ready printers, just installing the Drivers usually do not enable the printer's overall functions. The printer’s software utility has to be software on each Networked computer.</p>

<h2>            Computer waking from hibernate in the night</h2>
                    <p>Recently my computer has started waking from hibernate during the night. This has happened before but was fixed by doing a system restore, which I have tried and isn't hasn't fixed it. Looking in event log at the time it turned on, there is an event from

            Have already tried this, however I doubt this is to do with windows itsself.&nbsp; The previous time I had this problem waketimers would show "Automatic Maintenance" as the source.&nbsp; I have read online about "Legacy kernal caller" and people are saying the issue
 is to do with an old driver? Documentation on this problem is scarce, maybe someone has more info on this?

 i can now see other player’s custom pic. On any other microsoft web page it says that the account is adult but on smartglass and the console, it acts like im 12 or something. Any way i can fix this iritating bug?

<p>We have been gaming for 7 years and have our doors open for GOW 3 and MW3. The Known Outlaws are looking for gamers, 16+ of age, who are competitive/casual, have fun and love to win matches. We are an elite clan. We are The Known Outlaws(KO). We have teams
 who work hard to be where they are today. KO is about being a part of something bigger then yourself. Your voice, hard work, and dedication will not go unnoticed. Possibly even rewarded on your dedication to the clan. KO has been around for 7 years and has
 20+ members. We are looking for spots to be filled in Reach, Black Ops, and GOW 3 at this time.<br />
<br />
<strong>Games we play:</strong><br />
<br />
GOW3<br />
Halo<br />
BO<br />
<br />
<strong>Coming soon:</strong><br />
<br />
Battlefield<br />
MW3<br />
Halo 4<br />
<br />
<strong>KO Nights:</strong><br />
<br />
Some clans don't have this where everyone gets together on the same game and plays. Oh do we play as a team, wreck havoc on maps, cause people on the other teams to quit cause they fear us, and we have people challenge our strength. But KO also has fun, and
 over all enjoy each others company. We do not go by kills or who won us the match. We simply win for KO. We do not go by KD. We go by attitude, and how much you really want to be in a really awesome elite clan. You are stronger together than alone. If you
 are tired of rage quitters and team members quitting when you may have been able to win the match. Then come and give KO a try, we have structure, and we move as a unit. We also have many strong members in our clan who you will meet and simply enjoy the atmosphere
 that KO has to offer.<br />
<br />
Here in KO, we help with gamers who wish to become better in skill and wish to just kill enemies on game. We have many gamers who do one on one time with members to help them out with whatever they wish to get better at, snipers, DMR, MlG, ect. We do not judge,
 we help each other succeed in the clan. KO trains and works hard to become better.<br />
<br />
If interested please contact KO Tatsuke300 who is the recruit and Co-Leader in KO. She will direct you and try you out for KO material. The trial lasts up to ten days, this is mainly for attitude towards others and to see what you have in skill. Skill may place
 you on a team, which helps us crush other clans and get us to victory and soon GBs. Looking forward to meeting a lot of you on the battle field!</p>
<p><strong>What does KO have to offer you?</strong>&nbsp;We have member of the month, our clan is small so any help you do will be rewarded. We have a thousand achievements for you to complete and will appear on your profile. We have events, KO Nights, and we are
 working on getting into tournaments. We have a lot to offer you here at KO. We do have a clan council meeting that you can be apart of and get your ideas or concerns out there! In KO we let the members get what they want out of KO. The admins provide the game
 play. Its an awesome clan, you have a 10 day trial and then you get to see what KO has in stored for you. Its an awesome clan if you are looking for team work, a good place to always find someone on. As we have said, we do not go by KD. We go for the W at
 the end of every match, &nbsp;Its an awesome atmosphere.</p>

<p>First I pulled the pack off then put back in went to turn the controller on it wouldn't turn on now oh for F*&amp;k sake, tried a couple times - it wouldn't work, So I thought ok i will put the pack in my other controller hey pristo the controller turned on
 plugged up the charge cable working as it should (and still is) &amp; the extra funny thing is I put the normal AA battery pack on the original controller and it turned on first time (put play &amp; charge pack onto it to try one more time &amp; NO didn't turn on).</p>
<p>Anyone had this problem before - is my decent controller starting to crap out?</p>
<p>Just seems like a wierd issue to happen.</p>

<p>I have one controller that will not charge using the play &amp; charge. Two others work fine. I have no idea why this happens.

<p><span>I had one of my batteries do like that...blinking on the controller, put it on the charger and the charge light went from red to green, PDQ.&nbsp; But I left it on there, since I already had a good battery.&nbsp; Still, I wonder if it'll
 be fully charged when I use it?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I dont know why they dont make a new controller with internal battery sorta like the ps3 or cell phone where u just have to plug it in instead of having that PAGER stuck on the bottom of controller... &nbsp;Sometime when i charge my controller, &nbsp;it doesnt charge
 and have to remove then connect again &nbsp;to start charge....&nbsp; <strong>AND FOR GODS SAKE, REMAKE THE D-PAD...</strong> I got that new controller with the dpad transforms....The top&nbsp;broke off&nbsp;after playing mortal kombat</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(153, 51, 0, 1)">I have a NEW controller I bought two months ago and it was working fine gave me 3 days of game play before I needed to charge it back up. Ever since this new update hit our systems
 my controller acts like yours does, 3 seconds full charge, 10 seconds later red light needs to be charged up again. it’s the update that has cause these little issues and I am sure they will fix all issues one day but fro right now we have to deal with it.</span></p>

<h2>            Game download stuck at 16&#37;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, last night I bought Borderlands 2 from the games marketplace i left it to download and when i came back it wasnt in my active downloads or my games, i went to re-download it and it jumped straight up to 16% as if it were carrying on from the previous
 attempt then it just never moves, iv tried deleting it off my hard drive, clearing the cache and then re downloading it but it just gets stuck at 16% again when it gets there, any ideas??</p>

<h2>            New Skype is worse than the old Skype</h2>
                    The new Skype is worse than the old Skype.&nbsp; They hid everything with images so that it is very difficult to figure out how to do things with the app.&nbsp; Just trying to send files I have to click on all these buttons first before I know what they do.&nbsp; I think
 buttons with words on them are better.&nbsp; Or trying to share my screen that's also very hard to figure out how to do.&nbsp; I suppose the new trend in programming is to make button without words and let users figure out what they do but this is a mistake.&nbsp;

<p>For me, the loss of an adequate search function in the conversations is MAJOR! I use Skype to communicate with my subcontractors and frequently have to search through months of intensive chats to find an elements we discussed previously, a strategy, a price
 we agreed or other things like this. The new version DOES NOT allow that level of search, whatever the developers say.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not an upgrade, it's a downgrade! I'm very, very upset and am bitterly looking for alternatives to Skype for e-collaboration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds to me that Microsoft had been building Skype to enhance e-collaboration, not make it worst! What is the deal with this "upgrade"???</p>

<h2>            Microsoft wired Keyboard 600 keeps connecting and disconnecting each time I press a button.</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>Unfortunately now I know that hundreds of people are having my same issues with this bloody keyboard.</p>
<p>The workaround posted here (Unticking the power management of the keyboard in Device Manager to disable the PC option to save power) is NOT WORKING on my desktop (ACER Veriton X2631G) with Windows 10 64 bit.</p>
<p>I disabled even the&nbsp;option&nbsp;in the power settings (USB settings) and in the "Human interface devices", not only in the keyboard settings.</p>
<p>I installed the latest "Mouse and keyboard center" with no results.</p>
<p>The PC is updated and everything is working fine. Apart this keyboard.</p>
<p>I am so fed up with Microsoft products that this is the last time I buy one of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other solutions? Is anybody able to have this keyboard working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>

<p>I want to update this post to say that finally I found the perfect solution.</p>
<p>After many days passed on trying to make this keyboard up and running, I finally decided to trash it and put it to the place where it belongs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the perfect solution for this garbage of Microsoft and, do not worry, I will not buy your products anymore.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem and none of the above solutions helped but I think I just got it.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with the keyboard it's windows trying to save power by shutting off the USB (or rather going into a low-power mode) when it's not actively being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming you're using Win10</p>
<p>Go into Device Manager</p>
<p>Open 'Human InterfaceDevices'</p>
<p>On each 'USB Input Device' (as it's pretty much impossible to tell which is the keyboard port)</p>
<p>Right click and click 'Properties'</p>
<p>Click the 'Power Management' tab</p>
<p>Uncheck 'Allow the computer to turn off this device....'</p>
<p>Click 'OK'</p>

            <p>thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>I had already tried this solution because I found it in some other forum: NO WAY.</p>
<p>That is why I consider my request in this post unresolved.</p>
<p>Or better, it is solved: the satisfaction I had throwing this keyboard in the garbage is PRICELESS.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to install the keyboard drivers in a compatibility mode and check if this helps.</p>

<p>Hi G.A.,</p>
<p>The&nbsp;hardware&nbsp;manufacturer creates the drivers that Win7 uses.</p>
<p>If your not able to to find the cable manufacturer, you may not be able locate a compatible driver.</p>

<p>I just bought a new HP W7 computer tower and have a 2yr old keyboard with PS/2 plug. I have a Microsoft keyboard ps/2 to usb adaptor but the computer will not recognize it and therefore will not let me use the keyboard. The new keyboard does not have all
 the buttons &amp; functions of the older one so I really want to use the older one. Same problem as the other 2 people, but hopefully this extra info will help. &nbsp;I need a driver - any suggestions where to get it?</p>

<p>Hi, Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see if you can work this one out:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a generic adapter for my PS/2 keyboard. &nbsp;It worked fine for about a year and then stopped suddenly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After waiting a few months, I plugged it back in and it worked again for a few months and then one day it stopped again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is nuts! &nbsp;The device driver list shows that the PS/2 keyboard is there, is recognized, and according to the list, is working perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are forums that say reinstall drivers, etc. &nbsp;None of that works. The USB to PS/2 adapter is a simple item that says MADE IN CHINA on it--no manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is it possible for it to work for a year, stop working, work again, and then stop working? &nbsp;I have neither moved nor changed ANYTHING in the setup (Lenovo ThinkPad running MS 7 Professional with SP 1 and all current updates.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Richard</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah, that's sufficient storage required for <strong>Windows 8.1</strong>. FYI,
<strong>Windows 8.1</strong> needs atleast <strong>16 GB</strong> for <em>32-bit</em> edition and
<strong>20 GB</strong> for <em>64-bit</em> edition installation, respectively.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answers your query :)</p>

            <p>Although technically 50GB will be sufficient because it exceeds the hardware requirements in practice it is going to be very small and will potentially run out very quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have other storage then making a few changes as soon as you have installed Windows can move some of the folders onto another drive and reduce their impact on the C: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will also have to use the Disk Cleanup &gt; Clean System files on a regular basis to prevent build up of the Windows Update archive which is created for every update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a Program Files directory on the second disk and use the Custom install option available with most programs to redirect the install. You cannot move the Program Files directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point is although Kapil is technically correct, it falls within the minimum hardware requirements it is very likely you will have issues with space within a very short time. Only very aggressive maintenance could mitigate this and whatever you do do
 not consider the automatic maintenance tools you can get. Their value is dubious at best and this would fall well outside their scope.</p>

            <p>No, it isn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A working Windows 8.1 installation can rise to 100gb and above when everything that you want or need is added to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additions include page files, programs, utilities, updates, data files etc.. plus you want 25% free space on the drive for optimum performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set the space for 150gb and let Windows manage the page file.. </p>

            <p>Agreed Mike :) I thought that the TS was asking about space he need at the time of installation. Considering about a 30 GB margin, 50 GB looks justified. But as you said, its better to have around 150 GB if one one wants to put lots of data. The extra space
 required is dynamic and can differ for according to requirements of one.</p>

<p>Good day!</p>

            <p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>The process went like this. You download and run, it asks if it was an install or uninstall problem with a program and I said uninstall, then it gives you a list of programs to choose from and mine was not on the list so I chose "not listed". It then asked
 for the 13 digit product code an I tried to use the product key off my MS Office 2010 disc and it said I had used the wrong code as it had more #'s/letters than it asked for anyway. So anyway, YESTERDAY in fact, I was using the MS Ofice 365 program and it
 was malfunctioning by setting dozens of copies of old drafts of emails and an email I had sent that day into trash. Well in asked me finally if MS Office (some component of 2010) had uninstalled improperly and I&nbsp;clicked &nbsp;YES and it asked if I wanted to uninstall
 with compatibility mode or something, and I clicked "yes". I hope it is fixed now but who knows. So I tried Buddy, to use your method&nbsp;and Shawn I really appreciate you taking the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What really disturbs me is the monopolistic attitude Microsoft takes to their&nbsp; errors in safeguarding the public in disbursing a new OS. I tried to get help from Microsoft Tech support after Win 8.1 uninstall had totally bombed this uninstall of a MICROSOFT
 PROGRAM (Office 2010)&nbsp;WHILE TRYING TO INSTALL A MICROSOFT PROGRAM (Office 2013)&nbsp;IN A MICROSOFT WINDOWS 8.1 ENVIRONMENT. The foreign national was so sweet and delightful in telling me I could just pay the $149.00 fee for a YEAR of Tech Support, "SIT BACK AND
 RELAX" ....which had NOTHING to do with what I was asking but was trying to get a corporation to take RESPONSIBILITY for their IRRESPONSIBLE&nbsp;dissemination of an untried OS by simply fixing the problem it had caused on the $1200 system I purchased with their
 OS on it.&nbsp;I hope there will be better care taken of the loyal customers who in the forthcoming years will have additional options, because I for one, do not want to leave Microsoft as I am comfortable there, but all have their limits of being treated without
 respect after giving unyielding support to an entity of business or a person for that matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OH! and instead of the problem being fixed, so I could install the software to run my HP Officejet, I HAD TO PURCHASE ANOTHER PRINTER BECAUSE I COULD NOT GET HELP. I am thankful I have been Blessed with the ability to do that, but what about those students
 and young kids in single parent homes who cannot?</p>

<h2>            Saving Files to the desktop</h2>
                    I have a couple of files saved on the desktop itself and whenever I resave the file, it moves the file to the "next spot" on the left hand side of the screen, regardless of where I have the icon placed. How do I get this to stop?

            Hello salex1988;<br />
<br />
We are not sure of what you mean by "saving" those Word and Excel files to the desktop.&nbsp;<br />
If those files are completed projects&nbsp;on the desktop, the they are already "saved to the desktop" and there is no need to save them again.&nbsp;
<br />
If you are still working&nbsp;with those files by adding data to them, changing the file names,&nbsp;and then saving your progress; then those Word and Excel Icons may return to the default location on the desktop (upper left).&nbsp; Is this the case?&nbsp;
<br />
I've always used "My Documents" for staging ongoing Word and Excel projects.&nbsp; Using the desktop for this purpose may cause changes in the Icons location.&nbsp; However, I've never experiemented with this, so I'm not sure.&nbsp; I think that this is how working files
 saved to the desktop are supposed to react and there may not be a way to stop it without&nbsp;creating a&nbsp;"My Projects" sub-folder for them on the desktop in lieu of&nbsp;working working with them directly from the Desktop or from "My Documents".<br />
<br />
Does this help?<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />Are you trying to clear your web browser cache? If you tell me what browser you use, I can give you detailed instructions on how to delete it. 
<br />
<br />These 2 folder locations are temp files which can wiped out as well. 
<br />
<br />C:\Windows\Temp - ctrl + a and delete the contents. 
<br />
<br />C:\Users\YOURACCOUNT\App Data\Local\Temp (If AppData doesn’t display, go into control panel, file explorer options, and make sure show hidden files / folders is checked off”
<br />
<br />Let me know about the browser and I'll send back the info!

<br />1. Windows 10 Update Cache - The worst offender is the recent November 2015 Update that Microsoft pushed. The update itself is great, but it uses up to 24 GB of cache space and doesn’t automatically clear itself after the update is applied.

<br />Why Do You Have to Clear Cache?
<br />You certainly don’t have to, not as a regular part of computer or smartphone maintenance, anyway.
<br />You might also want to clear the cache if you’re experiencing issues like 404 errors or 502 errors (among others), sometimes indications that your browser’s cache is corrupted.

<br />Are your Windows updates completing successfully? Or, are your Windows Updates failing? Apparently the problem is not too uncommon. Unfortunately, I realized that my main notebook had not updated Windows 10 since February 2017, and it was now mid-April. 
<br />
<br />#1 Manual Reset Windows Updates
<br />the problems remain, you have to revert to a manual process to reset Windows Update
<br />Check that System Restore is turned on and configured 
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2955023/windows/how-to-turn-on-system-restore-in-windows-10-to-protect-against-bad-updates.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2955023/windows...</a>

<br />
<br />Create a System restore point. (<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402753...</a> )
<br />Use the following process to effectively delete the folders used by Windows Update:
<br />#1 Start a command prompt in Administrator Mode:
<br />In start menu search for CMD
<br />Right click on it
<br />Select “Run as Administrator”
<br />#2: Stop various Windows Update Service, Cryptographic, Background Intelligent Transfer Service,  and MSI Installer Windows services. 
<br />To do this, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don’t, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. 
<br />Then type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />   net stop wuauserv 
<br />   net stop cryptSvc 
<br />   net stop bits 
<br />   net stop msiserver 
<br />
<br />#3 Rename the folders used by Windows Update:
<br />   Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />   Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />
<br />Reconnect to the internet
<br />
<br />#4 Restart the services:
<br />   net start wuauserv 
<br />   net start cryptSvc 
<br />   net start bits 
<br />   net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />#5 Restart the computer:
<br />Reboot the computer
<br />open Windows Update 
<br />click Check for updates.
<br />
<br />#2 REMOVE THE WIN10 STORE UPDATE CACHE
<br />Open start menu
<br />Type: WSReset.exe
<br />Presss &lt;enter&gt;
<br />The Windows Store window should open, it means that Windows Store cache has been successfully cleaned.
<br />Restart the computer normally
<br />Trigger update manually to see if the problem is fixed
<br />
<br />#3 REPAIR YOUR WINDOWS INSTALLATION
<br />1.	Open Start menu , 
<br />2.	type Advanced Startup Options, and click on the results.
<br />3.	At the bottom of the screen, select Restart now to boot your PC in an Advanced startup mode.
<br />4.	Choose Advanced Options -&gt; Trouble shoot.
<br />5.	Select Automatic Repair and wait for the system to restart.

<br />
<br />TO MANUALLY REBUILD THE ICON CACHE USING THE COMMAND PROMPT 
<br /><a href="https://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/49819-icon-cache-rebuild.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/49819-ico...</a> 
<br />I (Ron) have successfully used this tip on Win10
<br />
<br />1. Close and save anything that you are working on. This command will kill explorer and restart the computer when completed.
<br />
<br />2. Open a command prompt in Windows 7 or Windows 8.
<br />
<br />3. In the command prompt, Copy and paste each command line below exactly as is one at a time and press enter after each command.
<br /> WARNING: The last command will restart the computer, so be sure to close and save anything that you are working on first.
<br />NOTE: the second command will kill explorer so your taskbar and all desktop icons will disappear, not to worry!
<br />
<br />    ie4uinit.exe -ClearIconCache
<br />    taskkill /IM explorer.exe /F
<br />    DEL “%localappdata%\IconCache.db” /A
<br />    DEL “%localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\iconcache*” /A
<br />    shutdown /r /f /t 00
<br />
<br />4. The IconCache.db file has now been rebuilt.
<br />
<br />5. If the icons are still not displaying properly, then download and merge the ICO option in this tutorial for Windows 7 or Windows 8 to restore the default associations of .ico (icon) files.

<br />The link(s) to non MS-page(s) appears to be providing accurate, safe information. I suggest you stick with the “manual” instructions. Unless I explicitly suggest it, avoid downloading their “utilities”.  Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it. Sometimes they include 3rd party programs, "unwanted" programs that are automatically installed during a standard install.  So, if offered, do a "custom" install and carefully read each step. One of the steps MAY give you an option to install, or NOT, "additional" programs.  99.9% of the time you don't want to let them be installed.  For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs. 
<br />
<br />As well, watch out for ads on the site. They may advertise products that include PUPs. Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.

<h2>            PES 2011 Download Error</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have purchased PES 2011 from Games on Demand. I have tried 2 times to download it to my console, each time, right before it completes ( 99% completed ) i got this error message "Can't download PES 2011" and nothing more.</p>
<p>I have used my PC to make the purchase, from xbox.com, UK region site. I am from Romania, have created and UK account and used the address of a friend that lives there. Could this be the problem? I have successfully bought other Arcade games, Games on Demand
 from the Marketplace and never had any issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really need help with this, i hope i didn't just lose 20pounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>It is very possible that that might be your problem. &nbsp;Even though you created the account in the UK you don't live there. &nbsp;IP's are still logged and the game is more than likely not available in your region.</p>

<p>Well normally i would not have access to LIVE, but still they sell the console and games here. I lied only because i had no other choice.</p>
<p>It's not like this is not a known fact. Anyway, it's the first time this happens. And i think there should have been a warning somewhere or some info for this.
