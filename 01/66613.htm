<h2>            Win 10 Mail App doesn&#39;t like my Exchange Account password</h2>
                    I've just discovered the Mail app in Win 10, and have been adding all my various email accounts to it. Oddly, the only one I'm having trouble with is an account hosted on an Exchange server (which may have recently been updated to Office365). &nbsp;I set up
 the account using the same mailbox name I use for web access, but it won't accept my password. It's the same mailbox/password I use for web access, as well as for the Outlook app on my iPhone. Any ideas? &nbsp;Thanks!

<h2>            Google Chrome works sometimes but not others on Windows 10</h2>
                    I have a new Dell Inspiron that came with Windows 10 installed. &nbsp;Periodically I can't get Google Chrome to load. &nbsp;Sometimes it works, sometimes not and it's becoming quite annoying. &nbsp;I've read that sometimes it needs to be re-installed but others who have
 done that claim the same problem reoccurs. &nbsp;Is this a problem with Windows 10 - if so - what do I do? &nbsp;If it's a problem with Google Chrome - same question. &nbsp;Thanks for your assistance.

                    <p>I had a BSOD unbootable boot volume once it was fixed it turned into&nbsp;system thread exception is not handled.</p>
<p>I just had a clean reinstall of windows 10 a couple of weeks ago so i thought the crash would be because of outdated drivers that had been wiped from the clean reinstall but after searching for a bit and the analysis from whocrashed im not sure anymore besides
 that i have already checked and updated the drivers the only one i have a suspicion of is the Inter driver which i don't know how to update.</p>
<p>I want to know what is causing the problem and how to fix it and prevent it.</p>

<p>Hi Fredrick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Ntkrnlmp.exe is a core component of Windows 10 and, as the last report stated similarly, something else caused this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since every driver is updated except Intel, we can logically assume this to be the root cause of the challenge. Fortunately, you can install
<strong><a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Intel® Driver &amp; Support Assistant</a></strong> to update the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't hesitate to reach out if you still need help.</p>

<p>thank you for the reply</p>

</p><p>this is what i got from your link.</p>
<div>Intel(R) HD Graphics 4600<br />
<div>&nbsp;installed driver:&nbsp;<span>x.x.x.4549</span></div>

<p>Installs the Intel® Graphics Driver version 15.40.36.4703 for Windows*.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so it says my installed driver does not match with the updated version BUT "updates available (0)" i don't know why it says that when it doesn't match. Should i download it manually and install it or not? since i know a little where there is a specific version
 of intel drivers for a specific manufacturer's model (which mine is a laptop[asus])&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's what we can do:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, uninstall the current Intel driver through the Device Manager. The update assistant should recognize the lack of it, and proceed to install it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, simply install the latest version manually and you should be good to go.</p>

            so i uninstalled it through the device manager without checking the box of delete software(something like that), restarted it then it installed automatically but it installed the same driver version of intel when i check it again through the driver &amp; support
 assistant the same thing shows. And when i install it manually this shows up "The driver being installed is not validated for this computer. Please obtain the appropiate driver from this computer manufacturer" - i checked carefully for the right version of
 the driver and it supports my I<span>ntel(R) HD Graphics 4600 - does this mean my laptop model/manufacturer does not support the latest version?</span>

</span>Are you sure the cause of my problems was another driver and not something else? since it keeps happening where i have to now do a clean reinstall of windows 10 again because i can't reset the pc. I have not installed any malicious programs; might be
 malwares but i doubt it since i make sure ive got measures against it unless bitdefender doesnt work against malwares. If its not an outdated driver or virus/malwares i have no idea if its a failing hard drive which i am kind of sure its not since the normal
 signs aren't there. If the cause is a driver like Intel i opted not to install a generic version of it since i may lose functionality in some cases as stated in your link.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So after a while of thinking i had it fixed by the clean reinstallation of windows 10 i had the same problem again and i have figured out the problem on why no matter how many times i reset the pc or reinstall windows 10 would not fix the problem. It seems
 like my master boot record has some problems i tried to repair it by myself but i ran into a bit of a snag where bootrec.exe /fixboot doesn't work by saying access is denied; have searched about it and found nothing comparable to what i am experiencing. It's
 my first time knowing about mbr so i could have missed on something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you describe step by step how to fix my mbr and what i should do about the "access is denied?"</p>
<p>Also it seems like whenever i reset the pc and i had the flash drive connected (not clean reinstall) it seems to corrupt or damage my bootable usb;i already damaged/unusable/corrupted 3 flash drives. Is that suppose to happen?</p>

<p>im pretty sure my problem has something to do with the mbr. When i did a clean reinstall of windows for the third time i checked my hard drive for errors and found some; when i tried to fix it windows system got corrupted so i had to reset the pc.

<p>After reseting the pc i checked the hard drive again; found errors and got windows corrupted again. Thats when i searched for another solution. I ran a smart test for my hard drive since i suspected it might be failing but the tests prove I was wrong.
</p>
<p>Found another fix where i ran to what i mentioned above. </p>
<p>So it seems like i can't repair the hard drive errors which is causing windows to get corrupted and if i dont fix the hard drive errors it causes my pc to slow down after hours have passed without restarting. Its fine for normal
 use without restarting but if i do any intensive gaming for a long time without restarting and it just so happens at that time my pc slows down that's when i ran out of RAM and my pc freezes up at best and at worst is the BSOD problems i've experienced before.</p>
<p>And yes i've tried sfc=did not find any integrity problems, chkdsk=after restart it just goes on a loop and corrupts the windows system</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail - Attachments Missing</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I posted this on the Office 365 forum and they were not able to resolve and suggested trying here.&nbsp; Here is the original thread:</p>
<p><a href="http://community.office365.com/en-us/forums/160/p/83198/327678.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://community.office365.com/en-us/forums/160/p/83198/327678.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm having a problem w/attachments emailing correctly from Oulook 2010 via Office 365. &nbsp;</p>

<p>My business partner is using the Windows Live Mail client w/a Live.com email account. She is not able to open some of the attachments I send. It appears that if I email a new message w/an attachment it works ok but if I Reply to one of her messages and add
 an attachment she is unable to see it. </p>

<p>More info...</p>
<p>Her inbox shows the attachment icon but when I open the message it is not visible. The size in the inbox also indicates there is an attachement. If she opens the mesage from Hotmail.com she can open the attachment. This doesn't seem to happen w/email from
 anyone else (just Office 365). All the emails I'm sending are in HTML format.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the other user replys to the email w/the missing attachment it comes back to me as plain text. It appears that something is happening to the email that makes it render in the
 Window Live Mail client incorrectly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks very much,</p>
<p>Craig</p>

            <p>Without seeing the message source of the involved messages, I can't be certain what's happening. But since attachments to new messages are available at the receiving end while those in replies don't, I'll have to guess that you're sending in a different
 format in the two cases. For example, new messages are sent using the contacts data for&nbsp;the addressee, but replies simply go to&nbsp;the
<em>From: </em>or <em>Reply-To: </em>address regardless of any settings in the contacts data for this particular addressee.<br />
<br />
If the message is sent using Outlook's proprietary RTF format - which might well be your default - then attachments will be TNEF-encoded. This encoding is not understood by any mail client other than Outlook (or Exchange Client). Some mail services can decode
 it, notably Hotmail and Gmail. This format should only be used in the corporate environment, and only if the sender knows that the addressee is using Outlook. Otherwise, plain text or HTML should be used.<br />
<br />
I wasn't aware that Outlook 2013 still uses this format, but <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290809" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
these notes</a> should explain what is happening and may help you find a way around it, like changing the default sending format to HTML and specifying RTF for corporate contacts and others you know to be using Outlook. It's only necessary when you're taking
 advantage of the interactive capabilities it offers, like meeting accepts and voting buttons.<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>[EDIT: Sorry, I've just re-read your question and see that you're using Outlook 2010. Here at the Microsoft Community, we've been indoctrinated to think of Office 365 as being synonymous with Office 2013. The page I referred you to covers the problem you're
 facing.]</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestions.&nbsp; All the emails I'm sending are HTML (I double checked them all in my Sent folder) so I don't think RTF is the isue.&nbsp; If the other user replys to me it typically comes back as HTML as well.&nbsp; However, if they Reply to a message
 w/a missing attachment it comes back to me as Plain Text.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if I do the exact same steps but send from my Windows Live account instead of my Office 365 account (both setup in&nbsp;Outlook 2010)&nbsp;it seems to work fine.&nbsp; We also didn't see this issue when I was on another Hosted Exchange provider.

            Please check the message source, both of the message in your own <em>Sent items
</em>folder and the one received in WLMail by the addressee. If possible, ask him to forward it to you as attachment so you get the full monty. What&nbsp;are the Content-Types of the attachment as sent by you and as received?<br />

Diane Poremsky's site</a>. You may find the explanation for one addressee receiving RTF even though you think you specified HTML:
<br />
<br />
</p>
<blockquote>The autocomplete cache (nickname cache) may remember the RTF setting and Outlook will continue to send messages using RTF, overriding the Contact settings. Delete the address from the cache to clear it (select the address using

            I'm confused. I'm having a similar issue. However, I don't understand why the format of the email (rtf vs html) would have any bearing on whether the attachment is attached/visible or not. I'm not a developer by any stretch, but in my simple mind if I
 put a suitcase in a car, a boat, or a bike, the suitcase should arrive "as is" because the carrier shouldn't be doing anything to the suitcase, be it a PDF, a jpeg, or a Word doc. It's just along for the ride, right? I'm sure it's more involved than that in
 email world, but it still leaves me scratching my head.
<div><br />
<div>I have a Hotmail account. My landlord sends PDFs to me occasionally. I was using the "Windows Live Mail" program that is provided by Microsoft to manage my emails on a Windows 7 PC. The email and its text arrive, but the attachments do not. I have since
 found out that if I use Outlook, or, access Hotmail via the web the email and the attachment are visible. Additionally, the entire email is completely absent on my iphone using Apple's default email handler.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't know what my landlord uses to manage email but I will find out.</div>

            Yes, that sounds like exactly the same problem. Ask your landlord to read the&nbsp;article I referred to.<br />
<br />
Because mail servers only understand plain text characters, any file (other than a plain text file, of course)&nbsp;has to be converted into plain text for transmission as an attachment. There are different ways of doing this, and all mail clients can deal with
 the commonest&nbsp;varieties. Outlook uses its own encoding/decoding system so that it can do more than just transmit files,&nbsp;like including an automatic 'accept' button with a meeting request. The same file will consist of completely different streams of characters
 if it's prepared for transmission by Outlook using TNEF encoding and not using TNEF. As soon as Windows Live Mail sees the string
<em>Content-Type: application/tnef</em>, it closes its eyes and pretends the attachment just isn't there.<br />
<br />
Imagine sending a message in code from the front line back to headquarters. If you're using a different code book from the one they have at the other end, they won't be able to understand your message, even though the message itself hasn't changed at all.<br />

            Hi I have just had the same problem. I am using windows mail live and am not receiving attachments from a travel agent once the email goes back and forwards a few times. I am only just able to get the gist of the conversation and the link you provided.
 Could you give me some clarity if it is a problem with my settings or the senders so I can either address it or ask the sender to do so? Thanks

                    <p>I built a new system using W10Pro 64-bit DVD. </p>
<p>I installed Outlook 2013 on new computer and moved all accounts. </p>
<p>All of the accounts are working except for one account. It is hosted by Rackspace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account is set as:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>secure.emailsrvr.com,995,SSL</strong></p>
<p><strong>secure.emailsrvr.com,465,SSL</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I get an error: "your email server rejected your login. Verify your user name and password for this account in Account Settings."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Yet running under Windows 7 PRO, the email&nbsp;is working correctly.</p>
<p>I have gone back and reinstalled the account and checked settings MANY times and get the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have also ran SFC /scannow and no errors were found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>System drive is a SSD, 512GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyone have any insight as to what the issue could be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
- For how long have you had the issue?<br />
- Have you made any changes to your computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're getting missing bthprops.cpl file errors or other errors with the bthprops.cpl file, I'd suggest you to re-install the program, uninstall and re-install a more up-to-date version, and/or check to see if any updates are available for the program associated
 with the file instead of attempting to copy a new version of the file to the computer. File errors are often caused by more than just a single missing or corrupt file and copying just one file could cause more issues.<br />
<br />
Follow steps from these articles to reinstall the program.<br />

            I fixed it myself as Microsoft actually weren't any help to me on this one. Backed up all files to hard drive then reverted back to windows 8.1, then did a fresh installation of windows 10 (from disk boot, not update) and set it up as a new pc (making
 sure all files are backed up on separate hard drive as this will wipe it all clean) once that was done with a clean boot from disk installation... It worked fine... Random I know. But if you got the patients to do this, it worked...

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should obtain your Driver Software from your Computer or Hardware Manufacturer, not even&nbsp;through Windows Update (except for Mictosoft Hardware Updates).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are having problems with any particular Hardware, go to your Computer or Hardware Manufacture's website &gt; Driver and Software Support Section &gt; look up your Computer or Hardware Model number &gt; then your Operating System &gt; locate the correct Drivers
 &gt; download and install them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>There are some tricks to try when on the last boss for insane, having all of the mutators can be very helpful as well as player placement during the battles. The first time me and my friends tried we worked on it for about 2 hours and couldn't beat the final
 boss, then the next time we tried it took us 30 min haha. Anyways I'm down for helping, just shoot me a message on either of my accounts Bravliltoast3r or ECGxZenyatta.</p>

<br />Sign out of your Excel and sign in again. Make sure that login ID and password is same for Excel which you used @ Microsoft account to renew this.
<br />
<br />If still the problem, login to Microsoft account @ <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/</a>
<br />Check under Services and subscriptions, your Office entitlement.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

    <title>Laptop will not enter standby - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justin2011  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop will not enter standby</h2>
                    Sony Vaio Laptop Mode VGN-FE855E<br />
Intel centrino Duo 1.67Ghz<br />
2 Gb of Kingston RAM at 667 Mhz <br />
120GB hard drive <br />
Mobile Intel 945 Express Chipset Family<br />
All the lastest drivers as of april have been installed on the hardware.<br />
with Windows Vista SP1<br />
<br />
After receiving recent windows updates for Windows Vista Premium, when trying to enter standby the computer hangs and will not enter into standby mode.<br />
Before reveiving the updates it was able to enter standby with no problem and did everytime. It will no longer enter standby from any means.<br />
I have tried&nbsp;the windows backup and restore center. After selecting a older version before april 12, 2009 It was able to enter standby once again. Only after the new updates it had uninstalled had been reinstalled it was not able to enter stand by again.
<br />
The computer intially starts to enter standby by turning off the screen. Then it goes weird after that, by the computer muting itself (which it never did before) THen it just hangs and the power light will not go to the flashing red indicating standby it just
 stays green, which is ON. <br />
The Hard drive is still spinning and it accesses the hard drive very quickly and light for&nbsp; second every couple of seconds.<br />
When any key on the keyboard is struck the computer unmutes itself and a sound is played over the speakers, which it previously did not do. This then turns on the screen and brings the computer to the computer locked/Login screen. I am able to Log on and use
 it normally. <br />

            Hi justin2011,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the responses to the forum.<br />
<br />
There could be a number of reasons this is hitting out of standby or not closing out to standby.&nbsp; Has there been any external devices attached recently?<br />
<br />
I know that Chris suggested a clean boot in the earlier thread, but that is going to be the best steps towards isolating this issue from this distance and that would help determine the component it is hanging on.<br />
<br />
If you will follow step 1 in the clean boot process then allow it to hit stand by to verify whether it goes or not then that will show what is enabled and what is not enabled when this happens.&nbsp; If doesn't have problem in step 1, move to step 2 and continue
 the process until the culprit is isolated.&nbsp; Here's the link to Clean Boot again -
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/</span></span></a>&nbsp;.&nbsp; Keep following the article down and document what
 is installed when the issue occurs if it occurs in step 3, but not step 2 then what services / programs were enabled in step 3 is where we need to review.<br />
<br />
Keep us advised on this and what you find so we can verify if there is something that can be done about the failing service/program.<br />
<br />
Also, remember after you have completed troubleshooting to perform the steps outlined in step 7 of the article to bring your system back to a normal boot.<br />
<br />
Justin2011, I know that you stated it happens in High Performance mode, but not in standard, so when you reach step 1 of the clean boot process, go in and turn High Performance mode on in the Power Options - also document what it shows about each attribute
 in that setting ---&nbsp; it may be the NIC is set to wake on activity.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could change that by clicking the Change Settings option for the power plan you have selected and drilling down to the NIC and choosing a Lower Power option.<br />
<br />
Again, try the clean boot and also verify if the NIC is set to a lower power option.&nbsp; If setting it to a lower option works then all should be well.&nbsp; If not, then let's continue to troubleshoot.<br />
<br />
Thank you,

            Hi justin2011,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting your question to the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
My first suggestion would be to perform a Clean Boot and see if the situation changes.
<br />
A program may be conflicting after the update.<br />
Here's an article on how to do that:<br />
<br />
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/</span></a><br />
<br />
You can also check the Event Viewer to see if there is any information about the issue that can be posted to this forum.<br />
Here's how to do that:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947321</span></a><br />
<br />
I also suggest checking for updated drivers for your video card and mouse/keyboard setup.<br />
<br />
Please let us know how this works out.</p>

<h2>            MS FSX Multiple Monitor Problems</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've been running Flight Sim on my desktop with a dual monitor setup and it runs just fine. Recently, I built a new desktop with 3 EVGA GTX580 cards to support 6 Samsung SyncMaster monitors. On the new desktop, I tried loading the flight in a smaller window,
 getting the flight going, hitting pause and then trying to load full screen mode. As soon as I try to load full screen mode, FSX crashes and returns a "Fatal Error." It runs fine on two monitors on the new desktop but crashes with more. Any ideas?</div>
<div><br />
Thanks,</div>

<p>Glad to inform that I finally found the solution.&nbsp; But I did not know which path has solved this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In one of the Community Answers it was suggested that I down load those free (or trial) Registry Fix or equivalent, I had tried a few of them and did not seem to work, and so I uninstall them.&nbsp; I discovered that in the process, it distrupted "Asus UBS charger
 plus", and therefore I also uninstalled it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without suspecting, the next few days when I work on this laptop, the "auto typing dashes repeatedly has gone",&nbsp; Also there is another "Shift-C" which didn't work also recovered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it was not due to moisture.&nbsp; I am very happy.</p>

            Try these first to see if they work:

Open Start, type: CMD
Right click CMD
Click Run as administrator

Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)

Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth

Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth

Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth

Also run the System File Checker utility:
Open Start, type: CMD
Right click CMD
Click Run as administrator

At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow

This will check for any integrity violations

Restart your system

Check if it works.

If not, try performing a repair upgrade since it could be corrupt system files.

<h2>            Adding Printer but Keeping Custom Name</h2>
                    I've renamed all my printers to things like "Office1_BW," "Office2_BW," but when adding the printers in Windows, the damn thing keeps reverting back to make/model information, i.e. "Brother HL-L6200W" which is useless and nobody cares about. &nbsp;Is there
 any way to force windows to keep the custom/WSD/Node-name instead of reverting it back to make/model? &nbsp;This is maddening. &nbsp;I need people to be able to identify, add, and use printers in context of a work environment, not the context of hardware specifications.&nbsp;

            <p>Jay,</p>
<p>While I appreciate the response, this isn't really isn't a solution for me. &nbsp;What you describe is to rename the printer *after* adding it to a PC. &nbsp;What I'm trying to figure out is how to force Windows to *keep* the custom name I've already assigned to the
 printer. &nbsp;I am basically refusing to sit down at every one of our 75 PC's and manually rename three printers on each one. &nbsp;I won't do it. &nbsp;I also do not want to be the only person who can decipher and add printers for new arrivals and guests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider the printer I've named (Node name, web services name, etc) "Office1_Color." &nbsp;When adding the printer to a PC, it does present itself, momentarily, as "Office1_Color." &nbsp;But, while Windows installs the driver, it also changes the printers name back
 to something like "Brother HL-L6200W series printer," &nbsp;which is useless. &nbsp;I also have Office1_B/W, Office2_B/W, Office3_Copier, Office3_Guest; all of which get added as "Brother HL-L6200W series printer (1)," etc. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When new people are hired or when we have visitors, I want *them* to be able to add a printer and, in doing so, also know exactly where the printer is located so they can go fetch their documents. &nbsp;I thought naming the printers with location and function
 were a cinch, but, alas, it's the easy stuff that computers make difficult.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Update Settings</h2>
                    
<p>Windows 7 64 bit</p>
<p>On the last Windows update, Windows shut off parts of my firewall/anti-virus program and would not allow me to turn them back on through Windows Security. I was able to turn the functions back on through the firewall/a-v program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a synopsis of what occured and how I resolved it:</p>
<p>http://forums.eeye.com/forums/p/1342/5787.aspx#5787</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you'll note in my second entry, in an attempt to find out what particular Windows update might have caused the conflict, I attempted to install the updates one at a time.</p>
<p>I selected the Malicious Software Removal Tool and installed as expect. The next update I selected required a reboot. However, when I rebooted, Windows installed not only the item I had selected, but the remaining downloaded updates.</p>
<p>So, while it appears I have resolved the conflict between my firewall and the Window's update, there does not seem to be a means of installing downloaded updates one at time which might be useful to figure out any conflicts.</p>
<p>While it appears the conflict has been resolved, at this time I do not want to download any future updates 'en mass' - I want to download and install them one at a time. So I altered my Windows Update settings to alert me of any updates so I can download
 one at time. However, in my system tray, I have an alert to 'solve a PC issue' to change Windows Update Settings - it keeps insisting I change it to automatically download/install, in spite of changing the settings to just alert me of updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to fix it, at least until I am certain I have resolved any conflicts between Windows and my firewall A/V program?</p>

<p><br />
Newly built around Feb 1 and I installed Win 7 64 Home Premium.</p>
<p>Blink Personal was purchased and installed same day as Win 7 - no other A/V systems; Win 7 firewall was turned off.</p>
<p>(Have used Blink Personal for 3 years on an XP Pro system - it's known.)</p>
<p>So far, Windows has not shut off any of the Blink systems. Just the same issue shown in the system tray - "Change Windows Update Settings" which I don't want to do yet - I want to download and install one at a time for the next few update cycles to be sure
 there's no conflict.</p>

<p>Despite your first post in <a href="http://forums.eeye.com/forums/t/1342.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
eEye Forums</a>, I suspect that Automatic Updates (AU)&nbsp;installed six (6) updates; i.e., MS10-019 (<strong>KB978601
</strong>&amp; <strong>KB979309</strong>), MS10-020 (<strong>KB980232</strong>), MS10-021 (<strong>KB979683</strong>), MS10-022 (<strong>KB981332</strong>), and the Malicious Software Removal Tool (<strong>KB890830</strong>).</p>
<p>I suspect&nbsp;the behavior you encountered was due to a&nbsp;now-known, since-corrected bug in&nbsp;AU's detection &amp; installation logic and the two-part MS10-019 update.</p>
<p>It turns out that <strong>&lt;edit&gt;</strong>&nbsp;<em>KB979309</em> must be installed first
<em>and the computer must be re-started</em> before&nbsp;<em>KB978601</em> <strong>&lt;edit&gt;</strong> can successfully&nbsp;install.</p>
<p>As I said above, MS&nbsp;was made&nbsp;aware of the problem [<em>in part because so many users opened&nbsp;no-charge support incidents!</em>] shortly after the updates were released on 13 April and has since corrected the detection &amp; installation logic. IOW, you probably
 would not have encountered the behavior if your <em>first</em> update attempt had taken place on
<strong>&lt;edit&gt; </strong>16 April 2010 <strong>&lt;/edit&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p>IN RE your comment in your second post in the eEye forum:</p>
<p><em>I installed the next one on the list; however, it </em>[i.e., KB978601] <em>
required a reboot and when it rebooted, Windows automatically installed the remaining 3 updates (not very user friendly, since I had unchecked all the items and it proceeds to ignore it.)</em></p>
<p>Had you (1) deleted the contents of %windir%\SoftwareDistribution\<strong>Downloads &lt;=this folder</strong> (2)
<em>before</em> you changed your AU setting to the "<strong>Download updates but let me choose...</strong>" option, the remaining 3 updates would
<em>not</em> have installed without your Approval.</p>
<p>Yes, it can be very confusing!</p>

<p>I just checked, the Malicious Software Removal Tool (<strong>KB890830</strong> ) does NOT show up on the recent update list, although the other 5 are there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm still annoyed that even after I have selected "Let me choose" option, set at "check for updates but let me chose whether to download and install them," it still reappears as an alert in the System Tray, Solve PC issues.&nbsp; As if setting it to Automatic
 Download and install is the only setting it will accept.</p>
<p>Edit: Even setting this to "download updates but let me choose whether to install them" doesn't remove it from the system tray as an open issue. Appears that it will only accept the 'Recommended' settings to turn it off.</p>
<p>I'll reset to Automatic and watch during the next update.</p>

<p>To jfl97</p>
<p>To clarify:</p>
<p>I have the 'flag' icon in my System Tray - Solve PC issues: 1 message</p>
<p>When I click on it, it shows this dialogue box:</p>
<p>http://moz.execulink.net/~jspirko/temp/action_center.JPG</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Originally, I had it set for Automatic Download and I'd select which ones to install, which was usually all of them and the only time I had a 'flag' was when there were downloads ready to be installed. Now I get the flag and the only way I can remove the
 notice is if I totally click on "Install Updates Automatically (Recommended)"</p>
<p>If I click on the lower section,&nbsp; it opens the "Change Settings" dialogue box - shown below. If I set that as shown, 'Download Updates but let me select.." it still shows in my system tray.</p>
<p>http://moz.execulink.net/~jspirko/temp/change_settings.JPG</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What PA Bear is telling me (and I should have noticed) is the 'Shield Icon' meaning I needed to run/set this as Administrator... However, I am unable to follow his instructions. If I click&nbsp; on Start - I have no accessible Run option. While I can press Windows
 logo key + R to open the Run dialogue box, it's not starting the Run command as Administrator.</p>
<p>If I go Start - type in Update and Right Click (Administrator) on Windows Update and go through the same process, it still shows up in the system tray. And if I try to do a screen capture with the Snipping Tool, the Start window closes, so I can't show you
 what I get when pressing the Start Key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PA Bear, if you have an alternate way of selecting Run as Administrator, please post</p>

<p>Doesn't work for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Step 1 - opening the Control Panel doesn't give me an option for Administrative Tools.</p>
<p>http://moz.execulink.net/~jspirko/temp/control_panel.JPG</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can press <strong>START </strong>| type in <strong>Administrative Tool</strong> s | to access the list</p>
<p><strong>or </strong>open Control Panel and search "Administrative Tools" and access from there.</p>
<p>However, when I Stop the service, empty the download folder, restart with MANUAL, it still shows up in the system tray as "Solve PC issue". The ONLY way that goes away if I set it to the 'recommended' setting of AUTOMATIC</p>
<p>http://moz.execulink.net/~jspirko/temp/action_center2.JPG</p>
<p>So it's either the Recommended setting and no issues or tolerate with the flag/issue if I want to download and install each update at a time.</p>

                    I installed the family safety feature, but to be honest, as it is only me that uses this computer it is more hassle as I have to turn the feature off before I can even log into my e-mail account.&nbsp; Any suggestions as to how I can do this please.&nbsp; Tracey

Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />

Turn Windows features on or off</p>
<p>Some programs and features that are included with Windows, such as Internet Information Services, must be turned on before you can use them. Certain other features are turned on by default, but you can turn them off if you don’t use them.</p>
<p>In earlier versions of Windows, to turn a feature off you had to uninstall it completely from your computer. In this version of Windows, the features remain stored on your hard disk, so you can turn them back on if you want to. Turning off a feature does
 not uninstall the feature, and it does not reduce the amount of hard disk space used by Windows features.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Click the Start button , click Control Panel, click Programs, and then click Turn Windows features on or off.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; To turn a Windows feature on, select the check box next to the feature. To turn a Windows feature off, clear the check box.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3.&nbsp; Click OK.<br />

    <title>black screen problem after virus prob - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clairebear1984  say:</h3>
<h2>            black screen problem after virus prob</h2>
                    
<p>ok the back story to this is a this morning when i switched on my laptop which is a hp pavillion dv9000 avast continually set off a virus alert so I followed as it said and sent it to like the quaranteen&nbsp; and deleted but it was still going off. Everytime
 i went to connct to net id get a continuous stream of an error along side the avast warning going off about 10 times in a room before it stopped for a min.</p>
<p>I then went to the avast forum and followed there advice which was to send a notification off to them to test if it was a false possitive on the same sight it recomended some anti malware programs, now this is where I think I made the big mistake. I tried
 one but after free scan it was then chargeable to clean so not thinking I then tried another recommended program but i didnt deinstall the first.</p>
<p>while this one was running a scan the laptop switched itself off (power cable had come far enough out to not be charging it) upon restart I first tried to start in normal mode but nothing black screen with cursor still moveable and tried in the 2 safe modes
 and nothing again.</p>
<p>only way to restart is to hit the power button and force restart I tried getting task manager up and it doesnt work at all after boot menu keyboard does nothing at all once it gets to that black screen ive done a hard disk check in f10 menu and tried recommendation
 on boot menu and have also tried f11 restore and still nothing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The virus found was win32:Malware-gen any help would be great oh the os is windows 7 32bit home</p>

<p><span>Hi clairebear1984,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It looks that computer has been badly infected or the virus has not been removed completely from the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>You may try using another keyboard and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may try performing startup repair and check it boots back to the desktop.</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;Insert the installation disc.<br />
2. &nbsp;<strong>Restart your computer</strong>. <br />
Click the&nbsp; <strong>Start</strong> button, click the arrow next to the &nbsp;<strong>Lock</strong> button, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Restart</strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp;If prompted, &nbsp;<strong>press any key to start</strong> Windows from the installation disc.<br />
<strong>Note </strong>&nbsp;If your computer is not configured to start from a CD or DVD, check the information that came with your computer. You may need to change your computer's BIOS settings. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>BIOS:
