<h2>            No Audio Output Device Installed. Audio is not functional</h2>
                    Just upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 Update but audio is not functional. A mute sign is visible on the sound icon. After troubleshooting it says "Audio Device not Responding". What shall I do? Another problem is that windows is not showing hp recovery
 manager (presumably it was uninstalled by windows).

<h3> hobbes78  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype 7 to be discontinued, but version 8 never worked correctly</h2>
                    <p>I'm using version 7 on Windows 10 and now I'm receiving the "This version of Skype will be discontinued soon. To continue using Skype in the future, update to the latest version today."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried version 8 a few times, but I never get any notifications of new messages, so I end up downgrading to version 7 every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I check the <strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt;
<strong>Notifications &amp; actions</strong> and also the options in the app itself, but everything seems ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will this issue ever be fixed? Sometimes people in other parts of the building walk all the way to my desk asking why I'm ignoring their messages... Version 8 is unusable! Please don't discontinue version 7!</p>

            Hi hobbes78,
<br />
<br />If you are running Windows 10, make sure you are up to date, that should include Skype 12, which, while not perfect, it is better and has more functionality that version 8 . . .

<h2>            Windows icon think - locked. Tray icon to get on internet - locked. Can&#39;t access program apps through program.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>My windows icon thing in the start up menu, when I click it today, it does nothing.</p>
<p>The tray in the start up menu with the "bandwidth icon" - click nothing and i can't see available WIFIs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go to my program files,&nbsp; I cannot open programs.</p>
<p>However, on my desktop if I open a file, the program for Word will open, but so far, not successful with Publisher or others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I am not logged in, I can use the lower right Internet access icon and see the available WIFIs, and connect that way, then log in and turn on Firefox, or Chrome, and access the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to re-download PC Tools and run that. Turned up nothing noticeable. Malware Bytes also did not show a notable problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>....</p>
<p>I went into the Task Manager, and ran Powershell - found NO integrity violations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I tried running DISM / Online/ Cleanup-Image/ RestoreHealth in to Powershell. But it got frozen and did not continue, so I exited.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I thought&nbsp; - ok, will set up a new user through the Task Manager and transfer the privileges and the files and settings over to the new user. NOW I HAVE A PROBLEM.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-----&gt; Maybe not doing it right? When I try to do this, typing netuser New UserName NewPassword in the command prompt and it starts to open, then closes very fast!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have access to files to back up documents so I don't want to have to do a system restore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PLEASE help!!! Need computer for looking for work.&nbsp; I am not aware of Windows 10 trying to do a back up yesterday. That is usually what messes things up. Last night everything was fine when I shut down for the night.</p>

<p>Thank you and your solution won't work. I cannot navigate to folder items. It's also very complicated information on your website - and I am somewhat of a tech person.&nbsp; How would I know if I am downloading the same Windows 10 version I have - if I can't
 get into Settings or the file folder to check it? </p>
<p>
</p><p>And are you talking about downloading Windows 10 - expanded on to a hard drive - or just the file itself sitting on a flash drive?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Very confusing info....sorry.</p>

<p>This info on this link is talking about going in through the Windows 10 logo. That is what is frozen. I need a work around. My settings short cut is also frozen in my start tray.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a work-around to get to the Windows Update? Could that possibly fix what was knocked out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. (The woman who posted her answer was "complicated" - and unclear and I responded back to her. Yours seemed more logical and easier - just I can't get through the Windows Logo.</p>

<p>I did Ctr Alt Del to get to Task manager hit More Details to get to running processes and</p>

<p>Edge was using tons of memory and probably swapping memory out to disk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use a different browser until MS fixes this.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Extended Desktop Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael oldham  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Extended Desktop Issue</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new Dell Inspirion 2350 touch screen. &nbsp;We are running a video system at our church through the following connections:</p>
<p>HDMI to VGA converter goes into a Kramer Presentation Switcher/Scaler, then out to twin high resolution projectors. &nbsp;Our trouble is as follows:</p>
<p>1) In extended desktop mode, during Powerpoint or ProPresenter 5, the extended desktop kicks out of presentation mode and moves back into the default extended desktop background. &nbsp;This happens when the main display is idle for 3 to 5 minutes or idle for
 30 minutes. I have set the sleep parameters to NEVER. &nbsp;There is no screensaver running as far as I can see. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) &nbsp;This problem does not happen when the display setting is in clone mode. &nbsp;However, this is not a mode we want to use because of presentation quality, i.e. &nbsp;seeing the mouse move on the presentation screen at the front of the building. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) &nbsp;In ProPresenter 5 it actually locks the entire video card down, blacking out the main screen, with no ability to even Task Manage my way out of the situation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any assistance out there. &nbsp;I fairly tech savy, and thought I had it sorted, but this is madness!</p>
<p>
</p><p>~ Michael</p>

                    I played on another computer (it was Windows 7 or Vista, but on a different computer completely). I'm trying to get it to play on Windows 10, which is my personal computer and it will open up the loading screen then freeze. &nbsp;You have to open the task manager
 to get it to close. &nbsp;I've tried the compatibility changes and they don't seem to be working.

<h2>            Keyboard freezes and disconnects randomly</h2>
                    My Corsair K55 Keyboard that I just got for Christmas&nbsp;not too long ago (less than a week ago) has been acting up just within the hour. It will randomly (what seems like it does) disconnect and reconnect&nbsp;to my computer because I hear the chirp of something
 connecting/disconnecting. It will freeze for a second and I can tell because just while I was typing this it froze and whatever key I just pressed it will hold down. For example, it will do this: the broooooooooown&nbsp;fox jumps over the lazy dog (or something
 of the sort). The lights that show if num-lock, etc. are active also turn off if they were on. Don't&nbsp;know why this&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;----- there it was. Don't&nbsp;know why it's happening, maybe I just need&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(and again) to restart
 my computer. Not really serious, just annoying to hear the s

<p>Hi Evan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, the issue is with your keyboard's firmware, the device itself, or due to a software conflict. To check if it's being caused by a software conflict, we suggest that you perform a clean boot on your computer. A clean boot helps eliminate
 software conflicts within your system. To perform it on your computer, kindly follow the steps in this article:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to perform a clean boot in Windows</a>. If the issue persists during the clean boot, this would signify that the issue is with the device itself. If that's the case, we recommend that you contact the support team of your device, and ask them for assistance.
 It's possible that you need to download and install a specific firmware version and a utility software for your device to properly work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have questions, don't hesitate to post another reply.</p>

<p>Dear Joshua,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I would like to inform you that when I clicked on that link I could not find any way on how to actually do a clean boot, just what it would do to my computer. However, I am now sure that it is part of the firmware/software that is causing this issue
 - I reinstalled/repaired the corsair utility engine and it is still acting up. I am going to post a forum in their support section so that they can hopefully fix my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>

<h2>            How can I get Windows 7 to correctly display Asian Characters&#63;</h2>
                    Who can I get Windows 7 to correctly display Asian Characters?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have Windows 7 x64 Professional, and it very often does not correctly display&nbsp;Japanese and other Asian&nbsp;characters. It does sometimes, usually after a reboot, but fails again in short order. All previous fixes I have tried failed. That link you are about
 to post me to someone else who has this problem, probably tried that.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Which is very frustrating, since people don't seem to know the answer to this one, or did not test enough.&nbsp;<span>I just want the characters to show up&nbsp;consistently&nbsp;on folder names or file names, etc.</span></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried, that is, these do not work (forever):&nbsp;</div>
<div>Doing that font cache/folder thing.</div>
<div>Switch the Locale to and back from Japanese/Chinese/Korean.</div>
<div>Set up Japanese/Chinese/Korean as a input&nbsp;language.</div>
<div>Installing Asian Fonts (These come with Windows 7, durr), but I installed more anyway (no change)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;language packs for windows 7 ultimate are for changing the display language. Not for displaying the language. &nbsp;I do not want to change the 'display language' of my machine. Before you get more ideas installing these packs do not help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have wrestled with this problem for awhile now, and I am a little frustrated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>tl;dr</div>
<div>Grrr. Fine</div>
<div>I DO NOT WANT MY DISPLAY LANGUAGE TO BE JAPANESE/CHINESE/KOREAN</div>
<div>I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO VIEW THE CHARACTERS</div>
<div>I WANT A PERMANENT FIX PLEASE</div>

            After some in depth checking I fount its the font cache strangely enough. Either the Asian fonts are not cached or became corrupted somehow.
<div><br />
<div>I had to clean it (delete it) and rebuild it. However I cannot be 100% sure it is this as rebooting has caused it to 'just work' before.</div>

<div>intermittent problems are always a pain to debug. I'll let you know if the problem occurs again. If so that is another solution that can be ruled out as a permanent fix.</div>

<h2>            I cant access wireless internet error&#34; The default gateway is not available&#34;.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: The default gateway is not available...help!</p>
<p>This problem began on my ASUS laptop a few days ago. (WIRELESS PROBLEM) </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Problems:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-Internet began to disconnect and reconnect on its own constantly, sometimes every few&nbsp;minutes.</div>
<div>-When I hit diagnose, it gives me several problems. "The default gateway is not available" , something wrong with my wireless adapter or access point, etc.</div>
<div>-Although my wireless appears to be working and on, sometimes when I check in device manager, my wireless adapter randomly disables itself. &nbsp;</div>
<div>-Of my 3 roommates, i'm the only person having this problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Failed Attempts:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>-Reset router (modem is directly into apartment wall / school internet)</div>
<div>-Reset wireless settings</div>
<div>-Uninstalled and re-installed wireless adapter.</div>
<div>-Disabled the stupid power management thing.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Basically I've tried anything I could find when googling this problem. The only step I haven't taken is doing a system restore which doesn't seem to work for most people anyways.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm not sure what program to use to upload all my PC specs... so here is some general info.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Norton Internet Security (Seen people having problems with firewalls)</div>
<div>Belkin Router</div>
<div><br />
</div>

</div>
<div>I bought my laptop about 3 months ago and this problem literally started 3 days ago, RANDOMLY. I didn't make any big changes whatsoever.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Someone please help me... not only is this frustrating for every form of entertainment... its actually complicating my online class work.</div>

            <div>Hi,<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please follow the given methods one by one and check.<br />
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Using the Network troubleshooter in Windows 7: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7</a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong> Wired and wireless network connection problems in Windows:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/wired-and-wireless-network-connection-problems-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/help/wired-and-wireless-network-connection-problems-in-windows</a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong> If the issue persists, you may manually assign the default gateway and the IP address and check if it works fine. Before assigning the IP address and the Default gateway manually, make a note of the IP address on the computer.
 To do this open Command prompt and type ipconfig and press enter. This will display the IP address, make a note of it.<br />
To assign the IP address and default gateway manually, follow the steps below:<br />
a. In system tray, right click network icon. Choose Open Network and Sharing Center.<br />
b. Right click on Local Area Connection and click on Properties.<br />
c. Double click Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) and assign the IP address manually.<br />
Example: Old Ip address is 192.168.0.1<br />
Change the IP address to 192.168.0.50<br />
d. Let the Subnet mask and default gateway be the same.<br />
Subnet mask = 255.255.255.0<br />
Default gateway, usually would be 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1<br />
e. Click on Apply and Ok and restart the computer and verify if it helps to fix the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 4:</strong> Reset WINSOCK, IPv4 TCP/IP, and IPv6 TCP/IP stack.<br />
a. Click on Start and in the search box, type cmd.<br />
b. Right click on the Command Prompt, select "Run as Administrator" to open a Command Prompt.<br />
c. At the command prompt window, type the following commands:<br />
netsh winsock reset catalog&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
netsh int ipv4 reset reset.log&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
netsh int ipv6 reset reset.log&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
d. Restart the computer.</div>

            Thank you for the speedy reply.
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, none of your suggestions worked.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I had already tried steps 1&amp;2 prior to your comment.</div>
<div>Step 4 just did not work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I ran into a problem with Step 3.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Either you forgot to mention a few steps or i'm doing something wrong.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here is what i did to fix my wireless:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>I filled in the Ip address and subnet as you told me to. My default IP is 192.168.2.2 so i changed it to 192.168.2.50 correct?</li><li>Then I filled in the default gateway as shown in my ipconfig. My default gateway is 192.168.2.1 so I left it the same... even though its different from the 2 "usual" ones you mentioned. (Did not end up working)</li><li>I even tried it with the default gateways you mentioned but a message came up saying they were part of a different subnet... so obviously it did not work.</li><li>But then came the problem... what do I fill in for the DNS below?&nbsp;</li><li>Lastly, this all should have been under the general tab and not the alternate config. tab right??</li></ul>
<div>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<div>Some other problems I noticed...</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>Sometimes when i restart my computer, my wireless adapter starts off disabled... even though it was on before.</li><li>It also doesn't let me disable my wireless connection via Network and Sharing Center. An error comes up saying something about "plug and play" and "other user" something....</li><li>However, I can disable my Atheros Wireless Adapter via device manager... however that doesn't seem to do anything. Since disabling it that way results in my wireless staying ON.</li><li>After all my attempts to fix the problem PRIOR to my original post, my wireless / LAN networks got slightly renamed...&nbsp;</li></ul>
<div>Wireless Network Connection ----&gt; Wireless Network Connection 2</div>
<div>Local Area Connection ----&gt; stayed the same.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I try to rename my Wireless Network Connection back to its original name without the "2", an error comes up saying that another network already has that same name... even though I can't see it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, my adapters would sometimes get a "#2" assigned to the back...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Example: Realtek -------------- #2</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>LASTLY, I had to type this response with my ethernet cord plugged in case of a disconnect... Oddly enough, when I plugged it in, instead of showing 2 connections to the same network... the name of my ethernet connection is the default factory name "belkin.9ce"
 and my wireless connection is constantly attempting to connect to the name i changed it to "Fred5134".&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Does this indicate anything as well?</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Again, my ethernet connection works perfectly.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also can't stress enough, this wireless problem literally happened overnight. I don't bring my laptop out of my room, its always sitting on my desk, I NEVER make any big changes, I never even touched my wireless settings prior to the problem. I am still
 the only person in my apartment that is having this problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there seriously any reason why my wireless would bug out like this? Could my physical adapter be damaged?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again for the help.</div>

<p><b>Problem:</b></p>

It's *very* possible that your RealTek audio is not supported by RealTek under Windows 8.

            If only it were that simple, I went to the Realtek website and downloaded the Windows 8 drivers for my audio before I posted this question. Like I stated in my post. It did not work. Thanks for trying but, already thought of that.

            <p><span>Hi Thomas,<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.<br />
To keep your computer clean &amp; running fast you can follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Method 1: <br />
Step 1: Try the Performance troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>The first thing that you can try is the Performance troubleshooter, which can automatically find and fix problems. The Performance troubleshooter checks issues that might slow down your computer's performance, such as how many users are currently logged
 on to the computer and whether multiple programs are running at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Steps to run performance troubleshooter:<br />
1) Press ”Windows + R” Key to open Run window.<br />
2) In the Run Window type control to open control panel. <br />
3) In control panel search box at the right corner type troubleshooter and then click Troubleshooting.<br />
4) Click and Check for performance issues.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Delete programs you never use.<br />
It's a good idea to uninstall all the programs you don't plan to use. This should include both manufacturer-installed software and software you installed yourself but don't want any more—especially utility programs designed to help manage and tune your computer's
 hardware and software. Utility programs such as virus scanners, disk cleaners, and backup tools often run automatically at startup, quietly chugging along in the background where you can't see them. Many people have no idea they're even running.<br />
Even if your PC is older, it might contain manufacturer-installed programs that you never noticed or have since forgotten about. It's never too late to remove these and get rid of the clutter and wasted system resources. Maybe you thought you might use the
 software someday, but never did. Uninstall it and see if your PC runs faster.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
How to Uninstall or change a program:<br />
You can uninstall a program from your computer if you no longer use it or if you want to free up space on your hard disk. You can use Programs and Features to uninstall programs or to change a program's configuration by adding or removing certain options.<br />
1) Press” Windows + R” Key to open Run window.<br />
2) In the Run Window type control to open control panel. <br />
3) In control panel select programs and then select programs and features.<br />
4) Select a program, and then click Uninstall. Some programs include the option to change or repair the program in addition to uninstalling it, but many simply offer the option to uninstall. To change a program, click Change or Repair</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>Step 3: Check for viruses and spyware<br />
If your PC is running slowly, it's possible that it's infected with a virus or spyware. This is not as common as the other problems, but it's something to consider. Before you worry too much, check your PC using antispyware and antivirus programs.<br />
A common symptom of a virus is a much slower-than-normal computer performance. Other signs include unexpected messages that pop up on your PC, programs that start automatically, or the sound of your hard disk constantly working.
<br />
Spyware is a type of program that's installed, usually without your knowledge, to watch your activity on the Internet. You can check for spyware with Windows Defender or other antispyware programs</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Here are some signs that your computer might be infected with spyware:<br />
• You notice new toolbars, links, or favorites that you didn't intentionally add to your web browser.<br />
• Your home page, mouse pointer, or search program changes unexpectedly.<br />
• You type the address of a specific website into your web browser, but you're taken to a completely unrelated website.<br />
• You see pop-up ads, even if your computer isn't connected to the Internet.<br />
• Your computer suddenly starts running slowly. Not all computer performance problems are caused by spyware, but spyware can cause a noticeable change.</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
How can I tell if my computer has a virus?<br />
a) Is your computer running very slowly? A common symptom of a virus is much slower than normal computer performance. However, there can be other reasons for slow performance, including a hard disk that needs defragmenting, a computer that needs more memory
 (RAM), or the existence of spyware or adware<br />
b) Are you getting unexpected messages, or are programs starting automatically? Some viruses can cause damage to Windows or some of your programs. The results of this damage might include messages appearing unexpectedly, programs starting or closing automatically,
 or Windows shutting down suddenly.</p>
<p><br />
Install an antivirus or another antispyware program. Many antivirus programs also come with antispyware protection; scan your computer with the anti-virus program.</p>
</span><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>CloakedToe7019, makes a good point there.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the newer consoles and power supplies are keyed,&nbsp;or&nbsp;at least they should be if they are official ones.&nbsp; This makes it impossible to attach a lower&nbsp;wattage PSU to the earlier consoles that required a higher
 wattage PSU.&nbsp; If the Console is not compatible the PSU simply will not fit.<br />
<br />
Please note the above is regarding the wattage of the PSU, the voltage is a different issue.&nbsp; Suffice as to say, if you get a compatible&nbsp;European PSU for your console it&nbsp;should work fine.</p>

<p>What is up with all the fanboyism when it comes to these to games? BOTH games are very good and very entertaining. Anytime there is a problem in BF its because a "COD camper, bush wookie, hacker, lag switcher" has managed to somehow want to play this game
 also. All the COD fanboys say BF is "boring, slow, lame, COD gets better reviews blah blah" Grow up and just play whatever game you like or both. Quit acting like 13 years old girls arguing over who is going to date the quarterback.</p>

<p>Call Of Duty is to checkers, as Battlefield is to chess. Take it as you want.</p>
<p>The whole COD vs. BF is a rivalry between the developers that's been going on for years and which has involved both communities. Think of it as the Basketball Championship between the Miami Heats and the Dallas Mavericks and how that stirred up a lot of
 team spirit (FANBOISM) among both sides. You don't have to choose a side, but at least try to undersatnd it.</p>
<p>As far as where I stand in all this... I hope COD sinks hard like the Titanic openning up the market and communities to new and innovative developers out there who can have a chance of pushing games that can set new landmarks in FPS and MP as DICE has done
 in the past couple of years, unlike COD that keeps pushing out Copy &amp; paste games twice a year milking it's fanbase.</p>
<p>But then again everybody is entitled to their gaming preference.Those are my two cents.</p>

<p>I play both. Both games have their good and bads about them and I'm not blind to call out either games short comings. I'm also capable of working around them. Each game gives me something the other doesn't and I don't give a sh!t what either of the communties
 problems are with one or the other. Neither game is better than the other, just different.</p>

<h2>            Why am I unable to delete System error memory dump file ,that&#39;s using  3.15GB of storage &#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I'm using "LENOVO ideapad 110". I tried to delete&nbsp;&nbsp;System error memory dump file ,that's occupied 3.15 GB space.</p>
<p>I ran DISK CLEANUP as ADMINISTRATOR and tried to delete this file. Deletion completed but this file is still in disk with 3.15 GB itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I tried through cmd. Started cmd -&gt; Run as administrator.&nbsp; Selected&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">C:\Windows&gt;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">directory and tried to delete
</span><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">MEMORY.DMP</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> file, but access denied.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">By deleting this file inside windows folder, I received a message that file is open in CCSDK , so action can't be completed .</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This file also contains sensitive information like password and others.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">Is there any solution to delete this file ?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">(CCSDK is the part of LENOVO Software development kit.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
