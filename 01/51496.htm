    <title>Mysterious folders and NETWORK SERVICE ownership&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mysterious folders and NETWORK SERVICE ownership&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a boot drive(C:) and my storage drive (D:).</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the top of my D: drive there are two folders whose names are a bunch of letters and numbers, the files contained in both are very similar with names like mpasbase.vdm and mpasbase.vdm._p and MPSigStub.exe and mpengine.dll and mpengine.dll._p among others</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant delete the folders because it says I need permission from NETWORK SERVICE to do so. When I try do delete the contents of the folder it requires administrator permission so I click continue with the little admin shield(I am the only user of this computer
 and I am the admin), when I click that continue button another window pops up that says I need the permission of the computer's administrator to delete it with a retry button! This is really frightening and I would assume someone else has encountered a similar
 issue, does anyone know how to solve this!?!??!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on windows 10 64bit.</p>

            Hello Aswind, and thank you for your reply, what exactly does being connected to a domain network entail? The only "network" I may be connected to would be my home network where when I built this computer I hooked it up to the same router as my living
 room PC. Also, given the permissions that these folders seem to have I don't think a scan will do much, is there any way I can forcefully delete the folders?

            Do you delete everything that looks mysterious to you? Better to do research on the internet so you can understand what things are before messing up your computer. For example, the Network Service is an important part of the Windows operating system.

    <title>Surface Pro 4 - Ghosting Images in Display - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jorgo1690  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 - Ghosting Images in Display</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, my SP4 is 3 months old and since the most recent update of Windows 10 - it has began developing ghosting images, particularly when playing videos, YouTube etc.
</p>
<p>The image is displayed then remains on the screen in an opaque form while the next image is in full colour. I suspect it is a Firmware or driver issue.</p>
<p>So this is what I have done so far and it has remained stable for a couple days then returns. It gets so bad I cant see the windows to navigate.</p>
<p>System Restore, removed all Apps, Backed up all Documents, reduced down the resolution&nbsp;and then turned off the touch screen drivers. I am now left with a thin strip right at the top of the screen where the colour remains in full - yet 99% appears to have
 a consistent tint over the screen. </p>
<p>I use this SP4 for my work and use very basic picture edit software, nonetheless I NEED&nbsp;reliable unit that doesn't have ghosting images......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice greatly appreciated in advance......</p>

    <title>How can I mark text in a CMD PROMPT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ekrash  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I mark text in a CMD PROMPT</h2>
                    See what I mean...the resizeable box changing up to the cursor where you would want to "mark text up to".....well I can mark and copy half of it at least.<br />
<br />
Its not hooking the lines of text as you drag the selection box up to x point...the box disappears over everything previous=extra manual operations.<br />
<br />
This needs a fix.

            As far as I know, this is by design in the command prompt. The text is not a stream of text like a word processor editor and word wrapping or selection wrapping does not exist.

<h2>            fix broken registration link for installed software.</h2>
                    
<p>I had to run re-install of xp after a virus my wife downloaded, when I did it broke the registration of a third party software i own. I un-installed and re-installed the software. To register the product I had downloaded a .reg file from the company. After
 I imported the .reg file the software gives me a message that it cannot find the registration entry. This worked just fine for the original installation but is not working for the re-install. The company is now out of business so I am on my own. How can I
 make the new installation find the registration key? I do know the clsid and verified it installed in the registry but the software doesn't seem to find it. Is there any way to fix this?</p>

<p>You haven't told us the name of the 'third party software'.&nbsp; If<br />
you post back with details of the program, someone might be able<br />
to suggest a solution to your problem.</p>
<p>It seems you had previously obtained a licence to use the<br />
software.&nbsp; The vendor supplied an activation key (which was<br />
probably valid for a limited period only).&nbsp; You have reinstalled<br />
the software.&nbsp; To activate the program, you need to visit the<br />
vendor's website again (to validate the re-installation against your original licence) and obtain a new activation key.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you have a very real problem.&nbsp; The vendor, who<br />
licensed the software has gone out of business.&nbsp; Consequently, it<br />
will be difficult, if not impossible to obtain a new registration<br />
key.&nbsp; And without a new key, the software will not work.</p>

 the clsid in that field but it did nothing. I am very comfortable working in registry editor but know mostly I only know how to add or delete things not so much know how things like this work. If you need those sections of the registry I can post them.</p>

<p>This software did not have a time expired key per the manufacturer when I bought it. it was guarenteed to be lifetime key. &nbsp;The problem is not an expired registration error. It clearly says the registration key was not found. I am pretty sure I just need
 to tell the software where to look for the key and I do not know how to do this. If anybody can help please jump in here. Bob could you please forward this to anyone you know that might know how to help me.</p>

<p>How do I have those file sizes simplified and shown in more convenient units like MB, GB etc?</p>

                    Hello, I would like to ask if I have removed a device from one Microsoft account and connected it to a new account, will the digital license be transferred over? (PS. Also, if I deactivate Windows 10 on one device, will I then be able to activate it on
 a new device?)

            Hi Oliver, yes the digital licence for that device will be unaffected and Windows will remain Activated. 
<br />
<br />The digital licence is tied to the device, not to your Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />So for example, say if you sell a device, the digital licence remains with the laptop/PC and will stay activated for the new owner!

            Digital license objective is an additional means of making reactivation easier if you make significant changes if you change motherboard or decide to move a full retail license to another motherboard.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Digital License
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.

            Activation is tied to the motherboard first. So if you transfer it to a new computer, you would find windows not activated for the first time.
<br />The following rule applies on transferring Windows license to another computer:
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/2577-sh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/2577-sh</a>... 
<br />
<br />Uninstall the keyhttps://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/ 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this: 
<br />
<br />Contact Microsoft at <a href="http://www.support.microsoft.com/contactus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.support.microsoft.com/contactus</a> through chat support. They would take control of your PC and activate(might need a proof of purchase) 
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.

    <title>Windows 10 store app not updating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dennisbierly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 store app not updating</h2>
                    <p>After installing the Windows 10 anniversary update everything seemed okay. The only problem I had was that my Microsoft Mahjong did not update. After trying everything I could find on the problem, I noticed that the Windows store app had not updated. I am
 still on version 11606.1001.39.0. I'm thinking that this is probably the reason why Mahjong will not update. So again I have tried everything I could find and nothing has worked. I have even uninstalled and reinstalled the store app. I have ran sfc /scannow
 with no problems. Any ideas besides a refresh or reinstall, I really don't want to have to install all of my programs again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I finally had to reinstall &nbsp;windows to get windows store app to update. However, Microsoft Mahjong still will not update.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Dennis,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I appreciate the troubleshooting steps you have tried to resolve the issue. As you have mentioned that you have uninstalled and reinstall Windows store this might be issue with user account in your PC.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Y</span><span>ou can create new user accounts on <strong>Windows 10.</strong> Those are basically
<strong>local accounts</strong>, but if you add your Microsoft credentials to it, it becomes a
<strong>Microsoft account</strong>. You need a Microsoft account to access the Windows Store, which enables you to download and install the applications. With a local account you can only access but can’t download and use the applications without the Microsoft
 credentials. </span></p>

            I have 2 computers and both have the same version of windows 10. I am logged in to both with the same Microsoft account and they are both synced. The other computer has no problems with any updates. I have also tried logging out of the Microsoft account
 and using a local account. Nothing changed, so I logged back in to the Microsoft account. The only difference between the 2 computers is that one is on the insider program. That is how I found out about the update to the windows store, so I was just waiting
 for the anniversary update so that the other computer would be updated also. Never happened.

"FreeAgentService" is related to Seagate external hard drives, so presumably you have one of these and installed whatever software was bundled with it.&nbsp; Something apparently has gone wrong with one of these applications causing it to not shut down gracefully.&nbsp;
 In general, this software is not necessary for the use of your external hard drive.&nbsp; I suggest removing it following the directions here:<a href="http://seagate.custkb.com/seagate/crm/selfservice/search.jsp?DocId=206311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://seagate.custkb.com/seagate/crm/selfservice/search.jsp?DocId=206311</a>
 If you want to re-install it later, either use the CD (if any) that came with the hard drive, the folder (if any) on the external hard drive that has the installer, or get it from<a href="http://www.seagate.com/ww/v/index.jsp?locale=en-US&amp;vgnextoid=1b0cfbbad0f89210VgnVCM1000001a48090aRCRD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.seagate.com/ww/v/index.jsp?locale=en-US&amp;vgnextoid=1b0cfbbad0f89210VgnVCM1000001a48090aRCRD</a><br />

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>- What is the exact location of the files on the host computer?</div>
<div>- Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to create a new test folder on the host computer and then check for the same on the other computer. If you are able to see and access the test folder, I would suggest you to move the zip files on to the test folder and check if the
 issue persists.</div>
<div><strong>Create a new folder</strong></div>

    <title>Windows 10 Thumbnails AND Icons Gone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wurmkampf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Thumbnails AND Icons Gone</h2>
                    <p>Alright, I was doing some routine cleaning with Ccleaner two days ago, and one of the areas cleaned was the Thumbnail cache.</p>
<p>When it finished, I discovered that in Large View mode, none of my icons or thumbnails regenerated. I can still see them in Medium, Small, Tiles, Details, etc. but not Large or Extra Large.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/18143078-46ea-49af-a7a5-48e855bdee4d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/18143078-46ea-49af-a7a5-48e855bdee4d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I made sure the check box "Display only icons, never thumbnails" was unchecked, and even checked and re-un-checked it to make sure. I also tried the suggestion of running Disk Cleanup and clearing the Thumbnail cache again, no dice. Another article suggested
 some registry edits to set those filetypes back to factory default settings (jpeg, png, etc) but all that did was reset their program association from Irfanview back to Windows Photo Viewer. Finally I tried installing Icaros and managing my thumbnail cache
 with it. Still no luck. Of course after each of these solutions I rebooted the machine. So far nothing has worked. Help please? What makes this issue extra weird for me is that only Large/Extra Large View is affected, and that the default icons are missing
 as well as the thumbnails.</p>

            Hi WK.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try rebuilding the Icon cache:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/232779/how-to-rebuild-a-broken-icon-cache-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/232779/how-to-rebuild...</a>
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if the Update installs and causes the same problem again uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />I don't recommend CCleaner any longer since Avast Bloatware bought it and we started seeing problems never seen before - much like Avast which was once the most recommended AV by experts until it bloated up 8 years ago and now no one recommends it for anything except uninstall.  
<br />
<br />So I'd use Disk Cleanup exclusively which is adequate.  In Windows 10 what matters most is a solid CLean Install, after which the built-in diagnostics is enough.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else works I'd wait a week because I've seen this same issue several times here today so it's possible there will be a fix pushed soon if Updates caused it.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            If the steps given to End Explorer process don't make the icon cache files delete then access the Command Prompt in Repair Mode by one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a> to open a Command Prompt, then run the Commands.

<br />If that fails, type notepad.exe to get a File explorer to browse to the files to delete them.

            Hi Wurmkampf
<br />
<br />This is a known bug in Windows 10, where thumbnails will not appear in Large/Extra large icons view, there is no fix, this has been reported many times over the past month, so hopefully Microsoft are working on a fix . . .
<br />
<br />Please provide feedback to Microsoft on the Feedback Hub (Windows Key + F) to add weight to those that have already reported this to them . . .

<p>Alrighty, Hurricane Michael hit the base and I ended up evacuating for two months and only recently got the computer back (Everything in the house survived thank God).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I of course got her set up again and pushed the two months of backed-up updates that had been pending; the issue is still persisting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started browsing here again to see if more solutions had been offered up in that time period and there has been: I ran the sfc /scannow in CMD and got no integrity issues. I now have Powershell with Admin running as a type this having run "DISM /Online
 /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore" which did find some discrepancies and now "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup" is running as I type and trucking along slowly at about 70.5% and counting. I'll continue to run the rest of the checklist
 which is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC /SCANNOW <br />
<br />
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore [Done]<br />
<br />
DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup [In Progress]<br />

<h2>            Safe Mode with network opens the browser on startup</h2>
                    Hi! Due to something I'm still working on diagnosing, sometimes I need to open Safe Mode with networking. But every time I do that, Windows launches my default browser to open&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/products/windows?os=windows-10 as soon as
 it can, without my permission. Is there any way to stop it from doing that? The whole point of me starting in Safe Mode is that I don't want any programs to launch until I say so. And I&nbsp;<em>especially
</em>don't want a browser launching before my antivirus and firewall are running, which is exactly what safe mode is doing to me. Is that the default behavior on Safe Mode, and if yes, how do I stop it from happening?&nbsp;

<p>Hi! No, it's not. Even if it was, Safe Mode isn't supposed to launch anything at startup. My antivirus and firewall are on the startup tab but my browser isn't, and in Safe Mode my browser launches but my antivirus and firewall don't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus I don't think it's about startup programs, what happens in Safe Mode is that Windows launches that webpage and then the browser is called to open it.</p>

            If you move it to a new computer because the old one went bye, bye or move to new drive no problem, other wise you must remove from Windows 8j.1 from one drive or computer in order to install on another. Hope this helps and if you need any further assistance
 post and we will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Xbox not picking up my seagate external hard drive anymore after new updated</h2>
                    <p>my external hard drive is a seagate 5tb and I talked to support and they told me to try to get some help in the forum since they couldn't help me anymore. We went through all the trouble shooting steps but my hard drive still isn't becoming detectable. I'm not sure what to do and need some help. They said I was in the early access program but I am pretty sure I opted out of that a long time ago.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Microsoft edge seems completely broken</h2>
                    I clicked on Microsoft edge on the taskbar as I usually do, and nothing happens at all, I click it loads more times and still nothing, then I right click and select open only to receive and error message telling me to re install it. First I thought it
 could be because of a virus, so I ran Norton full system scans and the Norton power eraser scan but nothing was found.&nbsp; But I found there were some downloads from chrome that I thought were suspicious that downloaded frequently, so I uninstalled chrome, as
 I never use it anymore. I read in another discussion that I can open it through apps with my default browser, which was chrome. So I opened an app which links to the internet and internet explorer was the programme that opened it. So I resorted to trying to
 un install and re install Microsoft edge. BUT THERE IS NO APPARENT WAY TO DO SO! I cant uninstall it by the usual way, and even when I right click the Microsoft edge icon in the start menu the only option is to un-pin it. And I c

            I'm thinking your problem is in your User settings and that there is nothing wrong with Microsoft Edge if its working for others.&nbsp;&nbsp; Go through your settings and if no luck consider reset or restore.&nbsp;&nbsp; Always backup/save what you need/want before doing
 any reset or restore.&nbsp;&nbsp; Good luck.

            I guess you just were not clear enough in your instructions for this to work. All @Bains_ should need to do is right click command prompt and run as admin and that should work for the sfc. this is definitely a problem with windows edge and not user settings.
 I know several people with same problem with edge as its still not in the best shape there is still problems. good luck i know this is old but hopefully it helps someone.

                    In the middle of being online, I got an error message saying "THREAD_STUCK_IN_DEVICE_DRIVER." I restarted and, upon doing research, discovered that the solution was to uninstall my graphics card drivers and reinstall them. The problem is, I cannot find
 a place where a driver download is available for my graphics card (<span>AMD Radeon HD 8330 graphics). Now, the deleting has limited me to only using one monitor
 and made my system overall more buggy. Can someone post a download link for&nbsp;</span><span>AMD Radeon HD 8330 graphics drivers?</span>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You may install the software for the printer from the Kodak website and use that. I would suggest you to refer to the manual for the software for complete steps for scanning. After scanning the image
 you can attach it to the email.</p>

<h2>            using a monitor to extend my screen</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP elitebook laptop with a docking station. I have an Acer LCD monitor that I was using and was functioning perfectly until all of a sudden it became invisible to my lap top. I restarted, checked all VGA connections on multiple occasions and everything
 is in order. I get a no signal message on the monitor and when I look for the display in settings (detect) it can't find it either. Why would it have just quit like that and what can I do to fix this problem. I repeat that it was working perfectly and then
 just stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Lou,<br />
<br />
There are several possible reasons why your LCD monitor suddenly stopped working. It could be that the graphic driver is outdated or could be the cable used is already damaged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to isolate this problem, we would like to ask the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any changes made on your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Have you installed any updates?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, please try the following suggestions and see if your laptop will detect the LCD monitor:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Update the graphic card driver. Check out Update drivers in Windows 10 for the steps.</li><li>Use another cable. Try using another VGA cable to connect the LCD monitor to the laptop.</li><li>Connect the LCD monitor to another computer. To help us isolate the issue, try connecting the LCD monitor to a different computer.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know how it goes. We're looking forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>
