    <title>Windows Command Processor nested under Akamai Netsession Client on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Command Processor nested under Akamai Netsession Client on Startup</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've been trying to speed up my PC's boot time, and noticed that Akamai netsession client has a high impact on my startup time. I did a little research, and am vaguely familiar with what it is. I want to disable it, but for some reason, Windows Command Processor
 is nested under the main Akamai task on bootup. I opened the containing folder and it seems to be the legit cmd.exe in the System32 folder, but I can't find out why it would be nested under Akamai. I would like to disable Akamai, but it seems as though I can't
 without disabling this as well, and I wasn't sure whether I can do that safely since cmd.exe is integral to the operating system. I did see online that a lot of viruses can imitate cmd.exe, but I've never had problems with it making popups before or asking
 me for permissions, so I'm not exactly sure what I'm looking at here. I've included a screenshot of what I'm talking about below.</p>

            Hey Andrew,
<br />
<br />I believe that Akamai NetSession, since it runs under Windows Command Processor, is a console application. Otherwise, I think it's as useless as a screen door in a submarine, really.
<br />
<br />I'd suggest you run Autoruns from Sysinternals and see if you can find the entry that best represents Akamai NetSession Client: <a href="https://download.sysinternals.com/files/Autoruns.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://download.sysinternals.com/files/Autorun...</a>
<br />
<br />Extract the ZIP file of all contents, then open Autoruns.exe in the newly extracted directory.
<br />
<br />Under the Everything tab, see if you can find the Akamai NetSession Client and disable it, or if you wish, remove the entry.
<br />
<br />Keep me posted if this doesn't work. Otherwise, good luck, I hope it helps.

<h2>            Power Schemes duplicate records</h2>
                    <p>How do I know which power plan did the current customized power plan derive from?</p>
<p>E.g. apply Create a power plan based on Balanced, Power Saver or High Performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then how do I&nbsp;know what's its parent power plan( if I didn't know)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any record that keeps the hirachy? </p>

            Hello my name is Bradford and I'm an Independent Advisor for the Microsoft Community and I will try to answer your question regarding creating a custom power plan and knowing its parent. 
<br />
<br />The parent of the custom plan is not stored so there is no way to know according to my research. 
<br />
<br />If you notice in these two links, reviewing the disclaimer at the bottom, one using the GUI to make a custom plan, the other one using Powershell, that the reference (or GUID) of the parent-plan is not stored once the custom plan is created:
<br />

            <p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code 0x00028001 that you encountered is due to limited Wi-Fi connection. Since you are connected to a school Wi-Fi, expect that there will be multiple device connected to the same broadcasted network that you are using. At the same time, the error
 may also occur when you are too far from the router. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot, we'd still recommend that you check this article and follow the instructions:

            <p>Hey there matchampion6.</p>
<p>Just to clear up a bit of confusion I've seen, the original Prince of Persia remake <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/Product/Prince-of-Persia/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80258410865" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">found here</a> is the game that is currently backward compatible with the Xbox One. You may be confusing the game with <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/Product/Prince-of-Persia/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8025553080c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this later release of the same name</a>. Let me know if that clears up the trouble you're having :)</p>

            <p>Hey, Mat! I'm very sorry to see any confusion around this. If you would like the Backward Compatible version, I suggest reaching out to <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">phone support</a> to ask for a refund for the game you purchased, and then purchase the version that is compatible. That would be the best solution here to get you the game you are expecting to be back compat.</p>
<p>However, if you are preferring this one instead, definitely give that game a vote on our <a href="http://xbox.uservoice.com/forums/298503-backwards-compatibility/suggestions/8376987-prince-of-persia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Feedback Site</a>. This is how your voice is heard for what games you'd like for back compat! :)</p>

<h2>            WIN 7 audiodg.exe and NT Kernel &#38; System CPU Hog</h2>
                    <strong>Explanation<br />
</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I recently factory reset my Dell Inspiron Laptop running Windows 7 due to some problems I was having a hard time figuring
 out how to fix. It seems everything has fixed with the reset except for a problem whenever I attempt to play game on my PC. The PC has the proper specs to run the game, yet whenever I try playing, my FPS (Frames per second) is fine for about 30 seconds, then
 they drop so low for 30 seconds, and this just keeps happening. I decided to check out what was going on in the background, so I opened task manager to see if anything was wrong and saw in the performance tab that whenever the FPS in game would drop, the CPU
 was sky rocketing to 70-90%. I then went into resource monitor to see what was causing that and discovered that audiodg.exe, and NT Kernel &amp; System was using so much CPU.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Steps I Have Taken</strong><br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I have done some research and everything I found to fix audiodg.exe is to go to my playback devices &gt; properties &gt; enhancements

<h2>            Slow performance using grep.exe or ag.exe on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been transitioning from windows 7 to window 10. I use cygwin and linux tools like grep.exe and ag.exe to search file contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is using these tools on windows 10 is dog slow and I don't get why. For a search that takes 5 seconds on my windows 7, takes about ~1.5 minutes on windows 10. (same search on same files)</p>
<p>Another observation is while searching, the lsass.exe starts using most of the cpu (40 -60 %) then goes back to idle when the search finally finishes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turned off realtime scanning (windows anti-malware)</li><li>Turned off UAC</li><li>used cmd.exe to search instead of mintty.exe terminal (to bypass cygwin.dll)</li><li>used powershell.exe to search</li><li>Program compatibility mode set to windows 7</li></ul>

            Hello! Sorry you are having this issue. Hopefully we can fix it.
<br />
<br />This may just be a bug with an update, or something else with the PC. 
<br />
<br />Has the problem ever occurred before recently? If so, try a rollback in the recovery environment. 
<br />
<br />If not, try to do the commnds in safe mode. Safe mode: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/...</a>
<br />
<br />Check if the problem still occurs there. If not, then do a clean boot of the PC and run the commands again. 
<br />
<br />Clean boot: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of this works, it may be that grep and others are including a lot of un-needed files that are making it take a long time. You may want to use an --exclude command like: 
<br />
<br />
<br />sudo time grep -rnw --exclude-dir={boot,dev,lib,media,mnt,proc,root,run,sys,/tmp,tmpfs,var} '/' -e 'Sony 50"'
<br />
<br />Or similar.

<h2>            Fresh Install of Windows 10 on a &#34;new motherboard&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was just wondering what the process was for a fresh install. I'm currently upgrading to a new motherboard and my current machine already has windows 10. After some digging I found that windows 10 doesn't play nice when it comes to upgrading major components
 of a PC. So is there a way I could transfer my old (windows 7) product key and use it to reactivate my window 10 again on a new motherboard?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
                </div>

            <p>Not really.&nbsp; Your Windows 7 product key, is exactly that a Windows 7 product key, it is not a Windows 10 product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In theory by the license if you have a standalone (bought as separate retail DVD) copy of Windows 7, your upgrade to Windows 10 should be stand alone too, and you should be able to do the install and get it activated.&nbsp; If you have an OEM (came with the machine,
 Windows 7 license) it can't used on another device, and a new motherboard is considered a new device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for the "in practice part".&nbsp; The answers you are going to get here are going to be the "safe route", as in tell you that you would have install Windows 7 and then do the update again.&nbsp; That certainly will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way that can be bypassed is if Microsoft Support will activate it for you.&nbsp; And by Microsoft Support I mean something like using the Contact Support app or running this command line, command to bring up a telephone number to contact them:</p>
<p>slui 4</p>
<p>
</p><p>No one posting here is going to do it for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then you have to convince them that you have the right to do it.</p>
<p>Note this is from the Windows 10 license:</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stand-alone software. If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do try get them to activate it for you, I for one would really be grateful if you come back and post whether they allowed it or not.</p>

            I'm planning on upgrading the motherboard in just over a week. It was not an OEM copy, and I was hoping to get them to "activate it" before i did the full install as this is my primary computer for school and having it being "temporarily bricked" isn't
 a viable option for me as I need it for research. Hopefully I'll get lucky and figure this out. I'll keep you posted. Thanks for your comprehensive reply.

<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/activate-windows-10-with-new-motherboard/f6cda734-e917-4a3d-8f12-3a0a14637da7">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/activate-windows-10-with-new-motherboard/f6cda734-e917-4a3d-8f12-3a0a14637da7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It certainly seems to me that this is in violation of the license agreement, but unless someone/a group was willing to sue, I guess you would be stuck with whatever they are currently telling their support people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note in the past this was never an issue, I had done it several times.&nbsp; I think they just didn't do anything different for the people with stand-alone licenses and are now caught in a situation where they can't tell if they should allow activating or not.</p>

</p><p>Yes, you can project your Microsoft Edge window or any other page full screen on the second monitor, just like on a normal external monitor or projector.</p>

            <p>Hello TeeFaser,</p><p><br /></p>
<p>Are you seeing an error when you try to download the game?</p><p><br /></p>
<p>If
 you're only meaning that the download did not start automatically, on 
your console you can go to System/Account/Download History and find Just
 Dance 2014 in that list and then press A to bring up a menu and confirm
 to start the download.</p><p><br /></p>
<p><em>However</em>, you mention
 you bought it from the Microsoft Store, so could you confirm the 
product page link you bought from? There's a chance you bought a 
physical copy of the game, so you would receive the disc for Just Dance 
2014 by mail and could then pop it in your Xbox 360 and play it. (If you
 did indeed buy a digital licence, not the disc, the first suggestions 
apply -- either go to Download History or let us know the error you're 
seeing.)</p><p><br /></p>
<p>Let us know how you get on.

            <p>Most computer have a "Recovery" partition which is used to re-install Windows. Typical you press a specific "F" key (F8, F10, F11, Etc) when you first boot the computer to start the recovery process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check your PC manufacture's support web site, your owner's / user's guide&nbsp;or try contacting the&nbsp;support team for your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your only other option if your PC came with a recovery media is to use it to re-install Windows or invoke the "Reset your PC" option&nbsp;to start over<br />
</p>
<p>"Reset, reinstalls Windows and blows out everything, even allowing you to securely wipe your data, so you can donate or sell your machine. At the end of a Reset, you'll need to re-enter your Windows product key."</p>
<p><br />
"In some cases, you might just want to remove everything and start from scratch manually. But in other cases, you’re removing your data from a PC because you’re about to recycle or decommission it. For both of these situations, you can easily reset your Windows
 8 PC and put the software back into the same condition as it was when you started it for the very first time (such as when you purchased the PC).</p>
<p><br />
Resetting your Windows 8 PC goes like this:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC boots into the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows RE erases and formats the hard drive partitions on which Windows and personal data reside.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows RE installs a fresh copy of Windows.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC restarts into the newly installed copy of Windows."</p>

<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows&nbsp;8 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. </p>
<p>For Fujitsu, press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>--------------------</p>
<p><strong>When you are booted into the Recovery environment, click 'Troubleshoot'</strong></p>

<h2>            Regional code for Champion Jockey G1</h2>
                    
<p>I have owned an xbox 360 for about 8 years and have never bought a game outside a Gamestop in the U.S. I was really interested in playing a horse racing game so I bought champion jockey on amazon from the U.K. Nowhere was I told on either amazon or the game
 case that the region mattered. I've play pc games from Europe all the time. I never knew that the region mattered considering I play with British kids on live a lot. Now I have a useless disc that I can't return. I have another xbox that i'd be willing to
 change its region to play this game. Can anyone help me I just want to the game.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
There's no way to change a Xbox 360 consoles set region. These are hardware based locks. When a console is sold in North America (United States/Canada) it gets&nbsp;a disc drive that can only play NTSC based games.<br />
<br />
The disc you have is a PAL based game since it's from the United Kingdom. Most if not all of Europe has PAL consoles. PC games don't have this designation, it's only for console games, dvd's and bluray's. Though, most DVD/BluRay players are now region free
 so you can take your movies and play them on any player. If you wish to play this particular game you'd need to get a console that is from Europe same goes for all other PAL based games you wish to order and play.<br />
<br />
The reason you're able to play with British folks living in the United States is because on the East Coast ping times to the United Kingdom specifically are bearable compared to the rest of Europe. Xbox LIVE games match you with folks who have an acceptable
 ping time in games such as Call of Duty, Halo, etc.</p>

<p>As Hassassinade stated in his response, the region setting is NOT software based but rather a hardware issue. &nbsp;There is nothing you can change about it.</p>

<p>You can change your account region to whatever you'd like, but it's recommended you stay in the same region that you're living in to avoid issues with purchasing and downloading content on Xbox LIVE.<br />
<br />
Changing the account region of your account doesn't affect the region coding of the disc or the hardware lock of your console. If the console you have is a US console (NTSC) and the game you're trying to play is European (PAL) then it will not work.</p>

            <p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the exact error message you are getting?</li><li>Are you able to install other drivers on the computer?</li><li>Have you made any recent hardware or software changes to the computer prior to the issue?</li></ol>
<p>I understand that you are unable to install the projector driver on the computer. We are really sorry for the inconvenience caused to you. You might be facing this issue due to several reasons like third party software conflicts, corrupt driver etc. I suggest

<p>I recently purchased Surface Pro 3. However, I'm experiencing&nbsp;2 significant&nbsp;setbacks with the product. First, the Surface battery&nbsp;does not hold charge. I have to keep it plugged. Technical Support advised me to refresh the Surface in the hope that new updates
 will clear out the problem.. In doing so, Office 2013 was wiped out as well.</p>
<p>I know there is a link for REINSTALLING OFFICE on Microsoft webpage ---within my account---but for some strange reasons I cannot find it! Kindly please assist.</p>

<h2>            How to save a setting for the ClearType Tuner.</h2>
                    
<p>After many, many tryouts I've finally settled down on a satisfying display tune for the ClearType font. The thing is though that I can't remember which of the given examples were the ones that I chose. So I'm wondering if there's a way to export the current
 configuration to a file.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Is It Fair To Charge For DLC That&#8217;s Already On Disc&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is It Fair To Charge For DLC That&#8217;s Already On Disc&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Earlier this week, Epic released The Horde Command Pack DLC for Gears of War 3, but it turns out that much of that content was already on the disc, and players just needed to download an unlocked. Is that fair? Epic thinks so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"We're not saying that everything on the disc is the product," Gears 3 executive producer Rod Fergusson told
<a href="http://kotaku.com/5856425/gears-of-war-3-creator-explains-why-theyre-charging-to-unlock-content-thats-already-on-the-disc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Kotaku </a>in a recent interview. "The disc is another delivery mechanism."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Fergusson, in an attempt to unify a game’s online community, game developers want all players to have access to new DLC content whether they pay for it or not. This makes DLC a trick proposition. The solution is that many developers provide
 new DLC to all players, but only allow those who paid for it to use the DLC weapon skins or host a new DLC map.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"One of the concerns was we would have to have people download compatibility packs,” explains Fergusson. However, since Gears of War was delayed from its original released date, earlier this Spring, Epic felt it had the option to include it’s first DLC pack
 on the disc, so that everyone wouldn’t have to download the new content. "We felt it was a win/win, because no one is going to have to download anything huge when the DLC comes out."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fergusson also said that he thought that there was so much on the original Gears of War 3 disc that he didn’t feel like Epic was shorting players who didn’t want to buy the DLC.</p>

<p>It's sad really, before 60$ would buy you the full game. Now? 60$ buy you part of the game. If you went the full game you have to pay 115$ now...</p>

<p>This is a pointless thing to complain about because there are way too many idiots who are willing to fork over their hard earned cash every day for DLC that could have been included on release day. &nbsp;Nothing you can do to stop it and it's only going to get
 worse as time goes by.</p>

<p>Good thing the OP doesn't play Forza 4. &nbsp;It is scheduled for 12 DLC packs, one per month for a year after release. &nbsp;Everything in their DLC packs is already on the discs too. &nbsp;No company is better at ripping people off than Turn 10.</p>

<p>And to be perfectly honest, I would be more than willing to spend a hundred or so dollars on a really good title if all DLC was included. I am not talking about one time use code cards either. Just having the disc itself should give you access to the content.
 I mean development costs are on avearge 10 tiles higher than they were when Nintendo was selling N64 games for 65 dollars. I understand they want to make more money. I understand that video game prices never&nbsp;really went up with&nbsp;inflation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You see, I have so many DLC packs I am doing nothing at all with. I have all the Reach packs, two of the four Black Op's packs, etc, etc, etc. The reason I didnt buy the other BO packs is because the game already got expensive enough for me at 90.00. I cant
 imagine investing 120.00 on something I might be able to sell for 20 bucks. Now if I buy MW3, I am stuck in the cycle all over again with yet again more content I am not going to care about next year when the following installment releases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know what people will say. This will never work because if they get your money up front, there is no need to work on the content. I disagree. Up until this gen, DLC was always seen as appreciation. More so like an incentive to get you to buy future titles.
 I dont know if you guys remember but when DLC was free, Ubisoft was releasing more Ghost Recon and R63 content than is available in 60.00 worth of map packs. I also like what DICE did last year with the BFBC2 content. VIP got you every pack except for Vietnam.
 If you didnt buy new or if you bought the game late, VIP only cost you 10.00.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used to buy so many games and still would if not for all this DLC crap.that has zero cash value to the customer. I used to be good for 30+ games a year. So far this year, I bought three. Bulletstorm, Crysis 2 and Battlefield 3.</p>

<p>It may be fair, but it's not right at all. It's the same has buying a car and then having to pay the dealer extra in order for them to allow you to use your air conditioning. I don't condone paying for something I've already paid for, this isn't even DLC
 it's LDC (Locked Disc Content).</p>
