    <title>No Startup folder - Microsoft Community</title>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span><span>Recently, i put a program in the startup folder in</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I later decided that I didn't want the program to Startup every time I log on, but instead of deleting the program i
<span>
<span>
accidentally</span> deleted the Startup folder instead. The folder is no longer in the recycling bin. Does anyone have any idea of how to replace my startup folder because I would really like to put some programs in there.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I've tried using Task Scheduler, but didn't find it to be very effective. What I really need is a new Startup folder.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>However this hasn't solved my problem...I placed the file in the new Startup folder but it didn't come up when I logged on. I know it's not the file because when I place the

<p><span><span>Do you have any ideas of what the problem could be?</span></span></p>

Hi Lucien</p>
<p>It sounds like this problem may be a bit deeper than just the Startup folder. You may have some corruption in that user account. Follow the instructions in the following link.</p>

<p>The system requirements page was written before Windows 10 was released and&nbsp;it simply hasn't&nbsp;been updated yet. The screenshot Shubham included above shows&nbsp;the 2012&nbsp;edition of Photo Gallery running on Windows 10. In addition, I can confirm Photo Gallery 2012

            <p>Hmm... If you open Photo Gallery from the Start menu or taskbar icon, it should give you something like the screenshot above. However, if you click on a picture and then choose to open it with Photo Gallery, you will get a different interface, like the one
 shown below.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If so, just click on the "Edit, organize, or share" button and that should take you to the main view.</p>

<h3> ron besdansky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 File History</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. I have 110 Gbytes total on my C drive including Windows. I am trying to start File History to back up to the G drive that has 137 Gbyte of free space. When I click Add Drive in Windows backup it gives a
 list which includes the G drive. When I click on the G drive, nothing happens. Someone from MS that I had in a chat claims the backup drive needs 1 Tbyte of free space. Is that true? Why???</p>

            Hi Ron.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />File History, Windows file and Image backup are dysfunctional and may be phased out in a future version. I suggest the safest and most reliable method which is to sort your files into their User Folders (Documents, Desktop, Pictures, Downloads, etc) and periodically drag them to external or another hard drive,  then have one other Cloud backup so your files are safe from fire and theft and easily accessible via the internet just like email.
<br />
<br />Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br /> Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg. Thanks so much for your almost instant reply! I have to admit I'm pretty staggered that File History is a broken product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have Google Drive sync and OneDrive. As you say, it's best to have an off-site backup anyway. I'll look into Macrium for the system image.</p>

            File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to
 a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).<br />
<br />
Learn more: https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-system-image-best-free-alternatives/<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
<br />
Let’s start off with Macrium Reflect (Free) (https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree). Macrium provides a small click to run the installer, but I chose the offline installer, which required finding the download agent (http://updates.macrium.com/reflect/v5.0/reflectdl.exe);
 this downloads the full installer at around 800 MBs. Included are a collection of preinstallation environment tools based on Microsoft’s Windows Image deployment solutions.<br />
<br />
Setup was quick and easy but needed a restart to complete changes made to the system.<br />
<br />
The Macrium Reflect interface is a bit more jam-packed than what you would normally find in Windows 10. But this a powerful alternative offering a range of options for creating and managing backups. Macrium integrates heavily with Windows—examples include support
 for attaching and browsing backups; boot image backups in Hyper-V; generating PowerShell scripts to automate backups; creating batch files and of course, scheduling backups. You can also find handy options such as cloning and standard file and folder backup.<br />
<br />
For these instructions, we are going to focus on image backups. Similar to the System Image backup (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-system-image-backup/) feature in Windows 10 and previous versions, this lets you create a replica of your
 current installation state. You can be granular with your backups by choosing only the partitions you want to save as part of your image.<br />
<br />
To create your first image, click the menu Create an image of the partition(s) required to backup and restore Windows.<br />
<br />
Under Destination, click the Browse button, then point to your external drive where you want to store the backup, create a new folder, select it then click OK. Click Next to Continue.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This phase of the wizard lets you create a Backup plan if you want. It’s optional, but lets you choose different methods of backups which include full, incremental and differential. For now, I am going to choose a schedule just to make things simple. I recommend
 you review the retention rules to save on disk space. Users can retain a number of backups using any method; this can quickly eat up disk space over time, so I will reduce the amount for each to about two. Click Next to Continue.<br />
<br />
What are Incremental and Differential Backups and which should you choose?<br />
<br />
A full backup gives you one backup file that restores your entire system up to that point. Full backups are a comprehensive way to go, but they take a long time to create and if you have multiple backup images, you end up duplicating a lot of the same data.
 Incremental and differential backups are two ways to address this inefficiency.<br />
<br />
Incremental Backup – This maintains a regular backup in addition to changes that have been made since the last full or incremental backup. Incremental backups are often preferred because they use less disk space; not to mention, they are faster, too. So, if
 you created new Word documents since your last backup, those are added to the backup.<br />
<br />
So, let’s say Backup A is a full backup you made on Monday. On Wednesday, you can make an incremental Backup B which only includes the new data since Backup A. On Friday, you can make Backup C, which only includes the new data since Backup B. In this way, you
 are storing no duplicate data. The downside is that if you want to restore your image, you have to use all three backup files: Backup A, Backup B, and Backup C.<br />
<br />
Differential Backup – This creates a backup of the differences made since the last full backup. So, if you made changes to a few Microsoft Word documents, those changes are applied to the backup. A disadvantage is that differential backups use more space, since
 you need to maintain a full backup in addition to changes since you created your last backup.<br />
<br />
How is that different than an incremental backup? Let’s say you make a full Backup A on Monday. On Wednesday, Backup B contains the differences since Backup A was made. On Friday, Backup C contains the differences since Backup A.&nbsp; In this way, if you want to
 do a restoration, you just need two files: the last full backup and the last differential backup. This means you only ever need two files, compared to the incremental backup method. The downside is that, as you can imagine, your differential backup image file
 gets bigger and bigger as the time since your last full backup increases. And after awhile, you end up with a quite a bit of duplicated data across your various differential backups.<br />
<br />
So, which should you use? Either one is fine. It all depends on how much storage space and time you have. Incremental backups are faster and take less space during the backup phase. Differential backups take more time and space during the backup phase but are
 easier during the restoration phase.<br />
<br />
Review the image summary to ensure you chose the right options. If you maintain a dual boot configuration, make sure each partition is checked as part of your backup. Click Finish to begin the backup.<br />
<br />
Click OK to start the backup immediately.<br />
<br />
As with all image backups, it will take some time, so, sit back and relax as your image is saved. Click Close after your image is created.<br />
<br />
Restoring Your Macrium Image<br />
<br />
There are multiple ways to restore a backup. You can start the restore process from within a running installation of Windows 10 with Macrium already installed. But in most cases, restoring an image would take place after booting into a recovery environment
 similar to System Image in Windows 10.<br />
Create Rescue Media<br />
<br />
One important task you should complete after creating your image is to create rescue media, which will facilitate restoration of the image. This is perfect for scenarios where your computer won’t boot or you installed a new empty hard disk. Click the Other
 Tasks menu then click Create Rescue Media.<br />
<br />
This will start the create bootable rescue media wizard. Remember, as we mentioned earlier, Macrium downloads a full installer at around 800 MBs. This is where the preinstallation environment tools based on Microsoft’s Windows Image deployment solutions are
 used. Macrium adds its own recovery tools to facilitate restoration of the image when you boot from it. Click Next.<br />
<br />
You can add drivers in advance for hardware that might not be supported by the restored image. Click the Update Driver button to do so then point to the source. This can minimize the chances of Windows 10 not booting on new hardware; especially if you are changing
 motherboards.<br />
<br />
Depending on the architecture of your Windows 10 image, you can choose either a 32 or 64-bit (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/windows-10-edition-architecture-build-your-install/) recovery image. For this particular case, I am restoring a 64 bit Windows 10
 installation, so I will choose that. Click Next to begin the creation.<br />
<br />
Bootable media can be prepared using a blank DVD or USB drive or you can create a bootable ISO image instead. Choose your desired method, then click Finish.<br />
<br />
Restore Image – Macrium Reflect<br />
<br />
Configure your computer to boot from the installation media (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/) on the target computer. Attach your external drive where the image is stored, then power it on.<br />
<br />
Under the Restore tab in Macrium, click the menu, Browse for an image or backup file to restore.<br />
<br />
Browse to the image file, select it then click Open.<br />
<br />
Click Select a disk to restore to… then click the selected image that appears. Click Next to begin the restoration.<br />
<br />
After the image is successfully restored, click File &gt; Exit to reboot.<br />
<br />
That’s pretty much all that’s involved in preparing a system image of your Windows 10 installation using Macrium Reflect. Macrium feels a little complex and overwhelming at first, but once you familiarize yourself with it, you should feel comfortable using
 it in no time. If you still want something a bit more user-friendly, then check out EaseUS Todo Backup Free.<br />

    <title>Location of user&#39;s custom sound schemes in Vista &#38; Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a.k.a.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Location of user&#39;s custom sound schemes in Vista &#38; Windows 7&#63; &#40;Hope to back it up &#47; export it, and build a scheme from scratch&#41;</h2>
                    Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
First of all, if a member of the Windows 7 sound team is reading this -- YOU GUYS ROCK! I am really blown away by the meticulous work you have done in recording these new sound schemes.&nbsp; You will make every Apple user jealous -- every mobile phone user, in
 fact.&nbsp; Calligraphy, Festival, Savanna and Sonata are especially exotic and dramatic.&nbsp; (What's the story behind the artists you recruited for 7? I know Eno was behind XP, and Fripp was behind Vista.&nbsp; I can only hazard some wild guesses that Tan Dun was behind
 or the inspiration for Calligraphy, that&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the bluegrass supergroups was behind Delta, and&nbsp;maybe that Kevin Volans or Thomas Mapfumo's Blacks Unlimited&nbsp;were the inspiration behind Savanna.)<br />
<br />
And so here's the issue that's coming up: <br />
<br />
How are custom sound schemes stored in both Vista and Windows 7?&nbsp; I see no way to back up&nbsp;/ export a custom scheme, because the location of that scheme is hard to trace. It's important to have a custom scheme on hand, so moderately experienced users don't have
 to worry each time&nbsp;they need to clean install.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Control Panel sound options in both Vista and Windows 7 allow building a custom sound scheme. They do NOT, however, discuss how to back one up or export it.&nbsp; So, for instance, I have just begun to edit a sound scheme, saved as "Custom," but the location
 of "Custom" is hard to determine. A search of the system for a file by this name turned up nothing. When saving a custom sound scheme in the Control Panel, no option is given to change the directory location, and there is no indication where it is being saved.&nbsp;
 There is no indication of a folder in the %SystemRoot%:\Windows\Media\ directory that corresponds to "Custom."<br />
<br />
Of course, since Windows 7 uses .theme files, the saved location of a custom sound scheme might be different than in Vista, but I don't have an alternate OS installation in place at the moment and can't check on it.<br />
<br />
Some clarification will also be useful on what the \Media\ directory contains.&nbsp; If I have made a custom profile, then are the "unfiled" default sound files in the directory the *original* default sounds, or are they now replaced by the *custom* scheme?<br />
<br />
I see no indication of a default scheme folder, which leads me to assume that the unfiled sound files are the defaults.<br />
<br />
But when a user is in the system sounds editor panel in Control Panel, "browsing" to upload and apply a&nbsp;custom sound file&nbsp;as a&nbsp;system event sound, where is that newly-uploaded file being saved?<br />
<br />
Is it, contrary to my expectations, replacing the default scheme? (With the option to restore the default sound scheme done by digging back through the original installation files to overwrite the files in the \Media\ directory.) I've heard that if you simply
 want to banish the default sounds, you copy all the files from a new scheme and paste them to replace the unfiled files in \Media\. So there's the confusion.<br />
<br />
Finally, the system sounds editor panel in Control Panel is kind of unwieldy. Can someone with admin rights create a new folder in \Media\, dump a bunch of files in there, and have Control Panel pick up on it the next time it opens?&nbsp; I'd like to know if there
 are any additional steps that would need to be taken to build a custom sound scheme by simply loading new (appropriately retitled) sound files into the \Media\ folder.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Is there a registry entry that will then need to be changed to have&nbsp;any file swap be&nbsp;seen by all / some / default users?<br />
<br />
Finally, how do the .theme files tie into this?<br />
<br />
This is a complete mystery, and I'm surprised there's no info out there on this question.&nbsp; I have searched the net high and low, and come up empty.&nbsp; An informed&nbsp;answer here would be a great reference to have available for others.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help&nbsp;on getting&nbsp;this straight.<br />

<p>Bla. Another glitch. Sorry about this, everyone. Having logged back on as a regular user (not as admin like when I answered the question), I'm recognized by MS as "a.k.a." and NOT as "a_k_a" now.&nbsp; (Two logins&nbsp;from MS consolidating many different parts of
 their&nbsp;forums).&nbsp; So I can't edit that post.&nbsp; So, reposting:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anthony,</p>
<p>(I'll come back and edit formatting for this in a few minues. Currently running in Protected Mode, which is messing up the scripts.)</p>
<p>Actually, that got us most of the way there.&nbsp; The page you found was a clear guide, but it's known info.&nbsp; Your discovery DID link to a broader explanation of how exportable .THEMEPACK and .THEME files are created, and that implies that there is no default
 storage location for a &amp;quot;Custom&amp;quot; sound scheme.&nbsp; Instead, modifying the Sound Scheme creates a modified .THEME file.</p>
<p>Here is the link to that guide:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/2026-theme-pack-create-save-install-delete.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/2026-theme-pack-create-save-install-delete.html</a></p>
<p>That guide on .THEMEPACKS links to the MSDN knowledge base article on making a .THEME file.</p>
<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb773190(VS.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb773190%28VS.85%29.aspx</a></p>
<p>That MSDN article says a .THEME file is simply a script telling Windows what changes to make in the Registry, and there is a section for sounds that points Windows to the location of the sound file for particular Events.</p>
<p>In other words, when you are making changes in Sound Schemes, you are making changes in a subcomponent of a .THEME file, which is a very compact file -- 3-8 KB or so.</p>
<p>It would be great to get some verification from someone to make sure that's right.&nbsp; That is my understanding now.</p>
<p>"[AppEvents] Sections (Sounds)<br />
Note&nbsp; This section is optional. If you do not include this section in your .theme file, the system uses default sound settings.<br />
The user can select the Sounds, Speech, and Audio Devices icon in Control Panel to associate sounds with events that occur in applications. For example, a .wav file can play when an application is opened. A .theme file can specify .wav files to replace the
 default ones. The following example shows how to do this.&amp;quot;</p>
<p>The registry key that's modified is</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\AppEvents\Schemes\Apps\.Default\[... name of system event goes here]<br />
DefaultValue=%WinDir%media\[...name of .WAV file goes here]</p>
<p>What this also implies is that the &amp;quot;unfiled&amp;quot; files in the \Media\ subdirectory ARE the files for the current sound scheme.&nbsp; I suppose the defaults, if erased, are recoverable????&nbsp; Not sure.&nbsp; I didn't see a folder for the default scheme, so that
 says to me DON'T TOUCH.</p>
<p>The .THEMEPACK format is a .CAB file:</p>
<p>"A theme pack is a .cab file that contains not only the .theme file but also the files needed to implement the theme on another computer, such as sound files and images. Users can create theme packs through the Personalization Control Panel.</p>
<p>"Supported file types include the following:</p>
<p>"File type Extension <br />
Theme .theme <br />
Image .jpg, .jpeg, .bmp, .dib, .tif, .png <br />
Sound .wav <br />
Mouse cursor .cur, .ani <br />
Desktop icon .ico <br />
Brand logo .png&amp;quot;</p>
<p>The guide on .THEMEPACK exporting says that under CONTROL PANEL --&amp;gt; PERSONALIZE (or DESKTOP --&amp;gt; RT-CLICK --&amp;gt; PERSONALIZE), you do three things:<br />
1. Edit your theme.<br />

    <title>Secondary HDD Crashed, Can&#39;t Uninstall or Install Programs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alieneila  say:</h3>
<h2>            Secondary HDD Crashed, Can&#39;t Uninstall or Install Programs</h2>
                    I have an SSD as main OS HDD, and had a secondary HDD that I installed everything on. For whatever reason, that HDD crashed and I've had to replace it. The problem I am running in to now is that all of the programs that were installed on that HDD obviously
 aren't there anymore. But when I go to install one of the programs the computer still thinks it is there and wont install (I am guessing due to registry entries), and if I go through Windows uninstaller, it says that files don't exist that are needed to uninstall.
 So I'm stuck and at a complete loss at how to get everything reset up. I've read that registry cleaners are more harm than good, but I am unsure what else to do?

            <p>No, the above is not working. 99% of the programs just don't do anything after you click "Uninstall" and if they do, it'll come up with an error that the files are missing since the hard drive that they were on no longer exists. I have over 100 programs
 that were installed on that hard drive, I can guarantee that most of them don't have a "cleanup" tool. Is there really no way to get Windows to not recognize that a program is no longer there so you can reinstall it?</p>

<p>So any chance Microsoft might listen and let Farsight Studios get the DLC tables for The Pinball Arcade out quick. I don't want to have to try a rival system to get the new tables.</p>

<p>Im sure they will release DLC, or at least i hope they will. The little i played since i purchased Pinball Arcade i definitely liked it.</p>
<p>As Nano said try emailing the developer or if they have a website maybe take a look and see if they have posted any info.</p>

<p>It appears that Micro$haft wants FarSight to wait for the release of the next generation XBox - however long that will be! :(</p>
<p>C'mon Microsoft - you are really pushing existing users to other platforms. Seriously, no other gaming platform is making us wait. I can play on Apple, Sony, even ANDROID! Get with the program! We should not have to wait for our titles for the likes of you.
 I am NOT going to buy the next XBox - you have proven that MicroSoft will interfere and hold back titles, and manipulate the market. Why whould I buy a console where titles are either deliberately held back, or worse, developers may shun because of all the
 hassle???? SHAME ON YOU!</p>

<p><span><span>Hi jacmad,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue has occurred recently, you may try to perform system restore which will restore back the computer to the point when it was working fine.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. You may open task manager by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. In Task Manager, under File &gt; New Task, type the command ‘rstrui.exe’, click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state,
 programs and updates you installed are removed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information, refer this link: &nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How
 to restore Windows XP to a previous state</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope the information helps. Please post back and let us know.</span></span></p>

    <title>HP Envy 23-d044 All-In-One Touch Screen PC. Blank Screen, no cursor - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HP Envy 23-d044 All-In-One Touch Screen PC.  Blank Screen, no cursor after Windows 10 Fall Creator update</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>HP Envy 23-d044 All-In-One Touch Screen PC.&nbsp; Blank Screen, no cursor, no power to keyboard, 12 days after Win 10 Fall Creator update.
<br />
<br />
After delaying the FC update for 2-3 days I finally installed it. It installed without a hitch, except when I would launch Windows related things like "Settings" "This PC" "Control Panel" etc., their associated icons appeared blank in the taskbar.
<br />
<br />
A few days after the installation, I was inactive on my computer for some time and it should've been in sleep mode if not hibernation, but it appears some update happened and auto restarted the pc, and I lost 2 or 3 unsaved notepads.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Days later, after power on, my Start Menu was all screwy, nothing was clickable. I couldn't launch "Settings" from a desktop shortcut or a search, along with nearly everything contained within "Settings" such as "Update &amp; Security" "Networking" etc. I also
 couldn't launch the Touch Keyboard or Speaker Volume .<br />
<br />
I researched corrupted Start Menu and the top solution was to create a new acct profile, but I already had one. I went to that profile (which I seldom use) and everything was fine, except for the same blank "Settings" taskbar icons. I also started the pc in
 Safe Mode, went back to the corrupted profile and it worked as it should. <br />
<br />
I wasn't ready to transfer all my stuff over to a new profile, so I tried some other solutions first. I did a "sfc scannow" command prompt, it completed and no issues were found. I did a virus scan with Malawarebytes, nothing was found. I ran the Troubleshooter
 for a couple of things, don't remember exactly what, Maintenace-something and Update-something, I believe neither one completed.<br />
<br />
I tried a System Restore, with a two-day-old restore point, the System Restore FAILED. I then uninstalled Malawarebytes as well as a couple of other non-essential 3rd party apps via Revo Uninstaller, which creates a new restore point and unfortunately in my
 case deleted my 2 other earlier restore pts.<br />
<br />
I then did a dskchk requiring restart, the dskchk got hung up at 12% for nearly 2 hrs, so I did a manual shutdown. Rollback was presented to me as an option, they say the old windows folder is deleted after 10 days, I was at 12 days, the folder was actually
 still there but the option didn't appear in update and security. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I was back and forth between both profiles, in and out of Safe Mode, and restarting a few times. While in Safe Mode, I saw "Rollback" on the menu, I tried it, it could not be rolled back. Still on the Safe Mode menu, I clicked System Restore just to recheck
 it. The computer hung again, so I had to do a manual shutdown again. <br />
<br />
After this happened when I powered on, BLANK SCREEN. The machine powers up, the fan kicks on, optical drive and HD spins, chirps, lights, the whole shebang. When I take the RAM out, it beeps and the power button flashes yellow.<br />
<br />
Upon further research, I removed the RAM and HD, reseated them. I removed the CMOS battery and did the Bios jumper trick. It didn't work initially, but after I let the pc sit for about 6 hours unplugged, with everything removed. I did the Bios jumper trick
 again, waited about 10 minutes, still BLANK, left it on and walked away, about 20-25 minutes later I check, the display is on and it has booted directly to the Desktop.
<br />
<br />
When this happened, my priority was to backup my files and the computer was working as smoothly as it should. Then I checked for a newer version of BIOS and Display, there were none available. I checked for other device updates -- all updated.
<br />
<br />
I did a couple of restarts, the display came back on each time, I did one proper shutdown and upon power on, the display again was there. I tooled around for another 4 to 5 hours and everything seemed good and right. I shut it down and went to bed.
<br />
<br />
When I powered on, BLANK SCREEN again. waited a few minutes, nothing... I manually shutdown and powered on again and walked away, 15-20 minutes later, I check and it again booted directly to the Desktop. I disabled App Readiness, I set the power plan to high
 performance, I set display, sleep, hibernate to Never. I restarted a couple times, the display came on as normal.<br />
<br />
Since it works just fine after I actually get a display, I got the bright idea to just hibernate it instead of shutdown, because I didn't want to leave it on FOREVER. This proved to be no different than shutdown. Hours later when I powered on again BLANK SCREEN.
<br />
<br />
I then learned about the 3 time power off technique. When I did this the first time, the screen stayed BLANK but I left it on, many minutes later I got THIS F1 Boot screen with a light on the keyboard, It booted to Desktop. Smooth running. More tooling around
 and research. Uninstalls and such. I trusted to do a restart because it worked before, this time restart resulted in a BLANK SCREEN.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ddb97af5-16e1-478b-ab74-a566471c4e95" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ddb97af5-16e1-478b-ab74-a566471c4e95" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I let it sit unplugged for hours again with all the above mentioned stuff removed. Did jumper trick a few times, then I did 3 time power off and I got the same F1 boot screen, but this time it popped up instantly. Messed around with project screen and remote
 desktop, I re-enabled&nbsp; App-Readiness for some reason and stupidly restarted, forgetting I accidentally ended Remote Desktop on the other computer. Tried to power on again. BLANK SCREEN.<br />
<br />
So on 4 different RANDOM occasions, I've been able to get a display.&nbsp; And from what I understand my ability to do these things suggests the Motherboard and HD is in good shape. So my question is, without a BIOS or Display update available what's my best course
 of action? ... Reset?.... Manual Rollback?.... Other???..... or Kaput?<br />

    <title>run program as administrator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> botfly  say:</h3>
<h2>            run program as administrator</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am using windows 8 and I am the only user on this PC so my user account is an administrator. My question is how I can by default run all programs as an administrator without right clicking and selecting "run as administrator".&nbsp; I found that some
 programs have problems because they don't have write access to certain files. I know I can set&nbsp;the shortcut properties to "run as admin" but it's quite tedious to do that for all programs that I have and will install in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>

            <p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>It is recommended that if you are the administrator, you need not run as administrator.</p>
<p>You can also try opening the programs with the compatibility mode if you are receiving compatibility issues.</p>
<p>I would like to inform you that there is no way that you can set a program to always 'Run as administrator'.
</p>
<p>What I would suggest instead is that if you are having problems with a program, you can create a new administrator account and try running it from there.</p>

Hello there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there are 2 things that strick me. One is that my account is already an administrator, so having the option to run a program "as an administrator" implies that my account is NOT an adminstrator account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using my Windows 8 machine to play MS Flight simulator X.&nbsp; I use many add-ons with the game and I realize that if I do not run them as administrator I would then get some some problem here and there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, having a default to run all programs as an administator is just a convienence for me so if that cannot be done then I am fine with it too. I am easily adjustable! haha</p>

            The start menu won't sync because you could easily have different programs installed on each computer so synching it would be pointless; and would create massive confusion for users,including shortcuts to non-existent software, under such circumstances.

</p><p>Thank you for being part of Microsoft Community. </p>

</p><p>In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, or if you're unable to open the Store, try running the
<strong><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Apps troubleshooter</span></a></strong>. This tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure the latest updates are installed on your PC and that your antivirus program isn't preventing the app from running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, some apps are blocked by Windows Firewall to help make your PC more secure. To work properly, you might need to allow an app to receive info through the firewall.</p>

<h2>            stupid auto-click software on windows xp</h2>
                    I install stupid auto-click software. I can not remove it, I don't know where it is and how is named. This software sent click signals to windows, without I to wish it. I want to disable this resident program what is not visible in task manager. If I press
 &amp; hold left mouse button, it randomly sent click signals and I can not use drag functionality. Help me.<br />
<br />
Also, I have slow internet, I can not accept remote repair. And enabling remote desktop functionality.<br />
<br />
I have windows xp sp3<br />
<br />
I already try restore points and reinstalling drivers.<br />
<br />
The program is not listed in "unistall control panel"<br />
<br />
It is not recognized like virus by my anti-virus software.<br />
<br />
Liked solution will be:<br />
You say me where I can find resident dlls or similar, who hook to mouse vectors and how to disable them from loading.<br />
<br />
It's something in the registry , I don't know. If some windows core dll is modified but missed by restore point, etc...<br />
<br />
I no like to preinstal the windows.<br />
I have original disk in me, if it's possible to manually extract selected files, it'll be great.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I just point the icon of hevy program and it was loaded near twenty times, I wasn't another way else to stop the process svchost.exe so my PC can be restarted after one minute.<br />
<br />
I want only the original microsoft drivers to be attached to the pointer on my monitor , it's like arrow. Nothing else, how to do that?<br />

<h2>            OEM Windows license is determined as not genuine</h2>
                    <p>I have Sony laptop wich came with OEM Windows Vista. I got uopgrade to Windows &amp; (also from Sony). During recent reinstallation of operating system, instead of installing Windows Vista and then upgrading it to Windows 7, I installed Windows 7 directly using
 an original Windows 7 image, and then used the product key that I have from upgrade DVD, to activate my Windowes. Although activation is successful, Windows Update does not work, and I started to receive messages that my &nbsp;computer is not running genuine windows.
 How to resolve this problem? Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>As for Windows Update:</strong></p>
<font>
<p>You can reset Windows Update components by running the Fixit on this page. But, if there's malware present, it will continue to reset the connection to the update servers:</p>
<p>How do I reset Windows Update components</p>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#0000ff">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</font></font></u></a></p>
<p>Suggest you download and save the Fixit. Then configure the system to Clean boot prior to running it:</p>
<p>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista/Windows 7</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#0000ff">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</font></font></u></a></p>
<p>Once the Fixit has been downloaded and the system booted to the Clean state, check to see that the native Windows firewall is now On if a 3rd party firewall was being used previously. Now run the Fixit and choose the Default mode. Restart once it's done
 and see if the system can connect to the update servers. If it can not, then run the Fixit again and choose the Aggressive mode. Restart when it's finished running and check for updates.</p>
<p>I suggest before shutting down and installing any updates, disconnect from the Internet first.</p>

<h2>            Problems running sfc.exe&#47;scannow on Windows xp</h2>
                    Running Windows XP Prof with SP3 on a Dell Latitude D505 <br />
Various problems made me think it would be a good idea to run sfc.exe/scannow...problem is it keep asking me for Windows professional service pack 3 disk...<br />
which I don't have <br />
I have the original XP disk&nbsp; from Dell (with SP1).and get automatic updates..so all that is up to date ..but it is still asking me for the disk.<br />
I have tried copying the disk onto the hard drive, downloading service pack 3&nbsp; to the hardrive&nbsp; and changing to registry for source files etc to look at c: drive, back to the d drive etc etc&nbsp; etc...I have tried making an integrated disk with and without nlite...I
 can't seem to get anything to work....<br />
Thinking about it a bit more - my hard drive failed last year and I had a new one fitted by a computer repair shop....I did give them the disk but maybe they used one of their own?<br />
(Struggling to remember - I can remember having to download service packs again ...but a couple of years ago they did a clean install for me -so I might be getting confused with then ...)<br />
Could that be causing my problems? If it is is there a way around it... really getting fed up with this now ....even thinking about doing a clean install again using my disk - (but planning on passing this laptop onto to my children in a couple of months -
 so would rather leave it till then)<br />

            Almost always, it is a BAD idea to run sfc /scannow. Even if you could jump through all the hoops with regard to service pack levels, i386 folders, and registry tweaks, running it will almost surely not help you one iota.
<div><br />
<div>Why don't we just work on identifying the actual problems so we can solve them. It's usually a lot easier than you might think!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then again, if the PC will be passed on to your kids in a couple of months, you might as well perform that clean install. I just made a few posts to this thread that you should find helpful:</div>

<div>The good news is you can upgrade DIRECTLY from SP1 to SP3.</div>

            <p>Sfc is actually a great utility,it repairs or replaces windows files/folders,a</p>
<p>installed service pack(s),has no bearing to Sfc,it doesnt run on those files.</p>
<p>As for youre problem,its simple,Sfc will not run with anything but an XP installation</p>
<p>cd,retail version..Dell/hp/etc installation cds are not what the OS needs.</p>

            If you try to run sfc /scannow on a system with SP3 installed and you don't have an SP3 installation CD, sfc /scannow is going to complain - alot.&nbsp; And it is sometimes hard to make it stop complaining and it is also annoying and frustrating.&nbsp; Like you
 say - really getting fed up with it... but that is because things are not matched up, but you can fix that.<br />
<br />
There are many WWW sites that have instructions on how to slipstream SP3 into an existing genuine bootable XP installation CD and I have tried many of them.<br />
<br />
Here is a link that will work the first time if you follow the directions exactly (you are going to be sure you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD and not some kind of system recovery CD from the manufacturer):<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/slipstreaming-windows-xp-to-create-bootable-cd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/slipstreaming-windows-xp-to-create-bootable-cd/</a><br />
<br />
I would first read/browse through the whole thing and just go through the motions mentally knowing that you can skip some parts of it...&nbsp; like adding SATA drivers, since that doesn't&nbsp; apply to your Dell Latitude D505.<br />
<br />
When sfc /scannow runs without complaining, it gives you a good feeling, but is extremely unlikely to solve any of your unspecified problems.<br />
<br />
I suggest you work on the problems first (since sfc /scannow is not going to fix them for you) and work on your slipstreaming project later.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you decide to just bite the bullet and reinstall XP from scratch, go ahead and make yourself a slipstreamed SP3 installation CD first, then run sfc /scannow to be sure the CD has been created correctly (sfc /scannow should not complain anymore) and
<br />
<br />
Then you will be able to rest easy knowing that you have one for the future if you ever need it.&nbsp; Take your old CDs and shelve them, use them for coasters, create an attractive
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_%28sculpture%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">sparkly mobile</a> for the kids room or put one in the microwave for a cool light show.<br />
<br />
If you want to see about resolving your problems first, do this (some things we already know a little about):<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
What is your Internet browser and version?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<br />
What do you not see that you think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />

            The reason I thought I would do sfc is try and make sure all the registry files are ok...if sfc isn't going to work - any other suggestions?<br />
<br />
Long story&nbsp; it needed a tweak - from Dell forums - a conflict between a dell driver and windows&nbsp; just an annoying 'end now' as you try and shut down...happened after both clean installs. Then sudddenly&nbsp; it&nbsp; started happening again - I think after a windows
 update ...couldn't remember the tweak&nbsp; and trying to remind myself how to sort it out&nbsp;&nbsp; ..was tempted into using one of the free registry cleaners (and I know I should know better -don't know why I did!) -
<br />
<br />
Recently things haven't been as smooth as they should be... not dramatic - no blue screens etc started having problems with recording using audacity (when it was fine a few months before), explorer.exe stops responding, had problems with firefox (doesn't start
 until I start another program!), acrobat reader kept running in the background until it used all the cpu.(sorted now) etc etc ...
<br />
<br />
I know I'm virus/spyware free ... recently I had to do a banks recommended full system scans etc - took hours - no problems (except now I have some annoying anti spyware thing&nbsp; that pops up at&nbsp; random points asking me if I want to do a scan now!)<br />
<br />
At the moment I'm working the computer hard .....especially explorer...and it is really starting to annoy me!
<br />
(trying to archive some data - also organising some data to allow back referencing&nbsp; I inherited in my job from someone who didn't use folders(!) and didn't really understand excel&nbsp; -so one big folder containing 4 years worth of information including things
 like 144 (3 sheet!) excel files (which could have been 12 excel files containing 12 sheets)&nbsp; then some more excel files, a few hundred randomly titled&nbsp; word files and a couple of dozen pdfs ...you get the picture... )&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
For a clean install I would rather have this data&nbsp; condensed - for back up reasons (it takes hours) and&nbsp; to prevent fragmentation (I have defragged but would be nice not to moving big chunks of data around on a clean install)...<br />

            Hope you realised that was a cross post! -&nbsp; main problem is that it just isn't running as well as it should/did in the past ....<br />
So XP prof SP3 - with automatic updates enabled (and been gets lots recently -hopefully so is everyone else!)<br />
Firefox version 8 <br />
Avast antivirus <br />
Comodo firewall<br />
Usually run Malwarebytes every week or so but currently have XoftspySE running....<br />
Some Trusteer Rapport thing (recommended by two banks I deal with)<br />
Yes it has an internal CD drive<br />
XP disc the the Dell version -it is labelled as the opertating system disk with SP1&nbsp; - (they also gave me another one - for drivers etc) so not sure if it is a recovery disc - don't have another version...<br />
<br />
As i said little niggles ...firefox not opening unless I open something else first , going incredibly slowly ...was having problems with acrobat reader running in the background all the time -until it used all the cpu unless you killed it in task manager,&nbsp;
 explorer.exe crashing.... audacity not recognising the microphone...just a bit sticky and slow going ....<br />
Plenty of space on the hard drive...not sure about the memory&nbsp; -but it was expanded to the max a few years ago ...<br />
<br />
So any advice gratefully received...<br />

<br />
<div>I thought you planned on giving this PC to your kids in a couple months. If so, the data won't need to be copied back to the PC; it's YOUR data, not theirs! Therefore, this old PC that is going to the kids will have a fresh install of XP with no fragmentation
 at all.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are still interested in improving performance for the time being, here's&nbsp;<span>my usual&nbsp;</span><span>cut-and-paste regarding the usual causes of sluggishness:</span></div>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
1. Malicious software (malware). You need to rule this out first! If you need guidance, let us know. Also, make sure you bookmark this page:</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.selectrealsecurity.com/malware-removal-guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.selectrealsecurity.com/malware-removal-guide</a></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
2. Not enough free space on the hard drive. At the very least, you should have at least 15% free space. A good goal to shoot for is 50%.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
3. Certain programs that are designed to combat malware (e.g., Norton and McAfee). Ironically, they can slow things down because they simply use way too many resources. Sometime they cause conflicts with other programs. Fortunately, there are other antimalware
 programs available that use far fewer resources (e.g., NOD32, Avast, and Avira).</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
4. Not enough RAM, which causes the PC to overly rely on the pagefile. A quick way to determine if this is happening is to open Task Manager (Ctrl+Alt+Del) and click the Performance tab. Then note the three values under Commit Charge (K): in the lower left-hand
 corner: Total, Limit, and Peak.</p>
<p>
The Total figure represents the amount of memory you are using at that very moment. The Peak figure represents the highest amount of memory you used since last bootup. If both these figures are below the value of Physical Memory (K) Total, then you probably
 have plenty of RAM. In case you want to explore this further, you may run Page File Monitor for Windows XP:</p>

<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
5. You might also want to check that your hard drive's access mode didn't change from DMA to PIO:</p>

            Sorry for slow reply - really nasty head cold and christmas chaos..still struggling to think straight now....<br />
First Joselbarra - I will look at the bleeping computer way of slipstreaming ...I tried one manually and one using nlite - and neither worked - I am also trying to get hold of a&nbsp; XP prof disc SP3 (through freegle)<br />
Daavee&nbsp; <br />
Sorry&nbsp; I think I might have been being dense -&nbsp; I'm trying to get a quick solution - &nbsp; so I can organise this data now - and the PC is giving me grief - making it really tricky...sure a clean install would sort it out - but then I would have to put the messy
1. I'm 99% sure that I don't have a malware problem -just over a&nbsp; week ago I did&nbsp; full system scans with antivirus (Avast, Mcafee and Kapersky) and full system malwarebytes,&nbsp; xoftspyse, and superantispyware...and I have a non-windows firewall...<br />
2. My hard drive is 60+% free space (new hard drive after failure a year or so ago - 4x the size of my old one).<br />
3. Got rid of Mcafee for that very reason - now use Avast - do need to get rid of XoftspySE - that is annoying me - but I had problems before I got that...<br />
4.and 5. I'm going to have to look at this when my head is clearer ...<br />
&nbsp;It seems like my physical memory is below my total/peak commit charge -but then I can't even count the number of digits in the numbers reliably at the moment ...<br />
<br />
Thank you everyone for your help...

    <title>Xbox one controller on PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ren mccourtey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one controller on PC</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. I just bought Xbox one controller to use with PC (Windows 10). I have a problem when controller doesn't work properly in _powered_ USB 3 hub. When plugged in, controller lights up and appears in Devices and printers/Device manager, but doesn't appear
 in joy.cpl or respond in games. It works properly in all ports on my mainboard, including the one hub usually occupy, so the problem is apparently the presence of the hub. But when I try various devices in the hub, they work without issues. What could be the
 reason? Where can I find some error messages? There's nothing in the event log. Also, another question. Can I somehow update controller's firmware in the controller from Windows?</p>

<p>Hi, thanks but that link is well know and speaks about driver, which is 1) something completely different 2) is being contained in Windows 10 out of the box 3) is working properly as seen by controller working in ports directly on board. Not related to my
 issue.</p>

<p>Hey, &nbsp;I had the same problem but instead of the hub it was the USB 2.0 port on my keyboard. &nbsp;I ended up using my motherboard USB as well</p>
<p>The problem is when available USB bus controllers ports have been used. &nbsp;If you have a powered USB 3.0 hub, they usually have their own controller chip. &nbsp;When using your motherboard USB, you are using the motherboard USB controller chip. &nbsp;Hope it makes sense.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Xbox Controller requires Memory/IRQ resource that is not available from your USB 3.0 hub.</p>
<p>If your motherboard has option for front panel USB socket then you can try 3.5"bay device for USB 3.0 &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Warjax.</p>
<p>Somehow I bet your issue with controller not working in keyboard's USB was power related, Xbox One controller have four motors in it and is therefore quite power hungry. That's why _powered_ hub is requirement, which is something what is not in keyboard's
 hub for sure. I don't have my PC close to TV so to use onboard USBs is very inconvenient, it means to run another cable beside the one going to the hub in question.</p>

            <blockquote>Install it and if prompted to "Restart" click on the 'Restart' button (Do not turn off the laptop). The restart will appear to shut down / turn off the laptop but do nothing, Windows should restart and complete the Windows Update
 process.</blockquote>
<p>The main downside of these monthly rollup updates is that they are actually applied in the early boot environment, absolutely non-interactively, — and that is the exact moment they fail without any explanation (status code 80004005 for “Unspecified error”
 is no explanation, to be honest). Then they revert their actions, automatically reboot and start all over again, failing once more, reverting and finally giving up, returning the update to the queue for the user to try again. But no matter how many times the
 user retries, the outcome is always the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to get out of this infinite loop is to hide the update. Previously, when updates were atomic, it was not a big deal, since failing updates were usually insignificant (like some muddy .Net language pack for a product one had not installed, i.
 e. considered as needed but not actually applicable). Now, as updates became cumulative, a single failing bit blocks all further updates, — I was unlucky to have such an update right from the beginning in October 2016 (KB3185330), and the situation did not
 improved since then (KB3192403 for November preview, KB3197868 for November, KB3207752 for December).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply put, the rollup update technology makes the entire system un-updateable (except for Office and .Net which still retain their autonomy), yet nobody has any idea how to debug such a situation — all recommendations basically come down to retrying and
 hoping for the best, which does not help at all.</p>

            <p>Hi, thank you for your help. &nbsp;I did what you suggested, it was installed perfect, but when I restart my pc and did the process of installing it I get this message "FAILURE CONFIGURING WINDOWS UPDATES REVERTING CHANGES DO OT TURN OFF YOUR COMPUTER".</p>
<p>this is the same message I get whenever I try to install this update.</p>

<p>No, that error message clearly indicates that the update did <strong>not</strong> apply correctly and was undone to the original state. That is the catch with those huge rollback updates.</p>

            <p>FWIW =&gt; After <em>much</em> hemming &amp; hawing and "svchost spikes"&nbsp;over the past week, AU finally installed December 2016 Security Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 7 SP1... KB3205397,
<em>not KB3207752</em>, about an hour ago (21 Dec-16, 05:28 UTC).</p>

            <p>I have Windows&nbsp;10 Pro on a Desktop which has a removable drive tray. Removed the Win10 drive and inserted a drive that has Windows 7 Pro 64Bit which has not been updated since May of this year. Installed the WU Speedup update and then manually ran Windows
 Update. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There were 24 stand alone updates and the December .NET rollup and the December 2016 Security Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 7 SP1 which is
<em><strong>KB3207752</strong>. </em>No update&nbsp;listed for KB3205397. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed all the updates except for both rollup updates, rebooted, reran Windows update but no change,&nbsp;the rollup is&nbsp;still listed as KB3207752 and installed as KB3207752.</p>
