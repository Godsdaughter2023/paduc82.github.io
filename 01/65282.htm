            Wordpad is a WYSISYG kinda program...&nbsp; It does not have default setting such as you would find in Word, Excel, etc...&nbsp; Now you can save a blank document with the font you like and put it in some default folder and just open that everytime but as for the
 blue background... well, it is the color of the sky!

    <title>DirectSound Error&#47;Application Sound Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derby_  say:</h3>
<h2>            DirectSound Error&#47;Application Sound Issue</h2>
                    <p>Recently, my sound has not been working when I open PC games on my laptop.</p>
<p>This has only started to happen, as of March 16th, 2016. I will admit that on the 15th I was messing with my sound settings while in a Skype call with my buddies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, my sound won't play while playing games on my laptop.</p>
<p>When opening one of my games, this error message is shown:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b43dc1c9-8de2-4000-80da-1d5add632dfb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b43dc1c9-8de2-4000-80da-1d5add632dfb" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note: Normal Windows sounds such as the start-up sound still play as normal.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried making things default in a way to reset it but to no prevail.</p>
<p>Restarting my laptop does not bring a solution to the problem.</p>
<p>I've even tried re-installing my Realtek sound driver, but that has not fixed the problem, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Writing this was my last resort, as I have already tried for the past few days to resolve the issue myself.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Please note that I am running Windows 10 64 Bit. I am using Realtek High Definition Audio as my main driver.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond as quickly as possible,</p>
<p>Derby_</p>

    <title>Computer will not boot right after Windows Updates... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronaldinho696  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer will not boot right after Windows Updates...</h2>
                    The last time I did an update was from about 3 months ago because everytime my computer did Windows Updates it wouldn't boot right. The computer would reset after all the updates were complete perfectly, and it booted with a box saying "Your computer was
 not able to start correctly" And a bar would come up trying to repair the problem and once it was finished I checked the details and it always did "System Restore" to fix it. The computer would boot up and work fine again, but I could never do Windows Updates
 unless it would System Restore to before that everytime...when I first bought this computer it would update fine, but since the time it never would update right, it never did. Sometimes it even keeps going in a cycle...please do not turn off computer, installing
 updates...computer would not boot go into repair mode at boot and when it would successfully boot it would do the updates thing again.... Another thing in the details of the repair after the re-boot of updates is that file sq??.krn something like that...was
 corrupted. Please help me fix this frustrating problem. I am running Windows Vista 32-Bit OS operating system on a eMachines W5233 PC. Thanks Microsoft.<br />

Hi ronaldinho696,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Windows Vista answers forum.</span></p>
<p><span>I will suggest you to turn off the Antivirus Software that is running on the computer and put the computer
 in a clean boot environment and then try to run the Windows Updates as the issue here seems to be with some third party software conflict.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To perform a clean boot on a computer that is running Windows Vista, follow these steps:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Continue. </span></p>
<p>
<span>2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></p>
<p>
<span>3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</span></p>
<p>
<span>4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</span></p>
<p>
<span>5. Click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span>6. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></p>
<p>
<span>7. After the computer starts, run Windows Updates and check.<br />

<h2>            BSoD - BcCode&#58; Deaddead</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last few weeks I've been experiencing issues and regularly encountering the Deaddead BSoD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typically, the events leading up to it are as follows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WiFi loses internet connection but remains connected to network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Troubleshooter then tries to fix it leading to BSoD.</p>
<p>After a few restarts and attempts at troubleshooting it establishes that the WiFi adapter is disabled and will either fix it or BSoD again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason I am struggling to figure out how to get the details it gives you after the unexpected shutdown, but all the minidumps created can be downloaded as a .rar file from onedrive here, including sysinfo:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have not recently installed any new software or hardware.</p>
<p>Running windows 7 64bit on a Toshiba Satellite p850-12z</p>
<p>
</p><p>Malwarebytes scan showed nothing, nor did Microsoft Security essentials.</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had this PC for about three weeks.&nbsp; I had been backing up to two separate external disks every other day, rotating the disks.&nbsp; Yesterday I decided to back-up early and this error code 0x80070015 is all I get.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;tried to back up to the other
 disk and it was the same.</p>
<p>&nbsp; One other thing that maybe a factor.&nbsp; Every time that&nbsp;I was able to back up before there was always an error that it was unable to find one file in my One drive video folder.&nbsp; I have been looking into this error code and I am reluctant to follow the advice
 that is clearly given for Windows 7 &amp; 8 but do not mention Windows 10.&nbsp; Perhaps someone could clear this up for me?&nbsp; Also, after reading that others with this kind of problem had update problems I ran the update trouble shooter and it came back with the second

<h2>            utility software</h2>
                    I would like to know if anyone out there has used a software utility program called [Pareto Logic Driver Cure and the other software that comes with it like Reg Cure etc.] and if it is a good program that is compatible with vista.&nbsp; I have the free scanner
 installed and it seems to catch quite a few drivers and software that is out of date and in need of updating. I just wanted to know if this software has proven useful on other pc's and if it is reccommended highly or what?I understand that&nbsp; Reg Cure is a good
 program, but just like to know about the Pareto Logic Driver Cure thing. Thanks for your time.

            I already told you what I think - programs like Advanced System Care and Norton System Works are cr*p. They are unnecessary, invasive, and more often than not will break your Windows install and negatively impact other important programs like Microsoft
 Office. Your "understanding" of the Registry is faulty. I have years of experience as a computer tech so have no desire to do any more "testing" about this subject to answer your question. I don't have any "lab guys" either although I have many tech friends
 and colleagues and we *all* feel this way. I don't have anything further to add to this.<br />
<br />
As for drivers, if you will re-read my previous answer more carefully, you will see that I did *not* say that drivers never need updating. I *did* say that if everything is working properly and you are not a gamer wanting to wring every last bit of graphic/frame-rate
 goodness out of your video card, you should leave the drivers alone. And your belief that "drivers are the key to keeping the pc working smoothly and if they become old they just don't work as well" is completely erroneous. Once again, and I don't know how
 much more clearly I can put this: if you are not a gamer and nothing is broken (not functioning correctly), you do not need to update your drivers. If you want to tinker, then get the drivers yourself instead of relying on some third-party program.<br />
<br />
Never get drivers from Windows Update. Get them from:<br />
<br />
1. The device mftr.'s website; OR<br />
2. The motherboard mftr.'s website if hardware is onboard; OR<br />
3. The OEM's website for your specific machine if you have an OEM computer (HP, Dell, Sony, etc.).<br />
<br />
Read the installation instructions on the website where you get the drivers.<br />
<br />
To find out what hardware is in your computer:<br />
<br />
1. Read any documentation you got when you bought the computer.<br />
2. If the computer is OEM, go to the OEM's website for your specific model machine and look at the specs (you'll be there to get the drivers anyway)<br />
3. Download, install and run a free system inventory program like Belarc Advisor or System Information for Windows.<br />
<br />
http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html - Belarc Advisor<br />
http://www.gtopala.com/ - System Information for Windows<br />
<br />
I really have nothing further to add to this thread. If you want to use optimizers, update your drivers, and generally tinker around with your computer that's your business. Have good backups. Consider doing regularly imaging and store the images on an external
 hard drive because one of these days you most certainly will need to restore to a working Windows system.<br />

            There is never any need to use a "driver cure" type of program and I strongly recommend that you stay clear of RegCure and any other "registry cleaner". With drivers, the First Law of Driver Updates is "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". Normally if everything
 is working you want to leave things as they are. The exception is that heavy-duty gamers will usually want to update their video and sound drivers to squeeze every last bit of performance out of the hardware to get the fastest frame rates. If you're not one
 of those people, you don't need to update your drivers if there are no problems you are trying to solve.<br />
<br />

<p>To solve NAT issues, the traditional method is Port Forwarding or Triggering.</p>
<p>Why not just put the Xbox IP address in a DMZ? Since consoles are hacked even if not in a DMZ, why not use that?</p>

<h2>            Program not launching. Error Reports say .NET Runtime 1026 error. It may also be a KernelBase.dll error&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just bought FIFA 18 on Origin. After installing the game does not launch and does not provide me with any error. I contacted EA Support and performed these steps.</p>
<p>Run application as administrator<br />
Clean Reboot<br />
Reinstall game<br />
Reinstalled Origin<br />
Reinstall graphics drivers<br />
Windows Update<br />
<br />
Disabled all startup programs<br />
Disabled Firewalls and white listed the game on Windows Defender.<br />
Ran system file checker.(sfc/scannow)</p>
<p>
</p><p>These steps were guided by EA's customer support.</p>
<p>I received an email later saying it is a KernelBase.dll error after submitting a 'msinfo' document to EA.</p>
<p>They told me to contact Windows Support as it was a 'major system file'</p>
<p>
</p><p>After approaching Windows Support, I performed these steps.</p>
<p>Windows In Place Upgrade<br />
Advanced chkdsk repair<br />
</p>
<p>Still the problem persists. I have no clue what to do next.</p>
<p>While EA said it was a KernelBase.dll error. Error Reporting on my PC says it is a .NET Runtime 1026 error.&nbsp;</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703. This looks like a compatibility issue with version 1709 which you have installed.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:

<p>The game is up to date.</p>
<p>I tried the .NET repair tool. It didn't help, unfortunately.</p>
<p>For updating Framework I downloaded 'Runtime' and recieved a 'could not update because a version higher than this is already installed'. There was a 'Developer Pack' option too. Should I try that or is this enough?</p>

I got it working after a lot of hassle. You need to reset your PC THROUGH WINDOWS DEFENDER. It basically reinstalls windows and applies windows updates automatically. This is what worked for me.

<p>It is a relatively new feature on windows defender. Heres how you can do it. Open windows defender security center. Then go to "device performance and health". Click on "Fresh Start". What this does is it resets your pc with all your personal files intact
 and applies all the latest updates automatically so you dont have to after it resets. All your installed apps will have to be reinstalled. So I recommend you to back up your files just in case. It will also remove your office subscription so make sure you
 have registered your office subscription online and are able to download office from office.com . You will need an internet connection for this process. All the best!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Converting BIOS to UEFI</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp; I have the current version of Windows 10 and a motherboard that supports UEFI, but is currently using BIOS.&nbsp; I want to convert from BIOS to UEFI.&nbsp; I understand that there are two main processes involved.&nbsp; Changing the HDD from MBR to GPT and changing
 the motherboard settings from BIOS to UEFI.&nbsp; I was going to use the recently available Microsoft tool MBR2GPT.EXE, however a Microsoft article states the tool cannot be used if a disk has more than three partitions.&nbsp; Mine for some reason has two system reserved
 partitions.&nbsp; One is shown as F: System Reserved , capacity is 100MB, used space is 31.89MB and the status is "none".&nbsp; The other one is shown as *: System Reserved, capacity is 100MB, used space is 30.83MB and the status is "system".&nbsp; I have a System partition
 (C:) and a Data partition (D:).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know how I can convert BIOS to UEFI without losing my data or having to re-install Windows 10.&nbsp; All advice will be appreciated.</p>

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You must wipe the drive to reinstall to change the drive formatting.  
<br />
<br />Just deleting all parititons during install is normally enough.  The installer will change the formatting to GPT and invoke the WIndows Boot manager as first device to boot where it must remain.  
<br />
<br />The modern UEFI firmware should work at defaults, so I'd use this opportunity to update the firmware if newer is available from the PC or motherboard's Support Downloads webpage.  Then set the firmware to Defaults, Save and Exit.  Now go back in and spot check that its set to UEFI, Windows Boot Manager set first to boot, Secure Boot and Fast Boot enabled, SATA controller set to AHCI.  
<br />
<br />Then follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Greg, thanks for replying so quickly.&nbsp; Having to do a clean install is what I wanted to avoid, mainly because it is going to involve a lot of time and in the re-installation of many of applications I have installed.&nbsp; I don't think I am ready to do all
 that at this time.

            I understand, but then you cannot change to UEFI until ready to do so.  There is no stable method to change from Legacy to UEFI BIOS without reinstalling while changing the settings.  
<br />
<br />I would bookmark the Clean Install link for when you are ready.   There is nothing that compares to the performance of a Clean install, especially the one in the link.

            I thought the utility&nbsp;<span>MBR2GPT.EXE provided the stable method without damaging/destroying anything, but it seems it doesn't work on disks with more than three partitions.&nbsp; I will have to wait until I have the time

            Greg, I just thought of something else.&nbsp; Apart from the two System Reserved partitions, I also have a System partition (C:) and a Data partition (D:).&nbsp; If I merged D: with C: I would get back to the maximum three primary partitions and no logical partition.&nbsp;
 Once done, the MBR2GPT.EXE utility should work.&nbsp; Will this work and will the data be unaffected?

            Data should always be backed up because the hard drive can fail at any time.<br /><br />You can merge those two partitions and only have three, but I'm not going to vouch for any tool to convert to UEFI without a full clean install while deleting partitions.

                    <p>I executed a factory reset for my Windows 10 tablet (no external keyboard or mouse) during the process I keep getting this error message "Install Windows The commuter restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error. Windows installation cannot

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience
<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.

<br />
<br />The mimidump file indicates bwcW10x64.sys as the cause of your system crashes . . .
<br />
<br />That is the device driver for your Killer Network Card. you should go to the support page for your PC on the manufacturers website, then from there, download and install the Killer Network card device driver they recommend .. .

            <span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time

<span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; This should get you back to normal again.<br />
<br />
If the system restore doesn't work (or even if it does) then note the update and its KB number and repost your question in the Windows Update Forum at:
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistawu/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistawu/threads</a>&nbsp;where people who specialize in Windows update issues will be more than happy to assist you with you problem and get
 that update installed without the error.&nbsp; Be sure to explain what happened with System Restore in your post there.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>

<h3> snake hollywood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Once again family safety is not working</h2>
                    <p>This time the apps I have blocked are no longer being blocked, and my daughter is able to launch them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have lost count of how many times Microsoft family safety has randomly stopped working.</p>
<p>Either it stops blocking apps or the screentime settings stop working, either blocking all access or allowing access without restriction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 4 kids, all with their own computers, and I have been battling with family safety on every single one of them for the last 10 years. Always something is breaking, it is so unreliable it is a joke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sick of having to delete my child from my family and remove their account from the PC and them re-create everything because it has supposedly been corrupted for the millionth time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With one of my kids, I spent 3 years (yes really) battling with Microsoft support because every time I went through this process, which they had told me to do, his account would not work as soon as it was added to my family, and I could not even log into
 it as I would get an error on the Microsoft site. I must have created 10 different accounts for him, each time having the same issue. And despite re-producing it via screenshare on multiple computers, multiple browsers, and getting a Microsoft engineer to
 re-produce it as his end. They still insisted the issue must be at my end.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How long is it going to take until Microsoft make family safety do what it says on the tin and actually protect your family?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do also have other solutions in place (I have no choice) such as commodo dome for DNS security, BitDefender parental controls (which are also pretty unreliable), and also my router security, but I shouldn't have to do this.</p>

<h3> alfa1956  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 in an iMac Mid 2010 &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an iMac (Mid 2010) running Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>
<p>Everything works fine.</p>
<p>Apple's Boot Camp warns me that my iMac can only upgrade as far as Windows 7, because of the Apple drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I got several alerts from Microsoft stating that I can upgrade for Windows 7, based on the compatibility report.</p>
<p>As I found nowhere any information to my specific case, can anyone please help me and tell me what can I do to upgrade to Windows 10 in my iMac (Mid 2010), with Intel 13, with 3.06 GHz and 12 GB memory.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

Recent versions of Windows include File History, which was introduced in Windows 8.0 in 2012 but based on my personal experience, it is not as thorough as Windows Easy Transfer which is no longer available or supported.

            <p>Thank you André da Costa, but it seems you overlooked the main problem:</p>
<p>- it's about an<strong> iMac</strong> (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Mid 2010</span> - and this is important, because it can only get up to BootCamp 4.0).<br />
<br />
Any solution that tells me "<em>just backup and try it....; if it goes wrong, roll-back..</em>" is not what I'm looking for.</p>
<p>Thanks anyway.</p>

            <p>I'm having the same issue, on a hardware level everything looks great but since Apple aren't providing the drivers for Mid 2010 iMacs I think we're left high and dry. My iMac is even Intel i5 3.6 quad which is the same as my girlfriends PC which has upgraded.</p>
<p>Like yourself Win 7 (Home Premium x64 in my case) confirms I can upgrade but won't initiate the install while other PCs in my house have completed this. Even if It did install I doubt things like the Eject key would work as expected.</p>

            <p>I have installed Windows 10 on my mid 2010 i5 2.8GHZ 27inch iMac.&nbsp; It upgraded fine from Win 7 and after downloaded BootCamp 5 from within Windows, all of the keyboard buttons etc work as they did on Win 7.&nbsp; HOWEVER - whenever the display goes to sleep,
 it won't come back on again! I have to hold down the power button and restart.&nbsp; It appears the computer is still on as I hear the chime from Windows when I press the keyboard; it just doesn't wake up the monitor.&nbsp; I am hoping this is a Windows driver issue
 and not to do with the fact that my Mac is technically not supported.&nbsp; Hope this helps, and I really hope to fix this issue soon!</p>

<p>
</p><p>For the sleep problem, I think its related to the graphic drivers. I had the same problem but I updated it using Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I must add that I could find updates for my graphic card on Windows Updates, because I went ahead and removed only the installed graphic drivers that came with bootcamp, after I installed bootcamp software on my windows install. After this, You´ll
 find updates on Windows Update that works.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same iMac 21.5" mid 2010 with Win 7 on bootcamp. After I upgraded to Win 10, I ran into the "bad pool header" issue. I did quite many steps to attempt to resolve it, ie:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- uninstall some of the memory residence apps, eg ant-virus, Torrent. I tried to keep the system as clean as possible in order to isolate the problem</p>
<p>- search the latest drivers from internet, eg I found a Wifi driver that is later than the Bootcamp 4 version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- run the bootcamp 4 app in Win 7 compatible mode</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I restarted the iMac for a couple of times without the bad pool header error. I am still unsure whether I finally fix the problem so I am keeping my fingers cross.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>KWC</p>

<p>Please help me to understand a bit more:</p>
<ul>
<li>You upgraded directly from the Windows 10 normal upgrade?
<ul>
<li>Got the "bad pool header" issue (that I have no idea what it is)</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<p>Searched the latest drivers... and found a Wifi driver more recent than Bootcamp 4.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Can you please tell me the name of the driver and where did you find it?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">And a Wifi driver is that important for an iMac? I have my iMac with an ethernet cable.</p>
</li><li>How do you run the bootcamp 4 app? &nbsp;The app is simply there; I just choose one OS or the other.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please excuse my lack of knowledge on all this and if you could help me to understand it, I would be very much grateful.</p>

            <p>I have the Same 21" iMac mid 2010.</p>
<p>I tried to install win10 directly without bootcamp and without a 2nd Partition Using just the DriveSaver on the win10 iso Image. It took me 3 attempts until win10 was installed at all and the home screen of win10 was showing.</p>
<p>i used a usb mouse instead of the Apple bluetooth mouse for Installation.</p>
<p>unfortunately i am not able to boot win10 properly from the ssd. It turns to Black screen shortly before finishing the boot Process. Only the iso dvd brings me further, But doesnt resolve the problem.</p>
<p>probably a graphics driver problem .... Have to work on this ....</p>

            Hi!<br /><br />The following are some tricks from another users:<br /><br />Surprisingly, when I entered the 4 digit pin that I've always used, I got the code error. <br />But after a day of trying to figure out how to fix it, instead of entering my pin, I used the password option and was able to use my computer with 0 problems. <br />BUT, I noticed after I log in, I get a RunDLL message:<br />There was a problem starting C:\Windows\System32\LoginLDA.dll<br />The specified module could not be found.<br />____<br />I have no idea why only the password works now. Ever since I've had my laptop, I never once used my Microsoft/Outlook/Hotmail password to login. <br />To be honest, I couldn't even remember it; I hardly use my Hotmail account.<br />After many tries, the password came to me, and thankfully i was able to use my PC. <br />I'm going to change the pin to see if I get the same error with a new pin. <br /><br />Try the Steps:<br /><br />To repair your PIN &amp; picture password:<br />Open File
