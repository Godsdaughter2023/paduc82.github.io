            Two web cams can "co-exist" in Windows 7.&nbsp; However, sometimes the "built-in" web cam can cause problems with another cam.&nbsp; You may have to turn it off in the BIOS.<br />

            <p>Very simply. But first you should make sure the other webcam has windows 7 drivers, or else you won't be able to use it at all.</p>
<p>Once it's installed and working, you should be able to go into start &gt; devices and printers, and the 2 webcams should be there. Now I'm not sure about this part, but if you right click the new one, there might be the option to set this webcam as the default.</p>

<h2>            Epsilon Car Mission</h2>
                    
<p>I currently need just one more car for this part and the game seems to have glitched. I purchased the Surano instead of looking for it outright and now the Epsilon icon won't show on the map, is there a way to fix this without starting the game over? I even
 made sure to pick up the Super Diamond the normal way and had no issues delivering it whatsoever and that car was second to last on my list.</p>

<p>are you driving it? is it damaged? they wont take it if it's damaged. other than that, maybe just save a few times or something...i've had some issues with some of the epsilon missions not showing up for a couple in game days. just save and re-load while
 in the surano and it might work, since it'll fix whatever damage the car has and it could kick start the icon...</p>

<p>The update yesterday fixed the issue where you don't receive the mission start email or cutscene start map icon if you finished this mission then reloaded from a save after, but it may not have fixed the problem you're having. Even today I did one of the
 later Epsilon missions and I had to restart it several times and do different things to get the proper events to trigger, it seems like this series of missions was one of the last things they finished up and they didn't do a very good job of it.</p>

            if "port settings" does not appear in device manager.&nbsp; maybe there are no any serial port device&nbsp; on your tablet pc. please check it.<br />
if not , you can fine a "usb to serial port" adapter instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
To change port settings
<ol>
<li>Open Device Manager.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Double-click <strong>Ports (COM &amp; LPT)</strong>.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Right-click the port for which you want to change settings, and then click <strong>
Properties</strong>.<br />
<br />
</li><li>On the <strong>Port Settings</strong> tab, make the appropriate changes.</li></ol>

    <title>Why does Windows 10 File History fail to copy some files&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billjunk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Windows 10 File History fail to copy some files&#63;</h2>
                    <p><span><span>Recently I upgraded my Windows 7 system to Windows 10 which resulted in the backup software I was using from Seagate no longer working.&nbsp; Seagate told me to use the Windows 10
 File History feature which I did.&nbsp; I needed to have a backup that produced an exact copy of the backed up files on a separate, dedicated drive and do it in a way that did not compress, encrypt, or in any way alter the files or directory structures.&nbsp; I needed
 to be able to easily access the back up files with the same application used to create them or take the drive to another computer and access the information there.&nbsp; Most of what I'm backing up are photographs and it is important that I be able to look at these
 files with various Photoshop products.&nbsp; My photo library is approaching 60K images and slightly under 1 TB of data. Doing full backup takes almost a day.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>A few weeks after moving to Windows 10 I upgrade my Photoshop Elements (PSE) to Version 12 which came with a slide scanner that I'd purchased. That upgrade went smoothly.&nbsp; I
 use PSE's Organizer to maintain a catalog of my images and meta data associated with the individual files.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In the last few days I've been doing some structural reorganization of my photo files, using PSE's Organizer to create new folders and move existing files into those folders.&nbsp;
 What I discovered was that Windows File History did not discover that there were new directories and relocated files.&nbsp; I've run a couple of experiments and based on the results I have made some assumptions&nbsp;regarding how PSE Organizers and Windows File History
 work.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The PSE Organizer likely uses system routines to do the&nbsp;movement of files, but based on system performance I would guess that it is a logical movement of the file that alters links / pointers in the file system rather than actually reading and rewriting
 the file and then deleting the original copy.&nbsp; After the file is "move" to a new folder / directory the "Archive" attribute is set, but no other attributes, especially date attributes, appear to be changed.&nbsp; I also experimented with File Explorer and noticed
 identical results which I would attribute to PSE Organizer and File Explorer using the same system routines.</p>
<p><span><span>Here's where a problem arises.&nbsp; Windows File History appears to look at one or more
 file attributes in order to decide if a file needs to be copied to the File History location,&nbsp;however it is not using the "Archive" attribute.&nbsp;From what I've read in several places, most backup programs use some&nbsp;algorithm based on date information and possibly
 other file attributes to decide if a file needs to be backed up.&nbsp;The "Archive" attribute seems to be a legacy structure brought from the creation of NTFS and Windows NT and no longer is really used, but has not been removed.&nbsp; For Windows File History it seems
 the decision to back up a file depends on at least one of the dates associated with the file, most like the Date Modified or something similar.&nbsp; That date would need to be later than the date the last backup was run.&nbsp; Since no date attributes are changed,
 the files that I've moved using PSE Organizer are not detected by Windows File History and consequently are not copied to the History archive.&nbsp; The only thing that seems to trigger File History to copy a file is to actually make a modification to the file
 contents and resave it.&nbsp;This is a very tedious and time consuming task and really makes using File History unworkable.&nbsp; This appears to me to be an error or logical oversight in the design of the algorithm in File History that decides when a file needs to
 be copied.</span></span></p>

            I believe that if you examine the way PSE Organiser works, and from the descriptions I've read of its Album Creation method of organising files, you will find it's an indexing system which doesn't actually alter the files it indexes (unless you start using
 tags) or change there locations in the Windows File System, so Windows File History is therefore correctly determining that the files haven't been altered in any way so it doesn't need to create a new backup copy. &nbsp;To verify, one way or the other, check with
 Windows File Explorer whether the folder structure has changed to match PSE Organiser's view of the files or if the Windows Folder and File structure remains unaltered.

            <p>I do use tags, but in general will apply them before I move the files to their final resting place.&nbsp; My normal workflow is to import images from my cameras into a special folder, XferIn, that has subfolder based on the capture dates of the images.&nbsp; I do
 my initial image correction / manipulation in these folders, add tags, and captions.&nbsp; Then when they are finished I move them into the main section of my archive that has significant based on geographic location, certain groups of people, or special classes
 of images, e.g. interesting weather.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also made it a habit to use the "write metadata to files" operation available in PSE Organizer.&nbsp; When I move a file or create a new directory using PSE Organizer that file or directory actually shows up in the Windows file system, at least from what
 I can determine by looking with the Windows File Explorer.&nbsp; You're correct that the file is not altered except for appearing in a new location in the file system.&nbsp; However, think about how that creates substantial confusion if one decides they would like to
 access the previous version of the file, or wants to be sure that a backup copy of the file is resident in the History archive.&nbsp; One has to know where the file was previously located in the file system.&nbsp; That creates a lot of "erroneous" files in the History,
 at least they are erroneous because they reside in some directory other than the one where the "real" most recent file resides.&nbsp; I don't think it's a good solution / implementation.&nbsp; If a file is moved to a new location, then all the copies in the history
 should be moved to a similar new directory in the history archive.&nbsp; That might be a challenge to implement, but that would make for greater integrity of the history archive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From this discussion I can see one possible work around for getting the files to show up in the archive in the correct folder.&nbsp; That would be to use the "Write metadata to file" operation after the files are moved.&nbsp; However, that would not remove the old
 copy of the file still residing in the original direcory.&nbsp; It would take another step to go there and delete the individual files that had been moved.</p>

            I failed to respond to your comment about Albums.&nbsp; While I do use albums to cross link various collections of images, this is not something that I expect File History to be able to track.&nbsp; My original problem is not involved with albums, but rather that
 File History does not find files that have been moved from one directory to another by Photoshop Elements 12&nbsp;Organizer because the meta data associated with the files is not changed, at least the meta data that appears to be used by File History.&nbsp; The "moved"
 files probably still reside at the same physical location on the disk drive with only file pointers or handles adjusted to place the file in a different directory.

            <p>Bill, I'm no expert in this field, but my experience of PSE (a few versions ago) led me to the conclusion that it's best to manage stored files either using the Organizer or using Windows, but not both except at a very basic level.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One point about File History not recording the fact that a moved file was removed from the folder it was in originally: that's one of the principal reasons for File History. Windows can't tell whether a file was deleted deliberately or accidentally, so FH
 keeps the original intact just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of those who routinely answer questions about PSE in the <a href="https://forums.adobe.com/community/photoshop_elements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Adobe forums</a> are very knowledgeable about how things work and are keen to help. There are sadly not so many Windows users among them, but even so, you'll probably get more qualified help there.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; Let me first make a clarification.&nbsp; I only use features within the PSE Organizer to affect the location and meta data about my photographic files.&nbsp; I never use Window's File Manager to move or otherwise alter these files because that
 would create a discontinuity in the Organizer's Catalog file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done a bit of looking around for information about the File History feature and how it's implemented.&nbsp; One thing that I did discover is that it uses the NTFS Change Journal to discover what files need to be copied to the File Change archive.&nbsp; The Change
 Journal provides a more efficient way to find out what files have been changed.&nbsp; The alternative would be a complete search of the directory structure on the volume, looking for any evidence that files had been modified in any way.&nbsp; That would be time consuming
 and inefficient.&nbsp; The only catch is that File History must know how to evaluate the information in the Change Journal and be smart enough to identify every combination of information that indicates a change that needs to be recorded in the archive.&nbsp; According
 to one source there should be two records written to the Change Journal when a file is moved, one documenting the location where the file was previously located, and one documenting where it is currently located.&nbsp; I would hope that these records would be enough
 for File History to conclude that the file in the new location needs to be copied to the archive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've asked my question on the Adobe Community Forum and about the only information that came back was the belief that the PSE Organizer uses system routines to do the file move operation, in essentially the same way as if the move had been done with the
 File Manager.&nbsp; If that's true, then I must point my finger at the File History feature as the source of this problem.</p>

    <title>Touchpad click delay causing erratic click and drag. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrneuby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touchpad click delay causing erratic click and drag.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Problem, executive brief:</strong></p>
<p>Please help, clicking and dragging with the touchpad is erratic. Suspected interference from click delay for multi-touch gesture.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Elaboration of conditions of the problem and suspicion:</strong></p>
<p>When using the built-in touchpad and depressing to click either on the right or left side, it seems I need to wait some unspecified time before moving with a second finger (or even touching the pad with a second finger) to drag, otherwise the computer recognizes
 it as a multi-finger gesture and then it cancels the click. Often if the click does register I have already dragged the mouse several centimeters. This is significantly irritating and has caused many mis-click and drag events. I have even gone as far as to
 turn off all multi-finger gestures and this delay persists. Before forcing a delay on the user, can the developers please make sure no multi-finger click gestures (like 2,3,4 finger click) are in use, or in a more customizable form they could give a way to
 set the delay time between 0 and user preference. If the only multi-finger gestures are drag style (eg scrolling) then there should be no need for a delay to check if it was a multi-finger click since they are not in use. If the user clicks in this situation
 the click would be intentional and not possibly a multi-finger gestures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Useful information:</strong></p>
<p>1. The laptop is a VJZ131 from Viao</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It has four mouse interfaces; touchpad, bluetooth mouse, touchscreen, MS surface pen 4. Three of the four of these work perfectly with no click and drag delay issues. Granted the surface pen and other ink devices have trouble selecting the window handles/edges
 to change window sizes but that is a whole other post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Attempted fixes and results:</strong></p>
<p>1. I uninstalled the other mouse interfaces, leaving only the touchpad. No effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I disabled tablet mode. No effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I uninstalled the driver and reinstalled it. No effect</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. To eliminate possible hardware issues. I have installed and tested the built-in touchpad in Ubuntu, and Remix-OS both of which correctly used click and drag, and multi-finger scrolling with the touchpad. Proof the clicking on the touchpad works properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. The manufacture recommended drivers are the Microsoft mouse driver. These do not solve the issue. These are my suspected root of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. I have installed the extend driver package from ELAN available for the international version of the laptop. This also had no effect on the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. I have scoured the registry for touchpad gesture settings. None found which were named anything remotely close to what I was looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Logic train:</strong> Six cases presented below, and expected results for more intuitive mouse control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. if multi-click gesture ≠enabled, when one finger clicks the touchpad and then a second finger touches even within the delay period the click and drag event should be initiated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. if multi-click gesture ≠enabled, when one finger touches the touchpad and then a second finger clicks the click and drag event should be initiated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. if multi-click gesture ≠enabled, when one finger touches the touchpad and then a second finger touches even within the delay period the multi-finger drag event should be initiated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. if multi-click gesture = enabled, when two fingers are present at the initiation of the click on the touchpad the multi-finger click should be initiated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. if multi-click gesture = enabled, when one finger touches the touchpad and a second finger clicks within the delay period it should initiate a multi-finger click event.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. if multi-click gesture = enabled, when one finger touches the touchpad and a second finger clicks after the delay period then a click and drag event should be initiated. (I suspect this is the only case being run right now.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>My plea:</strong></p>
<p>Please give me some hope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If this is some issue tell not related to my suspicions about a delay tell me how to fix it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If it is delay related and an option to kill the delay already exists in windows 10 already please tell me where to find it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. If not tell me pretty lies that it will be built-in to the generic MS touchpad drivers or somewhere else for the next developer preview build.
</p>

<h2>            Is there are structured way to find out if I can get my SST-EC01-P card running under windows 10 on my system&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 10 home running on an X48 platinum board from MSI. Since I bought a new case with USB3 connectors I bought a silverstone SST-EC01-P</p>
<p>PCIe Card. The card has an NEC uPD720202 USB 3.0 controller. When I go to device manager I see an exclimation mark in a triangle before "Renesas Electronic USB 3.0 controller". Currently it says Code 10, the apparatus doesn't start. The microsoft driver
 isn't doesn't solve it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I need some help to get this card working. I have several questions and need some guidance to find out if this card actually can work or not on my pc.</p>
<p>1) Do I need to update the card's firmware or not, on the silverstone website is an update for windows 8, but nothing for Windows 10.</p>
<p>2) How to update the firmware if necessary, does the card need to start before doing that or not. Norton tells me that there is a reputation risk on that firmware update ( downloaded from silverstone website), so I need to shut down Norton first? How do
 you tackle this in a step by step way?</p>
<p>Strange thing is that after I have givin up on it, it suddendly worked only once. The next time i rebooted my PC it didn't work any more</p>
<p>Thx in advance,</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Eddy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We acknowledge that you would like to install a new hardware on your computer. Windows 10 can provide generic drivers for devices but for them to be recognized or be installed properly, the specific driver would be downloaded from the manufacturer's website
 if they have one. If it's not yet available from there, we would advise to contact them to get the specific driver and make sure that it is fully compatible with your computer and with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>Xbox fifa 18 save game corrupted, cannot load different save. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zebidy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox fifa 18 save game corrupted, cannot load different save.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, unfortunately while playing fifa 18 the game glitched during an autosave after a match. This seems to have corrupted that autosave point and I cannot seems to reload the game. I have 4 other save points I could restore play from as I save multiple times
 per game week. However I cannot even get to those files as the game tries to autoload from the corrupt save point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I could access the different save points via the manage games and apps, stored data, etc, etc. However, I am faced simply with the option of deleting the entire save database in one chunk and lose everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can sign out of my profie and then load up fifa 18, but then when I load profile it just freezes up again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't want to lose the career mode I have been playing as I have invested a lot of time into it. Fifa 18 is the main game I play on Xbox too, I tend to play other games on Xbox when fifa 18 gets a little annoying. I have an xbox gold and live membeship,
 which without fifa 18, I now feel like I have very little use for. Might be time to cancel, sell the box, and move on to one the competitors.&nbsp;</p>

<div style="margin-left: 0">
More Information
<div>
<p>This problem rarely happens. When you try to play a saved game file that’s corrupted, you may get an error message depending on how the game saves corrupted files. Some games just filter out corrupted content, but other games display an error message.</p>

<p>Hi thanks for the reply. I have fixed it, but not using either of the options supplied via the post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason I cannot see individual save files, as your post states I should. I think some stages are missing from that solution, or it is based on out of date information. I can only clear the games storage space, which strangley does not delete the
 save files. It did not work, fifa 18 still froze while loading.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't bother with solution 2, never got an error message, just the game would never load after the main screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, an intreped gamer figured out that you have to uninstall the game, go into setting/system/console info, and choose to reset the console but keep the games and apps data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From here, you have to let the xbox restart, set up some of the stuff again, and sign in with your profile, and let everything update again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Weirdly, even though I deleted fifa 18 before the reset, it was installed when the xbox had restarted. Fifa 18 then downloaded the 6gig of updates, and loaded up fine. However, the corrupt save file was now gone. :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I lost was 4 in game days and a game against Newcastle United.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. A whole lot of other stuff downloaded for other games that hadn't prior the reset. This would indicate that it may have been an software issue with the xbox itself. But the reset has fixed everything. I would recommend that option as opposed to the microsoft
 option.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I purchased a new server and also Windows Server 2012 R2 essentials with 25 CAL's but when it arrived and I installed it, I was told I needed Standard edition, not essentials.</p>
<p>i contacted the company I bought it from and they said they won't accept it back because I opened it. I'm stuck with it apparently. I threatened to get a refund through my credit card provider and then they said I can contact Microsoft for an upgrade since
 I never activated the server. I didn't even get to the activation point when I found out I needed the other version.</p>
<p>i don't want to pay $300 to submit a tech support request so I thought someone on here could make a suggestion for me. All I need is Windows Server 2012 R2 standard edition license key. I've already downloaded it. Or should I try to sell the license and
 then buy the one I need? &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Credential Manager allows you to store credentials, such as user names and passwords that you use to log on to websites or other computers on a network. By storing your credentials, Windows can
 automatically log you on to websites or other computers. You can delete these settings; however you may contact your Internet Service provider before deleting it.</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer the following links for more information:</span></p>

<p>Hello There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. If you have the one that isn't the Xbox one version, you have the better together version. Which is the latest one that is out. The Xbox one version most likely wont download due to this one is installed. You can try deleting
 the one you have installed then downloading the Xbox one version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

<p>Good day</p>
<p>
</p><p>The digital copy of the game is the Better Together update meaning it is the Bedrock Edition which is crossplay enabled for Windows 10, Mobile, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The digital version of Xbox One Edition is no longer available as it was replaced with the Bedrock version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Xbox One Edition of the game should still be in physical copy in some retailers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>When you right click on Excel icon or File Explorer icon on the taskbar, it shows frequent files.</p>
<p>I dont want to see 3, i want to only see one or 2 there. &nbsp;How do i change it? On windows 7 , i did it with task bar properties very easily, but in windows 10 not so simple or at least i cant figure it out. &nbsp;Is it just set to 3 for frequent? &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Creators update causing lag when I move the mouse. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joycetanja  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Creators update causing lag when I move the mouse.</h2>
                    <p>Windows finally FORCED the creators update on me when they stopped updating the security for the previous version of Windows 10 which worked perfectly for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you start blaming my mouse or touchpad:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I have installed the Creators Update FOUR times and reverted back to the previous Windows 10 all FOUR times when it was still and option ove the past couple of months. Each time the result is the same: previous Windows 10 does not have this problem.</p>
<p>2. I have reinstalled the mouse driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I updated to the Creator's Update, the whole computer lags for a second every few seconds whenever the mouse is moving. That's the whole computer, videos (not audio), windows loading circles, flashing cursors.&nbsp;The mouse is clearly still being moved
 because when it unfreezes, it skips to where it's supposed to be. This happens from even before I start opening any programs on the computer (just on the desktop). It might be mainly the display, or a background program that opens on start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does NOT happen when the mouse/cursor is not being moved, ie. when I watch a video without moving the mouse - no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I beg: Please fix / help me fix. OR better still, make the security updates available on older version of Windows 10. I'm NOT a creator and don't have fancy 3D stuff device to play with - why can't this rushed incomplete buggy problematic update be OPTIONAL??!</p>

<p>Hi Joyce,</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>For us to isolate why your computer lags whenever you try to move the mouse, may we know if you have tried booting into safe mode and see if the issue persists? If not, we suggest that you do so and check if there were any changes in your system. You can
 visit this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for instructions on how to start your computer in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Let us know how it turns out.

            Erm.... apologies for going off at Windows. while composing the post above, it gave me the idea to update the display driver (when I typed "it might be the display", I was right). That solved the mouse problem, but now there is a typing lag... I'll try
 safe mode and let you know.

<h2>            In Windows Live Mail how do I recover an email that has disappeared from my Draft File&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Windows Live Mail. A message I've been working on and had saved in my Draft Folder has suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>When I opened&nbsp;Drafts the email was top of the list, being the latest, but instead of the text I had worked on appearing in the content window, there was a message indicating that there had been a problem and the content couldn't be displayed.</p>
<p>To&nbsp; view the content anyway I was directed to click on a blue link&nbsp;that said "click here" or "view here" which I did&nbsp;but instead of opening the content up,&nbsp;the entry disappeared completely from the list.</p>
<p>I'd spent several hours working on the text, How do I recover&nbsp;it please?</p>
