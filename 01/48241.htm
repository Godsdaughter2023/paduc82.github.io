                    <span>
<p>How does one go about setting up dual projectors?</p>
<p>I have dual monitors on laptop via an external widescreen using the integrated vga port and I want to know how do I project my dual monitor setup with two projectors? &nbsp;I've see the Windows 7 enhances, specifically the duplicate which works great for one
 but will if work for two?</p>
<p>Can I plug in two USB to VGA adapters, plug those two into the projectors, tell Windows 7 to duplicate and that's that?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>Hi Mike,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Well, your laptop comes with one VGA port. Most laptops allow you to connect one external monitor. By default, when you connect an external monitor to a laptop, the same image (mirror image) of your desktop appears on the external monitor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However, you can use VGA extenders that are available in the market to project two other monitors using your external monitor.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note: </strong>Your projectors must support graphics to support Windows 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi Azeez, thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>My concern is that I will not get the duplication I want which is to duplicate 2 of the monitors. &nbsp;I am aware that Windows will support 4 monitors. &nbsp;Heck, it probably supports 16 monitors today.</p>
<p>Will windows allow to say "duplicate these 2 monitors onto these other 2 monitors?"</p>
<p>Monitor 1</p>
<p>-Data for screen 1</p>
<p>Monitor 2</p>
<p>-Data for screen 2</p>
<p>Monitor 3 (Projector 1)</p>
<p>-Data from screen 1</p>
<p>Monitor 4 (Projector 2)</p>
<p>-Data from screen 2</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>Thanks for your post.</p>
<p>Using a third party hardware or software for this setup could have any number of options.</p>
<p>You will have to refer to the paperwork from the device manufacturer for information concerning their product.</p>

            So it turns out this is&nbsp;achievable!
<div><br />
<div>My setup is two dual head DVI video cards. &nbsp;Windows allows you to duplicate the monitor from one port to another on the same video card.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Config:</div>
<div>Video card 1, Port 1: Monitor 1</div>
<div>Video card 1, Port 2: Projector 1</div>
<div>Video card 2, Port 1: Monitor 2</div>
<div>Video card 2, Port 2: Projector 2 &nbsp;</div>

<h3> paa kent  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t insert pictures in Word since updating to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated from Windows 7 Professional to Windows 10.&nbsp; I am using Word 2007.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the update I can't insert a picture into a&nbsp; documents whether it is a new document or an existing document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seem to be several variations all ending with the programme becoming unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes when I click 'Insert Picture'&nbsp; the programme just hangs and I can't even see Explorer to find my picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the odd occasion I can import a picture the programme usually hangs when I save&nbsp; and I end up using Task Manager to end the programme and often lose some of the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Copy and Paste and got a picture but again the document wouldn't 'Save As' or even ' Save'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is driving me mad as writing documents is what I use my computer for most.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regretting doing the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS After writing this I tried creating a two word document without pictures and I can't save that either.

            <p>According to <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Which-versions-of-Office-work-with-Windows-10-0fc85c97-da69-466e-b2b4-54f7d7275705" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page on Microsoft's website</a>, Office 2007 will install and run on Windows 10, but it's not supported, except for security updates. That means Microsoft hasn't tested it and has no solutions for things that might go wrong. Perhaps someone here has a
 workaround for your issue or perhaps not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, the cheapest way to have the latest version of Office is with an Office 365 Personal subscription. For 7 bucks a month (or 70 a year) you'll always have an up-to-date version of Office, along with some kickers thrown in like 1 TB of storage on OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And of course there are other choices as well, like the free Office Online, which could be everything you really need, or the equally free LibreOffice which is getting better all the time.</p>

            Hmmmm - do you have a USB mouse you could hook up to test with? I’d plug it in, reboot, and see if you can use that mouse before hitting esc. Obviously not a solution, but it would help for troubleshooting purposes.

<h2>            &#34;Information&#58; You just unplugged a device from the audio jack.&#34; - NOTIFICATIONS 24&#47;7</h2>
                    <p>I'm absolutely sick and tired of this. Every day, every hour, every three to ten minutes, I get this notification saying "Information: You just unplugged a device from the audio jack." all day long. It happens when I'm on my PC, or even when I'm not on my
 PC. I can be away for almost twenty minutes and I'll hear the notifications going off constantly. I've had my PC for over four months and it's been happening since the day I got it. I can't take it anymore. I can't use it like this. It's brought my workflow
 to a complete stop. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What is wrong with my computer? I've checked the audio jacks, and I'm pretty sure the wires aren't unplugging or plugging themselves. I mean lol, I've tried everything. I've tried connecting my speakers through the front panel audio jack, the back panel
 audio jack, I've even tried not connecting to any audio jacks, the notifications won't stop. It usually happens when I'm making music, listening to music, watching a video, streaming a video, streaming music, and pretty much anything else that has to do with
 media on my PC, it just always seems to pop up. I'm stumped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I make music on my PC for a living, It's not the software program I use, in fact it's nothing that has ever been installed because I've done a system restore to factory setting, and then purposely not install anything, but the alerts continue to pop up.

<h2>            How can I get 3 computers with different OS to work together in the same LAN&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Recently I bought a new Sony Vaio laptop with Windows7 Home and Buisness OS.</p>
<p>From earlier I have an Acer laptop with Windows XP and a stationary PC with Windows 2000 Proffessional. These two machines work perfectly together in the same LAN - called "Arbeidsgruppe" in my home. Now I want to include also my new laptop to this workgroup,
 but so far not suceeded. When I open the windows explorer on the three different machines, it is possible to see the two others. But I do not manage to connect the Sony Vaio in a way that I can share files etc. on the same network as the others.</p>
<p>Additional info: It seems like the Vaio has another network called "Workgroup".</p>
<p>So what should I do to get the three PC's working together? My plan is to start using the stationary PC as a kind of a local server for the laptops - if possible. It has good capasity.</p>
<p>Zaren.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Maybe this can further Help.</p>
<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network has three types of Sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup Network</strong> = Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Work Network</strong> = Basically similar to the previous methods of sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing</strong> = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a Network with the same name while each computer has its own unique name.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted
 Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted<br />
</a><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd
 party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p><strong>Since you have a Network with Win 7 and other version of Windows you need to configure Win 7 as Work Network.</strong></p>
<p>In the Network Center, clicking on the Network type opens the window to the right.</p>
<p>Choose your type of Network. Notice the check mark at the bottom, and check/uncheck it according to your needs.</p>

<strong>When finished with the setting of the system it is advisable to Reboot all the hardware including the Router and all computers involved.</strong></p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p>If needed check specifically the <strong>Permission/Security </strong>settings.</p>
<p>Point to the a Folder that meant to&nbsp; to be share. Right click and choose properties.</p>
<p>In the properties</p>
<p>Click on the Security tab shown in the pic bellow to the right) and check that the users and their permission (shown in the pic bellow center and left) are correctly configured. Then do the same to the Permission tab.</p>
<p>This screen shot is from Win 7, Vista's menus are similar.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/Permission-Security.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/Permission-Security.jpg</a></p>
<p><strong>In both the Security panel, and the Permission panel you have to highlight each User/Group and examine that the Permission Controls are checked correctly.</strong></p>
<p>When everything is OK, Reboot the Network (Router, and computer).</p>
<p><strong>Please Note</strong> that the Groups and Users shown in the screen shoot are just an example. Your list will look the way your system is configured.</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p>*Note. Some of the processes described above are done Not for Windows sake but to compensate for different Routers and the way their firmware works and stores the info about the computers that are Networked.</p>

<h2>            Co-Op Player Can Steal Your Chance To Get 1000&#47;1000 Achievements</h2>
                    
<p>It appears that if you are playing co-op and your co-op partner is in your world and picks up a blueprint, you will not be able to use that blueprint in any game with that character going forward (since the game recognizes the blueprint as having been picked
 up, but your character does not register as having the blueprint).&nbsp; That means you will never have the Duct Tape Master achievement unless, of course, you go into someone else's world and still the missing blueprint from them.&nbsp; Of course, the person you steal
 it from would have to then steal it from someone else, and so on, and so on...&nbsp; Not sure that is what was intended.</p>

<p>[/quote]I've not experienced that myself. &nbsp;I have found out that if I don't save after getting said blueprint that sometimes I cannot go back and get it. &nbsp;Only way I could get it would be in someone else's game and they picked it up. &nbsp;</p>

<p>thanks for this, it will save me lots of hunting about.</p>
<p>My game is however being a bit strange; I can see the last blueprint, it is in/on the shop where u meet the lady dressed in meat!! The marker is there but cannot see the blueprint and if it is on the roof of the shop cannot figure how to get up that high.</p>
<p>Also if I look at my attributes page I have bought everything. If I look thru the combo upgrades it shows that there are 3 things I cannot make, but I have Duct Tape master achievment. It says I don't have Knife Gloves, but can make these? That I am missing
 one of the bomb set, but I can make all of them? and that I do not have the afro bomb wig which I actually agree with and is probaly the mystery bp mentioned above !?

<p>@sidneyTP If you are talking about the one I'm thinking about, there is also a Frank statue close by. &nbsp;Its not on the roof, but on the overhang in front of the store. &nbsp;There is a long path up there and its possible to get up using either of the special vans.
 &nbsp;If you are missing the afro bomb, I think its on the roof in south central city and is accessible from the safe zone.</p>

<h2>            Reinstalling Windows 10, unable to find storage drives</h2>
                    <p>My computer (HP Envy h8-1534) has been frozen in the startup repair loop for some time. I finally was able to get a fresh copy of Windows 10 on a USB drive, and am able to enter the installation
 page for Windows 10, but during the Windows setup, when I try to select "Where do you want to install Windows?" I receive an error message, saying "We couldn't find any drives. To get a storage driver, click Load driver."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Are there copies of the drivers for this device so that I can once again have access to these partitions? I know that they are there somewhere because when I browse for&nbsp;folder&nbsp;for the driver
 it recognizes ESD-USB (C:) as well as the other drives (USB D-G:,&nbsp;and Boot (X:).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your help!</p>

            Hey GI.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />So because most of the AHCI drivers are in the media, the error normally means the media itself is bad.  Did you create it using only Media Creation Tool?  If not do it over  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Remember the media must be booted as a UEFI device if you have the modern UEFI BIOS.  
<br />
<br />If it does require a SATA or AHCI controller driver download and unzip it to the same stick from the PC or motherboard's Supporrt Downloads web page, browse to it to pick it up from the Load Drivers link on the Drive Selection page.

<h2>            Game DVR not working with AMD Radeon R7 200 series</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;spent a fruitless hour with Microsoft support trying to get an AMD&nbsp;Radeon R7 200 series card on my MSI&nbsp;i7 motherboard to record with Windows 10. The card is listed as supported and there was no way that I have been provided to res anything by support. So I am stuck as to why it doesn't work. I will gladly provide any specific system information to anyone who knows what they are talking about. It seems those with knowledge about Game DVR are at a minimum as are the links on Google.<br /></p>

The card is also listed in the title of this post and you could have checked that for yourself as well. I really wish there were people who actually supported this....</p>

May we have the specific video card model that you are using?</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>We're&nbsp;looking&nbsp;forward to your reply.<br /></p>

            Hi Youssef
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To start the diagnosis, I would like to see your event log. Post entries corresponding to this event and few minutes preceding this event in Event Logs. 
<br />Windows Key+R &gt; Type eventvwr and Enter &gt; See if any log corresponding to your date and time is there (Look under all entries under Windows Logs such as System, Application, Security...) &gt; If yes, right click on that log &gt; Save Selected Event &gt; Zip all event files which correspond to your event, upload them to Onedrive and share the link here.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            A fail safe for the next gen XBOX against modders and hackers</h2>
                    
<p>Now this may not be fool proof and there may be flaws of which i did not see but at least it is a step.</p>
<p>In order to prevent more hacking and modding of XBOXs, i think there should be a type of fail safe installed inside the console. My idea was this, to have it where the xbox can only be opened by a microsoft employee by means of a certain key lock and if
 it is tampered with, then something on the inside of the console should automatically break or fry to prevent usage. And if the individual were to try to return the item then the store they return it to would look at it and know off hand that the individual
 was trying to do something they were supposed to so they cant claim &nbsp;it was sold to them broken.</p>

<p>any thoughts?</p>

<p>First off, you cannot physically rend the hardware un-usable just because the owner opened it. &nbsp;That's stupid. &nbsp;Second, they already have the stickers that are placed over the seals that, when removed, become damaged and let employees know that its been
 opened, if theyre just smart enough to check for it. &nbsp;</p>

<p>To me that would suck.I love to CaseMod my game systems.Nothing like a nice design cut in the case with plexiglass and led lights to make it look sexy....So i realy dont think that would be fare to the people like myself that enjoy making Case Mods.</p>
<p>And to tell ya the truth,they can mod and burn back ups of games without even having to take it apart. What they need to do is start laying the law down and realy Ban people for good,even have Jail time,Fines,etc...</p>
<p>Cause i like everyone else hates a Cheater.It ruins the game for everyone.... </p>

<p>You cant jail people for making the console that THEY OWN play back ups. &nbsp;The reasoning comes from the fact that when you LEGALLY purchase a game, you have the right to be able to preserve the game so that should something happen to it (the game breaks cause
 you derp, or your kids scratch it or draw on it with markers or whatever), then you dont have to BUY something that you already bought.</p>
<p>Of course, modding the console to allow back up game disc's voids the warranty, and blocks them from online content, as it should.</p>
<p>The problem with these methods is that they allow for game modding, which make online play unfair, and also pirating. &nbsp;Not everyone who mods a console is a pirate, some people are just fanatics and enjoy seeing what they can get the console to do. &nbsp;It isnt
 fair to ruin their console, or put them in jail, just because they wanted to change something that THEY own.</p>
<p>Now, jail time because they're actively PIRATING games? &nbsp;Sure, they already do that. &nbsp;The problem is that you cant throw every single person in jail for it, its just unrealistic. &nbsp;The companies can sue the person and get (way more then) their moneys worth
 from the pirate, but then the pirates broke, and he wants to play games, so guess what? &nbsp;HE PIRATES MORE!</p>
<p>Its a never ending cycle. &nbsp;Eventually, the new console WILL be hacked, and honestly, I think they deserve it, to some extent. &nbsp;This *** about not allowing previously used games and requiring an always on connection, this isnt how you treat your consumers.</p>

<p>LOL at pirating, &nbsp;it the developers fault for every leaked copy. &nbsp;If they didn't hand their code over to *** poor pirate manufacturers to print their disks for so cheap, &nbsp;Nobody would have the game before it launched. &nbsp;Loss of sales are nobody's fault but
 the seller. &nbsp;And digital distribution would stop a lot of that and allow you to re download your back up. &nbsp;But devs are greedy for the most part and will bully Microsoft into setting minimum price points to shut out indi developers leaving a bland and stark
 market. &nbsp;Hope you like sequels everybody! </p>

                    Mouse consistently stops responding after ~45 minutes; if I wait long (20 minutes) enough, it will start moving the pointer again. Mouse properties says the mouse is working correctly????

<p>Please run the Seagate SeaTools for Windows program.&nbsp; Your hard drive is manufactured by them and this software tests the HARDWARE of the drive.&nbsp; You should see the results of THREE tests:&nbsp; SMART, short and long.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seagate.com/ca/en/support/downloads/item/seatools-win-master/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.seagate.com/ca/en/support/downloads/item/seatools-win-master/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event, I would consider re-installing Windows 7.&nbsp; &nbsp;Most Windows pros will normally re-install Windows about every 3 years.&nbsp; It always produces a dramatic improvement in performance.&nbsp; It also means you will have a virgin clean system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run these tests first to be certain that you should not replace the drive first.</p>

            If the computer is in otherwise good shape, I would consider a new hard drive.&nbsp; It is a long process to install Windows7, but it is doable.&nbsp; I would be happy to provide a step by step.&nbsp; If you are good at following directions, you can do it.&nbsp; &nbsp;You should
 be able to buy a new hard drive for about $50 to $75.&nbsp; It is quite easy to do the hardware change.&nbsp; Usually just a few screws and 2 wires.

New Hard Drive
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<ol>
<li>
The hard drive&nbsp;has failed.&nbsp; You will have to replace it.&nbsp; Replace with a 500 G or more rotating 7200rpm drive.&nbsp; 500G drives can be found for around $70.&nbsp; Typically quite easy to replace.&nbsp; Now you will need a complete Windows 7 install.</li><li>
I do this all the time.&nbsp; I have done hundreds.&nbsp; This is likely to take an elapsed time of around 12 hours.</li><li>
First go to your computer’s OEM support site and find and download the drivers for your computer and store them on a USB stick.</li><li>
From this point onward, I am providing you with the process to install Windows 7.</li><li>
You&nbsp;<strong>may&nbsp;</strong>be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the failing&nbsp;hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC,
 copy the data off.&nbsp; You may need a friend to do this part for you, but the rest is not really very technical or difficult for most people.</li><li>
Install the new hard drive.</li><li>
Do not do any formatting or partitioning.</li><li>
If you made a set of disks for recovery or an image copy&nbsp;at the time your computer was new.&nbsp; This is the time you need them.</li><li>
Start your computer on the first of the disks as instructed and in an hour or so, your computer will look exactly as it did then.</li><li>
If you do not have that set of disks. You will need a legal reusable&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Product&nbsp;Key.&nbsp; You will need a Windows 7 install disk. The win7 disk must match the edition of your product key, and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows
 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; Hopefully, the disk you use will be labeled SP1 (Service Pack 1), because that will save you an additional 4 hours or so.</li><li>
Place the Windows 7 install disk in the disk reader and start your computer.</li><li>
Once the install process is started, choose CUSTOM.&nbsp; Ignore the check box about drivers, unless you can not proceed further.</li><li>
If this is not a brand new hard drive, when you get to the place where it asks you where to put the installation, click Advanced and delete all partitions.</li><li>
When the installer asks about Windows update, choose Ask me later</li><li>
Reset Windows Update setting to Never….</li><li>
<strong>Do NOT install any program</strong></li><li>
Hopefully, you started with a Win7 install disk that was SP1 (Service Pack 1). If not, run Windows Update until you get to the point that SP1 has installed itself as part of this procedure.&nbsp; It entails multiple Windows Update passes and restarts&nbsp;which you keep
 updating until you get there.</li><li>
Once Windows 7 SP1 is installed, install the following:</li><li>

Open Windows Update, change Windows Update setting to Never check for updates</li><li>
<strong>Do not install anything else at this point – NOTHING.&nbsp; Not even an antivirus program</strong></li><li>
Start&nbsp;the update process.&nbsp; It is likely to include about 200. It will take some time.</li><li>
Install all offered security updates.&nbsp; Install .net, but do not install any updates that do not come pre-checked.&nbsp; Do not install any “Optional” updates.</li><li>
Once you have a list of updates, you need to prevent certain specific updates from being installed to prevent Windows 10 from taking over.</li><li>
Click once on each Windows Update that is NOT labeled SECURITY and check the date of issue on the right.&nbsp; If that date is after January 1, 2015, Right-click on it and hide.</li><li>
Click install updates and wait for it to finish.&nbsp; Restart when asked to do so.</li><li>
After re-start is complete and you see a desktop, start Task manager – Right-click on task bar. Look at the % at the bottom.&nbsp; Do NOT attempt to use the computer for any purpose until you see that % fall to and stay at 10% or less.&nbsp; Windows Update is still working
 and has a lot of work to do.</li><li>
Keep running Windows Update again and again till it offers no new ones.</li><li>
Start Internet Explorer, click the gear (upper right)&nbsp;in IE11 and select Compatibility settings and enter&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft.com</strong>&nbsp;in the list</li><li>

After the install is complete, check Device Manager. Type&nbsp;<strong>device</strong>&nbsp;in the text box above the start globe when you click it and choose Device manager
 from the list&nbsp;to find out if Win7 was able to supply the drivers you need.&nbsp; You should get drivers only from the maker of your computer or Intel.&nbsp; Its best to get all the drivers at this point.&nbsp; Win7 install may have installed all of them or nearly. Do NOT

</p><p>After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and&nbsp;<strong><em>before</em></strong>&nbsp;any
 (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive, you will have a precise duplicate of your system as it was at this point.&nbsp; You can
 restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time, and you will have saved yourself all the
 time you put in this time.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Reliability Monitor not checking for solutions.</h2>
                    <p>Recently, my computer has been shutting down "unexpectedly" as the Reliability Monitor so expertly tells me.</p>
<p>It tells me the problem signature:</p>
<p>Problem Event Name:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;BlueScreen<br />
Code:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;d1<br />
Parameter 1:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;108<br />
Parameter 2:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2<br />
Parameter 3:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0<br />
Parameter 4:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;fffff80181a5f5c2<br />
OS version:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10_0_15063<br />
Service Pack:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0_0<br />
Product:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;768_1<br />
OS Version:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10.0.15063.2.0.0.768.101<br />
</p>
<p>but says 'not reported' at the top right of the screen.</p>
<p>When I click 'report and seach for solutions' I get a pop up saying that this cannot be done because I am not connected to the internet.</p>
<p>I've tried searching for a way around this (which I can do because I'm completely connected to the internet) and double checked my network adapter was up to date, made sure my virus protection wasn't the cause, disabled it just be to sure and still cannot
 get anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anybody encountered this and can suggest how I can get the 'find solutions' button to work so I can begin to find out what my bigger problem is?</p>

    <title>Code 43 Error for NVIDIA GeForce GT 745M - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Code 43 Error for NVIDIA GeForce GT 745M</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Lately, I've seen a surge of people posting about problems with the Code 43 error in the Device Manager on their NVIDIA Graphics card, notably the 745M card on the N550 series laptops. This is a very frustrating problem as it completely renders the card
 useless and leaving us with the less powerful Intel Graphics Card. On top of that, the solution to this problem is very cryptic, with various suggested solutions, sometimes with no avail on every attempt.<br />
<br />
This problem first usurped last September, unbeknownst to me until I purchased GTA V and noticed that my Graphics not sufficient enough to run the game, so I attempted to optimize through GeForce Experience (GFE), only to have the same NVIDIA update 'installed'
 over and over. After several attempts of fixes which I shall mention shortly, nothing worked, I gave up. Oddly enough, on the 6th of October, the card started working again. I attempted no fix on my own, it was completely random, and I have no idea what fixed
 it.<br />
<br />
The problem is now back as of Sunday 29th November. And I am seeing other people with the same issue.<br />
<br />
Here are some things I'd like to point out:<br />
<br />
<strong>Suggested BIOS fix</strong><br />
<br />
My BIOS is up to date <a href="http://imgur.com/VAJhBUT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
1</a>, <a href="http://imgur.com/Ixi8HZE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">2</a><br />
<br />
I have not attempted to 'flash' my BIOS, primarily because I have no idea how that works, and I've heard people saying it's not the best idea.<br />
<br />
I have not attempted to downgrade my BIOS<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Suggested DDU fixes</strong><br />
<br />
I have booted into Safe Mode, uninstalled the card through DDU, booted up, attempted a reinstallation, no avail.<br />
<br />
I have done the same procedure, with a different, earlier version of the card, and still, the same problem.<br />
<br />
Same procedures, with different versions, only this time with a Clean installation. Nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Suggested Manufacture-download fixes</strong><br />
<br />
Not possible, <a href="http://imgur.com/HXLS65J" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
there is no available NDIVIA download</a>&nbsp;under the Windows 10 tab on the N550LF page.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Suggested Device Manager fixes</strong><br />
<br />
I have uninstalled the card through the Device Manager, and reinstalled the card (different versions: current and early), but to no avail<br />
<br />
Scanning for Hardware Changes does nothing<br />
<br />
I've heard people saying they've run Device Manager immediately on startup, uninstalling the Driver, reinstalling, and saying it works: not for me, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically, I've attempted everything mentioned above.<br />
<br />
Here's what I haven't tried yet, unsure whether these fixes will work or not, or leaving them as an absolute last resort:<br />
<br />
Haven't attempted a reformat or system restore, leaving them as last resorts.<br />
<br />
Haven't fiddled around with my Intel Graphics, don't think it will do much unless Windows fails to detect my NVIDIA GPU (I had this problem at some point before).<br />
<br />
<br />
It's worth pointing out, that I found <a href="http://www.imgur.com/eMokNHS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a>&nbsp;in my Windows Updates. Not sure whether that could have done more harm or good, but it's there.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Currently, NVIDIA Control Panel is not accessible, GFE is uninstalled (no point using it: it persists to install the latest update which does nothing at all, and I can't access any other tab).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please, if anyone knows a specific fix, I'd really appreciate it. I hate having to wait without knowing whether or not this issue will be dealt by NVIDIA/ASUS/Windows. A lot of people have this problem too, hopefully, this will offer some insight into their
 issue.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If any more specs need to be mentioned, just let me know.</p>

            <p>I fixed my code 43 on the Q550LF! </p>
<p>I followed these instructions that worked for someone else with the same issue (without removing battery):
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Power off the computer. </strong></p>
<p><strong>remove A/C adapter. </strong></p>
<p><strong>remove battery (if possible) </strong></p>
<p><strong>hold power button down 1 minute </strong></p>
<p><strong>reattach battery reattach A/C adapter </strong></p>
<p><strong>power up computer </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then at first I still had the error. Although I did it a billion times by now, I
<strong>disabled and enabled</strong> the driver from the device manager. Once it re-enabled the code 43 was GONE. Then my control panel wouldn't open but a restart fixed that. I hope that is stays fixed and this works for others. I have no idea on why it worked,
 but it worked. This fix also helped someone with the same issue on the Nivida forums.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Net Framework 3.5 cannot be installed after upgrading to Windows 8. Error code 0x800f0922</h2>
                    Hello. A long while ago, during the summer, my father decided to upgrade our computer to Windows 8.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We bought Windows 8 online and downloaded it from the website.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There were a few problems. Like for example, my video card would fail randomly when I played games, but that was easily fixed after I updated the drivers. But more importantly when I tried to play other games (e.g. Osu! Minecraft) it would ask me to download
 Net Framework 3.5</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It would fail and spit out error code 0x800f0922. I went to the website to troubleshoot (via "Tell me how to solve this problem") but the error code wasn't mentioned.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I googled the error message and found other people had the same problem, but I couldn't find a straight answer. Some of them said they needed to restore their computer to a prior date, but since I wasn't informed about the decision to upgrade the computer
 so I wasn't able to make a backup.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried going to the control pad (Programs and Features - Turn Windows features on and off) and download it from there but it would spit out the same error message.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At that point I just gave up and left the issue alone, but now I really want to play these games that I took for granted. Could anyone help me? Thanks in advance.</div>
                </div>

            Hello!
<div><br />
<div>1. A really really really really long time ago. I know for sure though that I had it before May 7, 2010 as I had this computer before I bought TF2. According to an in game record, I first started playing on May 7, 2010, so it must have been before then.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I do not have a receipt that says when, but "Windows Activation" says August 3, 2013. I upgraded during the summer, so this date looks correct.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Under "System type" I see 64-bit Operating System, x64-based processor. So I assume 64 bit?</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. I did not install any antivirus, but my dad says he installed a Chinese program called "360安全卫士." He says it is a free program and updates itself. He says that the same program also has a firewall.</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. I believe not. I have not installed any antivirus and aside from his Chinese program I don't think my father has either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. I have no idea. It has been several years since I first purchased this computer.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>6. It says I have nothing installed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>7. "Version Information" says I have version&nbsp;11.3.372.94 installed. I assume I should upgrade?</div>
<div><br />
<div>8. I have Google Chrome, I believe it was installed prior to Windows 8 when I updated my Java. I am unsure about Firefox. I did not consciously download both of them though, I only have Chrome because I neglected to uncheck the box during the update.</div>
<div><br />
<div>9. I do not. I am unsure if my father does. If he does, it would it a Chinese program though.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>My memory is not the greatest and I do not have accurate records so I may not be able to provide all the information you have asked for, but thank you so much for replying.</div>
<div><br />

            1. I suppose it belongs to my father. But I use it more often than he does. We live in Canada.
<div><br />
<div>2. We had the safeguard prior to the upgrade.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Yes</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. I see a large list of features that I can (supposedly) turn on and off.</div>
<div><br />
<div>5. Um. It says Update Versions: RTM (KB2718695) I'm not sure if that's what you're looking for but the line above it says Version: 10.0.9200.16384. Just in case.</div>

            <p><strong>Note: The computer is missing scores of critical security updates and should NOT be connected to the internet or any local networks (i.e., other computers) in its current state!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quickest way to resolve the situation is by doing a Reset (AKA "remove everything and reinstall Windows 8"). See
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</a>&nbsp;&amp; pay close attention to the Notes &amp; Warnings.</p>
<ul>
<li>You might be asked to insert your Win8 recovery&nbsp;discs (if your father made them)&nbsp;or your Win8 Upgrade.
<br />
</li><li>All of your personal files will be deleted and your settings will be reset. All third-party applications will be removed.</li></ul>
<p>To preserve your personal data (e.g., contents of My Documents folder; IE Favorites; mail client data), back it up to disk (i.e., CD or DVD but
<em>not a flash drive</em>). Before restoring the data to the hard-drive, scan it with at least two (2) reputable online scans (e.g., ESET; Kaspersky; Bit Defender; etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Win8 includes Windows Defender by default. Defender includes an anti-virus component as well as an anti-malware component. Used in combination with the default Windows Firewall, you really don't need a third-party application like 360 Safeguard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need assistance with the Reset, you may begin <em>your own, new thread</em> in this forum:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reposting for emphasis...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The computer should NOT be connected to the internet or any local networks (i.e., other computers) in its current state!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            How to turn off Windows Defender</h2>
                    <p>I recently received the Windows 10 Creator update and now Windows Defender has turned itself on as is there constantly. I never asked for it to be turned on and have my own malware and virus protection so do not need it</p>
<p>
</p><p>can anyone tell me how&nbsp;turn it off as there is no button or setting anywhere I can find that allows me to disable and turn it off and surely that should be an option for the user.</p>

<p>Defender will automatically disable when it detects another security software installed on you device. There is a way to turn it off using the Registry, but take note that editing the registry can be dangerous, and it can cause irreversible damage to your
 system if you don't do it correctly. It's highly recommended to make a full backup of your system before proceeding. You can create a restore point by following the steps under
<strong>Restore from a system restore point</strong> on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To turn of Windows Defender via Registry, simply follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press<strong> Windows key&nbsp;</strong> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fMB2Nl.jpg" /><strong>+ R</strong> on keyboard to open the
<strong>Run</strong> command.</li><li>Type "regedit", and click <strong>OK </strong>to open the registry.</li><li>Browse the following path:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender</li><li>If you don't see DWORD <strong>DisableAntiSpyware</strong>, right-click on an empty space, select
<strong>New</strong>, and click on <strong>DWORD (32-bit) Value</strong>.</li><li>Name the key <strong>DisableAntiSpyware</strong>.</li><li>Double-click the newly created key, and set the value from <strong>0 </strong>
to <strong>1</strong>.</li><li>Restart device.</li></ol>
<p>

                    <p>My TF2 server was hacked by TeamSuddenDeath, he can change his name in my game and tried to shut down my servers multiple times. He is clearly not a valve administrator or The TF2 Police. I Reported him for Cheating and System Tampering, but Microsoft hasn't responded yet, or banned him. If they do he should be console banned because he is number one on the stats leaderboard. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He might have multiple accounts. In another case I have also seen other players trying to mess with my game and the players in my server and I also saw The TF2 POLICE try to shut down my server, even though I was not cheating and changing the game rules.</p><p><br /></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you set up BitLocker, you must choose how access to BitLocker-protected drives can be recovered in the event that the specified unlock
 method cannot be used (such as if the TPM cannot validate the boot components, the personal identification number (PIN) is forgotten, or the password is forgotten). In these situations, you must be able to supply either the recovery key or the recovery password
 to unlock the encrypted data on the drive. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Windows 7, the term "recovery key" is used generically to refer to both the recovery key file and the recovery password. When you supply
 the recovery information, you can use either of the following formats:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A recovery password consisting of 48 digits divided into eight groups. During recovery, you need to type this password into the BitLocker
 recovery console by using the function keys on your keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
A key file on a USB flash drive that is read directly by the BitLocker recovery console. During recovery, you need to insert this USB device.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please use the links mentioned below for information on BitLocker key.</span></p>
<p><span>What is a BitLocker recovery key?</span></p>

            The Update Assistant in Windows 10 cannot be uninstalled, but you can get rid of it
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Task Scheduler and hit enter
<br />In the left Pane, navigate to: Windows - Update Orchestrater
<br />Right Pane double click  'Update Assistant'
<br />Click on Triggers Tab
<br />On each of the triggers ( At login . . . etc.) double click and uncheck 'Enabled'
<br />
<br />Under 'Update Assistant, there is another event 'Update Assistant CalendarRun'
<br />Do the same for all triggers on that event
<br />
<br />Restart your system, that's It!

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft will never call you regarding security issues on your PC etc, it is more then likely a scam like the one mentioned here:
