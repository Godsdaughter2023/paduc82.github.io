<h2>            Friendly Trees in Windows 7</h2>
                    In Windows XP, by default when you clicked on a folder in the windows explorer&nbsp;folder tree, it would auto expand.&nbsp; In Windows Vista, you can turn that on using a registry key setting called FriendlyTree, but this does not seem to work in Windows 7.&nbsp; Is
 there a&nbsp;way to turn on Friendly Trees in Windows 7?<br />

            If it's not working then it's not working and trying to force the registry to accept the entry would be dangerous since it could seriously screw up the Windows GUI. Keep in mind that you're using a pre-release version and that's a relatively minor fix
 so it might be different in the final version. A fix for the third-party app might be available by then too.

<h3> gretchenvanderlee  say:</h3>
<h2>            What video program will work with split screen with Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I used to play the video player in 1/2 the screen and use the internet in the other half.
</p>
<p>Can you not split screens in windows 10? if, so- how do I go back to Windows 8???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can right click on task bar and select use side by side, it puts one on top of the other...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would they take away the ability to use programs side by side- I can't seem to get anything to happen when I run my finger down the screen...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help?</p>

                    <p><span>Skype for Desktop (on Windows 10)&nbsp;has been showing this popup upon running it since at least v7</span>.35, if not before.&nbsp;Not every time, thankfully, but with each minor version upgrade of Skype, as far as I
 have noticed (through 7.36.x).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-This needs to stop.</p>
<p>-Is this a sign&nbsp;Skype for Desktop is being phased out on Win10?&nbsp; I hope not.</p>
<p>-MS shouldn't care this much about the use of one Skype versus another, especially an inferior one.</p>

<p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Skype has new version design for Windows 10 that you can use and try. But, if you wish not to have this you can just you can disregard and cancel it.
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, Skype for the desktop is not retiring or it will not be phased out. With that you can still use Skype for Desktop.
</span></p>

<p>Great find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here, I don't have OsVersion or Shown. I tried Shown on both 0 and 1 though and it didn't have an effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing LastShown will trigger the popup 100% of the time (it must test to see if it's a future date), so that's out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That leaves Count, which I bumped to 1000. But since I see that Skype still iterates it (it did so when I was testing the LastShown value), I have a feeling that it doesn't care what it is. We'll see.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Skype, Windows 10 has new application which is Skype Preview. This is pre-install, with that the automated pop - up goes hand in hand with the new up to remind Skype users that we have the latest version for Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, we can't get&nbsp;free of the said pop - up.&nbsp;What we highly suggest&nbsp;is that use the&nbsp;stand alone Skype for desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>That is the thinking, yes. I've seen it mentioned by noted MS reporter Mary Jo Foley (ZDNet) several times, and it was even alluded to in a Skype Q&amp;A session held by the designers of new Skype just a few months ago. The designers were quick to say that there's
 no ETA on this, as a lot of work remains to be done, but it is their intent to pull the trigger at some point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing that it's almost inevitable for next year, but I hope they reconsider.</p>

<p>They did it, they forced Skype App usage. Now the desktop installer won't allow you to install skype, but points you to the Windows 10 app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which doesn't work properly and no "kind" response will make up for this mistake.
</p>
<p>I have been working with Microsoft products for over 15 years. </p>
<p>I still wonder, why is it that the<strong> Microsoft board, operations &amp; management</strong> leading the company, consistently make Strategic mistakes on their products? It's such a shame as a user to see one company make strategic mistake after mistake,
 while others are flawlessly trying to serve the community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft supports the whole industry and ecosystem with its products, but can't "<strong>decide</strong>" to make proper ones themselves. Doesn't make sense to me.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I haven't seen the message at the top of the thread for quite some time, but the behavior you're seeing is all part of the effort to get people off the far more capable "classic" Skype so that they can retire it--I'm guessing, at some point
 in 2018. I'm not sure what I'm going to do on that day, since I find any Skype but the classic one to be intolerable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That desktop installer you mentioned is for the new-generation desktop Skype intended for Win7, Win8, and older versions of Win10, explaining why on a current Win10 it shunts you to the Win10 app instead. You can access its properties and set it to Win8
 to install it, but you'll find it so close to the Win10 app that it's hardly worth the bother. I think the intention is for them ultimately to look all but identical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can still <a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
download</a> the classic version on Win10, but it's now the last option that you see when you click the little down arrow, which most people will never click in the first place in lieu of the big blue button. You've probably noticed that the classic version
 is rarely updated anymore.</p>

    <title>Old Laptop Stuck on Brand Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yelkcub97  say:</h3>
<h2>            Old Laptop Stuck on Brand Screen</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a new laptop as a result of my old one breaking in the one place that renders it pretty much useless for what I want to do on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I tried to reset the old laptop (because my dad wants it to replace his), and it was stuck at 2% for 4 hours so I gave up and force-turned it off. Now whenever I boot it up, it's constantly stuck in a loop on the brand name screen (Toshiba)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help? I literally cannot do anything with it as there is no manual reset switch/hole on the laptop (that I can see)</p>

            <p>Your attempted reset obliterated your old copy of Windows so now your laptop starts, tries to load&nbsp;a Windows which is not all there, crashes and so restarts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try to&nbsp;reset the computer to its factory state.&nbsp; There might be a function key you can press when you see the 'brand screen' that will take you to the factory reset menu.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or if you had previously upgraded the old computer to Windows 10 you can download removable media for Windows 10, boot from it and do a clean install (skip when asked for a product key).</p>

<h2>            System registry fileis missing or corrupt - Error 0xc00000e9</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Compaq Presario computer that is running Windows Vista Basic, 32 bit. Two days ago, I received the message, Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. To fix the problem:</p>
<p>1. Insert your installation disc and restart your computer. 2. Choose your language settings, and then click next. 3. Click repair your computer.</p>
<p>File: \windows\system32\config\system&nbsp;&nbsp; Status: 0xc00000e9 Info: Windows failed to load because the system registry file is missing, or corrupt.</p>
<p>From this screen, I press "ENTER" to continue, which allows me to hit press "F8" for advanced options. No matter which button I press, it brings me back to the original screen. It does not give me the "repair your computer" option, either.</p>
<p>I have the Windows Vista Service Pack 1 Integrated disk, and I load it, then restart the computer, but the same screen pops up. Help anyone??</p>

<div>
<p><span>I suspect the reason the disk isn't working is because your BIOS are not configured to boot first from the CD drive.&nbsp;
 Procedures to fix that are included below.&nbsp; Before you do that and re-install your OS, let's try to repair it.&nbsp; We can always do the re-install as a last resort (and the procedure is included as the last step below).</span></p>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. One of the features of System Restore is to replace the current registry with the registry that was in place at the time the restore point was created
 - so this may very well resolve the problem (if that's all it is).&nbsp; You may need to do this from the Recovery or Installation Disk if you can't boot into your system.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make
 the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted,
 push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a><span>&nbsp;along with burning software like:
</span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</a><span>&nbsp;and, of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32.<span>&nbsp; </span>Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption
 post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It may want to schedule itself to start at the next startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Agree and then reboot so the program can run. It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools /
 Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>.
<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Although this will not affect your data,
 settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had
 to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></span></p>

    <title>bios update prior to windows 8.1 download - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mary beth v  say:</h3>
<h2>            bios update prior to windows 8.1 download</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba satellite P55t-A installed with windows 8.0.&nbsp; I installed 8.1 and shortly thereafter it crashed. Eventually I lost all access to functionality which forced a reload of the 8.0 version of the operating system. I want to again&nbsp;download the
 8.1 version, but I have a recommended update to the bios. I currently have bios version 1.50 installed, which was the version when windows 8.1 was previously installed. The update will install to bios version 1.80. The instructions look very complicated and
 I am not a technical person and really don't want to be messing with the bios. So, can I re-download windows 8.1 without updating the bios to version 1.80? Can I do this and continue to update all other recommendations without concern for bios related dependency?
 Meaning, will I be creating problems down the line if I don't do the bios update and download windows 8.1 and subsequent updates?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
No that means BIOS passwords which I doubt you have - that would show-up before Windows
<br />
even boots.<br />
<br />
Your best source of information is Toshiba Support and their forums who will know your computer.<br />

    <title>Runas not working properly in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keefy_j  say:</h3>
<h2>            Runas not working properly in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I use desktop shortcuts with "runas" commands to run some tasks that required Domain Admin and/or local admin rights (The Domain Admin is in the local administrators group). But these shortcuts no longer work since upgrading to Windows 10 from Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If in a cmd window I type "runas /?" one of the examples given is:<br />
runas /profile /env /user:mydomain\admin "mmc %windir%\system32\dsa.msc"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you try this from a command prompt after substituting your domain &amp; user, you will find it fails with a message "Requires elevation". I'm not sure how much more elevation beyond Domain Admin it thinks you need!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you navigate to the Windows System32 folder, hold down the shift key&nbsp;&amp; right click mmc.exe&nbsp;you can select Run as a Different user, enter the domain, Username and password and the elevated mmc works just fine.<br />
<br />
I will have to work this way for now but it is such a pain to have to&nbsp; enter the domain &amp; username every time. Some of these commands are called many tens of times every day. I can accept having to type the password every time, I wouldn't have it any other
 way. But&nbsp;right click, runas,&nbsp;enter domain\user password is a royal pain!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way around this?</p>

    <title>Windows 7 64-bit mouse pauses&#47;freezes&#47;stutters often - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 64-bit mouse pauses&#47;freezes&#47;stutters often accompanied by a Windows Event Sound</h2>
                    
<p>Symptoms:</p>
<p>Erratic mouse behavior. Mouse pausing, freezing for a full second or more, accompanied by a Windows Event Sound, usually. Sometimes there is just a slight pause and no&nbsp;Windows Event Sound.&nbsp;Sometimes the mouse acceleration changes after the freeze. Sometimes,
 more rarely, my mouse will be dropped by the OS... the laser light on the underside goes out and I have to unplug the mouse and plug it back in to get it to be recognized.</p>
<p><strong>This is happening almost all the time.&nbsp;</strong>I like to use Windows mostly to play a game, World War II Online: Battleground Europe. It's a first person shooter mmo. This problem is annoying enough on the desktop.&nbsp;Unsuable&nbsp;for FPS gaming.&nbsp;I am
 considering having to drop using Windows 7 64-bit for now.</p>
<p><br />
I have this problem immediately upon installing Windows 7 64-bit.</p>
<p>The problem persists with Windows 7 64-bit after having tried many numerous solutions/workarounds offered on the Internet.</p>
<p>I have not been able to determine what Event might be tied to this in the Event Log Viewer, or if this is even an Event that is being logged in there.</p>
<p>NOTE: My Logitech (G3)MX518 Optial Gaming mouse works fine, with no problems whatsoever, under Windows XP Professional SP3 32-bit with all the latest updates, or under Ubuntu 10.4(Lucid Lynx) 64-bit. I've never ever had any problem with this mouse at any
 time under those OS's. Those OS's will run an intensive game if I want, all day long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steps in my latest attempt at resolving the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not try all the BIOS settings at once in the beginning. For instance, I disabled 'Intel Speedstep' to see if that would solve the issue. Then rebooted back into BIOS and disabled the C1E function when I discovered that disabling Speedstep alone didn't
 solve the issue. Ect, ect...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not install Norton Internet Security 2010 for quite some time while I tried out various workarounds offered and listed below in case it was the issue. No difference, so NIS 2010 is now installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keep in mind this problem occurs the moment Windows 7 64-bit is cleanly installed.</p>
<p>1) Clean install of Windows 7 64-bit, for the third time now</p>
<p>2) Installed Visual C++ 2008 64-bit Runtime v9.0.30729.4148 KB973552/KB969706 downloaded from --&gt;
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=2051a0c1-c9b5-4b0a-a8f5-770a549fd78c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=2051a0c1-c9b5-4b0a-a8f5-770a549fd78c</a></p>
<p>a) Rebooted just in case and then installed the same version of the Visual C++ 2008 Runtime for the 32-bit environment in Windows 7 64-bit</p>
<p>3) Installed Windows 7 64-bit Drivers</p>
<p>a) Marvell Yukon 88E8056 Gigabit Ethernet Onboard NIC Driver v11.24.5.3 (02-15-2010)</p>
<p>b) Creative Labs X-Fi Titanium 64-bit Driver v2.17.0007, and various Creative Labs software and all the latest updates for them.</p>
<p>c) Intel Chipset Software Driver v9.1.1.1025 (12-22-2009). Seems to just install a 64-bit Hard Disk Driver update.</p>
<p>d) ATI Catalyst v10.3 Driver</p>
<p>4) Installed Windows Updates</p>
<p>NOTE: I did not install the lastest four updates that are available at this time, three of which are Security Updates all having a Published Date: 2/9/2010. I decided not to install these due to a 'Circular Kernel context logger' error that I was previously
 seeing in the Event Log Viewer, logged by 'Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-EventTracing' EventID: 2. Now I'm not having that issue anymore.</p>
<p>NOTE: I also installed an Optional Driver, ATK110 ACPI Driver, which installs the following file --&gt; C:\Windows\System32\drivers\ASACPI.sys - It's listed as file version 1043.2.15.37 and dated 3-29-2005. In a previous install of Windows 7 64-bit I downloaded
 an update of this from Asus contained in a utility/file AMDCoolnQuiet_Utility_V21801_XPVistaWin7.zip and installed it. I started up the Utility and it gave me the message that my system was not supported by "Asus Cool 'n Quiet". It's ASACPI.sys file was dated
 sometime in 2009, rather than 2005. Since my latest Windows 7 install, I currently just have the 2005 version offered by Windows Update installed. I don't know if this file is getting loaded or used at all by Windows 7 64-bit. But I am wondering...</p>
<p>Is this an issue?</p>
<p>5) Installed Logitech Setpoint Software v6.00.68 (Driver Version 4.90.80) for Windows 7 64-bit</p>
<p>NOTE: I had not installed this in previous Windows 7 64-bit installations and had hoped this would cure the problem. No change, problem still persists.</p>
<p>6) Went into BIOS and reset it to default settings</p>
<p>7) BIOS: Set A.I. OC(overlcock) to 'Manual' and left at deafult values so that CPU is not overclocked automatically or manually in any way</p>
<p>8) BIOS: Set up Memory timimgs settings, Memory Voltage, and Northbridge Voltage, according to my memory Manufacturer's Recommendations(Mushkin memory)</p>
<p>NOTE: Again, I never have any problem at all in WinXP Pro 32-bit SP3 or Ubuntu 10.4 64-bit with these settings. Those OS's will run an intensive game if I want, all day long.</p>
<p>9) BIOS: Set Intel Speedstep to 'Disabled'</p>
<p>10) BIOS: Set C1E (Enhanced Halt State) to 'Disabled'</p>
<p>11) BIOS: Set the ACPI Power/Suspend Mode to 'S3' only'</p>
<p>12) BIOS: Set ACPI 2.0 Support to 'Enabled'</p>
<p>NOTE: Enabled, Disabled, on any of the above settings/functions hasn't solved the problem. I may have not tried every single possible 'combination', but anyway, no change with mouse issue.</p>
<p>13) In Windows 7 I selected the 'High Performance' Power Option and set 'USB selective suspend setting' to 'Disabled' with BIOS options set as listed in Steps 9-12 above</p>
<p>NOTE: With the BIOS set this way there is no 'Processor Power Management' settings available in the Power Options, other than 'System Cooling Policy' (Active/Passive).</p>
<p>I left this set at 'Active'.</p>
<p>Is this an issue?</p>
<p>14) Tried monitoring DPC Latency with the download link to the 'DPC Latency Checker' utility. No spikes visible in the utility during mouse freezes/pauses</p>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>I may have found the solution that has worked for me. It's probably too early to tell, I'll need more time to be sure. But in case it's resolved&nbsp; the issue for me, I'll post what seems to have worked as suggested on a post I came across from another forum.
 Take it from a guy who has tried a lot of suggestions, this may be the answer. Heck, I had tried a few other things that I didn't&nbsp;mention in my original post.&nbsp;But anyway, so far, my system and mouse seem to be working very well at the Desktop for the past
 hour and a half. I haven't tried gaming yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Uninstall the Windows Update KB977074 (The January 2010 stability and reliability update for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2).</p>
<p>2) Reboot and let your system sit for a couple/few minutes after rebooting.</p>
<p>3) Just in case... Reboot again, and then reinstall the KB977074.</p>
<p>4) Reboot to complete the installation.</p>

            <p>Problem could be due to </p>
<p>1. Virus</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. Please run a scan with Malwarebytes or similar to determine any presence of virus. If virus is detected, clean the virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Set computer to Clean boot by following the article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</a></p>
<p>and see whether the Lag is reduced, cause Clean boot loads only Operating system and its files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Try booting the PC in safe mode and check the LAN settings there. </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. If Everything fails, Open elevated Command prompt, type "sfc /scannow" (without quotes). wait till the scan is completed, and check for the complete message at the end of scan. Reboot the PC and check the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. If I am not wrong, if everything fails you need to clean install Windows.</p>

<p>I have had this problem for a little while now and it's starting to bug me, Every time i put a new video that i publish or add to my computer doesn't&nbsp;have an image, just a thumbnail, i have tried multiple solutions like Deleting the Cache but that only got
 rid of my old video thumbnails too.</p>
<p>Folder Options and Switching the Default Program back and forth with no success.</p>
<p>The problem, i think, started when i uninstalled Nero Burner and i heard that this same problem happend to other people that did it to.</p>
<p>Please if there is a Registry problem or something i can do Please tell me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If i don't have this thread in the right topic can&nbsp;a MOD&nbsp;move this.</p>

<p>The classic solution is, as you say, to delete the cache and let the thumbnails regenerate when you open the folders (it may take some time so you need to be patient).&nbsp;&nbsp;But you say that didn't resolve your problem - that's unfortunate because it does so
 for most people with this or a similar problem with thumbnails.</p>
<p>Here's a forum thread on this topic including a number of proposed solutions (including a registry fix).&nbsp; I would be very leary of the registry fix - it is untested, may not work, and/or may do things you don't want instead of what you do want.&nbsp; If you still
 decide to try it, first create a System Restore point <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/create-a-restore-point-for-windows-vistas-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/create-a-restore-point-for-windows-vistas-system-restore/</a>&nbsp;AND backup the Registry
<a href="http://www.adamsdvds.co.uk/tutorials/vista/regedit/backup.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adamsdvds.co.uk/tutorials/vista/regedit/backup.php</a>.&nbsp; Personally, I wouldn't chance it myself - but the decision and the risk is yours.</p>
<p>One person in a forum had the following comment (I don't know if it's true): "Windows will only show thumbnails that play in Windows Media Player as that is the player that is included with Windows. If the video does not play in Windows Media Player (it

<p>The classic solution is, as you say, to delete the cache and let the thumbnails regenerate when you open the folders (it may take some time so you need to be patient).&nbsp;&nbsp;But you say that didn't resolve your problem - that's unfortunate because it does so
 for most people with this or a similar problem with thumbnails.</p>
<p>Here's a forum thread on this topic including a number of proposed solutions (including a registry fix).&nbsp; I would be very leary of the registry fix - it is untested, may not work, and/or may do things you don't want instead of what you do want.&nbsp; If you still
 decide to try it, first create a System Restore point <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/create-a-restore-point-for-windows-vistas-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/create-a-restore-point-for-windows-vistas-system-restore/</a>&nbsp;AND backup the Registry

<p>One person in a forum had the following comment (I don't know if it's true): "Windows will only show thumbnails that play in Windows Media Player as that is the player that is included with Windows. If the video does not play in Windows Media Player (it
 uses another player like Real Player or Quicktime) then Windows cannot generate a thumbnail for it."&nbsp; It's possible, but frankly I doubt it.</p>

Like I said i Uninstalled a program called Nero Burner which seems to be the problem, when i deleted it every new video did not have an image, the only fix would be a registry fix. I recently found out from my Everio JVC Camera that the video file, MOD, had
 an image when uploaded to my computer but no other file does. And you didnt provide a link to the Reg Fix Thread

Tried that with no success, can you maybe ask your support team for a patch, this seems hopeless.

The registry fix is not a link but actually posted in the forum thread (OOPS, you're right, I didn't post it).&nbsp; Here it is:

<h2>            Skype for business installation</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem installing skype for business for one of the users in my company.</p>
<p>If I try to download the installation from Office 365 website , it says it can't work together with Office 2013 and asks me to uninstall it first.</p>
<p>If I try to download it using the link provided in another post (<a href="https://c2rsetup.officeapps.live.com/c2r/download.aspx?productReleaseID=LyncEntryRetail&amp;platform=x86&amp;language=en-us&amp;source=O15O365&amp;version=O15GA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">c2rsetup.officeapps.live.com/.../download.aspx</a>)
 , it says I cant install it because of Microsoft Visio and asks me to uninstall it.</p>
<p>Is there any other way, I can't uninstall any of those programs just for skype? Does it mean this user won't be able to use skype for business at all?<br />

<p style="text-align: left"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span>If you have installed Skype for Business. You can enjoy full communications with calling, meetings and Video-based screen sharing for better sharing performance.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span>However, from your screenshots above, I understand Visio 2013 was deployed by MSI. Since then, theses three can</span><span>’</span><span>t

Office installed with Click-to-Run and Windows Installer on same computer isn't supported</a>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span>So if you have to install Skype for Business and Visio on the same computer, I suggest you upgrade your Visio 2013 to Visio 2016 so that these three can work together.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: left"><span>Or you can install Visio 2013 on the other computer so that Skype for Business 2015 can works with Office 2013.</span></p>

            Most probably you are running Home Version of Windows in which Policy editor like Secpol and gpedit are not available.
<br />For group policies, you can use the registry edits:

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Usually, running secpol.msc command should open Security Policy snap-in.
<br />
<br />If you're on Windows 10 Home, Security Policy snap-in is not available on that.
<br />
<br />You need to upgrade to Pro version to have the snap-in.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>I have been using WaveLab Elements 7 for 2 months and no problem in Windows 7, But in the last 2 week the program will not start, it tries to start but shuts down after 20 sec.
</p>
<p>I removed it and reinstalled and re registered it and it ran once, but again the problem came back the next time I tried to start the program. I hope someone has a idea on the problem.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>Just to let you know I was in the process of trying your fix and noticed windows was loading soem updates(19). I let windows 7 do it's thing and restarted the computer and now it seems&nbsp;my audio program WaveLab Essentials 7 is working again. So I revert back
 to the old saying "Don't fix if not broken". But I will try your comments if I have more problems later.</p>
<p>Thanks for your Time</p>
<p>Terry</p>

                    This computer is not running genuine windows. This message appears when I switch on my laptop which was purchased from a reputable seller with windows 7 pre installed. Is this genuine and what should I do?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Unlikely - but I have heard of one of the rogue AV's which attempts to persuade you that the system is non-genuine.</p>
<p>It's more likely a minor file corruption problem, assuming the installation was genuine in the first place.</p>

<h2>            Probl&#38;&#35;232&#59;me mise a jour</h2>
                    
<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>J'ai acheté une xbox 360 S il y a quelque mois de cela et je viens de me rendre compte que chaque fois que je change de jeu, une mise a jour pour ce jeu est systematiquement demandé meme si j'y ai joué la veille ou dans la journée, tant que je joue au meme
 jeu rien ne m'est demandé mais des que je change de jeu et que je revien au précedent une mise a jour est demandé. Après discussion avec quelques amis sur le live on en a conclu que ce n'était pas normal mais n'avont aucune idée d'ou vient le probleme.</p>
<p>Alors si quelqu'un aurait une idee pour me venir en aide se serai sympa.</p>
<p>Cordialement,</p>

            <p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Le problème vient du fait que le cache système, (espace de stockage dédié aux mises à jour de jeux), est soit corrompu ou trop fragmenté, soit plein.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>La solution consiste à effectuer un vidage de ce cache système pour permettre un bonne ré-écriture des mises à jour, cette manipulation est décrite en détail sur cette page du support :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/fr-fr/pages/xbox-360/troubleshoot/hardware/clear-system-cache.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Vidage du cache système">Vidage du cache système</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Une fois cette opération effectuée, toutes les mises à jour de jeux auront étés effacées, ce qui veut dire que lors de la première insertion de chacun de tes jeux pour lesquels il existe une mise à jour, il te sera demandé de la faire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cordialement</p>
