    <title>How do i fix my UAC to activate windows&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do i fix my UAC to activate windows&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought a license last year which I used on a Virtual Machine.&nbsp; Having now upgraded to Windows 8, I want to use that license (also since it is now useless on a VMware VM due to the incompatibility with Hyper-V</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first upgraded, I was able to get through to the Contact Customer Support / activation screen no problem, but not being during office hours I hadn't got around to calling.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then I have un-installed Norton AV (thinking that might be the cause behind various other issues I've been having, along with incompatible Graphics drivers...!)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now when I try to go through the process of calling customer support in order to transfer the license, I get an error:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>User account control (UAC)&nbsp;has failed to authenticate the user</strong></p>
<p><strong>The error code is <span>0x80080015</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Description: The activation requires a display name to be present under the CLSID key</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This also seems to be preventing me doing a few other things that require admin type rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would REALLY like to find a way around this without having to refresh the install and spend another two days installing VS2012, VS2010, Adobe CS6 and Office!<br />

            Thanks for your detailed response, I have actually since resolved the problem by running a system refresh as I decided it was the only way to quickly overcome all of the problems that I seemed to be having (aside from the activation / UAC issues)
<div><br />
<div>After the refresh, I went through the phone activation process, and subsequently reinstalled all of the applications I needed. &nbsp;Everything is&nbsp;working&nbsp;great now, although I think there are a few drivers missing that are specific to my machine (Samsung&nbsp;Series
 7 Chronos - i7 2.2ghz / 8Gb / 1Tb)</div>

            ello,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the swift response.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>It's happening to just one account in my Windows 10 mail app. The others are working OK&nbsp; although the one that's causing the problems is the most important of them. I can access this account without any problem on the btinternet server, but that's very inconvenient.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The account allowed a few emails through into Window 10 today but then stopped. All very frustrating. It still keeps asking me to sign in.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I wonder if I should try removing the account from Windows and then reinserting it but it's the same as my Microsoft account and I've read somewhere that I shouldn't do that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've made no changes to my laptop and things started to go badly wrong yesterday lunchtime. Previous to that I was frequently being ask to sign in to the account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>I'm up to date with downloads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should add that syncing all accounts in Windows 10 mail seems very slow.</p>
<div><br />
<div>Regards,</div>
<div><br />

            <div><span>Hi, I attempted Option 1 but it when I tried to cut and paste the folder elsewhere it kept telling me that it couldn't do so because
 a file was open. I closed all apps but with the same result each time so I abandoned that approach.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div><span>I went to Option 2 and deleted and re-established the account. It downloaded old emails into my inbox but won't allow new ones although
 they're sitting on my email server and it says it's syncing. (Based on previous experience they may eventually appear in the Windows 10 app.) When I try to create and send an email from the re-established account to another of my accounts the message just
 sits in the Outbox where it may (eventually) or may not get sent. <br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>In addition, I'm sometimes being asked to sign into the account again.
<br />
</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>In account settings it tells me under 'Change mailbox sync settings' that it is 'Syncing your content...' so it appears to
 be trying.<br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>
<p><span>So, all in all, nothing has changed but I'm going to have another go.</span></p>

            <p>Hi, I've tried again and, if anything, the results are worse. I've deleted and re-established the email account following your instructions. This time it won't even download old emails from my server. Here's what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After deleting the account I set it up again using my btinternet password and it appeared to be successful but when I opened up the Windows 10 email app the account had an exclaimation mark in a triangle beside it.&nbsp; Then I got a message across the top of
 the screen saying the account settings were out of date with option to 'Fix Account' or 'Dismiss'. I went to 'fix' and it asked me to update the password for the account, whch I did. I finished up getting an error code 0x80004005. Every time I tried to sync
 the Inbox I got an 'Attention Required' panel to update the password. I rebooted the computer again but this made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you now have enough information to advise me on the next step I should take.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Richard</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PS: Since writing the above I've reset my btinternet password on this account and that seems to have fixed the problem - for now at least!</strong><br />

    <title>0x000000C5 Crash Dumping - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            0x000000C5 Crash Dumping</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, recently my computer has been crashing at random intervals. I have a Toshiba Satellite L455-S5009. It's hardly two months old but I feel I may have a virus already, I'm not sure.</p>
<p>However, when it does crash, the blue screen pops up and says something about the drivers and making sure software is correctly installed-- or something along those lines.</p>
<p>I did get this much though:</p>
<p>Technical information: ***Stop: 0x000000C5</p>
<p>And it would do a crash dump of the physical memory. As far as I know the RAM seems to be fine, as does the harddrive, and overall system. I've done a full scan with Kaspersky and have rebooted, done a chkdsk, and have even gone into safe mode and have deleted
 files that I no longer use. Everything is also up to date. I feel like I'm either missing something or completely overlooking something else.</p>
<p>Help is desperately needed.</p>
<p>P.S. I've checked through the msconfig and have scanned the memory and drives. I'm honestly stumped as to what the problem is. A much detailed explanation would be appreciated. Also, the OS is Windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got the crash dump logs.</p>

 get the above error regarding the kernel debugger. I ran start up repair and says it can not repair the problem. Can't get to safe mode or command promt just loops back to the Kernel debugger error everytime?</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>If you formatted the hard drive then there is no possibility of getting the virus again. I believe that you have might have transferred
 some old data or programs will have virus infection.</span></p>
<p><span>At first, Scan all drives including external storage devices, I would also suggest you to download and run the latest Microsoft
 Safety Scanner on your computer and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></b></a></p>
<div>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<div>I would suggest you to perform last know good configuration from Advanced Boot Options and check.<br />

<p>In order to troubleshoot this issue will run chkdsk from WinRE(Windows Recovery Environment )mode and check for the issue.</p>
<p>You can follow these steps to run CHKDSK :</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span> </span></span></span>Use the Windows 7 DVD to start the computer in Windows Recovery (WinRE).</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span> </span></span></span>In WinRE, open a command prompt. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span> </span></span></span>On the Install Windows screen, select the appropriate Language to install, Time and currency format, and Keyboard or input method options, and then click Next.</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span> </span></span></span>Click Repair your computer.</p>
<p><span><span>e.<span> </span></span></span>Click the Windows 7 installation that you want to repair, and then click Next.</p>
<p><span><span>f.<span> </span></span></span>Click Command Prompt.</p>
<p>At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<b> </b></p>
<p><b>chkdsk drive: /r</b></p>
<p><b>Chkdsk disclaimer:</b></p>
<p>Important: While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>

            <p>Hi TConkling1,</p>
<p>Please take a look at the steps below thanks to an earlier post by <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/457b3ce8-d34d-4115-8baf-04a2d60af08a">
Claude1777</a>:</p>
<p>This solution which I found on another thread seems to have worked:<br />
<br />
"Boot&nbsp;into Safe Mode. Turn the computer off (cold boot), start backup, before operating system loads, press F8 on your keyboard, when the Advanced Boot Options menu appears, use the up and down keys and select Safe Mode.
<br />
<br />
(Booting into safe mode may take several minutes.)<br />
<br />
When booted into Safe Mode, log in, click Start <br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them."<br />
<br />
After that my system acted normally again upon boot-up (at least so far).</p>

            <p>Thanks for the effort but I can not boot into safe mode, I can't boot at all other than the Windows recovery mode. As you see above running chldsk/r in that mode does not work only gives a error.</p>
<p>To recount I was loading windows onto a formatted hard drive and when the laptop restarted as part on the windows installation I got the
</p>
<p>File: \windows\system32\kdcom.dll Status: 0xc0000221 Info: Windows failed to load because the kernel debugger DLL is missing or corrupt</p>
<p>I get the same error trying to boot into safe mode. The only place I can actually do anything is the command promt in the Windows recovery more. But so far nothing I have tried from there has worked.</p>

Hi</p>
<p>Have you ever enabled a French Keyboard on that computer?</p>
<p>Open <strong>Control Panel</strong> and select <strong>Region and Language</strong>. Select the&nbsp;<strong>Keyboards and Languages tab</strong>. Click the
<strong>Change Keyboards </strong>Button.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Installed Services</strong> box, make sure that the only keyboard there is the&nbsp;<strong>EN English</strong> keyboard. If
<strong>any other keyboards</strong> are installed there, make sure that the&nbsp;<strong>EN English Keyboard</strong> is&nbsp;at the
<strong>top of the list</strong>. If it is not at the top,&nbsp;<strong>select it</strong> and click the
<strong>Move Up</strong> button until it is at the top.</p>
<p>Let us know the results.</p>

                    WMP was working fine and then for some reason it stopped playing WMV videos and also stopped playing video for AVI files.&nbsp; I didn't change anything, this happened (seemingly) randomly.&nbsp; I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling&nbsp; Windows Media Player and that
 didn't help.&nbsp; I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling my codecs and that didn't help.&nbsp; I tried the Windows Media Player troubleshooter and that didn't help.&nbsp; I have tried changing the merits on wmvdecod.dll (to at least get WMVs playing) and I can't access
 the codec to change the merit--or--I fail to change the merit when I do have access.&nbsp; When I try to play the sample video "Wildlife in HD", I get the same error I get for all WMV files: "Windows Media Player cannot play the file. The Player might not support
 the file type or a required codec might not be installed on your computer."&nbsp; AVI files play sound only, no video.<br />
<br />

            Okay, no thanks to Microsoft Answers (HELLO?!) I seem to have found a solution to MY problem.&nbsp; Unfortunately, if you're having a similar problem, and you're not using an ATI/AMD video card, I don't have a solution for you.<br />
<br />
When I checked to see if there were new drivers for my video card available, lo and behold, Catalyst 12.4 was released just yesterday (4/25/12).&nbsp; So I uninstalled my current drivers and proceeded to install the latest ones.&nbsp; This is where the solution comes
 into play, apparently.<br />
<br />
SOLUTION: DO NOT INSTALL AMD Accelerated Video Transcoding -OR- AMD Media Foundation Decoders.<br />
<br />
If you are experiencing this problem and for whatever reason don't want to install the latest Catalyst suite/drivers, you can use the Catalyst Uninstaller to specifically remove those two components by going to Start&gt; Control Panel&gt; Programs and Features &gt;
 AMD Catalyst Install Manager and selecting the "Change" option.&nbsp; Hit next, select "Uninstall Manager", hit next again, select "Custom", and hit next again and finally, a list will be generated of all the AMD components you have currently installed on your
 computer.&nbsp; Then it's just a matter of checking off AMD Accelerated Transcoding and AMD Media Foundation Decoders and hitting next.&nbsp; Boom, they get removed and you keep your video driver (and Catalyst Control Center if you're using that).<br />
<br />
On a hunch I decided not to include those two AMD components when I updated my video card drivers and now I can play WMV files and AVI files without any problems.&nbsp; The mpeg video is an unrelated thing, apparently it's just a problem format (AVC1/H.264/MPEG-4
 AVC) which is far less of a concern for me (it plays in Media Player Classic and VLC Player, so whatevs).<br />
<br />
Hopefully this helps some people, I don't claim it will fix everyone's problems with WMP but it's an easy fix (easy to reinstall the AMD components too if it has no effect) and worth a shot.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Solved my problem with the mpeg file too--just renamed the file extension to MP4.&nbsp; Amazingly simple.<br />

<h2>            Copying files from one external drive to another under Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am making a second copy of some files stored on an external hard drive. &nbsp;This drive holds about 1.64 TB (109,282 files, and 1922 folders). &nbsp;When I look at the drive that I copied the folder to, there are only 92,068 files, and 1.32TB. &nbsp;None of the files

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It would be hard to find out what are the remaining files especially if you have very big files. Only one thing that we can assure, once you copy the files again to the same location you will prompted this option&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b959229-071e-49e2-ac76-7aa313a0957b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b959229-071e-49e2-ac76-7aa313a0957b" /></a></p>
<p>First option will copy all the files and replace all the existing files. Second option will skip the option and continue to copy and create a double files. Last option will ask you both in each and every file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 People app&#58; Save contacts to &#34;Microsoft account&#34; vs &#34;Outlook &#40;Mail and Calendar&#41;&#34;</h2>
                    <p>There was the same question here:</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-outlook_mail-winpc/outlook-mail-and-calendar-vs-microsoft-account/d99a5689-4d83-481d-b97d-9cdb0c9bd309</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I think I experience exactly the opposite what is written in the answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I want to save a new contact then I can choose from two options:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>"Microsoft account" &lt;-- literally</li><li>"NameOfMicrosoftAccount (Mail and Calendar)" which is the name of my Microsoft account I added to Mail and Calendar app and also to People app.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If I save a new contact to the 2nd option then I almost immediately can see the new contact at https://outlook.live.com/people/ site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if I save a new contact to the 1st option then it is not available neither on the web nor on my phone.</p>
<p>Additionaly on the Settings page of People app I can sync only the 2nd option because 1st option is not displayed there at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So I would like to know where exactly the contacts are stored if I save them to the 1st option because I can find them nowhere (web, phone, etc.) but only in People app.</strong></p>

            You are signed into Windows using the Microsoft account and they should be saved to the hard drive - i believe under this folder - C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.People_8wekyb3d8bbwe\

<h2>            Windows Mail, Error Code 0x86000112, Something Went Wrong</h2>
                    <p>I am currently using Windows Live Mail 2012 with no problems.&nbsp; I keep getting the message from Microsoft that I must upgrade and use Windows Mail that comes with Windows 10.&nbsp; I have tried on several occasions but I am getting very frustrated.&nbsp; I have read
 many of the similar posts and tried the suggestions but none have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several email accounts and all folders sync in each email account except for my Hotmail.ca account.&nbsp; Most of my folders (approximately 3/4's) in Hotmail.ca account do sync but then I receive an error code 0x86000112.&nbsp; It states "Something went wrong&nbsp;
 We're having a problem syncing your email folders.&nbsp; Change your synchronization schedule or reduce the number of email folders being synced."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the troubleshooter and it says there is nothing wrong.&nbsp; I have changed the sync schedule.&nbsp; I have made sure the Windows Mail version is up to date.&nbsp; I have uninstalled and reinstalled&nbsp;Windows Mail several times but still end up with the error.&nbsp;
 I have tried deleting the account and adding it again but eventually get the same error when syncing folders.&nbsp; I do have several folders but this was never a problem in Windows Live Mail 2012.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Attempting to uninstall Age of Empires 2</h2>
                    I've had Age of Empires 2 and the Conquerors expansion installed for a while and have been able to play it for a long time without problems. Recently however, the game has stopped working at all, and nothing I do works. The only thing that it does is when
 I run the disk the start-up menu appears, but if I try to play it, it crashes giving me the "Has stopped working" message.
<br />
Annoyed, I re-installed both parts of the game a few times to no avail. When I tried to completely uninstall the game, I noticed that there were still some program files left on my hard drive. I tried to delete them, but the computer would not let me, saying
 I didn't have permission (and I'm the administer). <br />
I have also scanned all of these files, the disks, and the entire computer for viruses, but haven't found anything. I'd appreciate any help, as I'm at a lost what to do...

<h2>            Windows store not working while running on a vpn &#38; ticking client for microsoft networks did not work.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello all. The original topic was locked, so this is the only way I can provide this fix.<br />
<br />
I found that windows 10 metro apps/services such as, the windows store, outlook, windows update etc. do not seem to think that there is an internet connection when using the PIA (Privet internet access) VPN. The fix in the forums for this VPN problem was to
 tick the "Client for Microsoft networks" box in my VPN's TAP device properties, but unfortunately, this did not work for me. However, I have managed to fix the problem, and this is what I did that worked for my situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to:&nbsp;Control Panel\Network and Internet\Network Connections</p>
<p>Right-click the TAP network device for your VPN.<br />
Go to properties.<br />
Click Configure.<br />
click the Advanced tab</p>
<p>Select "Media Status"<br />
Change Value to "Always connected"<br />
Click ok.<br />
<br />
Right-click the TAP network device for your VPN again.<br />
Go to properties.<br />
Click "internet services version 4 (TCP/IPv4)"<br />
Click Properties.<br />
Click Advanced.<br />
Tick the "Automatic Metric" boxClick ok.</p>
<p>Click ok.<br />
Click Close.<br />
<br />
Your Windows 10 / Microsoft Metro app services should now have an internet connection.<br />
<br />
Hope this is of help to others.<br />
</p>
<p><br />

<p>This helped, and appears to correct the problem - yes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I found I had to go thru the device manager, selecting the network access devices and then the TAP portion for the VPN appeared. With the media services change done, (and the Auto metric was already clicked), I can access the store OK, thank you Ad-man-gamer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No thanks to the MS support staff however - I was quite unimpressed that in the original 2017 topic we were directed to work the problem with all the VPN providers, and then the topic was closed with an incorrect answer and locked from further commenting.&nbsp;
 That lack of active support is what drives customers away from using products...</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t get to Logon Screen after period sitting idle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david jones_ms  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t get to Logon Screen after period sitting idle</h2>
                    I'm running the RTM build of Win10 on a desktop setup where all of my peripherals are connected through a Dell USB 3.0 Universal dock.&nbsp; It runs great, except I have intermittent problems where after I lock the machine and it sits idle for a while, I cannot
 get back to the Windows logon screen.&nbsp; I know the keyboard is active as the monitor wakes up when I press it, but Windows will not display the logon edit box.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm forced to do a hard reboot of the machine to fix the problem.&nbsp; Any ideas for why this is happening,
 and how to fix/work around it?

            <p>Thanks for the info.&nbsp; As it turned out my installation did have problems, and I had to run SFC and later DISM (and then SFC again) to fix everything.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But in the end, this did not fix the problem above.&nbsp; I did notice something new though:&nbsp; when the monitor comes on, the time and date displayed in the lower left corner are&nbsp;stuck in the past.&nbsp; So whatever component is responsible for displaying the screen
 with the time and date before the logon screen seems to have hung.</p>

            <p>I'd be curious how old is your computer.&nbsp; Most all computers have a cmos battery on the motherboard that holds the time/date when the computer is off.&nbsp; The most used&nbsp;batteries generally last 4 to 5 years ...&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Popular is a somewhat inexpensive shiny chrome larger coin shaped battery, easy to pop out and&nbsp;replace usually - but often in an awkward spot for your fingers to get at.</p>

            The computer's no more than about 2 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't think this is&nbsp;a CMOS battery issue though.&nbsp; The problem is that I cannot get back&nbsp;to the logon screen after the screen saver/screen lock&nbsp;kicks in.&nbsp; The PC is on, I can wake up the monitors by pressing
 the KB/moving my mouse, I see my mouse cursor moving around, but clicks and keyboard presses do not bring me to the logon screen where I can enter my password.&nbsp; What makes this even more puzzling is that the problem is intermittent.&nbsp; Happens maybe 50% of the
 time.

            <p>My machine recently got upgraded to Build 10532, and now the system locks-up and requires a hard reset every time the screen saver kicks in.&nbsp; I was eventually able to work around the problem by opting out of the power management security policy, and then
 disabling the screen saver.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be happy to provide error logs or help diagnose this problem in any way I can.&nbsp; But for now I will simply use the workaround I found to remain productive on this machine at work.</p>

                    <p>I have just received a pop up which claims that my PC has been invaded by a Trojan horse and that my personal data etc is at risk- It seems to come from Microsoft and has come through MS Edge which I don't use normally.&nbsp; The error code it quotes is 0x80070424.
 This means nothing to me. I did call the Toll Free number 0800-014 8984 but there was no answer. Should I be suspicious and how do I remove the pop up&nbsp;which now inhabits my screen. Google Chrome etc work well.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 through 10 causing playback errors. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alyssadefranco  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 through 10 causing playback errors.</h2>
                    <p>My laptop computer always seems to have issues playing videos, whether they're from websites like YouTube, Facebook, or videos that I have stored on my computer that I watch on Windows Media Player. &nbsp;All these problems started when I upgraded my OS from
 the original Windows 8 to later versions of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For YouTube and Facebook, when I click on the video, 9 times out of 10, the video will turn into a grainy grey screen that says "An error occurred. Please try again later." and then leave a playback ID. &nbsp;However, when I finally get the video to load properly
 (after a load of refreshing), when I watch multiple videos in a row everything is fine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I'm using Windows Media Player, when I click on a video that I have on my computer, it will take a long time to load up, and then a new error window will pop up saying the video route "C:\Users\........." and then it will say "Server execution failed."
 &nbsp;I'll click the video again and then it will load properly, but if I wait too long, the error window will pop up again. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These problems always happen when I am using Windows 8.1, 9, or 10. &nbsp;It eventually became a major problem because there are a lot of videos I need to watch for my University classes, so I backed everything up from my computer and reverted my computer back
 to it's factory settings (it's factory settings started with Windows 8). &nbsp;On Windows 8, everything is fine! &nbsp;Videos play normally and load almost immediately! &nbsp;So I was going to stay with Windows 8, but the computer automatically updated me to Windows 8.1
 again. &nbsp;So, what I am looking for is either a way to stop the playback errors in 8.1 (I'm not going back to 10, I hated it), or a way to stop automatic Windows OS updates. &nbsp;I tried stopping the computer from automatically updating important updates and to
 check with me first, but I don't think it worked.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If I can't find a solution for Windows 8.1, I'll revert to 8.0 again and try the "Never check for updates" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For troubleshooting the Windows Media Player, nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There shouldn't be anything like malware on my computer or anything that's corrupting files because I just restored the computer to it's factory settings. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>More Shadow Brokers Exploits Patched June 2017 for Win XP and Vista - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> great white north  say:</h3>
<h2>            More Shadow Brokers Exploits Patched June 2017 for Win XP and Vista</h2>
                    <p>Extended support for Vista SP2 ended on 11-Apr-2017, but Microsoft has taken the unusual step of releasing out-of-band security updates in June 2017 to patch vulnerabilities for three additional NSA-leaked exploits (<strong>EnglishmanDentist, EsteemAudit
 and ExplodingCan</strong>) for older operating system like Win XP and Vista.<br />
<br />
See Woody Leonhard's 13-Jun-2017 Computerworld article <em><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/3200765/windows-pcs/theres-a-reason-microsoft-is-patching-windows-xp-again-this-month.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">There's a reason Microsoft
 is patching Windows XP again this month</a></em> as well as the June 2017 blog entry on the Microsoft Security Response Center subtitled
<em><a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/msrc/2017/06/13/june-2017-security-update-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft releases additional updates for older platforms to protect against potential nation-state activity</a></em> for additional
 information.<br />
<br />
The five new security updates for Vista SP2 are listed in Tables 2 and 3 of the <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4025687/microsoft-security-advisory-4025685-guidance-for-older-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Security Advisory 4025685: Guidance for Older Platforms: June 13, 2017</a></strong>.&nbsp; These
 updates were not delivered via Windows Update and must be installed manually using .msu offline installers.<br />
<br />
Download links are included in Advisory 4025685 and installers were also posted on the Microsoft Update Catalog in June 2017 at the following links:<br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KB4018271</strong> (<em>Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 9: May 9, 2017</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4018271%20Vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; KB4019204</strong> (<em>Security Update for the Windows Win32k Information Disclosure Vulnerability: May 9, 2017</em>)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4019204%20Vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
Install these security updates as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Disable automatic Windows Updates [Windows Update | Change settings | Important updates |
<strong>Never check for updates (not recommended)</strong>] and <strong>re-boot </strong>
to terminate any Windows Update session currently running in the background.</li><li>Download the offline .msu installers and save them to your Windows desktop.&nbsp; Use the Vista x86 installer if you have a 32-bit OS; use the Vista x64 installer if you have a 64-bit OS.</li><li>Double-click each .msu file on your desktop to start the installation and restart your computer when prompted after the installer is finished.</li></ol>
<p>Once all missing updates are installed you can reset your automatic Windows Updates back to your preferred setting.
</p>
<p>____________________________________________<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All Vista SP2 computers that were fully patched as of 11-Apr-2017 should have received the earlier updates listed in Table 1 of the advisory.&nbsp; This includes security update
<strong>KB4012598</strong> (<em>MS17-010: Security Update for Microsoft Windows SMB Server, March 14, 2017</em>) to protect against the
<strong>EternalBlue</strong> exploit used in the recent Shadow Broker <strong>WannaCry / WannaCrypt</strong> ransomware attacks.<br />
<br />
To confirm that KB975517 (rel. Oct 2009), KB2347290 (rel. Sep 2010) and KB4012598 (rel. Mar 2017) were installed by Windows Update go to Control Panel | Programs | Programs and Features |
<strong>View Installed Updates</strong> and search for the full KB number in the search box (e.g., "KB4012598" and not a partial string like "4012598").<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/791c5f63-1606-442d-b121-d2d7c3c0474c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/791c5f63-1606-442d-b121-d2d7c3c0474c" /></a><br />
<br />
If you are missing any of these older updates, please note that many Vista SP2 users are currently affected by a problem where the initial
<strong>"<em>Checking for updates...</em>" phase of Windows Update can hang for several hours</strong> (or even days) while the Windows Update Agent searches for available updates.&nbsp; See the instructions posted on page 1 of m#l's thread
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-update/updates-not-working-it-has-been-searching-for/92cd6922-17f6-4730-b46b-91a480b95dd3"><em><strong>Updates not working, it
 has been searching for updates for hours</strong></em></a> for a possible workaround that should help speed up Windows Update and ensure that all security updates released as of 11-Apr-2017 are also installed on your system.</p>

            &nbsp;Nice to know that with all that Microsoft has to deal with that they care about security. Personally I hate to see these old operating systems not supported anymore as they contain unique learning experiences as well as memories. Thank You for the critical
 support and yes automatic updates installed older patches to Vista which is still running strong for me. I downloaded the newer ones today.<br />

<p>Hi Great White North</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks so much for this wonderful post! I have successfully installed the 5 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm interested in the line that reads, specifically, "confirm that KB975517 (rel. Oct 2009) had been installed". I don't have that update installed, but my research also shows that it has been superseded twice. I don't have the superseded updates either.
 The last supersede that I can see is KB980232 from April 2010. The prior one was KB978251. I'm not finding any supersede updates on this since, but I don't have any of the 3 that I mentioned.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I simply download and install KB980232? Or are you aware of more supersede updates for KB975517?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi joezapp:<br />
<br />
I searched my installed updates at Control Panel | Programs | Programs and Features |
<strong>View Installed Updates</strong> and confirmed that KB975517 was installed on my 32-bit Vista SP2 machine on 14-Oct-2009, so it's possible that your operating system was originally installed (or re-installed) after that date and never received that particular
 update.</p>

</p><p><strong>KB3177186</strong> (<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms16-114" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>MS16-114</strong></a><em>: Security Update for Windows SMBv1 Server: September 13, 2016</em>) appears to be the last update
 in the supersedence chain, so search your installed updates for "KB3177186" and see if it is already installed (I confirmed KB3177186 was automatically installed on my system with my other September 2016 Patch Tuesday updates).&nbsp; If not, download the correct
 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) .msu installer from the following link and see if it installs successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB3177186%20Vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB3177186 Vista</a><br />
<br />
In your case, I assume the .msu installer for the old KB975517 would simply throw a "<strong><em>not applicable</em></strong>" error since it has been superseded (replaced) by newer updates per the MS support article
<em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3057448/-the-update-is-not-applicable-to-your-computer-error-when-you-install-windows-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"The update is not applicable to your computer" error when you install Windows
 updates</a></em>.</p>

</p><p>&nbsp;I seem to have both KB975517&nbsp; and&nbsp; KB3177186 installed I suppose the newer patch would not uninstall the older ones? And will this affect performance in any way?&nbsp; I did install the 5 newer patches described above and everything is working fine. Again Thanks
 for the tip and help as these security threats can cause many problems.</p>

</p><p>Hi Stephen V Coppola:</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, it's normal to have both those updates listed in your install updates&nbsp;(Control Panel | Programs | Programs and Features | View Installed Updates) if you have an older Vista SP2 machine that was built prior to November 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If KB975517 was installed on your system you don't have to worry that a newer update in the supersedence chain would uninstall this update and leave your system exposed to the SMB vulnerabilities described in security bulletin
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms09-050" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MS09-050</a>. Think of newer updates in the chain like KB2536275 or KB3177186 as "new and improved" versions that will install updated versions of some of the system files delivered with the older KB975517.&nbsp; KB975517 is just the "minimum" update you need to
 be protected.<br />
<br />
All these supersedence chains are checked by the Windows Update Agent when you run a Windows Update.&nbsp; If you haven't run Windows Update for several months (or have a fresh reinstall of Vista SP2) the Windows Update Agent will check the supersedence chain of
 each update that is missing from your system and will only install the newest update in each chain to make the update process more efficient.

<p>Hi Great White North,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I successfully ran Windows Update on my Vista (SP2) 64-bit system on 10/01/17, and I think I'm fully patched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two (2) of the June 2017 out-of-band security updates (KB4018271 and KB4019204) were offered and installed through Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other three (3) out-of-band security updates (KB4018466, KB4021903, KB4024402) were NOT offered by Windows Update, nor have they been installed on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you think I need KB4018466, KB4021903 and KB4024402?&nbsp; I downloaded them from the Microsoft Update Catalog, in case I need them, but I'm apprehensive about installing them.&nbsp; Can those three (3) updates do any harm to my PC?</p>
<p>
Thanks.</p>
