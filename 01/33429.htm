I am using Vista 32 bit. I started to see this problem when I recently copy some pictures from a SD card.<br />

When adding pictures to Vista Picture folder it creates a HIDDEN folder of the same name with two copies of same picture in it<br />
<br />
I have view hidden files enabled in folder options.<br />

Any help is appreciated.

<h3> eddyortiz1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for Business crashing &#40;has stopped working&#41;</h2>
                    <p>We recently ran into a problem with Skype crashing for one specific user. We tried recreating the profile, reinstalling Office2016 and the issue continued. We had tried multiple things and almost called the situation an OS reload since it was behaving so
 odd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Compare registry key to a working profile/computer:&nbsp;Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case I noticed it was missing a lot of information and before it started working there was a REG_SZ with&nbsp;WindowsAccountSipUri - Double click that entry and make sure the correct email account with no spaces at the end is entered. Skype should now open
 successfully. After a successful sign in the data under the registry path above will change completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have any questions and I will be happy to assist.</p>

<p>Hi EddyOrtiz1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description, we know this issue (Skype for Business crash issue) was resoloved by "Compare registry key to a working profile/computer: Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync", and we need make sure&nbsp;&nbsp;correct email account
 with no spaces at the end is entered. we need notice the "REG_SZ with WindowsAccountSipUri".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your sharing.</p>

 the beginning few seconds off of the music file?<br />
<br />
Also, how can I stretch the time for each image showing?&nbsp; They are at the default of 5 seconds and I would like to make them about 6 or 7.<br />

=================================<br />
In Timeline view...left click (select) the Audio/Music <br />
track and drag the Playback Indicator (vertical line)<br />
to the point where you wish to split the Audio file.<br />
Type...Ctrl+L...to split the file and then right click/<br />
delete the unwanted portion. Finally...drag the remaining <br />
segment to the left so it will match up with the Photo.<br />
<br />
As for duration:<br />
<br />
The setting change at: Tools / Options /<br />
Advanced tab...only applies to clips added<br />
to the timeline *after* you change the setting.<br />
<br />
If you switch to 'Storyboard' view and select<br />
all the clips as a batch (select one and type...<br />
Ctrl+A)...you can add the "Speed Up, Double"<br />
or "Slow Down, Half" effect to change the<br />
duration. Just select all the clips / right click<br />
the Effect and from the menu...choose...<br />
Add To Storyboard.<br />
<br />
"Speed Up, Double" cuts the duration in half.<br />
<br />
"Slow Down, Half" doubles the duration.<br />
<br />
These effects can be added up to six times.<br />
<br />
If you need a more accurate adjustment...<br />
the following info might be useful:<br />
<br />
You can change the duration for each clip<br />
manually. Move your pointer around on the<br />
edge of a clip until you see a double red<br />
arrow. Now drag the double red arrow...<br />
you'll see a tooltip that shows the duration<br />
changing.<br />
<br />
Or...just redo the project after you change<br />
the duration at: Tools / Options / Advanced<br />
tab.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I have been running the Windows 10 Preview Build for a while and i decided to reset my PC to start out clean, Once the process was finished i am getting an INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE blue screen after 15-20 secs of appearing to load the OS, the setup is as
 follows.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>i7-4930k</p>
<p>16GB DDR3</p>
<p>2x GTX 970 4GB</p>
<p>2x 240GB SSD(RAID 0)[boot drive](irst mode)</p>
<p>WD 2TB HDD</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially upgraded from 8.1 to 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any input on the issue at hand?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community. I would be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description of the issue, I understand that the computer fails to load the Operating System. The Stop message
<strong>INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE</strong> indicates that Windows&nbsp;lost access to the system partition during the startup process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting, I&nbsp;would suggest you to disconnect all the external peripheral devices except for the keyboard and mouse and check if the issue still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know the status of the issue. If it still persists, we would be&nbsp;happy to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>
<p>

            I ended up downloading the iso and using a third party program called Rufus to make the drive. Granted this was on an old laptop running xp since my main desktop was down. Should work on a surface too.

<h2>            You require permission from yourself to make changes to this file.</h2>
                    <p>I have an external hard drive. I am the only one who uses it. I need to move the files on it to another external.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to move everything except a handful of images that keep telling me I need permission from myself to copy them. I don't understand why Microsoft does this. They are MY files. It is MY external drive. I am the OWNER of all folders and files on the
 drive. I even reset the Ownership.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed post after post after post in this forum trying to get these files copied over, to no avail. There HAS to be a solution. I can't format the drive until I move the files. PLEASE HELP.</p>

<p>That's very odd. &nbsp;Are you still able to open the files and use them in other ways?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've already made sure that your name is listed as the owner on these specific files (which is good), have you also already granted yourself the 'full control' checkmark?</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I await your reply, let me suggest running a disk check to repair broken NTFS values on the file system:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open the "Computer" window</li><li>Right-click on the drive in question</li><li>Select the "Tools" tab</li><li>In the Error-checking area, click &lt;Check Now&gt;.</li><li>Choose to scan for bad sectors as well</li></ol>

<p>Ok I ran the disk check that you suggested above. It said the drive was scanned successfully and it found no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to just open an image file (jpg) and it told me, "Windows Photo Viewer can't open this picture because you don't have the correct permissions to access the file location."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to try to reboot into Safe Mode and see what I can do. I will be back shortly to provide my findings.</p>

<p>Just to confirm:&nbsp; Are you operating as the Administrator account on this PC?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior is what one normally encounters if they operate a Standard User account requiring permissioning everything with the Admin password.&nbsp; It's the main reason I don't recommend this, as well as the fact that Windows installs as the Admin account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
To be sure Take Ownership executed correctly, install it to the right click context menu from
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Take Ownership Shortcut</a> then right click the external drive to Take Ownership.&nbsp;&nbsp; This applies blanket permission.&nbsp; Do not use it on C drive, however.</p>

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I am admin. I am admin on the network also and I am using my network login. The User accounts on each computer are also admins and I can't do it under that either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your shortcut to add Take Ownership to the right-click menus. It didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither did Safe Mode. I was able to copy over one file (autorun.inf) that NEVER copies over but not the ones I really needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas? It's just stupid that it keeps telling me that I need permission from myself. It's very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jessica</p>

<p>Jessica, it demonstrates a level of OS or drive corruption that is concerning since an Admin should always be able to copy files wherever you want.&nbsp; At most it might load slowly the first time as it assigns a recognized Admin permissions across the board.&nbsp;

<p>Well I plugged the drive into our server, logged in as server administrator, and still wasn't able to move the files. So I don't think it's my computer that really has the problem. It's something about this drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed something today. The file and folder names that I can't copy are green. Everything else has black text. One of the folders I can't move is called New Folder (2) and the words New Folder (2) are in green text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Google search and I found that it means Windows thinks the file is encrypted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://www.andyrathbone.com/2012/01/30/why-does-windows-show-my-file-names-in-green-letters/</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting an Access Denied message when I try to uncheck the box so I am going to try to reboot into Safe Mode and see if I can do it there.</p>

<p>From what I remember, Microsoft Points can only be used with the XBOX 360 and not Windows 8 or the Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How and where will be the right place is up to you.&nbsp; Just as what you select to purchase.&nbsp; Find things that interest you within the XBOX Marketplace and purchase items with the points.&nbsp; Could be songs for games, could be DLC, could just be avatar items.&nbsp;

            <p>I've no idea; I was was just trying to prevent you wasting any more time on it.</p>
<p>The fact that it is getting worse suggests&nbsp;it might be a hardware problem. You could experiment with older graphics drivers.</p>

<p>I hope someone can give you more assistance.</p>

            <p>Hey guys, major problem and no FIX has been brought about for more than 2 years, Media Center Recorded TV Shows Duplicate Entries, e.g.,&nbsp;recorded WinTV shows appear as duplicates in the Public Recorded TV directory folder. And only in that directory.<br />
<br />
I share the recorded TV directory so I can watch TV on my 60 inch TV, so I moved the shows that I usually watch in there.&nbsp; I put them in the Recorded TV directory, but when I go to the Recorded TV in Media Center, it shows them twice.&nbsp; To be clear, it is not
 showing one local and one remote copy, it is showing a duplicate, i.e., Media Center is showing two listings for each file.&nbsp; But,&nbsp;if I delete one, they both disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to search for a solution, but searching for Media Center duplicate files&nbsp;just returns a bunch of posts on how to find and delete duplicate recordings.&nbsp; I did manage to find one old post on another forum that describes the problem many others are
 having,&nbsp; but no one has found a fix.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try to explain it better.&nbsp; My PC in the living room is hooked to a TV.&nbsp; I record and watch TV in there.&nbsp; When I start Media Center the files that are on the HD show up twice in the Recorded TV directory.&nbsp; When I look at the recorded TV in Media Center,
 I see&nbsp;the same one&nbsp;listed twice.&nbsp; The synopsis of both episodes are identical, I have the option to play and delete both.&nbsp; If I watch one and stop it in the middle, I have play, resume and delete.&nbsp; If I look at the duplicate entry, it is still just play and
 delete.&nbsp; If I delete either of them, they both disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It only seems to do it with files in the \Users\Public\Recorded TV directory.&nbsp;&nbsp;I created a Recorded TV directory in the root of the drive and moved the files there.&nbsp; I added that directory to the media library.&nbsp; Now everything shows up correctly.&nbsp; If I move
 one to \Users\Public\Recorded TV, it will show up twice again only&nbsp;in Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another person has written on other posts: </p>
<p>I have the same issue, but I'm storing all my recorded TV into a Recorded TV file I created on a secondary hard drive. It's the lone storage location for WIMC7. Every entry shows up twice. And, for what it's worth, the F:/Recorded TV folder is NOT included
 in the list of other libraries, so that rules THAT out. But my problem is the same. I can play from either entry, but delete one and the other one disappears, too. There is no second recording of the program anywhere. This happens on my Win 7 x64 machine only.
 I have another Win 7 32-bit machine built specifically to be a DVR on steroids. Locally recorded programs on it are also stored on a secondary hard drive. It does not display duplicate entries under Recorded TV in Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 7 "library" only points to the F: drive. No subfolders. And, within Win 7's "libraries" each program on the F: drive is only listed once. The WMC "Media Libraries" does not contain a reference to the F: drive as that's the default recording storage
 point. Trust me, I already thought of that during setup and did not put a pointer to the F: drive in there. The MCE "Media Libraries" only points to other computers on the network where programs are also recorded. And, no, the same program is not being recorded
 on two different machines. Hmm. Possible clue. While attempting to double-check my "Media LIbraries" I'm getting an error "Windows Media Center is missing a necessary component. Restart media center" or words to that effect. EDIT: rebooting windows solved
 that. And no entry in WMC's "Media Libraries" points to the default recording drive. Yet every show that's there is listed twice in "Recorded TV".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am seeing this tonight too and here is my take on why it is happening:</p>
<p>I have been recording to D:\Recorded TV.&nbsp; My D: drive had a bunch of old junk on it that Windows would not let me delete (Administrator nonsense) so I moved all of my recordings to different drives while I did a full reformat of D: and also told WMC to record
 to the C: Drive.&nbsp; From there new recordings went in that users\public\public record tv path or whatever it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never thought to tell WMC this to remove D: from my library.&nbsp; When the drive was done I went into WMC and told it to use D: as my recorded tv storage folder.&nbsp; Thats when I began noticing the dual entries on newly recorded shows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved the recorded storage back to C:, and then went to remove D: from my recorded tv library.&nbsp; Low and behold there were two D:\recorded tv entries there.&nbsp; Deleting both of them still left one copy of the new programs in my Recorded TV library in WMC,
 even though I told WMC not to look there anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted my computer and they were both still showing up with the rest of the recorded tv programs.&nbsp; I moved them both out of the folder and then deleted the D:\Recorded TV folder (remember I already told WMC not to look there anymore).&nbsp; At this point
 they do not show up with the recorded programs in WMC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went into WMC and told it to record to the D: drive.&nbsp; WMC would have to now create a Record TV folder on that drive since I deleted it in the last step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I began recording a few things to see if the entries were duped and it does not seem like that is happening now.&nbsp; I will report back if I see a second entry after the shows are over, but from what I was experiancing earlier it was showing a fully recorded
 program along with one entry that was currently recording.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem. I went into manage libraries and went into add folder and looked at the folders already added and my folder on my external drive was listed twice. e:\Recorded TV I went into remove folder and it wasn't there, because I went in there
 earlier and removed all entries. So there is no way to remove the double entry. &nbsp;I am going to try changing the drive letter for the hard drive. Will let you know if that fixes the problem.... Otherwise it's GREYED OUT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesnt work consider changing your recorded tv storage space in wmc, and then moving everything out of that twice listed recorded tv folder (just move it to another folder on the same drive).&nbsp; You cannot remove the folder wmc records to, which is
 why you cannot remove it.&nbsp; if you change that, move your recordings out of it, delete it, and then tell wmc to record there again (thus having wmc create the folder) you should be back in business.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed this one playing around. I share my "Recorded TV" folder via home group. And when I go into Media Center -&gt; Recorded TV, and cursor over to "shared", I see my pc listed. If I then select "all computers", I get duplicates showing in recorded TV.
 If I cursor back to "shared" and select "recorded tv", the duplicates disappear.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Surface Laptop - 4G&#47;LTE Option&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys</p>
<p>I just ordered the new Microsoft Surface Laptop with the hope it had a 4G/LTE sim card slot so I can use my data sim card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it doesn't seem to have the option (how dumb). Can anyone confirm whether there will be a model release with it?<br />
<br />
I'm going to cancel my order now - was so looking forward to it too and had it on pre-order for weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks<br />

<p>Well, now you know to scroll down the web page and read the technical specifications.&nbsp; No SIMM card slot was mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface Pro tablet will have a LTE model come out later this year if you can wait.&nbsp; As for the laptop itself, if you have a mobile phone with hotspot capability, the laptop can use it like a router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking to getting one of the&nbsp; laptops myself and is getting good reviews from reviewers, especially the keyboard and touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SIMM card slots are not a standard feature on devices but some companies are starting to add them to laptops and tablets in the past year and would expect to see them become a standard in a year or two.&nbsp; Read the specs before buying and will save you a lot
 of money.&nbsp; USB-C is not there either but had heard that Microsoft is going to have a dongle for USB to USB-C which can be used for both data and power (for at least the Pro model) and not sure if it would work on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The docking station is also supposed to be compatible even though not listed.&nbsp; Keep and eye on the online store for updates on those.</p>

 But I have watched the troubleshoot capability video and tried both of those options. And the problem still exsists I am running an Emachines EL1850 Intel Celeron 450 @ 2.20 GHz and 2 GB Ram 64 Bit OS on Cable Net.

We are using the latest build of Windows 10. Our AD schema has been upgraded to server 2012 R2. I have confirmed the GPO is being applied, it just doesn't seem to be doing what it says it should do.

            <p>They are selling Windows 10 at a very steep discount from the normal retail pricing of $199. Thats a too good to be true pricing. They are likely reselling MSDN or Technet licenses. I would definitely avoid it&nbsp;and buy directly from the Microsoft Store:</p>
<p>

<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys </p>
<p>They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose
 is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside
 of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses
 it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere
 along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.</p>

            Thanks for the reply, it looked a bit too good to be true ... now what is the best way to check a license is genuine when like in my case you bought your pc in a south American country where you never know what you are buying ... ? I am asking because
 even in "trustworthy" shop you get pc or laptop without even a recovery cd ?

    <title>It is the Error 1935 again, installing Norton Ghost on Windows 7 64bit - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            It is the Error 1935 again, installing Norton Ghost on Windows 7 64bit</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I say "again" because this is a rather often asked question, alas with no workable solutions.</p>
<p>I installed Norton Ghost 15 on this machine 3 years ago. No problems. Today, when firing up Ghost, it suddenly want to run the MSI installer for some reason, and then complains about something. Unfortunately I did not make a copy of the error. I just uninstalled
 it completely, using the Symantec Removal Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to install Norton Ghost again, I get this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b9e295c-6bce-4b88-a31d-57e5bfc8c441" /></p>
<p>I have unchecked .Net framework 3.5 in Windows features, restarted, checked them again and restarted. I have installed the Microsoft C++ 2005 and 2008 Redistributable. This I did because another post was suggesting doing this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also turned on the verbose log feature in Windows installer, and get a huge file chock full of data, which doesn't tell me anything I can use. Yes, something went wrong, but in this (these) file(s) there is no particular section which stands out in
 a way that tells me what actually went wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, say, isn't it possible to get some information in plain English? Telling me what Assembly is missing, what file is missing, and so on. Because obviously something isn't there that should be there, which was present 3 years ago, when installing Norton
 Ghost went flawless. <br />
<br />
Or, is it something else? <em>"An error occurred during the installation of assembly component"</em>, what component? And what is normally the cause for such problem, what goes normally wrong when an assembly component cannot be installed? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><br />
My question basically goes like this:</strong></p>
<p>How can I find out what the real error is? What assembly is missing, what feature is missing? The hit and miss approach is not tempting to me, there has to be a scientific way to approach this!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help, appreciated!</p>
<p>-Ingvar</p>

            <p>Ok, I have found the solution:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.symantec.com/connect/forums/norton-ghost-14-installation-fails-error-1935" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Error 1935 solved</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically - just install Ghost until the error message pops up. Do NOT click OK, Instead, use task manager or much better, SysInternals Procedure Monitor to kill all windows msi installer processes and all that has anything to do with Norton.</p>
<p>Ghost 15 is now installed, and you can register and use it.</p>
<p>Problem is, there is a pending rollback, which will be executed the next time you want to install (any) application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete these registry keys:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Installer\</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">InProgress</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">and</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Installer\</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">InProgress\</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Rollback</span></p>
<p>Now everything should be fine, at least it look so here!</p>
<p>Case closed.</p>

<h3> igordefaye  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Black screen even in safe mode, repair or reinitialize fail</h2>
                    <p>I have followed many threads to try to fix this issue. None work.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For no reason windows 10 pro got a black screen after a reboot. Since then the only mode that works is safe mode with command line.</p>
<p>Starting in regular safe mode, with low video mode, etc... nothing works.</p>
<p>I've tried uninstalling the latest driver installed on windows, but that did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows starts, I see the login screen, but when I log in, even with admin account, I see the cursor, but the rest it totaly blank.</p>
<p>I've unplug everything but keyboard, mouse and monitor. </p>
<p>I've tried two different monitors same issue. </p>
<p>I've tried windows+ctrl+shift+b : beeps, but that's it.</p>
<p>I've tried windows+p I see windows changing display mode, but screen always black with only cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to repair, .... windows fails to repair</p>
<p>I've tried to reinitialize windows, it fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried launch Windows 10 installation media installer from command line, but only get the splash screen, but nothing displays.</p>
<p>If I try to launch from boot the windows 10 installation media it ask for a key I don't have (will need to get it from commandline), if I do install without key, it says it can't it must be launched when windows is started....</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really bad as it gets in terms of getting a pro version of windows. What else can microsoft propose that will fix their issue without me needing to reset everything from scratch ?</p>

            Hello there,
<br />Please do you mind to explain me with more detail what the issue is?
<br />
<br />The laptop came with a DVD drive?
<br />Go to Device Manager on the Start button
<br />Under DVD drive see if  has a driver installed and working

<p>I'm not sure. It's just a list of a lot of things, but DVD drive is not one of them.</p>

            Hi ecto
<br />
<br />The Dell Inspirion 15 3000 sometimes just comes with a blank DVD cover, the model with that cover does not actually have a DVD drive in the specification . . .
