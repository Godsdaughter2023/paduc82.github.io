<h2>            Skype Group Call Failing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p><br />
I have been using Skype group video calls for a long time now and all of a sudden it has stopped allowing us to make group calls. It allows me to connect to one person and then drops any of the other callers out of the call. Please advise<br />

    <title>Assassins Creed and Hitman have stopped working, is there a fix&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the_inventor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Assassins Creed and Hitman have stopped working, is there a fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Assassin's Creed I, II, and Brotherhood, Hitman: Silent Assassin, Hitman:Blood Money, Hitman:Contracts, and the original Hitman:Codename 47.&nbsp; Right now only one out the seven will load and play, but it is the only program, the only&nbsp;one that does not
 show up on the list of installed programs, the one being Codename 47.</p>
<p>These games used to work just fine until Ubisoft upgraded the Game launcher software to 2.x and now all of my games that are installed have stopped working and fail to finish loading.&nbsp; They claim that the launcher would launch other programs on the PC besides
 their software.&nbsp; Now none of them work, including others games that are not from Ubisoft.&nbsp; I have tried CCleaner, uninstalling, then reinstalling, etc.&nbsp;to no avail.&nbsp; They seem to have changed some of the basic files within the Win7 Pro OS that I am using.&nbsp;
 It is very frustrating, and have wasted more time trying to nail down trying to find the changes that were made.&nbsp; Short of a new install of Win7Pro, which would clear out all of the software I have installed and if I do that I may as well just wipe out the
 whole hard drive and then start from scratch, which I don't really want to do.&nbsp; I am afraid if I go a buy a new game that uses the high end graphics capabilities of my CPU and GPU, that it won't work either and will just be wasting my money and time as well.&nbsp;
 Is there any real help for this issue other than star from scratch???&nbsp; </p>
<p>I built my own from off the shelf components, it is a Wintel system, ASUS mother board and video card (ATI 1GB), Intel i7 quad core 950 3.07GHz, Win7Pro, 6GB of DDR3 RAM, etc.&nbsp; just one notch below extreme, built when the 950 had just been out for a month
 or 2.&nbsp; It has been, and still is, working just fine.&nbsp; Somehow the files in the OS seem to have been changed.&nbsp; All other software such as AutoCAD, and other graphic rendering software, is working fine.</p>

            So, I gather one feature the Ubisoft launcher is supposed to keep you from having to be on line when playing the games ?<br />
Are all these games Steam downloads or are they a mix of disk and download ?<br />
<br />
Have you tried disabling your Ainti-Virus ?<br />
<br />
I still don't think the 'launcher' messes with Windows it's just a buggy application and is possibly conflicting with something else.<br />
You could try running via Clean Boot to see if there are conflicts.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a>
<br />
<br />
If there is no joy from the above, and the game specific forums (I see there are a lot of&nbsp; entries when doing a web search regarding the Ubisoft Launcher ) still don't provide a fix I would be inclined to do another system restore and uninstall the game and
 either return it or wait until Ubisoft&nbsp; sort out the 'Launcher'.<br />
<br />
Quite right -&nbsp; EIDOS <br />
<br />
You're not wrong. Start focusing on customer satisfaction and service instead of treating honest customers like the enemy, but sadly Ubisoft is not alone in this attitude, it's pervasive throughout the gaming 'industry'.<br />
Another reason for the bad attitude of computer software vendors is the people<br />
in government don't understand computers and let the software vendors get<br />
away with things that other mfg's can't&nbsp; when it comes to marketing a faulty product.
<br />
Here in Oz we can return a store bought game that wreaks havoc on<br />
out machine as this game is doing to yours ( not offering an alternative to not installing the launcher being an abrogation of our rights), as anything that does not work as intended or designed is deemed faulty,&nbsp; but dealing with an on line<br />
provider such as Steam is a minefield with little viable protection by consumer law.<br />
<br />
Steam games can be a problem. What I hated about Steam before getting Broadband (only about 18mos ago) was having to update the game before playing. Even off line.
<br />
I was unable to play FEAR2 (bought on disk) for nine months because of the huge (just under 2GB) patch. When HL2 came out it took, I don't even want to remember how long, to be able to play the game for the same reason.<br />
&nbsp;I should have returned FEAR2 (HL2 came with a gpu) but I new that I would have to get Broadband in the end.&nbsp; so I didn't bother.<br />
Fortunately Steam is pretty well sorted out these days. As long as you have <br />
Broadband and allow Steam to do as it wishes regarding Steam Client and game updates when you do launch Steam while on line, then playing games<br />
from Steam off line is no problem.<br />
The new kids on the block are still going though a, 'lets make the consumer a <br />
BETA test Guinea Pig while we try to emulate Steam' phase.<br />
GFWL (not exactly new) is still a big hassle that I wish would just go away<br />
&nbsp;(in my dreams ).<br />
EA's Origin, from what I've read is not a lot of fun for some either.<br />

<h2>            &#34;Safely Remove Hardware&#34; icon mising in the action center.</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: <strong>How to get Icon Back on Task Bar for "Ok disconnect USB Hardware"?</strong><br />
<br />
Ok I have Window 7 Professional installed for about 2 weeks.&nbsp; When I had a Mem Stick plugged in or anyother USB device, I could go to the Taskbar and select an Icon which ask which device I wanted to remove.&nbsp; I made selection and it replied "OK to remove device/hardware"
 Now for some reason I no longer have that Icon/option even in the HIDDEN area.&nbsp; How do I get this option/Icon back on the Taskbar and where would it/program/Icon be in Windows 7 when it is not on the Taskbar?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gokul and Ross,</p>
<p>Here is how it works in Windows 7 x64 Professional.&nbsp; I made sure that I had ACPI set at V.3 in BIOS.&nbsp; Next I plugged in a pocket flash drive.&nbsp; I looked at the drive (H:) in Windows Explorer and saw it had an "Eject" ? choice.&nbsp; I clicked on the "Eject" and
 the "Safe to Remove Hardware" Icon appeared with the device / flash drive (H:) was safe to remove.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            My Xbox 360 Slim 250gb Hard Drive not recognized</h2>
                    
<pre>My XBOX 360 is a 4GB Slim. I bought an HD original Microsoft 250gb last year and until 07/04, everything was fine. But last friday (07/05) when I turned my xbox on (17:00 pm), a LIVE update came in. I accepted it, however soon after it completed, I realized I had no profile for me to log in (I had about three profiles in my HD, including my main account). I found it very strange, and then went to see if I had my games downloaded and everything was gone. I checked the storage devices and my HD was not there, it wasn't being recognized. I already took it off and put it on again and NOTHING. I am very upset because I called Microsoft support and they told to buy other HD! But what happens with my game and my saves that were there? This is stressing me out a lot because all I had (including saves and on demand games) was there. I've downloaded my profile again and it's working fine, but I lost everything. All is lost or is there a solution?<br />I know that there is an update for those who signed up for Beta

<p>I had this problem about 2 months ago. To fix it what I did was took apart my Xbox and removed the hard drive. Then took a can of air and cleaned it good then put it back and it worked fine. Hope this helped :)</p>

            <p>Hey there Thais!<br /><br />I'm sorry to hear about your HDD issues. Let's see what we can do to get things sorted.<br /><br /><strong>My first suggestion is to (if you get your HDD working again) move any games saves and such that you can't redownload to either <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/13/t/156009.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Cloud Storage</a> or a different storage device like a <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">USB drive</a> just to keep them safe.</strong><br /><br />Things like your profile, any DLC you've purchased, as well as any Games on Demand games, and Apps are all able to be redownloaded from your Download History; so I wouldn't worry about saving them.<br /><br /><strong>Next, if you're part of any preview programs, you'll want to make a post in <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/beta-2013/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow

<p>You can re-download your history by going to settings on your xbox. Then go to account, and finally download history. From there it will have everything you downloaded from the market place. But all your saved game data is lost. When you get it working,
 you should use the cloud to store some of your data. hope this helps.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SORRY I didn't see there was already an suggestion for the cloud already.</p>

<p>I have the Xbox 360 E model but the hard drive is compatible with the slim and says: "For use with Xbox 360 S model". It started out with me trying to connect to Xbox live and being confused when it didn't ask me for my password when I signed in. It finally
 worked and it told me to update Xbox Live but it said no storage space please connect storage device with capacity of at least 190mbs. I have a 500gb hard drive and have 461 gigs left so I go to storage settings and my hard drive doesn't show up. I plug in
 a USB and it comes up on the screen. Go to my games and nothing there. I turn off the Xbox and remove the hard drive. I blow on it and wipe it off (don't know if blowing makes a difference). Turn on the Xbox without the hard drive and turn it back off. Install
 the hard drive and press until you hear a click. Turn it back on and you should be set. Hope that helps!

<h2>            Random BSODs win32k.sys 0x3b</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bought a new computer and installed Win7 64. I'm getting about one BSOD a week and it seems to be totally random when it happens. So far I have tested with memtest86, Furmark and chkdsk with no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find 3 dump files here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.dropbox.com/sh/7vt2ruxojpqn3hc/DKvxcxqbSG</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated the Video drivers (to Beta, nothing newer), chipset drivers and installet SP1 to no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if more information is needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much appreciated!</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>3. </strong>If you're still crashing after all of the above, please run Memtest for NO LESS than ~8 passes (several hours):</p>

<br />
<strong>Which should I download?</strong><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
Do note that some older generation motherboards do not support USB-based booting, therefore your only option is CD (or Floppy if you really wanted to).
<br />
<br />
<strong>How Memtest works:</strong><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />
Any other questions, they can most likely be answered by reading this great guide here:<br />

                    <p>Windows 8 not seeing my iPhone 4S Hotspot as an available wireless&nbsp;network although&nbsp;Personal Hotspot is ON&nbsp; Running iOS6.&nbsp; Have rebooted phone and HP ENVY Ultrabook Touch.&nbsp; I have used iPhone Personal Hotspot on former Dell Windows 7 Laptop &amp; iPads since
 it became available several years ago.&nbsp; My new Windows 8 on HP Ultrabook Touch simply does not show&nbsp;my IPhone Hotspot as an available Network although It sees my home wireless network fine and my neighbors wireless network.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I am currently connected to my home Wireless Network.&nbsp; When I travel or away from home and not around a&nbsp;free WIFi&nbsp;the IPhone Personal Hotspot is handy as pocket on a shirt.&nbsp; I'm not a beginner because have 14 wired and wireless devices on my home Network.&nbsp;
 My security cameras, lighting and pool controls are all managed by PC iPhone and iPad apps.&nbsp; But I am a beginner with Windows 8 and cannot seem to make it find my iPhone Personal Hotspot.</p>
<p>I'm sure solution is simple but I just don't know that simple solution.</p>

<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community!
</p>
<p>I am sorry to hear that you are facing a problem with Windows 8 not seeing your iPhone 4S Hotspot as an available wireless network. I will surely help you regarding
 this issue.</p>
<p>Is the iPhone Hotspot hidden or available or shown to all?</p>
<p>Is the iPhone Hotspot available in other devices when you try to look for wireless network?</p>

    <title>Lost OS after update - primary disk locked &#40;SOLVED&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> m.whitaker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost OS after update - primary disk locked &#40;SOLVED&#41;</h2>
                    I was working on rendering some graphics (Blender, two instances: one rendering CPU, the other rendering GPU), left my computer for a while letting it do its thing and when I came back to check its progress, my machine had frozen; totally unresponsive.
 I hit the reset button and it told me Windows was updating. It reached 100% and power cycled. Got my rendering set up again, occupied myself otherwise and when I checked on it later, the screen was black. It was gone, machine frozen again. Rebooted again,
 resigned to render one at a time thinking I had overburdened my system (I was pulling two composites and some video sequencing simultaneouly just a few days ago with no hiccups). When the power came back on, I had no operating system. Inserted install disc
 for repairs and learned my primary drive is locked, but DISKPART tells me it is NOT set to read-only. It seems that my previous drive letter has been reassigned E, but even changing it back to C doesn't stick. No boot. No OS found. No error messages. POST
 is fine; in fact my boot priority and devices remained unchanged! Everything is still recognized. But the work I had in progress: lost. How can I get my machine back? Is Windows 10 going to force updates, stealing priority regardless of what a machine is doing
 while giving users a giant middle finger as it destroys their work? Is this going to be Microsoft's new bag?

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand your concern and I’ll be glad to assist you. This could be because of corrupted drivers, hence before going any further I suggest you to unplug any peripherals you have plugged in at the time and restart the system and see if you are able
 to boot in the desktop. If you are able to boot in please install all the pending Windows update available for your system. I would suggest you to perform
<strong>Automatic Repair</strong> once again using Windows 10 installation media. Drivers, conflicts with other programs, malware, and memory can all cause startup problems. Automatic repair can detect and fix problems that prevent your PC from starting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you don’t have an installation media. I request you to download and create an installation media of Windows 10 from the below link.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Download Windows 10</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Refer to the steps below to perform an <strong><span>Automatic Repair</span></strong>:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Insert the installation USB media and boot Windows from it.</span></li><li><span>In the ‘<strong>Windows setup</strong>’ page select the ‘<strong>language to install’</strong>, ‘<strong>Time and currency format’</strong> and the ‘<strong>keyboard or input method’</strong> and click on ‘<strong>next’</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on ‘<strong><span>Repair your computer’ </span></strong>and select ‘<strong><span>Troubleshoot’</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select ‘<strong><span>Automatic Repair’ </span></strong>and select the operating system.</span></li><li><span>You will then see a blue screen and an option to choose. Choose the option
<strong><span>Troubleshoot </span></strong>and select <strong><span>advanced options</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>You may choose <strong><span>Automatic Repair </span></strong>from Advanced boot option.</span></li><li><span>Follow the instructions.</span></li></ul>

<div><br />
<div>I inserted my optical boot media; my computer won't start to create USB. I followed these instructions as you laid out. Selected troubleshoot. Here I have "Reset this PC" or "Advanced options." Skipping your step that didn't apply, I selected advanced
 options. There is no automatic repair. I have system restore, which tells me i need to select an operating system. No option to do so. System image recovery tells me it cannot find a system image. I don't know where one would be stored on the hard disk, so
 browsing for it turns up nothing. Next option is startup repair. It diagnoses, attempts repairs, then tells me it could not repair my PC. Log file was not indicated. Now I can go to shut down or advanced &nbsp;options. I have command prompt, UEFI Firmware settings
 (don't know what that is) or go back tot previous build, which also fails.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Am I screwed, or will a USB boot media avail me further?</div>
<div>Additional info:</div>
<div>Disk 0, Volume 1 letter is C, label is ??????? (Each question mark enclosed in a box) capacity is 350MB. My previous C drive is now Volume 2 marked E, with a capacity of 953 GB. All volumes report Healthy. Reassigning drive letters loses effect on reboot.</div>

            I installed Windows to a USB thumb drive. It's a real hassle, but you'll need 20GB if you're going Windows 10 Pro. Even on USB 3, it's painfully slow. I did some poking around: something assigned a drive letter to my system reserved partition and flagged
 my primary disk read-only. Through the use of the diskpart utility I cleared the read-only flag. Then in disk management I removed the drive letter to the system reserved partition. For what will be your primary partition, be sure to mark it as active, since
 that flag was probably reset too. Shutdown Windows, remove USB, reboot. Boot sector had errors, inserted installation media to repair startup... At reboot, remove installation media, choose your OS if applicable... Problem solved.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My personal opinion is that you buy a newer machine as Vista Basic came on machines that did have only the basic hardware requirements for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It depends on the hardware requirements of later operating systems and also&nbsp;whether the computer/laptop manufacturer supports and supplies drivers for the later operating systems as to whether it is possible or feasible to upgrade or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no free upgrade from Vista to 7, 8.1 or 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps before you buy Windows 7.</p>
<p>Microsoft no longer sells 7; try amazon.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your Computer / Laptop&nbsp;Manufacturer's website and see if Windows 7 Drivers are available for your Make and Model Computer / Laptop.
</p>
<p>If not available, Windows 7 will not&nbsp;work correctly for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the "Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor"</p>

<h2>            Computer detects headphones that are not there</h2>
                    Since a week or so ago, my laptop detects devices in audio jack that are not there. I have checked, and there is no debris in the jack itself. I am berated with a message asking weather it is speakers or headphones that have been plugged in, several times
 in a minute, having not plugged anything in. It causes the speakers to cutout and makes music and videos unbearable. When I actually use headphones, it works perfectly fine. I updated my sound driver, but to no avail.

    <title>how do I make a back up copy of windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wrenchtt  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do I make a back up copy of windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I have a new gateway dx series pc with win 7 pro. I purchased the upgrade win 8 pro &amp; downloaded it. I downloaded the assist program 1st before installing win 8. After I installed it I have to restart it several times 5 or 6 before it lets me on. I get the
 message your pc ran into a problem &amp; needs to be restarted. so I follow instructions. But when I do get on&nbsp;&nbsp;I open my documents &amp; when I try to open music ,video or pictures etc. it tells me they are damaged &amp; I can delete them. So I re downloaded win 8 again
 &amp; installed it a 2nd time&nbsp;. Now I have lost all my programs that came with the p/c. This happened when I ran the refresh windows [save all my files etc.. option]&nbsp;&nbsp;program! I have a very slow internet it took me over 6 hours to download each time. I would have
 just bought the disc. if I would have known I was going to have all these problem's !!!</p>
<p>The only thing I know too do now is to reformat my p/c back to the OE. win 7 &amp; try it again. Unless you no a way to recover my programs! I do have everything backed up on an external drive. But I cant figure out how to put it back on my p/c with win 8 .</p>
<p>I would hate to loose the win 8 I have already downloaded [twice] &amp; then have to do it again wasting another 6 hours or more. I can't find it on my c drive !
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help!!!!!</p>

    <title>New Xbox One S wont install games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> calzoner99  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Xbox One S wont install games</h2>
                    <p>Either by disc or downloading.&nbsp;&nbsp;I've tried the troubleshooting options such as power cycling, deleting cache, rebooting, going offline to install and factory console resets.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I&nbsp;insert disc or start a download/install, you can hear the Hard drive start spinning and the download begins.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several seconds later, I will get "install stopped" message.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I click to get details, it will say to try install again or reference error code 0x8007045d.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can keep retrying the install and very very slowly make progress 1% at a time but nothing consistent.&nbsp;&nbsp;My next step is to send in for repairs as perhaps I'm thinking there is an issue with my internal HDD? &nbsp;Very limited info on this problem from what I can find online.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>I sure hope it works.</p>

<p>It will work, unless your Windows 7 Professional is an OEM copy - OEM can't be moved to a new computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can You Move Windows 7 To New Computer <br />
<strong><br />
If it's a retail Full or Upgrade license - yes.</strong> You can move it to a different computer as long as it's only installed on one computer at a time (and if it's a Windows 7 Upgrade version the new computer must have it's own qualifying XP/Vista license).
 The previous Windows 7 installation on the old computer must be formatted/deleted. You might have to call Microsoft and explain what happened to complete the activation. Activating it on the second computer will automatically in effect "deactivate" the license
 for the first computer. The key will work with both 32 and 64 bit, but only one can be installed at a time.
<br />
<br />
<strong>If it's an OEM license - no.</strong> OEM licenses, including Windows preinstalled on a computer before purchase and Windows bought separately, are tied to the first computer they are installed on and can not be transferred to a different computer.
 To install Windows on a different computer you will need to buy another copy.<br />

<p>Yes you can. Simply remove the installation of Windows 7 Professional installation from the current PC.</p>
<p>You will have to reactivate your license though.</p>
<p>To save yourself some trouble, use Windows Anytime Upgrade to upgrade the Windows 7 Home Premium installation to Professional by simply using the Windows 7 Professional key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Click Start, type Anytime Upgrade, follow the onscreen wizard, enter the Windows 7 Professional key when requested, click and restart your computer when prompted. Within 10 mins, you should be upgraded to Windows 7 Professional and your files and settings
 preserved.<br />
</p>
<p>How to activate Windows 7 manually<br />
1) Click Start, and in the Search box type:&nbsp;&nbsp; slui.exe&nbsp; 4<br />
2) Next press the 'ENTER' key<br />
3) Select your 'Country' from the list.<br />
4) Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.<br />
5) Stay on the phone and wait for a person to help you with activation.<br />

<p>hello</p>
<p>First you may check in Device Manager whether the device shows up as an “Unknown Device”.</p>
<p>Simply UNPLUG YOUR COMPUTER FROM THE POWER SUPPLY. Yes that’s it! Note that this does not mean just turning off your computer because modern computers don’t really turn off when you press the power button as the motherboard still gets power.<br />
<br />
First to explain, the motherboard is where all of hardware of the computer is connected to, including the USB ports. Sometimes the motherboard needs to be “rebooted” also because something can go wrong, i.e. all your USB ports suddenly stop working. The small
 microprocessor on the motherboard will reload the drivers and your USB ports should be back to recognizing all devices!<br />
<br />
So first turn off your computer using Shut Down or pressing the power button and then UNPLUG it from the wall outlet. Let it sit for about a minute and then plug it back in.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps someone fix that pesky “USB device not recognized” Windows 7 error!</p>

<p>Hey Jay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to sign into your accounts on Xbox.com and account.live.com? Or is it only the Xbox app that you are getting this error code?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From research that I did right now, it's also very difficult to find a definitive solution to this but from what I found it may be due to compatibility issues between the hardware installed in your PC to the software system being used. It's related to drivers
 not being compatible in the device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is&nbsp;a Windows error code as I've seen that others are getting this same error code logging into their Outlook mail address, which a lot people use as their Microsoft account email address so it seems to be related to the operating system having
 issues with the installed drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest looking over these two articles for some solutions to try for this Windows system error code:</p>

<h2>            Missing System Protection tab on System Properties &#40;Windows 7 Home Premium&#41;</h2>
                    I just installed Windows 7 and want to create restore points as I proceed to install apps.<br />
<br />
However, there is no System Protection tab on System Properties!<br />
<br />
Volume Shadowing is on and I have plenty of space on the C: partition.<br />
<br />
So how do I get the tab to appear?<br />

<p><span>Hi,<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft 7Answers Forum!
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Try performing SFC scan on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;1</span><span><span>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prompted for an&nbsp;administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER: <span>&nbsp;</span>sfc /scannow<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>[The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.]</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If any files require a replace SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Win7 DVD for this process to continue</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>resource protection did not find any integrity violations" </span></p>
<p><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>computer and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan –</span></p>

            Torrents are notoriously dangerous ways to download files (I'm assuming that a torrent isn't the normal way to download the fully paid version of this program).&nbsp; For one thing, although the uTorrent program itself is safe, what you download definitely
 isn't - it could contain any type of malware imaginable (and if I recall it sometimes asks you to take down your Firewall making it more dangerous still).&nbsp; One of the other downsides of such software is that it is often incomplete even if it isn't dangerous
 (e.g., missing the uninstall program or not feeding into the Programs and Features section of Windows Vista or missing key componenets of the program - especially considering the method of download).&nbsp; It's not a sure thing that it will overwrite the files
 already there (you'd normally expect that) - it may create duplicates (it depends on how it is programmed to react to a re-installation and that may have nothing to do with how the REAL program is scheduled to operate - which I couldn't find in a search of
 National Instruments.&nbsp; You may not be able to "uninstall" the program once it is installed - except in pieces by deleting the main directory entries (if you can find them) and hoping the entries in the registry and the Windows directories don't have an adverse
 impact on your system when the main directory is deleted. (if you decide to delete it).<br />
<br />
It's possible it's not in Programs and Features yet because the installation failed and that's often one of the last steps in an installation - but it's also possible that it will never appear and you'll have no clean way to uninstall the program.&nbsp; This is
 the chance you take with 3rd party software and ESPECIALLY with torrents.&nbsp; BEFORE installing the program, I'd run it through a number of AV/AM scans just to be on the safe side (though this by no way attenuates the potential danger - it does at least help).&nbsp;
<span>
While in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Safe Mode</span> with networking (click repeatedly on F8 during the boot process) try to run anti-malware programs.&nbsp;To fix this potential problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp; install, and run the following
 two programs: </span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.pandasoft.com</span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(with
 the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; Make sure the file you downloaded is scanned (and you way want to run these programs again after it
 is installed just to be sure you weren't infected in the process).&nbsp; </span>You may also want to try the free OneCare at
</span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a></span><span>
 and let it run all the options because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).<br />
<br />
Sorry I can't tell you more but I frankly don't know more about ANY torrent download - especially about a program I'm not familiar with.&nbsp; Are you sure this program is even compatatable with Vista?&nbsp; Check here:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/default.aspx</a>.&nbsp; If it's not compatable don't try to install it.&nbsp; If it's not listed, chances are good that it isn't compatable (but not certain).<br />
<br />
Good luck!&nbsp; I hope this helps.</span>

<h2>            Can you turn down the in game speech volume in GTA 5&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Sorry if this is a re-post but I find it the only fault of GTA 5. The speech (dialog) volume is so damn loud compared to everything else. It ruins the experice while driving a car and someone is blabbing away so very loudly.</p>
<p>And while we are on the topic, does anyone else notice how quiet the vehicle's engines are? anyway to turn just the engine volume up?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>the voice acting and car conversations are fantastic, but i guess if you really hate entertainment i think you can lower voice volume in &nbsp;settings.</p>
