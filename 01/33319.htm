<br />Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Once you have the Windows 10 Spring Creators Update ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade. If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:

            Hi Jarret,
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            <p>In most cases like you describe, it turns out to be a failing DVD drive.&nbsp; DVD drives are one of the most common if not the most common hardware failures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yours is a desktop PC, you can buy a replacement for about $20 and the actual install is easy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yours is a laptop PC, a replacement is only available from the OEM and it may be rather costly.&nbsp; An alternative is to buy an external USB attached DVD drive for around $25.</p>

<h3> alex-reyes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wifi connection drops &#43; continually asks for key to reconnect</h2>
                    <p>My computer is running Windows 8. Recently we had to change the router (Comcast all-in-one). &nbsp;When we did the laptop started having problems with the wifi connection. &nbsp;If I go somewhere and connect to their wifi (Starbucks, Panera, etc) when I come back
 home, I have to input the key to connect to my home wifi even though the computer is set up to connect automatically and to remember the key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other problem is that it drops the connection while I'm working (not just when the computer is idle). &nbsp;I would be in the middle of something and the connection just drops. It keeps connecting and disconnecting. The connection in all other devices is
 working fine (3 Android phones and 2 other laptops).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen answers referring to power management but it seems those are for connections that drop while the computer is idle.</p>

    <title>Microsoft and Spyware - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cadenmitchell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft and Spyware</h2>
                    <p>When Microsoft released their new OS, they made sure to give you the best OS possible... for them. When Microsoft launched their new OS they made sure to make it available as a free upgrade for the previous two generations of Windows. When you first started
 up your new Windows 10 pc they made sure to get you involved with their services right out of the box, asking you to create a Microsoft account, sign up for Bing, use their new Cortana tool and use a Smart-screen filter for their OS. This may seem intrusive
 for most people especially for those who had just came from Windows 7. If you were to go into your settings after you created your account and go to the privacy section you will notice many different options regarding your personal information checked. Things
 such as settings that allow apps to use your camera or microphone or USB/ Bluetooth peripherals. Some of the most unsettling options that come turned on by default are the settings that make your computer send personal information such as passwords, memory
 dumps, crash reports, and even your contacts! Also, in the settings privacy options there are some settings that give websites the ability to use your "advertising ID" to help them "Provide locally relevant results" which is not what it is for but is instead
 for giving Microsoft the ability to give sites your personal info which makes them a lot of money. If you've ever wondered why you are always seeing those pesky ads that are for local businesses this is why. I will give you a few screenshots to show you what
 I mean. <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a0abb7d-9f9f-430c-b249-e4a2068ad0ef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a0abb7d-9f9f-430c-b249-e4a2068ad0ef" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see there are lots of settings that send your information to other websites. These settings are by default all turned on to give Microsoft full access to everything you do. Now, I want you to read the descriptions of each of these options and
 tell me what you think. The first one, sends your location, language, and search history to any website that requests it which gets Microsoft a lot of money. Microsoft is even kind enough to make you an "advertising ID." The second one sends any kind of file
 that you are attempting to download... any kind of file you are trying to download and it also sends any web URL that you are on to Microsoft to make sure you stay "Safe" on the web but it really is just worded the way it is to make it seem good. The next
 option down makes Windows 10 track anything inputted by your keyboard to Microsoft so that they can see anything you have typed. They say it's for helping you type better and correct spelling in the future and it may, but it is also like having a person following
 you all day and listening to every conversation you have. The last one says that it will allow websites to access your language list to provide relevant content when it is really for advertising. The way that Microsoft uses this advertising ID that they make
 for you is by taking your info and putting it on websites so that they will have some info on how people use their products and websites to improve their websites or make ads based on their user's experience. There are also many other settings that need to
 be disabled to make your "PC (personal computer)" a real PC. If I were you I would look through these settings to make sure you are ok with the&nbsp;spyware being forced upon you by Microsoft. I would actually disable all of these if I were you because they are
 all bad. Also, make sure you have these settings for your feedback and diagnostics settings:

<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b675d561-854f-4e12-a1cd-fde1bcabe890" /></a></p>
<p>Lastly, I will give you a link to a tutorial on YouTube for any users who have a previous version of Windows like Windows 7 or Windows 8 to remove that little icon that pops up constantly and tries to get you to upgrade to Windows 10 as well as some things
 Microsoft has done to your PC to alow them to spy on you like they can in Windows 10.

            Let's get it to the point, straight forward: Windows 10 is becoming the 'worst' operating system of all time, like Vista and 8; and because of this, that's why many people widely use Windows 7 as their preferred operating system, and hopefully Microsoft
 (and their partners) would've had called the cops on you saying that you were doing illegal activity on your Windows 10 device, as it will try to send email, contacts, text, keyboard/inking input, browsing data, your location, and other things like phone calls,
 search results, calendar data, etc. back to Microsoft.

            Hi&nbsp; Mohhammad<br />
<br />
Thanks for your posting in Microsoft Community<br />
<br />
As i can see in one Microsoft Link ,Microsoft Has mentioned::Windows Store Topic<br />
<br />
<p>Apps listed in the Windows Store are directed at customers in markets around the world.
</p>
Local laws and restrictions could prevent some apps from being listed in some markets. Also, some markets may require age rating certificates from a specific rating board. See
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh694080.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Age ratings and rating boards</a> for more info<br />

<h2>            Windows live mail 2012 sends mail but stays in outbox - with errors - and is received, too&#33;</h2>
                    <p>So here is the situation. &nbsp;I've created a Windows Live Mail account and it began receiving all the contents of the webmail from this comcast account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As well, I created a test email and sent it to my Gmail account. &nbsp;Once I received it, I replied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reply came through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the original email sits in the Outbox and error messages pop up in WLM. &nbsp;Help!</p>

<p>Hi Babu, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; This is on an acquaintence's laptop, so I don't get to see it often.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the suggestion was tried but the errors seem to be the same.&nbsp; I did not capture them, but they did seem to be the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it turns out he is not comfortable with change and would rather use the Comcast webmail interface (IMHO, a real PITA).&nbsp; Every user has their own comfort level!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks - and if there are other suggestions, I'll try them the next time I get my fingertips on that keyboard!</p>

            I am seeing the same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Am email&nbsp;was sent to two people. One of the addresses was good and the other was bad.&nbsp; The email should have sent correctly (into the Outbox and then immediately gone from the Outbox)&nbsp;followed by receiving an email from the
 system administrator that the bad address was unreachable.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead the email remained in the Outbox and prevented any further sending of email.

<h2>            Robbed</h2>
                    
<p>I have just found out that movies/tv series that I purchased on my xbox one to use with xbox video can be taken away from me at anytime and that is supposed to be ok.&nbsp; I was looking on some search engines trying to find out why the movie Prometheus that
 I BOUGHT kept coming up with a error message.&nbsp; There was a post from LAST YEAR talking about how MS can lose the rights to movies and that they might not always be available or some have a expiration date.&nbsp; If there has been a date on anything I have ever
 bought it has been well hidden as I have NEVER seen one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I personally find it disgusting that you would "sell" something that you obviously can not provide.&nbsp; At first I was thrilled with xbox video.&nbsp; I can access it multiple places, no dvds to carry, and I don't have to actually drive somewhere to buy a new movie.&nbsp;
 The problem comes when I find out that the movie I paid full retail price for and now I do not have access to it.&nbsp; That is like selling someone a car and then telling them after they bought it that they might not always be able to drive it, but they can't
 complain because it was in the fine print.</p>
<p>Also it suggested that you should have downloaded the movie to always have access to it.&nbsp; Last I checked the storage space on my xbox is kinda limited and in no way could hold my entire collection from xbox video.&nbsp; What happens if my hard drive craps out
 after downloading it?&nbsp; Oops you are stuck again.&nbsp; If a dvd player goes bad you can always remove the dvd from the player and still have it.&nbsp; If you were unable to provide constant access to something then you have absolutely no right, and in fact a business
 ethic to have them as rent only instead of purchasable.&nbsp; </p>
<p>There are ways that you can handle this professionally, and keep my business with xbox instead of my deciding to switch to sony.&nbsp; I would like all movies and shows in my collection that are no longer available to be refunded.&nbsp; This in general would be good
 practice for everyone and would keep/restore consumer confidence.&nbsp; If you suddenly can't provide something then refund it.&nbsp; If it comes back later then the consumer can repurchase it if they wish to do so.&nbsp; Otherwise I would like my ENTIRE collection of movies
 and shows refunded (not a credit to my MS account) as they were bought under false pretenses.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I do not want any BS statements like this one in response:</p>
<p>"Due to licensing restrictions with the content owner we have to remove some titles from the Marketplace and not allow those that purchased it from being able to view it. &nbsp;There is a disclaimer on the purchase screen that states you should download the content
 prior to a specific date in order to maintain the ability to view it. "</p>
<p>If you are not the content owner why are you selling anything.&nbsp; How about I go sell Microsoft and if Mr. Gates gets upset about it because he is the "content owner" then I will just tell the other guy he can have Microsoft back if/when it comes back online,
 and that he should have downloaded it first if he wanted access all the time?</p>

<p>When you purchase digital content (not just movies/tv shows) you're only purchasing a license to use the content. You're not purchasing the content itself. This is how it works with any service you purchase digital content from. Even if you switched to Sony
 it would be the same with their services. </p>

<p>If that were the case then it should be made completely obvious instead of being buried in a license contract that no one who is not a lawyer is going to read or understand. &nbsp;I'm sick of companies pulling stuff like this and saying you should have read the
 fine print when you get upset about it.</p>
<p>I know for me a little window pops up when I select purchase so that window should say in BOLD print that this is only a license and you may lose access to this content. &nbsp;You are not purchasing rights to watch this movie at anytime like you actually believe
 you are. &nbsp;I did a google search and know I am not the only one who has run into this by far. &nbsp;That shows that this is not being made clear.</p>
<p>So again does anyone want to buy Microsoft? &nbsp;I will sell it to you for the great price of my digital movie collection.</p>

<p>I too just discovered that the copy of Prometheus I bought is no longer available for me to watch. &nbsp;No notice, no explanation. &nbsp;It shows in my Collection, but I can't watch it--I get an inexplicable error message. &nbsp;It doesn't even show up in my purchase
 history anymore. &nbsp;What a scam. &nbsp;I won't make this mistake twice. &nbsp;I will no longer purchase movies from Xbox Video. &nbsp;Their rentals are fine, no different than anyone else's, but as far as purchasing video content, unless I can download my purchase onto my
 internal cloud, forget about it. &nbsp;If I want to buy a movie, I'll buy the DVD on Amazon and transfer its content onto my NAS device.</p>

<p>Sorry but you are not just "buying licensing" &nbsp; On Xbox 360 you have the option to actually download the movies/shows to your Xbox. &nbsp;Why can't we download our movies we buy on Xbox One to the console? If microsoft loses the rights to sell the product than
 no big deal I have it downloaded to my drive.</p>

 (which may not work depending on how bad your administrator account is functioning) or</span><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9001970/How_to_access_the_true_Administrator_account_in_Windows_Vista?taxonomyId=17&amp;pageNumber=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9001970/How_to_access_the_true_Administrator_account_in_Windows_Vista?taxonomyId=17&amp;pageNumber=1</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>If
 you can't remember the password (and it requests one – it may not), try nothing as that's probably what you (or the vendor) did during installation.&nbsp; Once done, be sure to deactivate the HAA to save it in case it's needed again and for security purposes (since
 people often try to hack into systems using this account).&nbsp; Do NOT use the HAA as your administrator account because if you lose the only administrator account on the system or it becomes corrupt again then you are hosed.&nbsp; See if that gets you into the system
 so we can do a proper troubleshooting.</span></span></span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span>We'll need to do a general troublehooting to see if we can identify and resolve the problem (since it affects all user accounts, it isn't a single corrupt user profile).</span></p>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>

If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Try to post any corrupted files here so
 we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;startup or login (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command
 prompt starting from C:\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install,
 and run the following two programs:</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and</span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></a><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></a><span>
 and Avast at:</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></a><span>. &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a>.&nbsp; If the problem goes away then it's just a matter
 of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs
 in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></p>
<p><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></p>
<p><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers.&nbsp;</span><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the
 program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get
 drivers (and you should do any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from
 Windows Update as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span><span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems:</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></a><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></a><span>.&nbsp; If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes,
 RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></span></p>

<p>a asdfmovie reference</p>
<p>anyways I noticed how theres less train simulators on xbox 360/1 and why can't we have more like rail sim or trainz since they can easly run on pc so they must have same specs for xbox cause it don't need a lot for pc to run any train sim</p>

<p>^ A drunk simulator would be fun. Make it to your house from a pub! You lose points for attempting to drive your car, faceplanting in front of your ex, peeing in a stranger's garden... the one with the Beware of the Giant Dog sign...</p>
<p>... and falling asleep in any one of the hundreds of super comfortable places before your house... like that oh so comfortable [insert anywhere] that feels so cozy.</p>
<p>It could play like Octodad or something... without the stickiness. The GTA drunk animation in its own game.</p>

<h2>            Repair My Documents, My Music, My Pictures folders in XP</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
<br />
I've lately been organizing my photos and music collection on my computer. Nothing special, just moving files around. But now something strange is happening to my My Documents folder. It&nbsp;is now showing the "Music Tasks" bar in the left pane of the folder. The
 folder now thinks it's a&nbsp;music folder and I see the musical note&nbsp;background image in the folder window.<br />
<br />
The My Pictures folder shows now a "Video Tasks" bar in the left pane of that folder. I could not find any way to repair these folders back to the default.<br />
<br />
But wait, there's more. The problem continues with my hard disk C: folder, which also shows the "Music Tasks" bar in the left folder pane.<br />
<br />
I've tried right-clicking on the My Documents, My Pictures, and Hard Disk folders,&nbsp;and then choosing Properties to see if I could change the document template under the "Use this folder as a template" option. However,&nbsp;to my horror,&nbsp;I did not see any Customize
 tab in the Properties dialog.<br />
<br />
How do I repair my My Documents, My Pictures, and Hard Disk folders so that the left pane of these folder windows revert back to their Windows' default?&nbsp; Is there a "repair" button anywhere?<br />
<br />
I am using Windows XP Pro with SP3.<br />
<br />

<p>I believe I found the solution to this problem.</p>
<p>To fix the problem, try the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new folder on your desktop (or use an existing folder, preferably not a system folder).</li><li>Right-click on the folder and then click on the <strong>Customize</strong> tab.</li><li>Choose Documents under "Optimize this folder for". </li><li>Press <strong>OK</strong>. </li><li>Resize the folder, choose the icon view you want. Doesn't matter. </li><li>From the folder menu, click on <strong>Tools</strong>, <strong>Folder Options</strong>, and then click on the<strong>View</strong> tab.
</li><li>Under "Folder views", click on <strong>Apply to Folders</strong>. </li><li>Press <strong>OK</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>Now open up the My Documents folder, and any of the other folders, such as My Pictures, My Videos, etc.</p>
<p>After I tried this, all the folders on my hard drive began showing the correct settings on the left panel. I did not have to create a new account. I used my existing one.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Windows 10 Aniversary Update 4 days ago. Everything works fine except Cortana. Also when I previously updated my PC from Windows 10 (initial version) to November Update I accidentally checked the feature in Auslogics BoostSpeed 9 which said

<p>
</p><p>Here's what Cortana's interface looks like when I click the search button in the Taskbar:</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 is slow to boot and svchost is using 50&#37; cpu, updates fail</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
i have this Win7-64b desktop with all latest updates installed and pretty recent hardware. But it is running very slow. Symptoms are:<br />
<br />
- after boot + autologon the system is unresponsive for at least 15 minutes. Showing a sort of flashing desktop, no response on mouse or keyboards actions.<br />
- after the 15 minutes, the system becomes responsive but 50% CPU is used by scvhost.exe all time long. The high cpu is due to the update service. If I stop this the cpu goes down to say 0%.<br />
- important (windows) updates install ok, but the optional updates fails to install. The install starts but then just hangs on downloading, without any visible progress.<br />
<br />
What is the cause/solution for this?

            <p>I just want to report that I am getting a similar problem: svchost.exe using 50% CPU, and is related to Windows Update searching endlessly for updates. It's been doing it for days now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a 7-year-old Sony laptop (VGN-NS30Z) with Windows&nbsp;7 SP1, and fully updated. This is a computer that I have tried to update to Windows 10 several times, but it always failed and so I had to revert to Win7. Looking at Sony's support site, Sony do
 not appear to recommend that this computer be updated to Windows 10. I have read elsewhere that people seem to think this problem is related to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            <p>Oddly enough this process solved my 50%++ cpu usage by svchost</p>
<p>Pretty much the reason is windows updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switch your windows update setting to Never check for updates temporarily<br />
<br />
Restart the machine<br />
Then download this to your downloads folder to run it from there,<br />
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS16-039?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/MS16-039?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a><br />
<br />
Download the x86 for 32 bit system or x64 for a 64 bit system<br />
<br />
Install it and restart when prompted too after it does a stand alone search for updates which shouldn't<br />
take too long it took all of 5 seconds "If" the windows update settings are switched to Never check for<br />
updates before running it from the downloads folder.<br />
<br />
Once it installs and restarts<br />
You can reset your updates setting to whatever you had prior = Default....<br />
Then manually check for updates.<br />
<br />
I believe the solution came from Softpedia and Joel_CS posted it on this thread,<br />

            Hi, so you're saying my HP Officejet 6700 Premium Wireless e-All-in-one printer with faxing capabilities isn't considered a fax server? I can wirelessly fax through it using the included HP software, just want to be utilizing the File Explorer "Send to

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You would need a <span>fax modem</span>. Either it could be an Internal fax modems plug directly into your computer motherboard, similar to the way a video or sound card is plugged in. External fax modems are small devices that connect
 to the serial or USB ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sending a fax using a fax server doesn't require you to add any special hardware to your PC. You just set up a connection with the fax server and go.</p>

<p>So, I can send a fax from my computer to my fax machine by printing to the fax device, but I can't set it up to use Microsoft Fax and Scan? I have a Canon MX472.

<h2>            Adware. Possible scam&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I've had 2 phone calls from an indian man called John Smith? calling from a company called Online PC Solutions. He says they are part of Microsoft and my parents laptop has sent a report that it is infected with Adware to them. He was call in from India.</p>
<p>So he wants to remote into the laptop and run a free scan for adware. but there will be a charge to remove it. This just to weird and not normal. He has left a number for me to call back on but its a London number and their HQ is in Liverpool and he was
 in India?</p>
<p>I have refused to let him do this as it sounds so dodgy.&nbsp; I would just like to know if Online PC Solutions based in liverpool have any assosiation with Microsoft what so ever or if this is some kind of scam like i suspect?</p>
<p>Has anyone else been contacted by John Smith?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to properly isolate the issue with your mouse scroll, we would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any changes made on your computer prior to the issue (e.g. updates, software installation)?</li><li>Are you using a wired or a wireless mouse?</li><li>Have you tried using your mouse to a different computer? If yes, how was it?</li><li>Have you tried a different mouse to your current computer? If yes, what is the result?</li><li>To make sure that we have not missed on anything, what troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you try installing the latest hardware driver to resolve the issue. You may follow the steps provided by

            <p>Hi Teddy, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the steps that you have tried to resolve the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Which version of AutoCAD are you trying to install? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to check the version in <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=Windows%208.1&amp;Locale=en-us&amp;Architecture=X64&amp;TextSearch=autocad%2B2010&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Compatibility Center</a> to see if it is compatible with Windows 8.1 or not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is not compatible, you may try to install the program in Compatibility mode and check the results.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><br />
a. Download the drivers from the Manufacturer’s website.<br />
b. Right-click on the driver and click on <strong>properties</strong>.<br />
c. Click on the ‘<strong>compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box "<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for</strong>” and select
<strong>Windows 8 operating system</strong> from the drop down.<br />
d. Click on ‘<strong>Apply’</strong> and click ‘<strong>OK’</strong> and run the file to install it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also post the query in AutoCAD support forums to know more information.

<h2>            How do I play Diablo II on Windows 7 Home Premium Edition&#63;</h2>

<br />
<br />
<span>Windows Vista and 7 have known compatibility issues with Diablo II/LoD ... to fix them, take the following steps:
<br />
<br />
Right-click your Game.exe file and in the compatibility view, make certain you are running the game under Windows XP SP2/3 mode, and DISABLE DESKTOP COMPOSITION. This should allow your game to start normally, but you will probably have serious lag spike issues
 that need to be resolved. <br />
<br />
On your Desktop, hit Control+Alt+Delete and open your Task Manager program. Select the "Services" tab, and click the "services" button at the bottom of that screen to access your services manager. (you can close your Task Manager now) Scroll down the list until
 you find "Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service". Stop this service, then right-click it and select "properties"</span><br />

<p>
<span>This can help with some (but not all) programs/drivers:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next window click "Start the Program" to install it.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in Windows 7.
