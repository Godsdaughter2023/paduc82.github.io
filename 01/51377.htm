<h2>            Update to W10 1803 stops at 43&#37; every time</h2>
                    <p>I have tried many, many times to update my main PC to the latest W10 update 1803. I have a pretty solid background in PC troubleshooting and I have updated all of my other PC's to 1803 without incident. I have failed miserably trying to update my main office
 PC however. I have followed this thread...</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-10-update-1803-gets-stuck-at-43/aaf78a22-4b50-4a78-901f-83689bdd5c14</p>
<p>
</p><p>and have followed many, if not all, of the suggestions to no avail. I am linking the pertinent log files and am hoping for some guidance and suggestions as how to proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is a modern custom system with pretty standard components. Gigabyte z370 chipset i7 8700, 16gb ram, AMD R9 390, Samsung NVMe Ram system drive. Windows 10 Pro has updated itself flawlessly up until this latest (1803) update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any and all suggestions (and analysis of log files) would be most welcome.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the link to the log files. Note that the rollback "setuperr.log" file was empty so I was unable to upload an empty file. I assume it is empty since my PC rolled back to a pre 1803 version.</p>

            Hi David.  What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install April Version 1803 by downloading and  installing Media Creation Tool from this link and then choose to Upgrade This PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This is the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If Version 1803 causes problems go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If problems persist you can also roll it back within 10 days at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery and block it using the Hide Updates tool or another method here to wait to see if it matures:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br /> But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to Clean Install doing a great install like the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<p>I have tried many things. I have, what I think is the latest 1803 ISO, which I've made a bootable USB drive from the Media Creation tool. I downloaded that ISO in mid May, so I'm guessing that's at least the "April" update. I have tried the update from the
 ISO as well as from the Windows Update app, both with the exact same result, total spinning dots at 43%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried a clean install, seems a little draconian, at this stage, my 1709 install is working perfectly and doing a clean install would be somewhat time consuming to say the least as I have quite a bit of software and plug-ins etc etc. I don't rule
 that out, as I like to do it periodically, but I'd like to avoid that for the time being.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My big question, I guess, is anyone able to glean anything pertinent from the \sources\panther log files. Every support discussion here is always asking for them so I was hoping that someone would be able to look at mine and deduce something relevant. I've
 looked at them and there's a lot there, but nothing that sticks out to me as valuable. Anyone know if those log files are just a detailed equivalent of an obtuse Windows error message, or something more?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Did you do the preparatory steps I gave you which work for many?    <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I'm assuming that you've done a Clean Install in the recent past which is why doing it again seems "draconian."  As I said most enthusiasts would never even run a Factory or Upgrade install in the first place because we'd expect endless problems (is this both?).  And the Fresh Start is fully automated so nothing draconian about that.  What's ancient is trying to nurse along a serially upgraded factory install that's already a disk junkyard.  The quality of the install is absolutely EVERYTHING in Windows 10.

<p>Ours is out too ( for about 3 days) I am now able to make outgoing calls but no incoming calls. The SIP channel is registered just fine ... I have the my Asterisks server in troubleshoot mode and I am able to see all incoming and outgoing SIP transactions
 as they happen ... so the incoming call never reaches my server it's a problem somewhere at skype .... for the Incoming call the number rings once (and not a full ring seem just like half way)&nbsp; but then goes to a busy signal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had issues like this before, seems like every 6 months, there's a major catastrophic problem like this IT'S A JOKE this service, and we depend on phone calls coming in for business... I've allocated one of my main business numbers to a skype member
 so we can receive calls to a skype APP </p>
<p>
</p><p>GOTTA SWITCH</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't even see the chat support link in the help section... WHAT'S UP WITH THAT ... that chat support is such a headache too, but at least seemed like after spending 30minutes just verifying you're account with the chat support person and then another
 30minutes explaining to them that the problem is NOT MY SETTINGS and it's form them... At least they were able to escalate the issue to the right tech who seems like the just hit a reset button or something then it starts working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate sounding so negative, I don't like to complain ... But seems like that's all I can do, hopefully some tech will see this and fix something.</p>

<h2>            Why does a phone &#40;or other item&#41; show in my Network list&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm not any type of networking expert- practically a novice.&nbsp; I am working from the Desktop on a Lenovo laptop, running Win 8.1, and using a Motorola wireless router.&nbsp; On most occasions, when I open File Manager, scroll down to Network (left pane), and open
 it up, I see a phone or a Linux client in my Network!&nbsp; I don't understand why, my ISP says don't worry, and it does NOT show up in my list of networks when I click the Icon from the taskbar.&nbsp; Is someone using my network??&nbsp; Sneaking in on me?</p>
<p>I have a very unique SSID, and a unique password, but since all Motorola modems have the same main interface username and password, this has me concerned.&nbsp; I live in a closely populated area, where at any given time there may be 10-15 other networks showing
 in the list when I do click on the network icon.&nbsp; I have my default windows Firewall set to on, but not to any special settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>LITTLEWING is my computer name (so it should be there), and the Motorola SBG6580 is mine as well.&nbsp; But NOT the phone.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is a LG phone,&nbsp;other times a different phone, and as I mentioned, sometimes a Linux client.&nbsp; It kinda spooks me out to see them on my network.&nbsp; I looked at other similar issues, but none matched this exactly or were unanswered.</p>
<p>I tried to show the properties of the phone in the picture as well.</p>
<p>Is someone sneaking in on me?</p>
<p>I do monitor my usage, and sometimes I am online for 10-15 minutes and it will tell me I have used 120 or more MB when I have hardly done anything, maybe just checked for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I can be "online" even when my Airplane Mode is set to ON!&nbsp; I believed that being ON would not enable me to get online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp; Suggestions?&nbsp; I admit I am not a networking expert, I just want MY network to be MY network.&nbsp; Any help is greatly appreciated...&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">It is possible that some wireless configuration using the same address range could get pass the filtering. There could be a router that is set with the
 default IP address range. There is also a chance that the SSID could be the same - a lot of people call the network something such as Home or Wireless and the chance is there that two nearby systems could be named the same - this is more likely when the routers
 are from the same manufacturer and are left at default.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the info you referred to, I actually saw it in my research, but seeing that it apples to Win7, I didn't think it applied any longer.&nbsp; I do not have any wireless adapters or anything like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The info gives instructions on WPA or WPA2 as best defenses- I checked my router wireless page:</p>
<p>
</p><p>and this shows that WPS/WPA2 are using something called TKIP+AES, so I don't want to mess anything up by creating a "new network"- which I don't understand much about...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wouldn't this be safe enough since it is the router that is protected and they can't get through that?</p>
<p>Please help me by explaining a bit further...&nbsp; and thank you for your help!</p>

            I wouldn't worry about it until you notice that the device has been assigned an IP address. Then it is on your network and you should change your password/PIN immediately and maybe hide/change your SSID. It is probably just a device that is scanning available
 networks in the area. Also, please remove all of your screenshots for safety reasons.&nbsp;

            <p>Thanks, I got rid of the screen shots- I had erased some info before I posted but likely not enough, I appreciate you pointing it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phones and the Linux Client show up, but I don't always look at my Network.&nbsp; I do when I can, but it's kind of annoying.&nbsp; And spooks me out when I find them- almost every time I look.&nbsp; I have yet to see the 'properties' of&nbsp;anything that&nbsp;showed anything
 more than their MAC address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;Could a very simple description be this:&nbsp; They are users nearby, so when they are close enough to my router or across the street (we get very weak phone signals in my area, nearly everyone has to go outside to use a cell) then my network just happens to
 see them?&nbsp; Therefore, they are really *not* on my network, just happen to be close enough that my network 'sees' them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll sleep better if that's the dumbed down answer, and it's true.&nbsp; Would that also explain why I never see them in my list of available connections?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;Any insights, though, on why I can be online when my Airplane mode is set to 'ON'?&nbsp; Sometimes when I am getting online I will turn my connection on and forget to turn Airplane mode OFF, but I can surf away.&nbsp; he Icon in my taskbar shows the bars as usual.&nbsp;
 When I am getting offline, I'll note that I am disconnecting my connection and the Airplane mode is still ON.&nbsp; I thought that was a sure fire way of making sure you couldn't (or anybody else) actually access the Internet via my computer.&nbsp; All those things
 combined gave me my scare...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate your insights and thanks for your time, I hope you can comment just a bit further to help me get some rest at long last!&nbsp; MANY thanks!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yes, that is the gist of it. You may have even experienced it yourself, e.g. connected to the wrong wifi and not have the password to actually access the network. Makes sense if people have to leave their houses for a cellular signal as phones will try to
 connect to the strongest signal available. You can block the MAC address from getting on your network at the router if you are that afraid. But I don't think you can block the casual connection. Need more info on the airplane mode issue. Airplane mode should
 turn off cellular, wifi, and Bluetooth radios. However, you can turn on wifi, e.g. to use a plane's wifi so that is not abnormal. If you are not manually turning wifi on after turning on airplane mode and it never turns the wifi off, that is unusual. Maybe
 a newer wifi driver is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, you can change the default username and password for the Moto router. In fact, it is advisable.</p>

            <p>I got on the phone with my ISP, I am paying them after all... no help.&nbsp; They cannot help me with blocking MAC addresses, though one support guy tried, after he did, another (repeat) phone showed up in my Network folder, so it's not working to block anything.&nbsp;
 Tier 3 support says "we don't help with anything except that you have an internet connection."&nbsp; Great service.&nbsp; I did enter the MAC addresses correctly, set it to 'deny', clicked 'apply' but the phones were still showing up during and after the call to my
 ISP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did&nbsp;change the Username to the Router, at least, it took many tries for some odd reason.&nbsp; But it seems to have taken.&nbsp; I'll change the password when I have more patience- I was on the phone with them for over an hour...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far a the Airplane mode goes, I am an habitual person, so I do the same thing 99% of the time:</p>
<p>Click on my airplane icon, choose my network, check the usage (usually 0)&nbsp;and reset&nbsp;the time&nbsp;to 0, just so I don't have to look at how long since it has been offline.&nbsp; Once in a while (whether I forget is debatable) I will see lots of MBs used in the last
 x hours.&nbsp; Hmm...</p>
<p>Then I'll go right above it and click Airplane mode to OFF.&nbsp; And I am&nbsp;free to zoom all around the internet.&nbsp; Maybe it is one of those debatable occasions when I forget (though I got pretty much in the habit forming mode after years of dial-up).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get offline, I'll select my network, check the usage (I have no streaming TV or anything, and sometimes it looks suspiciously high, like 300+ MB in &lt;1 hr.), reset it to 0, and click it to OFF.&nbsp; Then, I go right above it and click Airplane mode to
 ON.&nbsp; Usually just checking email, or checking for downloads, if they are available, and new definitions are pretty small.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I somehow do forget- or however Airplane mode is ON while my Network is ON, my "bars" icon show nothing different- no little asterisk above them, just the bars.&nbsp; And I can zoom around as usual.&nbsp; It won't be until I am getting offline that I will notice
 Airlane mode is still ON.</p>
<p>And, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>at least several times a month</em></span>, I'll boot up and start my ritual, and it will show actual MB usage while my Network mode is OFF- while my computer was OFF.&nbsp; I have verified this each time.&nbsp; That's
 part of my paranoia with the phones and the Linux Client...&nbsp; (I have WU set to let me select downloads, so it's not that.)</p>
<p>So I don't understand, I thought Airplane mode to ON meant no Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very curious about your thoughts or any insights...&nbsp; I know I'm not going crazy, but I'd sure sleep better knowing someone wasn't knocking at my door :)&nbsp;

            <p>I think you have taken the steps to be more protected than you were. Although I can't say I have ever "seen" devices that I could not account for on my network, I doubt if you are under some kind of malicious attack. It sounds like you don't have a lot of
 devices on your network and the PC and router may be the extent of it. See if Resource Monitor (networking tab) helps you monitor your usage any better:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/closer-windows-resource-monitor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/closer-windows-resource-monitor/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As for airplane mode, yes, it offers a convenient way of shutting down wifi and other functions. Test it. Turn on your wifi and then enter airplane mode. It should shut the wifi off. Now turn on wifi and airplane mode should still be on. Airplane mode doesn't
 prevent you from using wifi, however.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to truly turn off your network is to turn off your router. Even if you turn off the PC, the router can be getting info from the ISP, which would be usage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't worry.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>No problem. I can get where you thought airplane mode should turn and keep everything off. That's the way it used to be on flights. &nbsp;If you have taken an airplane flight lately, it is confusing. They want you to keep laptops off til they tell you it is OK
 to power them on. Yet a tablet can be powered on all the time. Luckily they still keep the cellular phone restriction in place until take off/landing. Can you imagine the din if everyone was allowed to talk on the phone during a flight? And recently, they
 have begun to allow pay wifi on the planes for more revenue, so that is why you can use wifi in airplane mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose there is always the slim chance of some young computer genius in your area trying to hack networks for fun but you have done all you can to prevent it at this point by keeping your router secured with good username/password and MAC filtering. Good

            <p>In Win8.1 settings it clearly says that turning Airplane mode off will stop all wireless activity...&nbsp; whatever.&nbsp; Here's where I miss the simplicity of Dial-up- just pull out the phone plug :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, I have already proven the MAC filtering doesn't work, and that was with my ISP on the phone. When he escalated to tier 3, they were of absolutey no help as long as I had my internet connection up and running.&nbsp; I was tempted&nbsp; to tell him to get back
 to his GameBoy, but I was polite.&nbsp; He actually told me to contact Motorola for help.&nbsp; All during this, and after the supposed blocking, the SAME phones were showing up in my network folder.&nbsp; Same thing even after a reboot and checking the router again., verifying
 the MAC addresses were still in there and it was set to DENY.&nbsp; Even seeing the Linux Client today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not going to even bother with the password (I meant Username in my last post) of the router at this time- It kept cycling back to where it I was getting messages that the new Username was not being accepted ("try again"), and just as I was about to give
 up, I thought I'd try it (the new one) and (despite the error messages) the new one had actually taken.&nbsp; I didn't want to run into the same problem with the password and potentially lock myself out and have to reset to original settings :).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I would guess most people would be trying to hack a password, not the Username, so I felt a little vindicated.&nbsp; Odd things continue to happen (this morning 236 MB were used while my computer was off and I AM 100% CERTAIN that I shut down properly.</p>
<p>I guess I'll just monitor for damage and make sure I run Defender consistently.&nbsp; With so many loopholes in Flash, ActiveX, etc... it's hard to keep up with, but I'll do my due diligence.&nbsp; Until my ISP (as they reserve the right to do) changes my Username
 back to its default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really want to thank you for you efforts here, GOLD star in my book!&nbsp;&nbsp; And I'll keep learning along the way :)</p>
<p>MANY THANKS!</p>

    <title>windows 10 1803 and Epson scanner - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hec51  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 1803 and Epson scanner</h2>
                    When will Microsoft fix issues with updates to Windows 10 that renders printers and scanners useless. Since the update to Windows 10 version 1803 my Epson scanner-printer does not work. I have uninstalled and reinstalled Epson software, downloaded new
 drivers, did a reinstall of Windows. All has been a waste of time. I have searched Epson support which has no answers and offers the same drivers and software. I am very fortunate that I resisted the free Windows 10 update on a Windows 7 computer I have because
 that is the only way I can use my Epson printer-scanner now.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Epson Printer-Scanners do work in Windows 10, but, you'll need make a slight change to the Scanner software to make that work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Epson XP-425 had a similar issue.&nbsp; There are no problems printing, but a few months ago, the scanner either wouldn't work, or crashed after the first scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully, there is a fix with the scanner.&nbsp; If you have a desktop shortcut, right click on it and select
<strong>Pr</strong><strong>operties</strong>.&nbsp; Click on the <strong>Compatibility
</strong>tab, put a tick in the <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> tick box and click<strong> Apply.</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for the reply. I have already tried those settings as well and still no scanner. I have run out of ideas and fixes and Microsoft has no answers. As I stated previously I am fortunate I still have a working Windows 7 computer. Unless Microsoft comes
 up with a definite fix there is no answer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is more of an issue with Epson not supporting newer Windows updates rather than Windows not supporting your printer.</p>

            It's the Epson CX8400. Epson hasn't posted any new driver updates that I know of and they requested that I call support which I refuse to do for now.&nbsp;

            Printer works fine. It's a scanner problem. It'll work for a few scans and then freezes. I feel as though Epson and Microsoft are pointing fingers at each other and the consumer is the real loser. As always.

<h2>            Why am I not receiving Skype-in calls anymore on my computer&#63;</h2>
                    Need some help here, in March 2019. Focus assist is off; app is up and running; Forwarding to VM after 15 seconds is on, as always. I do not&nbsp; know if this is happening on my cell phone, because my cell phone is lost, and I am trying to use the computer
 instead! I can call out, but I'm not receiving any calls.

    <title>Can&#39;t re-add a PC to Family Safety Devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lizzymom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t re-add a PC to Family Safety Devices</h2>
                    <p>Long story short, our PC was removed from the Devices list of of the Family Safety website. We are attempting to re-add it to no avail. Creating new child accounts does not do the trick and clicking "Manage settings on the Family Safety website" does not
 add it back either. The machine id is present in the URL and we are convinced this is some kind of bug on Microsoft's part. We would very much appreciate it if this could be fixed ASAP.&nbsp; Any advice on fixing the issue is welcome.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have already tried changing the user account type from child to standard and then back to no avail. We even attempted to logon and logoff the account while it was standard user before converting it back to child in an effort to fix the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any registry settings or browser settings that could be contributing to this problem?</p>

            <p>Hi Zig,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the issue description, you are facing issues with USB devices and USB 3.0 ports are not working.&nbsp;To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would
 appreciate if you could answer the following questions: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Does the issue occur with a particular USB device?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b>Let us start with running the hardware troubleshooter and check. Follow the article mentioned below for more information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</b></a></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>If the above step does not help us to diagnose the issue, uninstall the drivers for USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller and restart the computer. Let Windows install the generic drivers and then see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open Device Manager by clicking the
<b>Start</b> button, then <b>Device Manager</b> in the search box.‌</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Look for the device under
<b>USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller</b>, <b>right click</b> on it and select
<b>Uninstall</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Reboot the computer.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On reboot, Windows 7 should re-install the drivers automatically.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope it helps. For any further Windows related assistance, feel free to contact us and we will be happy to help.</p>

    <title>Freezing bug in File Association dialog found in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnnygui  say:</h3>
<h2>            Freezing bug in File Association dialog found in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, it is worth mentioning that this freezing bug has been present since Windows 8.1 and it's still reproducible with Windows 10 Pro 16299.125 that I now have. Doing a reformat and reinstalling Windows 10 along with installing the latest Windows
 updates doesn't fix the problem. The "sfc/ scannow" doesn't show any issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occurs when using the File Association dialog in the old Control Panel, not in the new Settings app of Windows 10. It's a "soft lock" freeze that can be undone by opening the Task Manager and closing the problem causing dialog. Please see below
 for steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to reproduce the freezing bug: </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Open the old Control Panel and search for "file association" where you can change the programs associated with specific filetypes.
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/431be35e-8f8a-4dc7-b435-76e0ef22c01a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/431be35e-8f8a-4dc7-b435-76e0ef22c01a" /></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Clicking on that would give the File Association dialog:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e291f8fc-2bd6-454d-ba27-56554543a069" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e291f8fc-2bd6-454d-ba27-56554543a069" /></a></p>

<h2>            Windows update error _80004002. Haven&#39;t updated since October 2010. </h2>
                    
<p>I am running Windows Vista SP2. 64 bit. HP Desktop. Strange occurances happening here. I have only had minor issues that usually can be handled easily or, at least, with System Restore. But, even that has ceased to work now. No restore, no updating, no sound.
 It is only Windows that won't update. Adobe and the others do or did fine. But, if it says Windows or Microsoft, it ain't gonna happen. Hope someone can help!It all started when I got the dreaded WindowsUpdate error_80004002 back in October 2010. I came here
 today 2.16.11 and see loads of people have had the same problem, some fixed and some didn't. I followed some advice, such as the re-registering the .dll's and a few others. Rebooted after each one with still no luck. So, here's my story from 10.10 to 2.11....I
 wrote to MS and a tech tried to help....I have upteen (a bunch) of error messages saved. I written 2x to HP with no luck and either the tech at MS left or when they read my continuing problems they gave up. I have tried again, sending them this message.....<em>I
 have returned from my surgery and recently did everything you suggested. To refresh your memory, it was the inability to Update Windows. Nothing worked. I did everything 3 times with no luck. I did have a problem with importing the 'TrustedInstaller.reg'.
 There is a very good possibility that I was confused with what to do with it. But, now, I have run into other problems that may or may not have anything to do with the 'Windows Update' that started this whole thing.<br />
Last week, I noticed that on the Status Bar, my 'Speaker Icon' had an 'x' by it. (Attached System Audio) Received an error. (Attached SA 2). Followed by an error saying that there is no audio device. (Attached SA 3) But, there is. (Attached SA4) After being
 unable to get the computer working properly, I went to Control Panel\System and Maintenance\System and noticed on the bottom of the page that it says 'this copy of windows is not activated'. It is attached. (System Info) When I clicked on 'Activate Windows',
 I received an error message. It is attached. (System info 2) I decided to try 'System Restore'. The response is attached. (System Restore) I clicked on the recommendation. It is also attached. (System Restore 2)<br />
I have attached the 'Device Manager' so you can see what maybe I cannot (System Device Mgr 1 + 2)<br />
So, it seems as if I have some major issues since the above is not available. I, then thought to back up my files online and to start from the beginning. I do not have the disks but I do have the 'Recovery' partition on the 'D' drive.<br />
I have also attached 2 jpeg entitled 'Program Files' so, possibly you might see a file that I have that has caused issues in the past</em>.</p>
<p><br />
All the Attachments are, of course, still here, on my computer&nbsp;and I have followed everything with no luck. How can I lose the System Restore, sound etc? It is like crazy. I've deleted ever program that I do not need or that I added since Vista was a newborn.
 I've kept my Docs, Music and Pics.</p>
<p>Thanks, Matilda</p>

            <p><span>This problem usually happens when there are unmovable system files at the very end of the volume. there are multiple things you could try to work this around.<br />
1. Run the Disk Cleanup Wizard, making sure to remove the hibernation file and all restore points.<br />
2. Disable System Restore<br />
3. Disable the pagefile ( Open up System in Control Panel, then Advanced System Settings \ Advanced \ Performance \ Advanced \ Change \ No Paging File.<br />
4. Disable kernel memory dump. In the same Advanced Settings, go to Startup and Recovery \ Settings and then change the Write debugging information drop-down to “None” to disable the kernel memory dump.<br />
5. Disable Hibernation mode in your power options \ advanced power options screen.</span></p>

                    I saw a smaller surface pro 3 today at best buy. It had the core i5 and 64 GB of ram and it was black all around. It had a fan as well. What model was this? I did not know they had an 8 inch surface.

            <p>I checked around with BestBuy to see what they had and I think you saw the original Pro model and not a Pro 3. &nbsp;Some of the sales people don't know the difference and probably mis-spoke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are left over original Pro models to include the Pro 2, still brand new being sold in some stores. &nbsp;If a store can't sell them, they box them up and send them to another store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has only been one 8" model built and it was a RT model but never went to market. &nbsp;Microsoft still has those. &nbsp;Later this year during the Windows 10 rollout, you may see two tablets roll out along with it. &nbsp;The Pro 4 (12" or 14" model) and a possible
 8" model as well. &nbsp;That is a "maybe" and not confirmed.</p>

</p><p>When the original Pro model came out, a lot of them where not sold due to the price tag. &nbsp;It had nothing to do with who made them, sticker shock lost the sale. &nbsp;There will be quite a few of those left over and the same for the Pro 2. &nbsp;The Pro 3 models have
 been selling like crazy and I find those going "out of stock" in a few stores.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the i3 model itself and that rascal is just great! &nbsp;No defects and gets online instantly. &nbsp;Those are on sale now and you can check on those.</p>

            <p>I think this one is the original Pro model and if it has a silver back, then a Pro 2 which has a 10.6" screen.&nbsp; There are some of both models still floating around and are brand new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may get a good price on it or as mentioned before, the i3 model of the Pro 3 is on sale and you check it out.&nbsp; It is the 12" screen model and chances are, you can get one of those along with the keyboard for it for the same price or less than this older
 Pro model.</p>

<p>Hi BruceFromFL,</p>
<p>1) What exactly do you mean by “but it will not activate at all”?</p>
<p>2) Do you get any error message or error code?</p>
<p>Just to make sure, have you followed the method as put down here.</p>
<p>1. Open Screen Saver Settings by clicking the Start button Picture of the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type screen saver, and then click Change screen saver.</p>
<p>2. In the Screen saver dialog box, click the screen saver that you want to use, and then click OK.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-screen-saver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-your-screen-saver</strong></a></p>
<p>If that is exactly what you did and failed to get the screen saver on the desktop then I would want you to perform a System File checker scan and see if that can fix the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Run System File Checker (SFC) scan</strong>.</p>
<p>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password,
 or click Allow. <br />
2. Type the following command, and then press ENTER:</p>
<p><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></p>
<p>The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</p>

<div>Ah - A Genuine Advantage key and disk! I must admit, I thought they were </div>
<div>Full disks, rather than OEM type - but maybe not for XP.</div>
<div>When you go to System Properties, on the front page, in the Product ID, is </div>
<div>the second group -OEM- ??</div>
<div>If so, then it's an OEM -style disk, and can't be used for anything other </div>
<div>than a Clean Install.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>OTOH it may simply be because you can do a repair install of XP SP3 with XP </div>
<div>SP&lt;3 media!</div>
<div>You'd have to uninstall the SP's back to the same as the media, then do the </div>
<div>repair, then reinstall the SP's back to current, then update again.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Never having had to use WGA media I don't know whether ordinary OEM/Retail </div>
<div>disks will work with the Key provided by the WGA process.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HTH, anyway!?</div>

<p>Hi Noel,</p>
<p>Thanks for responding so quickly!:-)</p>
<p>My copy is not an OEM version.</p>
<p>I actually went through the steps to actually do the repair that I found online, and strangely it stated that the partition isn't recognized as valid. Yeah...WTF???</p>
<p>I've never heard about the WGA media thing that you're talking about, nor how to access it.</p>
<p>I can't figure out why the partition isn't recognized as valid, and I'm having the sneaking&nbsp;suspicion that I'm going to have to do a clean install. The computer takes forever to load up once it gets to the desktop wallpaper, and it hangs, and hangs, and
 then all in a burst it loads up. I'm not a novice, and I'm fanatical about not having any viruses or anything like that. I'm really at a loss here, but I would like to know what the heck is going on.</p>
<p>Thanks again for the response.</p>

<p>Don't worry about it - WGA is Windows Genuine Advantage. The disk that you have shows that it's one issued by Microsoft through the 'Get Genuine' process, after having been sold a fake Windows.</p>
<p>Very odd that you're not able to see the partition properly! Is it the only partition on the drive?</p>
<p>Is it an SP3 disk?</p>
<p>If not, then that could be your problem.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>What you stated about my media matching what I've installed has struck a chord with me. Perhaps if
 I give you some background information, then my situation might make sense.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>I had a laptop with Win XP Pro, and I then put together my own tower. Rather than go out to the store and buy the Win XP disc which would have been more expensive, I popped in the disc from the laptop, and loaded the os, and then went onto the MS Website
 to purchase the license key, and then they sent me the disc, which has Service Pack 2 installed on it. I sold the laptop, and then one of my hard drives died, which was exactly the same as the one that had my os on it, so I got all paranoid, and went out and
 purchased two new HD's, and I used Drive XML to copy everything onto the other drive. Now, everything is running, but it's running a little slow. I have lots of programs to clean up the registry, and I'm fanatical about not getting any viruses. Additionally,
 I defrag my computer regularly using Smart Defrag, but it's still a bit slow especially when I'm moving a file from my C drive to my other drive. They are SATA drives, so you'd think that they'd be a lot quicker than that.</p>
<p>My thinking is that there might be some corrupt OS files, or the settings might be off, and by replacing them with the original files it might clear things up. I used to do that with Win 98SE, and it worked a lot of the times to fix various slow downs.</p>
<p>Will I still be able to download SP3 if I have to do a clean install?&nbsp;I know just enough knowledge about computers to make myself dangerous;-P That's why I'm here to get some professional advice.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Hi everyone,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I'm having a bit of an issue that just came up out of the blue. First, my system specs:</span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">One day, Windows Update just stopped working. I received an error message like this:&nbsp;</span><br />

</p><p>You can also see the update history of when the updates started failing:</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">After digging through Google, I find that it has something to do with Windows Module Installer (TrustedInstaller). I run services.msc and find it in the list. But when I tried to start it, it gave me
 this error 1405:&nbsp;</span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I then research this error and there is very little that helped me. There was one solution that came up multiple times that helped some but not others:&nbsp;</span><br />

<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I tried this (note the example is missing a couple "f"'s for the hex but using the decimal format is correct) and I still could not get WMI to run nor does SFC /scannow:&nbsp;</span><br />
<a href="http://imgur.com/a/Rv0gq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com/a/Rv0gq</a><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">So basically, I don't know what to do at this point. Without WMI being able to start - Windows Update just doesn't work. Anyone else run into this problem have solutions I can try?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Many thanks!</span></p>

<p>Have you had any luck with this since?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been experiencing the exact same issue. I am unable to install any new game or program without receiving an error 1450 message towards the end of the installation. I've edited registry keys in regedit, tried to start the Windows Module Installer (which
 is prvented by error 1450 'not enough system resources'), its exhausting, and I have simply been unable to find any solution to it at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm no computer buff either so I've no idea what caused it or what I should do.</p>
