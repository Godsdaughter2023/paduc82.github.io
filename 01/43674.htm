            <p>There shouldn't really be any need for a default encoding, as most messages nowadays specify the character set in a
<em>Content-Type: </em>header. If you select <em>Use default encoding for all incoming messages,
</em>this header will be overridden. The 'funny symbols' you see are most probably the three-byte representation of Unicode characters displayed when using a restricted character set like Western European (Windows) to&nbsp;render a message encoded in UTF-8. Let
 the program choose the most appropriate encoding - it will usually get it right.<br />
<br />
I can't help with your printing problems -&nbsp;it sounds like a printer driver problem. Can you print successfully to the XPS printer?<br />
<br />
<br />

PS <em>I'm intrigued by the layout of your original post. It seems to have word wrap in the middle of words. Did you paste the text from some other program?</em></p>

                    Yesterday I was informed there was an important update for my Win7 ult. I installed it successfully but after installation Windows Update said the same update should be installed. I have now installed it six times, apparently successfully. Why do I have

    <title>Cancell subscription - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> agnieszkafacer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cancell subscription</h2>
                    <p>I got my son 12 month subscription on XBOX1 live. I received and email last month asking for me to update my payment options if I wish to continue with another 12 month subscription, as my bank details have changed. I did not contact Microsoft and I did
 not up date my new details, and I specifically remember cancelling auto renew last year and I selected not to store my card details??</p>
<p>Somehow my subscription was changed to auto renew, my old card details have not been removed and Microsoft have tried debit the card &amp; the payment did not go through and I spoke with my bank and they inform me that Microsoft some how gain my new visa debit
 card details and taken the payment with out my consent. I would like my subscription cancelled, as it is not letting me to cancel for 2017-2018 and I would like the cost of my subscription return asap. My bank will now block Microsoft from taking any further
 payments ever from my account and will also be requesting refund of this unauthorised payment.</p>
<p>Many thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a link on that page for Hardware, Services and Account.&nbsp; That's where you should post your question.&nbsp; Xbox isn't supported in this community.&nbsp; We are volunteers here, not Microsoft employees, so making rude demands will not likely have the result

<p>At this point Dragon Age: Inquisition is worth the sub fee for EA Access on its own IMO. So I recommend you get EA Access, and have access to a bunch of other games too. If it had been in the Vault earlier I'd have subbed, but it wasn't, so I didn't, and
 probs won't for a long time.</p>
<p>1: Yes and no. There's a variety of armour and weapons but none of them are really uh, standout special, and the way the metals look in-game... some of the armours are just odd. From what I've seen a majority of players end up crafting the Battle [X] Inquisitor's
 coat. Me included.</p>
<p>2: Yeah, I've done two single-player playthrough's and haven't even seen anything to do with the multiplayer. Save maybe the main menu changing sometimes to remind players of double XP weekends and such. I haven't even checked MP out in Twitch streams or
 let's plays... because I genuinely have not no interest, but <em>negative</em> interest in it. So less than no interest.</p>
<p>3: The world is vast [by region. Seperated by world map access and loading screens, it's not quite open world vast], and diverse, and dynamic in some instances. So like, an entire town lost to floods is drained and you walk through the seaweed covered remnants
 of it and stuff.</p>
<p>4: There are dragons with abilities ranging from electricity to fire, and ice... they all look different. So yeah, there's thirteen dragons total I believe. Don't expect the fights to be too different though. If you have a well-rounded party you can pretty
 much take on everything with the same approach. Harder difficulties don't require more skill, just more grind.</p>
<p><br />
What's good about Inquisition is it remembers its Origins roots. So it's not, "Hey, you can only be a male or female of the most common species in the setting, and your name is Hawke." You get to pick human, dwarf, elf, and Qunari. So you get to experience
 the prejudices and whatnot of certain races depending on your race, while playing, Unlike DA II... which offered nothing but a pair of action-hero shoes to fill in a action-adventure game with roleplay reduced to uh, left or right at the next action-adventure
 junction!</p>
<p><br />
I highly recommend Dragon Age: Inquisition. [=D</p>

<p>It's an amazing game really. &nbsp;I've been a long time fan. &nbsp;I played Inquisition and Witcher 3 and it's truly a toss up in my opinion. &nbsp;I got the same level of enjoyment from both. &nbsp;There are a ridiculous number of parallels too, which I found amusing. &nbsp;Inquisition
 has all the elements of a perfect rpg with an incredibly huge world, characters that are extremely well created and a very memorable story. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll agree with the comment above about armor. &nbsp;I learned to save just before a major armor purchase because some of the most expensive armors look hilarious once equipped.</p>

<p>Yeah I have a few more questions</p>
<p>4. Is there a lot of dynamic dialogue?</p>

<p>4: When you're not fighting in battles, or exploring the beautifully designed environments, you'll be engaged in reams of dialogue with companions... if you choose to show an interest in any of them that is. You can skip through it or ignore them all if
 that's your jazz.</p>
<p>Getting to know them opens up new quests, sometimes new areas, and y'know... you're more engaged.</p>
<p>5: Options for customising Skyhold include changing the throne, bed, banners, curtains/drapery/rugs, stained-glass windows etc. But they're chosen by theme. So Warden themes, Elven themes, Inquisition themes. You can chop and change themes, so you can have
 a Mage throne, with Dalish drapery, Chantry banners etc.</p>
<p>But it ain't The Sims, you won't be choosing where to put your throne, and... TV.</p>
<p>6: Depending on which faction you choose to side with the enemies are different on different play-throughs. So if you side with Templars you'll be fighting a small amount of Red Templars, and a lot of Mages/Tevinter forces and mercs. If you side with the
 Mages you'll be fighitng a ton of Red Templars [mutant-type magically resistant dudes] and the occasional apostates/Tevinter mages.</p>
<p>Then there's the dragons, wyverns, giants, giant bears, giant spiders, spirits, undead... and of course a metric eff-ton of demons, rage demons, fear demons, pride demons, hunger, sloth, pride demons.</p>
<p>According to the X1 stats I've done 282 hours across the base game and two add-ons, in two play-throughs. So... it's not lacking content or appeal for me, apparently. Heh ha. {XD</p>

<p>Just throw my hat in the ring to say this game was awesome, especially for my first RPG on the Xbox One. It seemed to have everything and nothing was overly frustrating or annoying.</p>
<p>The Witcher 3 was a much better RPG overall though, but there aren't many RPG's that compere against that, it really was something different, pretty much raised the bar for RPG's imo.</p>

    <title>How to revert back to older transpency effect from Acrylic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> -mkanet-  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to revert back to older transpency effect from Acrylic transparency on Win10 Fall update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The new "Acrylic" transparency effect for Windows 10 modern apps and Start Menu is way too too opaque.&nbsp; It looks almost as bad as turning transparency completely off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to revert back to the older transparency effect in Windows 10?&nbsp; The whole point of transparency is to be able to tell what's "behind" windows that are on top.&nbsp; Its not really possible to do that anymore with the almost opaque Acrylic transparency
 effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't appear there is any builtin ways to do this.&nbsp; Maybe, it's possible to use a 3rd party tool like Aero Tweaker or something like that?&nbsp; Thanks in advance!</p>

            I read your question and i think we have the same issue, Acrylic is actually not working on some devices like mine, is not an opacity matter, even with the official Fall Creators Update release installed. Did you fixed it already?

<p>Mine is working correctly.&nbsp; It looks like it does in the Windows 10 Fall Creators screenshot of the start menu and modern apps.&nbsp; I was just complaining that I didn't think it was an improvement.&nbsp; I'm not sure why they can't just offer the ability to switch
 between Acrylic and standard transparency (with the ability adjust blur intensity).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What kind of display adapter do you have?&nbsp; I'm guessing the <span>display adapter
</span>drivers you're using may not have support for it yet.&nbsp; Maybe (if you haven't already tried) upgrade to the latest drivers directly from the manufacturer's website.&nbsp; Possibly, your video card my not support Acrylic if its too old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I kind of got used to the Acrylic look.&nbsp; I think Win10 still looks WAY better than what WinXP, Win7 and OSX11 looks like (Acrylic look and all).</p>

<p>However, since removing it and re-inserting it, my PC (Running Windows 10) does not recognise it, although the sound occurs when I add it. I've tried updating the driver etc, but to no avail. I;ve even inserted it into other PCs but still the same thing

    <title>What would prevent a local administrator from changing local - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zfurd  say:</h3>
<h2>            What would prevent a local administrator from changing local policy&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The problem is occurring on an XP (svc pk 3) workstation within a W2K3 domain. It is the only workstation (out of 103 others) to which I cannot remote into via mstsc from my administrator workstation (also running XP svc pk 3). I went (walked over to) to
 the workstation and logged on as a local admin, then fired-up gpedit so I could change the local User Rights policy for "Deny logon through Terminal Services"&nbsp;to remove the Everyone group. But both buttons were grayed-out (Add User or Group, and Remove). After
 checking several other local policy settings I found that they too had their buttons grayed out. I then tried the same thing logged in as a domain admin. No joy. Same problem.&nbsp;I couldn't change the local policy settings via my domain administrator account
 or via the local administrator account. So I checked the Default Domain Policy as well as&nbsp;all of the&nbsp;policies assigned to the OU in which the problem workstation account resides. All of those policies had the "Deny logon through Terminal Services" set to "Not
 defined".&nbsp; Is it possible that one of our administrators changed permissions on a registry key where the policy settings reside such that only he could change local policy on that box? Or is there another explanation?</p>

<p>If you do your research, you'll see that PS3 has A LOT more issues with hacking then 360. Just google "PS3 Hacked" and you'll see for yourself

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding your issue, your Fifa game cannot be hacked as far as&nbsp;I know, if&nbsp;that has happened then that is due to someone getting hold of your account details (which you are responsible for). If you feel that this was done in error, then you will need to
 contact EA, as they are the ones responsible for your in-game stats, not Microsoft</p>

            Does this happen on all web pages or just 1 specific webpage? It seems specific to youtube. In which case, youtube may just be down for a bit.

            Hi Lesley, 
<br />
<br />Click start - Settings - Apps - Find Google Chrome - click on it, and uninstall. Once done, reboot. 
<br />
<br />Then, go to www.google.com/chrome - and download and install fresh.

<br />Are you getting this error on all websites or just some websites?
<br />
<br />If it is all websites:
<br />
<br />Uninstall Chrome
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />On the view ribbon, temporarily turn on 'Hidden Items'
<br />
<br />Navigate to (replace username with your login name):
<br />
<br />C:\Users\username\AppData\Local
<br />
<br />Delete the Google folder form inside local
<br />
<br />Go to this link, then download and install the newest version of Chrome:

    <title>Windows 10 Spotlight Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> muhammad-imran  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Spotlight Problem</h2>
                    <p>I have windows spotlight enabled on my laptop, it was working properly until a week ago it didn't change the background picture, i searched on the internet, the solution i found was to delete the contents on asset folder inside Microsoft.windows.ContentDeliveryManager-----
 , by mistake i deleted the whole content of .ContentDeliveryManager folder, now i am stuck with a single image on lock screen and there are no apps showing or anything. how do i restore windows spotlight.</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

            <p>it seems that you didnt read the whole thing that i wrote, kindly read it and try to understand what the problem is, i know from where i can turn on or off the spotlight feature, my question is
<strong>I deleted the contents of "microsoft.windows.contentDeliveryManager" folder, inside the user/appdata/local/packages folder, instead of deleting the contents of only the "asset" folder inside&nbsp;</strong><strong>"microsoft.windows.contentDeliveryManager"

If your Vista Operating System came preinstalled it is classified as an OEM Licence and&nbsp;all Support for it&nbsp;comes from your Computer Manufacturer, not Microsoft.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;you bought an OEM Disk/Licence yourself, the same conditions apply re Support; as you become the System Builder.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 restart loop- can&#39;t fix</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated to Windows 10 and like a lot of people I got stuck in the restart loop. I can get to my desktop for a few minutes but the computer takes forever to load now so I can't do anything before it restarts again. The computer has restarted over
 10 times now and it won't go into automatic recovery either. How can I fix this?</p>

<h3> adamjbsc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unidentified network&#59; No internet access - tried all other solutions.  Help&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've got the dreaded 'Unidentified network; No internet access' message, however the problem has only just started with my laptop running Windows 7 and only arises when using the wireless and trying to connect to my home broadband. &nbsp;My laptop is fine when
 connected to the home broadband through a network cable and also works wirelessly when connected to via mobile phone tethering.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried as many of the solutions I can find on the net without success. &nbsp;So far I've tried (individually, not together):</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) &nbsp;Running Windows troubleshooter - no problems identified.</div>
<div>2) &nbsp;Reset winsock, reset ipv4, reset ipv6 - no change</div>
<div>3) &nbsp;Clean boot - same problem once clean booted.</div>
<div>4) &nbsp;Deleting network adapter in Device Manager and rebooting to allow Windows to reinstall via plug n play - no change.</div>
<div>5) &nbsp;Downloading and installing latest driver software for my network adapter (Realtek RTL8191SE Wireless LAN 802.11n PCI-E NIC), both via Windows and by going to the Realtek website - no change.</div>
<div>6) &nbsp;System restore to about a month ago, ie way before the problem started - no change</div>
<div>7) &nbsp;Checked ping via Command Prompt and the laptop gets nothing unless it's wired or mobile tethered.</div>
<div>8) &nbsp;Disabled and re-enabled the network adapter - no change.</div>
<div>9) &nbsp;Disabled Bonjour service in msconfig - no change.</div>
<div>10) Disabled Windows Firewall - no change.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I think that's everything I've tried. &nbsp;Just to add, the router seems fine as we have other devices in the house and they all connect fine, both wired and wirelessly.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only other thing I thought was about Java. &nbsp;I was getting annoyed with Java and (probably stupidly) uninstalled it not long before this problem occurred. &nbsp;However, since the problem arose I've reinstalled it incase that was the problem and it's changed
 nothing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can anyone suggest anything else please? &nbsp;I'm not a techie so please give any instructions in 'Dummies guide...' speak!!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance.</div>
                </div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I've been annoyed by this unidentified network for a while.&nbsp; I'd like to brought up my solution here for everyone who tried the following but failed,<br />
<br />
1. disabled Bonjour service, i.e. ##Id_String... <br />
2. resetting TCP/IP stack<br />
3. reinstalling network drivers<br />
4. removed McAfee (poor McAfee, Daddy gives you a hug.. , looks like everyone wants to disable your agent)<br />
5. disabled IPV6<br />
6. route delete 0.0.0.0<br />
...<br />
<br />
The reason behind this is that Win7/Win8 broadcasts packets with IGMP (please correct me here).&nbsp; But the old switch/firewall/router blocks the IGMP packets.&nbsp; Win7 will not be able to recognize the network and consider it's within an 'unidentified network'.<br />
<br />
Please try to 'unplug' your network cable and plug it back again during the gateway PING.&nbsp; You might see your network would be back for a while, depends on how fast your switch/firewall/router starts to ignore and block the packets.&nbsp; Sometimes you might get
 a few minutes to get the network back.<br />
<br />
My suggestions to this problem,<br />
1. If you have host-based firewall installed (PC Tools, McAfee... etc.), try to make it transmit IGMP packets, or tried to disable it first.&nbsp; As for default Windows Firewall, disable it is irrelavent, just leave it as it is.<br />
2. make your switch/firewall/router to transmit IGMP packets.&nbsp; Most likely is the hardware firewall blocks the IGMP packets.&nbsp; Or try to enable the IGMP for firewall enabled routers.<br />
<br />
Why&nbsp; IGMP packets need to be used in Win7/Win8? I guess it's for Audio/Video Streaming broadcasting, since it's in great demand for current internet content.&nbsp; But those packets would be blocked by old firewall/router and considered them as snooping attacks.<br />

            Thanks for the reply Chih. &nbsp;I'm afraid I'm not too tech-savvy so I'm not sure how to change the IGMP packet settings. &nbsp;In any event, the router works fine with all other devices in the home, both Win7 devices and non-Win7 devices so it's not likely to
 be a problem with the router is it?
<div><br />
<div>The problem has also got worse. &nbsp;Initially the only problem was with WLAN connection between my laptop and the router. &nbsp;Wired connection to the router worked and mobile tethering worked. &nbsp;However, as of yesterday, wired connection to the router has stopped,
 giving the same 'Unidentified network' message. &nbsp;Mobile tethering still works though. &nbsp;And all other devices in the home connect fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do you think a Win7 reinstall would work?</div>

            Can you do test for me? I am not sure how many IPs can get from the WAN, i.e. your ISP.&nbsp; I'd like to test that connect your laptop directly to your router.&nbsp; And the rest of the devices connect at the back of the other router/wireless router.<br />
<br />
So it would looks like...<br />
<br />
[ISP's router] -&gt; (real IP) -&gt; notebook w/ Win7<br />
[ISP's router] -&gt; (real IP) -&gt; [wired/wireless AP] -&gt; [NAT] -&gt; other devices<br />
<br />
- OR - (same topology, but in real case)<br />
<br />
[ISP's 5-port ATU-R]<br />
port #1: plug to notebook w/ Win7, set as DHCP, or fixed IP<br />
port #2: plug to wireless AP, connect to rest of the devices.<br />
<br />
I strongly suspect that hardware (i.e. router/firewall) is the key which caused Win7 sent out packets that can't be recognized.&nbsp; That is why we are doing the test for.<br />
<br />
If you can list out the devices, I might be able to have detailed topology for you.<br />
<br />
Hope that will help,<br />
<br />

            Hi Chih - thanks for your help with this.
<div><br />
<div>I've stumbled across the solution though this morning when another laptop started to have the same problem with the router.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This led me to consider the problem might be with the router rather than the laptop. &nbsp;A help topic on my ISPs website (Sky Broadband) suggested I perform a factory reset on the router (I'd previously turned the power off to the router and that hadn't worked).
 &nbsp;For anyone else with this problem using a Sky Broadband router, the factory reset button is on the back of the router but for my version (white Netgear box) you need a small implement to press it (I used a toothpick).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Having performed this reset my connection to the laptop has now been restored. &nbsp;So frustrating that the amount of hours I spent on my laptop trying to resolve this problem and the problem was with the router all along!!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for you help though.</div>
        </p>

            I'm glad to hear that you've solved the problem.&nbsp; It's really frustrated that the network disconnected suddently and you don't know how to fix it.&nbsp; I am not sure if Microsoft is able to fix this problem.&nbsp; I used to blame Lenovo X200 notebook support, and
 I strongly asked them to replace the motherboard after I reinstall a customised Windows 7 Ultimate specificly for X200 model without network connection.&nbsp; The problem I understand now is caused by the incompatibility between Win7 and netscreen firewall.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I mounted OneDrive and sometimes the folders/files appear, sometimes not. But I get notification "OneDrive operation taking to long" option "Abort" Click Abort and minute later same message, over and over, even with notifications in Do Not Disturb mode.
 Unchecked all apps in the setting (no OneDrive is listed however) and still it pops up. Only way to stop is to CLOSE OneDrive in Files and/or disable totally by turning it off in Extentions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also use Box and it works as expected even though there is much more there to sync then in OneDrive. Mention this cause some asked if there Chromebook OneDrive was doing any syncing. If it is, and I dont know how to check on this, and the sync operation
 is indeed the root problem then sync must be terribly terribly slow and/or buggy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Side not, I have other cloud storage accounts like MEGA. Anyone know how to add these to Files?</p>

            ChromeBooks run Chrome OS. Could you clarify if you are actually running Windows 10?
<br />
<br />Right click the OneDrive icon in your Taskbar
<br />Click the Vertical (three dots menu), click Quit OneDrive
<br />
<br />Restart then sign in again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, uninstall OneDrive completely then sign in.

<p>No, I'm having issue with onedrive on Chromebook (chromebook/onedrive forum is no more and told to post on windows forum). Details of problems and what I have unsuccessfully tried (per stuff read on web) are in original post. If more info needed, will be
 happy to provide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like to ask question about most frustrating pop-up /drop down menu that appeared few months ago and can not find way to disable. It's square with diagonal arrow pointing up and to right. It's next to star in address bar. After a search and chose site, it
 comes up, says open with, and list of apps appear. I would so so much welcome help to disable. Thanks</p>

            You would be better to sign in with a local account if your laptop is not connected to the Internet all the time . . .
<br />
<br />Go to the Settings App
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-In Options
<br />Choose to sign in with a local Account rather than a Microsoft Account
<br />
<br />Then you will be able to sign into your laptop all the time like in previous versions of Windows!
