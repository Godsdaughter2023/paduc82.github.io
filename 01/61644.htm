<h2>            CD&#47;DVD drive not working after installing Vista Service Pack 2</h2>
                    <p>I have Vista Home Premium. After downloading and installing Service Pack 2, my CD/DVD drive is not able to detect a disc. It was working fine before the install (I just burned a cd a few hours before). I have already tried uninstalling/reinstalling the drivers
 for the drive and that did not work. I also edited the registry, and those drivers automatically reinstalled, but that did not solve the problem either. I have already tried Microsoft FixMe, that didn't work either. It keeps telling me to insert a disc when
 there is already a disc in the drive. It will not read cds, dvds, or blank discs.

            Can you use a bootable CD or DVD to try and boot up and see if it is a Windows issue vs a hardware issue?

            I am not sure what a bootable CD is. However, I am sure that it is a Windows issue. I was able to use the drive a few hours before the service pack install, and unable to immediately following the install.

            <p>Yeah - coincidences never happen.&nbsp; ;-)</p>
<p>A bootable CD/DVD is like the Windows installation CD/DVD or a Linux Live CD (<a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Ubuntu</a> is a nice and easy one to download and create.)</p>
<p>When you go into the BIOS, do you see the CD/DVD drive in there?</p>
<p>Did you try installing the latest motherboard chipset drivers - not CD/DVD?</p>
<p>Did you see if there were any firmware updates for the CD/DVD drive you have?</p>
<p>Did you try uninstalling the service pack and then using System Restore to go back to the time before you installed the service pack (both things, in that order)?</p>

<p>What says "No more updates are available"?&nbsp; WIndows Vista?&nbsp; Microsoft did not manufacture nor do they support your CD/DVD drive.&nbsp; That support comes from the CD/DVD drive manufacturer and that is where you should be going to get drivers and/or
 firmware updates.&nbsp; In device manager, what drive does it say you have?</p>
<p>You said you uninstalled the CD/DVD drivers and reinstalled them - the motherboard is no different - if you knew what you were doing before, this is just another device to download the latest drivers for and install.&nbsp; Do not depend on Windows
 Vista (or Microsoft) for your drivers - again - they did not make the device and do not directly support them.&nbsp; Go to the source.&nbsp; You could run Belarc Advisor to figure out the individual hardware components OR you could&nbsp;let us in on&nbsp;the make/model of the
 computer in question and probably get pointed to the place to get said drivers.</p>
<p>What about the BIOS... When you turn on your machine there is likely something that says, "Press ___ to enter the system setup" or something similar.&nbsp; What does it say it detects the CD/DVD drive as?</p>
<p>You can easily make one on another system (if you have another available) by downloading and burning a copy of

Why are you unmounting to convert to ntfs?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, point to <strong>
All Programs</strong>, point to <strong>Accessories</strong>, and then click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</li><li>At the command prompt, type the following, where <var>drive letter</var> is the drive that you want to convert:
<div><span>convert <var>drive letter</var>: /fs:ntfs</span></div>
For example, type the following command to convert drive E to NTFS:
<div><span>convert <var>e</var>: /fs:ntfs</span></div>
<b>Note</b> If the operating system is on the drive that you are converting, you will be prompted to schedule the task when you restart the computer because the conversion cannot be completed while the operating system is running. When you are prompted, click
<strong>YES</strong>.</li><li>When you receive the following message at the command prompt, type the volume label of the drive that you are converting, and then press ENTER:
<div>The type of the file system is FAT.<br />
Enter the current volume label for drive <var>drive letter</var></div>
</li><li>When the conversion to NTFS is complete, you receive the following message at the command prompt:
<div>Conversion complete</div>
</li><li>Quit the command prompt.</li></ol>

<p>Hi Shawn</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You for your reply, I failed to clarify my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one computer, desktop connected the the internet, and one old computer that I wish to extract some files from.</p>
<p>The old computer wont send or download these files to the USB stick, any one of many blank ones I insert for this purpose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I insert a disc as directed, but it shows i have not done this</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Australia we connect to the internet by the new NBN system, which is third world, and my carrier, Telstra, has more complaints about lack of connectivity and service than any service provider in the World, so I am very reluctant to connect this old one
 to the net and attempt to email files to my current one.</p>

    <title>USB Mouse Driver Problem. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris dziak  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Mouse Driver Problem.</h2>
                    
<p>Recently my USB mouse stopped working on my Windows 7 desktop computer.&nbsp;In order to solve this problem I first tried using a different USB port. When moving the mouse to a new USB port, Windows would try to install the driver for my device but it would fail,
 and the mouse would not work. I then uninstalled all the USB drivers using device manager, restarted so that windows could reinstall the drivers. After reboot and reinstallation of the drivers I tried plugging in the mouse to no avail. I then went to my motherboard
 manufacturer's website to get the USB driver from there. After installation and reboot, I tried the mouse again, to no avail.&nbsp;I believe I am running a 64-bit version if windows 7 premium of that helps.</p>
<p>Some additional&nbsp;key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>My mouse worked a couple of days ago. </li><li>I tried System restore, also to no avail. </li><li>I have tried two different mouse (mice) </li><li>Other USB devices work fine (such as my printer). </li><li>When I first plug in the mouse and windows is trying to make it work (so to speak), the mouse will be able to move for a second or so, and then I get the error and the cursor freezes.</li></ul>
<p>Thanks for the help</p>

<h2>            Unauthorized purchased that does not show up in purchase history</h2>
                    <p>I received an email about a $25 Skype credit purchase, and then a second email saying that my "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Skype Credit balance" of $33.79 is now active. The
 purchase was done through paypal and I was charged for it so it did happen -- though I did not make this purchase. I noticed that Skype was an approved creditor in Paypal so I immediately deactivated that. I also changed my Microsoft password since clearly
 someone had fraudulently accessed my account.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I also changed the password on my Paypal account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>My question is why does this $25 purchase, and the supposed "Skype Credit balance" not show up when I look&nbsp;at my purchase history in Skype ?&nbsp; If someone did access
 my account and use the linked paypal account to buy Skype credit, you would think I would see this transaction. This makes me wonder where this supposed credit actually is and if they created some parallel account or something that still has access to my paypal
 account?&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

            Hi SandraVerthein 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Most likely you are using a different ID to login. You need to use your Skype ID not mail ID to login to Skype. Microsoft has been moving all to a single Microsoft Account based services including Skype. Hence, a new Skype ID seems to have been given to you on the basis of your Microsoft Account. So, when you use your mail ID to login, it gets into new Skype ID. Your Microsoft account, in this case, gets 2 Skype IDs attached - this new ID which is default now and your old Skype ID. 
<br />
<br />Just use your Skype ID as user name.  You will find your transactions.

<h2>            I get an error code 800736B3 while installing Windows Update.</h2>
                    Keep getting error 800736B3. I've tried multiple fixits, a clean boot, disabling Norton antivirus/firewall. So far nothing has seems to work.
<br />
<br />
It seems to fail installing a new version of the Windows Update Software itself. <br />
<br />
Running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit with SP1 installed. <br />
<br />
Is there a way to wipe out the windows update SW and fully reinstall it? Or is there another trick I can try?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />
1) The error message I get is: Windows could not search for new updates. An error occurred while checking for new updates for your computer.<br />
Errors found:<br />
Code 800736B3 Windows Updated encountered an unknown error.<br />
<br />
2) It appears all updates since 6/14 have failed. These are Windows updates (I see MS Office updates that have completed successfully). There are too many to list, but the main one seems to be:<br />
Windows Update Agent 1.6.7600.256 <br />
There are lost of others, a few are:<br />
KB2732500<br />
KB2729094<br />
KB27199985<br />
KB2722497<br />
<br />
3) The one change that seems to coincide with this problem starting is that I downloaded and installed two items on 6/14:<br />
Update for MS Windows KB2709981<br />
Windows Internet Explorer 9<br />
I have heard that IE 9 can cause problems; could this be it?<br />
<br />
Method 1: I ran this fixit (and I've run many other versions, it seems). They find a problem and claim to have fixed it, but not so.<br />
<br />
Method 2: See above. I can send a longer list if you want, but I think the basic problem is that the update to windows update doesn't work.
<br />
<br />
Method 3: Did this, it ran fine and show successful installation. But I still can't install updates.<br />
<br />
Method 4: Ok, I haven't done all these yet. It's a bit daunting, but if that's the fix, fine. I'm wondering though, if removing IE 9 first might be a good move?<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help. <br />

<div><br />
<div>Thanks, I've done all of these before and I just went through them all once again. They all complete, but none fixes the problem. I've also run a pile of different MS fixit programs (see above entry). They all claim to have found and fixed the problem,
 but still no luck.
<div><br />
<div>It isn't failing installing the updates; it's failing updating the update program itself.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>This problem started with the installation of IE 9. Should I try to remove it? All the replies so far have pointed to various fixes, but no one has commented on IE9.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there a way to remove and then reinstall the entire MS update system? I suspect that might fix it.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Writing in the gray text box on Surface Pro 4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mela1965  say:</h3>
<h2>            Writing in the gray text box on Surface Pro 4</h2>
                    When I start writing in the gray text box, I can't write a whole word.&nbsp; I get the first letter in and it inputs that and then wants to start a new word.&nbsp; All I'm using it for is OneNote.&nbsp; Is this a problem with OneNote or the Surface?

            <p>I am unable to do screen shot with the pen as when I double click the pen, the gray box automatically disappears. I tried doing q screenshot using the buttons but was unsuccessful. Plus I do not have&nbsp;a key board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote this entire message in the gray box and did Not have a problem. I have 5 new Surface 4's and all do the same thing when writing in OneNote. I also tried using the gray box for writing in a cell in Excel and had the same problem. So if You open a
 spreadsheet and activate a cell and try to use the gray box to do text to type I suspect you will be able to recreate my problem and see what I am talking about.</p>

            <p>I contacted MS and first talked to Office365 support.&nbsp; After running a repair on 365, they decided that it was definitely an issue with Surface Pro 4.&nbsp; They connected me to SP4 support and after a remote session and determining that the problem only happens
 when there is a cell entry in either Excel or OneNote, they decided that it really was an issue with O365.&nbsp; I imagine that anyone that has a SP4 can duplicate the problem as I have the problem on 5 of the tablets that I have bought in the last 2 months.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you open Excel with the gray handwriting box open try to write in a cell from the gray box.&nbsp; If you have OneNote open, finger touch in an open page to get the blinking cursor with the circle on bottom.&nbsp; Then attempt to write in the gray box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say you want to write the word "Ask."&nbsp; When you make the up and down stroke of the A and then lift the pen to make the - through the center, the /\ will be entered at the blinking cursor typically as a ^.&nbsp; Then a space will be inserted after the ^
 and you have to backspace in the gray box to start over.&nbsp; Once you start over, you can write as normal and everything is fine.&nbsp; But 100% of the time, to be able to write a complete sentence or complete word requires backspacing over that initial mark.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last person that I talked to at MS said they would pass the issue along to the technical support of O365 and I posted the problem on one of their message boards where you have votes.&nbsp; I have had no response there yet.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow there is a problem with the programs working together.&nbsp; I imagine it is a software problem with O365 on the way it wants to enter information from an input.</p>

            <p>1st you should check if your band on xbox.com . If that doesn't work you should restart your Xbox. Finally if that doesn't work just call Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Is there a driver available for Windows 8 for a Lexmark Z705 printer&#63; Lexmark says Microsoft has refigured their printer functions such that Lexmark designed drivers won&#39;t work.</h2>
                    I just got a new HP&nbsp;ENVY m4 laptop with Windows 8. My older printer is a Lexmark Z705. When I hooked it up to the new computer, it came up listed on the hardware screen, but showed "driver unavailable". The Lexmark website stated that Windows 8 refigured
 the printer functions in such a manner that Lexmark could not configure a driver for this printer to work with Windows 8, and indicated that Microsoft did have or would have a suitable driver available for download. Any info?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Lexmark X5340, and was eventually able to get it to work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two things that don't work though...the ink level display that pops up when printing, and the voice that says Printing Started and Printing Complete.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have already tried to install your printer, go to Devices and Printers, and REMOVE it, before uninstalling and reinstalling your software. This will fail otherwise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use your OEM installation CD...it has more features than anything you will download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open or Explore the CD, do not Autorun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right Click on SETUP, and select Properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the Compatibility Tab at the top and check the box for Compatibility Mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I used XP SP3 for mine, and it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Double Click Setup to install when ready.</p>

There are no Windows 7 or Windows 8 drivers for that printer.<br />

As OEM&nbsp;Lexmark is responsible for the proper operation of the printer and their<br />
supplied drivers. Check with&nbsp;Lexmark Support, their on-line documentation, and <br />
drivers.<br />
<br />
Good chance you need to update or re-install the latest available drivers which<br />
"might" work and use the methods in the lower section below.<br />

<b>Compare</b><span>&nbsp;</span>the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to<br />
<b>Visit</b><span>&nbsp;</span>the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).<br />
If there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program<br />

 sure. Only last update had to give me an application error 0xc0000142 for third party software such as GOOGLE and F-SECURE ANTIVIRUS. Seems MS is going the phone way.</strong></p>

<h2>            Error code 0xc000000e&#58; The boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible.  Happens when selecting &#34;Repair&#34; option only.</h2>
                    I am getting the Error code 0xc000000e: The boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible.&nbsp; Happens when selecting "Repair" option only and only since imaging a new drive and installing the new drive.&nbsp; The new drive has the same partitions
 as the old drive (the root and the Recovery partitions are larger than the original, but the contents were not changed) and the system partition seems to be the same.<br />
<br />
I have an HP Pavilion dv7 custom built unit running Win 7 64bit OS.<br />
<br />
I started having issues with my computer just turning off and then rebooting again, or, having the screen freeze with a strange horizontal pattern, and since my primary drive only had 1% free space left on it, I purchased a new 1TB hybrid drive and imaged it
 and installed it.<br />
<br />
I'm still having the same problems with the computer rebooting on its own or freezing up, so I think that problem is hardware related (I'll be contacting HP tomorrow), but the issue of the error code doesn't appear to be hardware related.&nbsp; It's as if Win7 can't
 find the Recovery partition on the hard drive.<br />
<br />
I created the Windows 7 Repair Disc from this computer and I can't get the PC to look to the DVD drive to attempt another repair.<br />
<br />
I tried to create the Recovery Disc set from my computer and I successfully burned disc 1 of 2 and it was verifying that disc when my computer rebooted itself.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my issue here is that I need to get my computer to not get this error when trying the "Repair" option.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to point the OS to look again to the Recovery partition on my root HD or at least have it recognize the Repair Disc or the Recovery Disc (1of2) so that I can attempt a repair again?<br />
<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />

            You can test <b>reagentc /info</b> on a command line of your normal Windows 7 (before it hangs) to check its opinion about your recovery partition. &nbsp;The important line is the BCD-ID if everything else is plausible. &nbsp;After that ask
<b>bcdedit</b>, if there is a <i>recoverysequence</i>; it should have the same ID, and it should be
<i>recoveryenabled Yes</i>. &nbsp;You could also try <b>reagentc /boottore</b> followed by a reboot, if everything is okay that should once boot the recovery RAM-disk image in the recovery partition.

When I type in, "reagentc /info" in the Command Prompt window, I get the following message:&nbsp; "This command can only be executed from an elevated command prompt."&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure what that means as I've never seen it before, but it seems to not allow me to type
 in these commands.<br />
<br />
I typed the same command into the "search programs and files" search box and it seemed to do something and now the ShutDown button has an exclamation point and says that updates will be installed when I shut down.&nbsp; I hope this doesn't cause any issues as I'm
 having enough already.<br />
<br />
I'll comment back here on this thread when/if my computer reboots and I can get back online.<br />
<br />
Please let me know how to get to the "elevated command prompt" location.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            I'm sure the reboot did something, but I've had two or three crash failures with the horizontal screen patterns.&nbsp; Hoping HP can help fix this computer, but so far, I think it's a Microsoft Windows 7 issue.&nbsp; Too many things are not working that should not
 be hardware related and appear to be operating system related.&nbsp; Would be nice if Microsoft would come through on this one with a repair fix for me.&nbsp; My computer did not come with system discs and when I burn my own, I get a Win7 error message that the discs
 are not usable on my hardware, yet they are made from this computer.<br />

That only means that you need a command prompt with admin rights, normal users are not supposed to modify the next reboot into a recovery reboot (after all pressing F8 should do this.) &nbsp;When you right click on "command prompt" in the "accessories" of the start
 menu it will offer "run as administrator". &nbsp;When you do that you get the special UAC pop-up asking you for an admin password, or if you are already logged in as administrator you can simply click OK or CANCEL. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The point of this exercise is that malware cannot hide the "elevation", it also cannot bypass the special pop-up by some kind of automatical OK. &nbsp;</div>

            Hi Omniplex. <br />
I tried your suggestions above, using the right click on command prompt admin thing and it worked.<br />
The <i>recoverysequence</i>; had the same ID, and the <i>recoveryenabled was Yes</i>.&nbsp; I tried the
<b>reagentc /boottore</b> followed by a reboot, but got the same error screen stating that the drive is it accessable.<br />
<br />
I finally got HP to get a case started to see what they think is the problem.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you have any other ideas or things I might be able to check, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

Not really, sorry, but after reading&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">[[en:w:Hybrid_drive]]</a>&nbsp;I'm certainly curious how booting Windows 7 vs. Windows RE works with your disk. &nbsp; When I check<b> reagentc /info</b> on my box it tells me that
 the <b>WinRE.WIM</b> folder is<span>&nbsp;<b>\\?\GLOBALROOT\device\harddisk0\partition1\Recovery\</b></span><span><b>WindowsRE</b></span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>The command<b> list volume</b> in <b>diskpart</b> displays a list of all volumes incl. the recovery partition, in my case volume 4 is listed as "recovery" and "hidden". &nbsp;After
<b>select volume=4</b> and<b> assign letter=R</b> &nbsp;and<b> exit</b> (from <b>diskpart</b>) &nbsp;I can
<b>dir /A: R:\recovery\WindowsRE\*</b> to see the<b> boot.sdi </b>(2009-06-10, 3,170,304 bytes) and the<b> WinRE.WIM</b> (2010-06-22, &nbsp;168,389,598 bytes). &nbsp;The dates and sizes can be different for you, but if you don't have these files BOOTMGR can't boot the
 RAM disk image of the recovery console.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>The commands <b>select volume=R</b>&nbsp;(example) and&nbsp;<b>remove letter=R</b> followed by<b> exit</b> in
<b>diskpart</b> do what you'd expect. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>

            Omniplex,<br />
Thanks for all of this information.<br />
I'll check out the info on my partition and see if there is an issue with the recovery partition.<br />
I'm beginning to think that the Win7 OS has been hosed as I can't boot in SAFE Mode and my computer continues to crash.&nbsp; It just took a huge crash and I thought the PC or hard drives were done for, but it finally booted back up after a repair attempt (with
 Repair DVD that the repair didn't work) but after several attempts to reboot, the PC did finally reboot.<br />
<br />
I was having these crash issues with the original 160GB SS drive and I purchased a Seagate Hybrid 1TB drive and used Apricorn Upgrade Suite to copy/image the SS drive to the new Hybrid drive.&nbsp; Apricorn says that their software creates all of the logical drives
 and all partitions and increases the size of the root or c: partition with the remaining disc space of the new drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; The image seemed to work OK as the computer booted up without issue with the new drive installed, but I just can't seem to get it to point
 to the recovery partition or wherever the OS goes to find the repair files.<br />
<br />
It's been very frustrating, to say the very least.<br />
<br />
I will try to look into your info in your post above, but if you have any other suggestions, please let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks again or all of your input!<br />
<br />

Omniplex is trying to give me some high level technical help here.&nbsp; I am pretty sure I know what he/she is trying to say, but if you have no idea what he/she is talking about, then perhaps this thread is a bit too technical for you to understand.&nbsp; I have to
 think about what he/she is saying a bit too, but I think I understand enough to try and look into it.&nbsp; So far, I've learned some about my system that I didn't know before.<br />
<br />
Since Bill Gates and MS refuse to take ownership of the issues with Win7 (like backup/restore not being able to utilize the 4k bit higher capacity drives), we have to get our technical advise from anyone who wishes to offer suggestions.<br />
<br />
Omniplex is offering suggestions when Bill Gages and MS are silent.<br />
<br />
If you would like some clarification, please be a bit more specific on what you don't understand.<br />

    <title>To maintain system stability Windows must restore the original - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suekappler  say:</h3>
<h2>            To maintain system stability Windows must restore the original versions of these files.  Insert your Windows XP Professional CD2 now.</h2>
                    I have the same problem as previous questions in that I received the message that my files had been changed and I needed to insert the Microsoft XP Professional CD2 disc.&nbsp; However, the message that I needed to insert the CD2 appeared after I attempted
 to burn a dvd of a Smilebox creation.&nbsp; I followed the instructions exactly and it indicated that it had finished but the dvd was blank.&nbsp; I tried it on my computer in media player, media center (both of indicated that it was an unkown dvd) and on my dvd player.&nbsp;
 Then the insert XP disc appeared.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I have checked for malware, viruses and checked the drives on my computer.&nbsp; All drives appear to be fine.&nbsp; I have tried the dvds on other computers and nothing is thre.&nbsp; I had repeated the burning process several times.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I share this computer with my husband.&nbsp; When he opened his "side" of the computer, he got the same message.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
One other thing, the first time I started the burn, a window popped up asking how I wanted to treat the process.&nbsp; It gave me only burning or playing a cd, the window disappeared and then the Smilebox dvd burner took over.&nbsp; The next few times, only the Smilebox
 window appeared--this is after I got the "unrecognized files--insert professional xp cd2-which I also do not have).&nbsp; The last time I tried to burn the dvd, I opened my Smi;ebox application in Mozilla Firefox instead of Internet Explorer.&nbsp; This time the message
 box popped up asking me what to do and the options were playing the dvd, searching for files on the internet or no action.&nbsp; I did choose Play the dvd, which obviously I wasn't going to do but... So then the Smilebox started, again, burning the dvd.&nbsp; Again,
 nothing.&nbsp; Obviously something is screwed up.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
My son says that he has the Microsoft Professional XP CD2 and I could use that but it appears from other answers that this was unsuccessful for others.&nbsp; Should I just bite the bullet and call Geek Squad or is there and answer for me.&nbsp; Thanks, Sue<br />

            How can it be that with all that fine typing, we know so little about your computer?<br />
<br />
Could it be because the MS Answers forum owners do not see fit to have the MS Answers forums prompt for any system information when a new question is asked?<br />
<br />
I will hold my hypothesis, but perhaps you would answer some general questions (that I have posted 1000+ times and shouldn't have to even post once)) and then one of the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts" can help you out.<br />
<br />
Let's get them started:<br />
<br />
<br />
Sadly, the MS Answers forums does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know absolutely nothing about your system.
<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see (exactly) that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<br />
What do you not see that you think you should be seeing?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
If you are seeing messages like this:<br />
<br />
Windows File Protection<br />
Files that are required for Windows to run properly have been replaced by unrecognized versions.&nbsp; To maintain system stability, Windows must restore the original versions of these files.<br />
<br />
or maybe something like this:<br />
<br />
Windows File Protection.<br />
Files that are required for Windows to run properly must be copied to the DLL Cache<br />
Insert your Windows XP Professional Service Pack 3 CD now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hopefully, you are curious to know what the file is and when you know that, you can decide what to do about it.&nbsp; Until you know what the file is, you can't really decide what to do about it or how it happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; But, you can sure try some things!<br />
<br />
You should click Cancel, then click Yes to keep the file, then you will have an event to look at that will tell you what the problem file is.<br />
<br />
There may be more than one file missing, so you will have to just fix them one at a time as you discover what they are.<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer System log to see what the file name is, then decide what to do.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
eventvwr.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
Check your Event Viewer System log and look for an event sourced by Windows File Protection.<br />
<br />
When in the Event Viewer System log, click or double click the 'Source' column heading to sort the events alphabetically by the Source name.&nbsp; The 'Windows File Protection' events should be near the bottom (or the top) of the list (since they start with 'W').<br />
<br />
The event you are interested is will look something like this example:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64005<br />
Description:<br />
The protected system file taskmgr.exe was not restored to its original, valid version because the Windows File Protection restoration process was cancelled by user interaction, user name is Jose.&nbsp; The file version of the bad file is unknown.<br />
<br />
or this:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64021<br />
Description:<br />
The system file c:\windows\system32\taskmgr.exe could not be copied into the DLL cache.&nbsp; The specific error code is 0x000004c7 [The operation was canceled by the user.&nbsp; This file is necessary to maintain system stability.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you know what the file is, you can decide what to do about it.&nbsp; There may already be other copies of the file(s) on your system or you can get the file(s) from another trusted source - or some nice person can upload the file(s) you need to their SkyDrive
 and you can download them and replace the file(s) one at a time if there are not too many.&nbsp; First you must figure out what the file is that XP thinks it needs.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can also copy and paste the Event back here if you don't know how to interpret it.<br />
<br />
If you double click an event, it will open a Properties window with more information.&nbsp; On the right are black up and down arrow buttons to scroll through the open events. The third button that looks like two pages on top of each other is used to copy the event
 details to your Windows clipboard.<br />
<br />
When you find an interesting event that occurred around the time of your issue, click the third button under the up and down arrows to copy the details and then you can paste the details (right click, Paste or CTRL-V) the detail text back here for analysis.&nbsp;
 Remove any personal information from your information after pasting if you are compelled to do so.<br />
<br />

            My additional 2¢ worth of advice:<br />
<br />
By all means try to answer as many of ElderL's questions as possible; the more we know about your computer and your problems, the more likely it is that someone will be able to help (and he didn't type all of that -- at least not today -- he copied and pasted
 it from his notes).<br />
<br />
If at any point you decide that working on your computer is not your cup of tea -- and there is no shame in deciding that -- do yourself a favor and go to a good local independent computer repair shop rather than one of the big box or chain stores.&nbsp; Ask around
 to check reputations. Although those chain stores sometimes have people who actually know what they're doing, it's more common that they have a "one size fits all" solution:&nbsp; wipe out the system and reinstall Windows.&nbsp; You'll probably be unhappy if you go
 down that road.<br />
<br />
With respect to your last paragraph, if your son has a genuine Microsoft Windows XP Professional
<b>including </b>Service Pack 2 CD, then whether you can use it or not depends on what version of Windows you have.&nbsp; Right click My Computer and select Properties to see Windows version and service pack info.&nbsp; Note that you need the

            It is 2:32 a.m. so this will be short.&nbsp; I did read all that ElderL sent to me and did go to the event viewer.&nbsp; I found the listings under source to be rather disturbing, all yellow warning triangles down to the Windows File Protection.&nbsp; Since I have a
 lot of irons in the fire right now, I believe I will attempt to sleep on this and approach it again in the morning.&nbsp; I enjoy working on the computer and learning how to do new stuff at my advanced age so won't give up just yet. My husband does not have a great
 deal of confidence in my ability to do this so I would be just tickled to prove him wrong.&nbsp; He is a retired engineer and a bit OCD but other than that a fine fellow.&nbsp; I also am glad to hear your advice about who do turn to if I throw&nbsp; in the towel.&nbsp; I shall
 ask my son if what he has is what you specified. Our computer is a Dimension Dell E510 which has given us problems since day one.&nbsp; I will see what the Service Pac is.&nbsp; Will get the rest of the info tomorrow-uh, later today.&nbsp; My wine has run out and so must
 I.&nbsp; You seem to be a jolly group.<br />
Thanks for your advice<br />

            What the messages in my example are trying to tell you is that the Windows File Protection part of XP (which looks after 3498 critical XP files) has detected that backup copies of some of those files have come up missing on your system and XP wants to
 replace them so it asks you for your installation CD.<br />
<br />
The problem is that many people don't have a genuine bootable XP installation CD with the same Service Pack as their installed version and Service Pack.<br />
<br />
In the past 2 weeks, there seems to have been a rash of these and the once I have been helping with all seem to have one thing in common - McAfee.&nbsp; The second thing these seem to have in common is the afflicted systems are XP Media Center Edition (MCE).&nbsp; Hence
 my questions.<br />
<br />
If there are not too many backup copies of files missing, you can replace them either from a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed SP, getting the files from another system with the same XP version and SP or by
 downloading copies of the missing files from a trusted source, like my SkyDrive - you can trust me, right?<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I have lost possession of my MCE installation CD, so if you are missing files specific to MCE, I may not have them handy, but somebody else might...&nbsp; once you figure out what they are.&nbsp; "Regular" XP files I got.&nbsp; I'll bet you dollars to donuts
 you will not get them from any Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" here since I have never seen them resolve this problem and never seen them even spell the word "SkyDrive".<br />
<br />

    <title>Getting blue screen error on new ASUS laptop after it&#39;s in sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bluejaysfanlj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting blue screen error on new ASUS laptop after it&#39;s in sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new ASUS laptop in December 2011. It was running Windows 7, Internet Explorer 9 and I used Mozilla Thunderbird for my email because Windows 7 doesn't come with Outlook Express. After a couple of weeks, I started getting a blue screen with white
 text which seemed to happen after the computer was put into sleep mode. Over a four-month period, I took it back to the store 3 times for repair and&nbsp;each time it came back that everything was working fine. But it wasn't because&nbsp;the blue screen crash still
 happened.&nbsp;I finally got the store to give&nbsp;me a replacement laptop and&nbsp;I again went with ASUS. I am still running Windows 7, Internet Explorer 9 and Mozilla Thunderbird for email. And this new laptop has also started to blue screen crash. I'm wondering now
 if Windows 7 and/or Internet Explorer 9 being Microsoft don't like Mozilla Thunderbird and that is what is causing the laptop to "crash" with the blue screen. I hope someone out there can help because the Geek Squad can't. To be fair to them though, I have
 usually deleted all the programs and data I was using when I took the laptop back for diagnosis.</p>

<h2>            Cannot delete &#34;Other User&#34; Account</h2>
                    <p>I have&nbsp;system with Windows 8.1 installed.&nbsp; Initially, I created two users.&nbsp; I have since deleted one of the users.&nbsp; Now, when the system boots up, I get an "Other user" Welcome screen, then it switches to the correct user.&nbsp; There is no "Other user".&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How can I delete the "Other user" Welcome at boot up?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there an easy way to do this without having to reinstall Windows?&nbsp; How do you delete an "Other user" account that doesn't exist?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />

            <p>I have suffered the issue since last October, and I finally fix the issue thanks to SteveBeta.</p>
<p>Windows8/8.1 apparently cannot delete an account right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I don't remember the steps to reproduce the issue exactly,</p>
<p>I did the following things before. Timeline is uncertain.</p>
<p>* Created microsoft live mail account a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>* Installed Windows 8 and associated the mail account to Windows account.</p>
<p>* Created an account for guest (not generic guest account), then deleted.</p>
<p>* Created couple of accounts for my family with no mail address associated.</p>
<p>* Windows starts to show Other User account first in start screen.</p>
<p>* Deleted the mail account associated with the primary Windows account, expecting it stops to show Other User.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is less obvious because only few people uses multiuser feature.</p>
