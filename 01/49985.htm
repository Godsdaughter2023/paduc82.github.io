</p><p>I have a brand-spanking new laptop, running Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Edge works, but ALL (!!) other browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Opera) work for maybe 20 seconds and then hang. I have tried everything, including a step that apparently worked for some: typing "netsh winsock reset" in the command line running it as

<p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply. I tried the recommend steps and had no success. I've tried installing, uninstalling, re-installing, re-uninstalling, re-re .... you get the picture, various browsers and the problems persist.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is another thing I noticed that might be relevant: </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I am unable to turn Airplane Mode off</span>. I have tried fn + prntscreen, I have gone to settings, etc. The slider always immediately jumps back to "on". I have changed the setting so that the computer does not automatically

<h2>            Network&#47;internet problem - after while I can&#39;t access anything in my network and internet</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I installed Windows 10 Pro. I chose to perform a clean install rather than an upgrade (because the upgrade wasn't finishing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything working very well, my computer a lot faster than before with Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I noticed that after a while, my computer couldn't access internet and even my network. The problem was only with this PC (my desktop), other PCs in the network continued to access network/internet&nbsp;without issues. Trying to access my router returned
 an error message in Firefox "The connection was reset". I tried many things (sfc, dism, disable/enable network adapter, uninstalled/re-installed the network adapter,&nbsp;changed the network cable to the second network adapter, troubleshooting for internet and
 network, ipconfig /renew, ipconfig /flushdns), none of them worked. The only solution was restarting my computer (only temporary, until the problem happens again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing is that after the problem is "on", some programs can still access internet (Skype, Spotify...) but none of the internet browsers can (Edge, Firefox, IE, Chrome).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that I had a protocol "disabled": Microsoft Network Adapter Multiplexor Protocol. I tried to enable it, but a message appeared asking if I was sure to disable the protocol. Like this behavior appeared to be an error, I uninstalled the protocol,
 and at this moment the network connectivity returned, but only this time. A couple days after that, the problem occurred again (and continues to happen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked into my notebook and it have this same protocol (also unselected), so I thought that it wasn't related to my problem and decided to re-install it in my desktop PC. But every time I get an error: "Could not add the requested feature. The error is:
 The specified module could not be found."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I have two problems, 1) I'm still having the randoms network lack of connectivity (one theory: I thing it may be related to µtorrent, most of the times it was running when the problem occurred, and the problem persisted even after closing µtorrent),
 and 2) I can't re-install what appears to be a system default network protocol.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My both network adapter (onboard) was installed as Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller (driver version 10.6.1001.2015). I'm using Windows 10 Pro x64 Version 1511 OS Build 10586.71.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or insights to solve these issues would be gladly appreciate. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Danhe,</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are experiencing at this moment. We will assist you on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might experience network or Internet connection issues in Windows for a number of reasons. Some common issues that can cause these problems are:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Corrupted or incompatible drivers. </li><li>Network connection settings. </li><li>Hardware or software problems. </li><li>There's interference from other devices. </li><li>Your router and the network adapter in your PC might not work together.</li></ul>
<p>I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Perform System Restore</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System Restore</strong> takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Choose a restore point before you experienced the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the section Restore from a system restore point from below article and follow the steps.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Recovery options in Windows 10</a></strong></span></p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persist, follow the steps in <strong>Method 2</strong>.</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Inplace Upgrade</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There might be corruption with the system files making the User Profile opt this kind of behavior. Since we tried DISM and system file checker to fix the issue, but the problem still appearing. So, the root cause of the issue seems to be deep.
</span></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>You can fix this issue by performing a repair In-place upgrade. A repair In-place upgrade will repair operating system files while preserving your personal files, settings and installed applications.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>We recommend you to take a Backup of personal and important files to avoid unwanted situations.
</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Refer below article and follow the steps&nbsp;to perform a repair upgrade:</span></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">How
 to: perform a repair upgrade using the Windows 10 ISO file</span></span></span></a></strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>If you’ve already successful activated Windows 10 on this PC, including if you upgraded by taking advantage of the free upgrade offer you won't need to enter a Windows 10 product key. You can skip the product key page by selecting
 the Skip button. Your PC will automatically activate later. </p>

<h2>            Memory Settings for Maximum Contiguous Space allocated to program</h2>
                    
<p>Is there any way to change memory settings so that Windows offers contiguous space rather than bits &amp; pieces?</p>
<p>I am getting an error in a statistical program that says "Operating System refuses to provide memory".&nbsp; Apparently, this is because the program needs contiguous memory for a data operation, and Windows is trying to give it bits and pieces that is has cobbled
 together.</p>

<p><span>Hi GT,</span></p>
<p><span>Windows cannot offer contiguous space for a specific application. You can try a disk defrag to consolidate fragmented files and folders on your
 computer's hard disk so that each occupies a single space on the disk. </span></p>

    <title>Windows 7 Explorer Search Boolean - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marinacandela  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Explorer Search Boolean</h2>
                    I am using a Windows 7 computer in which almost all of the file names have no spaces. I'm trying to figure out what the best way to search for documents in Windows Explorer would be. Most of the file names are set up this way:
<b>FileNamingGuidelines</b> or <b>BODMin_2010-01-12</b> or <b>EE_ExpReport_2010</b>. My question is essentially, what would be the best way to search for documents on this computer? I was thinking of using Boolean search operators to search for keywords, since
 most files don't have spaces.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>One of my ideas to find&nbsp;<b>FileNamingGuidelines</b>&nbsp;was to search for: <b>*file* AND *nam* AND *guideline*</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>When I do that, however, nothing comes up. I am unsure what I am doing wrong and how exactly Windows 7 search interprets Boolean operators. I have come across some difficulties with the way Windows Explorer reacts to wildcard searches using * and ?. Any
 suggestions?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
                </div>

            <p>You can make use of MS's Advanced Query Syntax.&nbsp; The symbols ~= mean "match anywhere in the searched property", and so you wouldn't use wildcards at the same time, as in:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>name:(~=file ~=nam ~=guideline)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AND is inferred by default and not necessary to specify.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now if you need to use wildcards, then the ~= symbols won't work.&nbsp; When we want to specify a searched property such as name, we&nbsp;are restricted to ~ alone which means "match exactly", so we have to place * at start and end of text that could appear within
 text, if used in conjunction with the name property, as in:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>name:(~*min?20*)</p>
<p>&nbsp;[Curiously, the similar property filename: can search with wildcards without use of ~, as in filename:*min?20]</p>
<p>By the way, = alone&nbsp;also means "match exactly", but when used with the name property, wildcards won't work.</p>

            Thank you so much for your help! That ~= function is definitely helpful.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Also, if you don't mind me asking, why does the search not work if one just inputs,
<b>~=file ~=nam ~=guideline</b> ? (The question mark is not part of the search function) Why does one have to use the
<b>name:</b> filter?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Essentially my goal is to be able to find files when I am not entirely sure what the name is. For example, with the file, "<b>File Naming Guidelines</b>," one may be looking for the word
<b>file</b> or <b>doc</b>, or with <b>guideline</b> it could also be <b>rule</b>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Lastly, I was curious if you knew of any resource that listed all of the Boolean search capabilities that Windows 7 has? I find a lot of stuff about search filters but a lot of the articles about Boolean search on Windows 7 Explorer don't really say how
 exactly Windows 7 interprets Boolean operators. I have heard that wildcards are used a little differently on Windows 7 and it's also confusing to me how some operators, like ~= don't work with wildcards and such. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank
 you!</div>

            <p>You are welcome.&nbsp; Now as to why <strong>~=file ~=nam ~=guideline</strong> wouldn't do the trick for you, I don't know -- a quick test I did with something similar seemed OK.&nbsp; But I have decided not to rely on searching without specifying the property that
 I am searching for anyhow, as there do seem to be quirks related to indexing or settings that are not obvious.</p>
<p><span><span>[update:&nbsp; apparently special search symbols such as ~= don't work if the name property is not specificed when searching in indexed locations, but do work when searching in non-indexed locations regardless.]</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for searching for optional terms, the word OR in capital letters works, and you can use the name property more than once, as in:</p>
<p>name:(~=file OR ~=doc) name:(~=guideline OR ~=rule)</p>
<p>which would find files with names having either of file or doc while simultaneously having either of guideline or rule.&nbsp; You can use multiple brackets instead for the same effect:</p>
<p>name:((~=file OR ~=doc) (~=guideline OR ~=rule))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About resources out there about such searching, I didn't find any single one that satisfied me, and so&nbsp;I spent a few months looking at those resources, trying stuff myself, and made a lot of notes that I refer to instead.&nbsp; I'll dump some of that here now.</p>

            <p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The Windows 7 search syntax is called Advanced Query Syntax.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It uses many symbols and a few words as operators to give some flexibility and specificity to searches.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Here is a summary of the operators:</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>( ) parentheses:<span>&nbsp; </span>search operators and text that is placed within parentheses is taken to belong to the search property immediately preceding the opening parenthesis.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, name:(cat man) gives results whose name contains words (or other text strings) that are or begin with both cat and man (but not merely either).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Parentheses can also be used to affect priority of special words AND, OR, and NOT as described later in these notes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is ineffective to place special search syntax symbols (=, ~=, and others described in the next few paragraphs) immediately before search text that is within parentheses, as the search results given are the same as would be there if the symbols were
 not used.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, instead of entering name:=(buns), enter name:(=buns), or since with a single word of search text the parentheses are optional, enter name:=buns.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>" " quotation marks:<span>&nbsp; </span>By default, the “Find partial matches” setting is active (in the Folder Options dialog box, Search tab), which means that results include items with words that begin with the characters
 of the search text.<span>&nbsp; </span>If quotation marks are placed around the search text, then the effect is the same as deactivating that setting, and the results only include items with words that are the same as the search text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>(Some special syntax described later can override the effect:<span>&nbsp; </span>
~, ~=, ~!, ~&lt;, ~&gt;, and $&lt;.)<span>&nbsp; </span>When quotation marks are placed around two or more strings of text (words) separated by spaces, by default Windows 7 Search treats the strings as a list.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So, for example, name:"one two three" finds items whose names contain every string in the list, in any order.&nbsp; [Update:&nbsp; bizarrely, the mostly equivalent property called "filename" does enforce order, actually, while "file" and "name" do not.]<span>&nbsp;
</span>The quotation marks are not sufficient to treat the list as a single string (or phrase), when searching most properties.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Treating the list as a single string requires special syntax symbols (=, ~, ~=, ~!, &lt;&gt;, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, ~&lt;, and ~&gt; work, but $&lt; and $= do not) to precede the first quotation mark.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, none of the working syntax symbols allow searching for a phrase that appears anywhere in the property text except for ~=, and ~= includes items that have other text immediately before or after the search text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, content:~="goose pimple" would include items whose content text had “bgoose pimpleq”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If only content with “goose pimple” as a distinct phrase was desired, then to get results closer to that desire (but not completely successfully), enter content:(~="goose pimple" "goose pimple").<span>&nbsp;
</span>That search would, however, include items that did not have the distinct phrase but instead “bgoose pimpleq” if the content text also had separate instances of “goose” and “pimple”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If instances such as "bgoose pimpleq" are not considered<span>&nbsp; </span>to be a problem, then it is sufficient to enter content:~="goose pimple".&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>[Update:&nbsp; apparently special search symbols such as ~= don't work with the content property when searching in indexed locations, but do work when searching in non-indexed locations.]</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>With the use of special syntax symbols, quotation marks also allow searching for non-alphanumeric symbols that otherwise would not be searchable, as described in the section titled “How to search for symbols or text
 containing symbols (non-alphanumeric):” later in these notes.</span></span></span></p>

gives results for items whose searched property contains any words (or other text strings) that match or begins with the search text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>By default, Windows 7 Search already searches that way without $&lt;.<span>&nbsp; </span>
For example, name:$&lt;rat gives results no different from name:rat.<span>&nbsp; </span>If the “Find partial matches” setting (in the Folder Options dialog box, Search tab) has been deactivated, then $&lt; would be necessary to search that way.<span>&nbsp;
</span>With $&lt;, the use of quotation marks put around the search text has their default effect of treating separate text strings (words) as a list, and not as a single string (or phrase).</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>$=<span>&nbsp; </span>dollar sign and equals sign:<span>&nbsp;

</span>With $=, the use of quotation marks put around the search text has their default effect of treating separate text strings (words) as a list, and not as a single string (or phrase).<span>&nbsp;
</span>Two dollar signs $$ works the same as the dollar sign and equals sign.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>- hyphen-minus:<span>&nbsp; </span>The minus sign has the effect of searching for the opposite of what the search otherwise specifies.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It is effective when placed immediately before the search property, immediately before search text that does not use most of the special syntax symbols (=, ~=, ~!, &lt;&gt;, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, ~&lt;, ~&gt;, $&lt;, and $=, but works with ..), or immediately before any search
 text regardless of syntax symbols if the symbols and text are enclosed within parentheses.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, -name:cow and name:-cow perform the same search, giving all items whose name does not have the word “cow” or a word that starts with “cow”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For another example, -name:~&lt;fig and name:-(~&lt;fig) perform the same search, giving all items whose name does not start with “fig”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The minus sign works inconsistently with search terms containing any wildcards (* and ?) depending on the search property.<span>&nbsp;

            <p><span><font color="#000000"><font>AND:<span>&nbsp;
</span>The word AND is a redundant feature, because simply entering search terms together is effectively performing the function of AND.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, name:(we AND bu) gives the same results as name:(we bu).<span>&nbsp;
</span>For another example, name:bit AND ext:.doc gives the same results as name:bit ext:.doc.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The word AND is only interpreted as search syntax when the letters are all uppercase (capitals).<span>&nbsp;
</span>A space needs to follow AND for it to work, unless it immediately precedes text in parentheses or quotation marks.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>OR:<span>&nbsp;
</span>The word OR allows for searching for alternative search terms with the same search property, and also allows for searching with alternative search properties.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, tag:(beach OR pool) gives results whose tag properties have either (or both) the words (or starts of words) “beach” and “pool”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For another example, foldername:=gong OR path:clang gives results that are immediately within a folder named “gong” or have a path that has the word (or start of a word) “clang” somewhere.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The word OR is only interpreted as search syntax when the letters are all uppercase (capitals).<span>&nbsp;
</span>A space needs to follow OR for it to work, unless it immediately precedes text in parentheses or quotation marks.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>NOT:<span>&nbsp;
</span>The word NOT has the same effect as the minus sign described earlier.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The word NOT is only effective as search syntax when the letters are all uppercase (capitals).<span>&nbsp;
</span>A space needs to follow NOT for it to work, unless it immediately precedes text in parentheses or quotation marks.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, the usage requirements of NOT match those of the minus sign, such as requiring parentheses around search text when used immediately before search text that uses special syntax symbols, as in name:NOT(~&lt;g).</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>AND, OR, and NOT:<span>&nbsp;
</span>When more than one of these words is used (or the same word is used more than once), Windows Search interprets the priority as though search terms were within parenthesis from left to right.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, filename:blue NOT ext:.txt OR content:blue AND size:&lt;100kB is interpreted as ((filename:blue NOT ext:.txt) OR content:blue) AND size:&lt;100kB.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To change the priority, the search properties can be reordered or parentheses can be placed elsewhere as required to have the desired search performed.</font></font></span></p>

            <p><span><font color="#000000"><font>* asterisk:<span>&nbsp;
</span>The asterisk can serve as a “wildcard” and substitute for any number of characters within search text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For instance, m*ns would match moons, mountains, and maidens.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For information on the usage limitations of the asterisk wildcard, read the paragraph later in these notes that begins “* asterisk and ? question mark”.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>? question mark:<span>&nbsp;
</span>The question mark can serve as a “wildcard” and substitute for a single character within search text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For instance, pe?t would match pert and peat, d??p would match drip and drop, and t???an would match tartan and Taiwan.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The usage limitations of the question mark wildcard are described in the next paragraph.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>* asterisk and ? question mark:<span>&nbsp;
</span>The two symbols can serve as wildcard characters with some properties such as filename: (some such as content: need the ~ symbol also).<span>&nbsp;
</span>The asterisk * can mean any number of unspecified characters, and the question mark ? means exactly one unspecified character.<span>&nbsp;
</span>When a wildcard * or ? is used, the search text is only compared to the start of the text of an item.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, filename:y?k could give results with items whose filename is or starts with yak or yuk, but not items that only have such words elsewhere than the start.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, filename:y*k could give results with items whose filename is or starts with yak, yuk, yeek, or yamok, but not items that only have such words elsewhere than the start.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To include results matching later words, also place * as the first character of the search text.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, the search results might then give results that don’t begin with the desired character, requiring a more complicated search to limit the results closer to what is wanted (but still not completely successfully).<span>&nbsp;
</span>For instance, folder:*m*ns gives items contained in folders named “moons” and “big mountains”, but also “salmons”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To try to exclude “salmons” and others with no words that start with m, enter folder:(*m*ns m).<span>&nbsp;
</span>The exclusion is imperfect however, as items in folders with “salmons mix” would be included for instance, which does not match the desired form m*ns.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, folder:*pe?t gives items contained in folders named “pert” and “the peat”, but also “respect”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To try to exclude “respect” and all others whose folder name does not have a word beginning with pe, enter folder:(*pe?t pe).<span>&nbsp;
</span>The exclusion is imperfect however, as items in folders with “respect pepper” would be included for instance, which does not match the desired form pe?t.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>When search text with a wildcard * or ? is within quoatation marks, the results only include items whose entire property text matches the
 search text.<span>&nbsp; </span>For example, filename:"y?k" would give results with items whose filename is yak or yuk, but not yak.txt, yaka or “yuk ick”.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>Most of the search syntax symbols (=, ~=, ~!, &lt;&gt;, &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;=, .., ~&lt;, ~&gt;, $&lt;, and $=) do not permit the usage of * and ? as wildcard symbols
 within text that the syntax symbols apply to.<span>&nbsp; </span>So, for example, path:~=th?ck would not work to find items whose path contains “thick” for instance, but instead would attempt to find items whose path contains the specific characters th?ck.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The search syntax symbol ~ does permit wildcard usage of * and ?.</font></font></span></p>

<h2>            Wireless Headsets on Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p><p><br /></p><p>I've taken the unfortunate path of trying to find an easy-to-setup, quality wireless&nbsp;headset for the Xbox One (for &lt;$149+Tax). This has resulted in purchasing 3 different pairs of headsets&nbsp;in last 3 days (returning 2 of them later). For those who have been researching and looking for a quality&nbsp;wireless headset that's compatible&nbsp;fresh off the shelf on&nbsp;Xbox One without spending $200+, best of luck. I've come to learn that the Xbox One has more barriers to these technologies than other common&nbsp;systems (PC/PS4). You'll also need to be aware that headsets these days require/recommend updates to get the most out of them, e.g. you need access to a computer if you want the best value from your product.</p><p><br /></p><p>My first mistake was assuming that the Xbox&nbsp;One&nbsp;would be able to detect and use PC&nbsp;compatible headsets (some misleading advertising/articles helped this too). SO I&nbsp;ended up purchasing these three he

</p><p>I&nbsp;get what you're saying but my point is that Microsoft, being the creator of&nbsp;Xbox &amp;&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;(the latter being the preferred OS&nbsp;for gaming), is ultimately responsible for failing to incorporate a broader range of support for wireless headsets in their console.
 The headset has zero problem connecting to my PC wirelessly&nbsp;through the USB unit. I don't think it'd require much effort on Microsoft's part to expand Xbox&nbsp;One's ability to do the same. One could enlighten me though.&nbsp;:)</p>
<p>You tell me which is more likely; A) Microsoft will buy every company that makes headsets and force them to make headsets based on their products (kinda like what apple did with Beats headsets) or B) Microsoft will provide each specific headset manufacturer
 that wants to make a headset for the Xbox One, the specific to make a wireless communication necessary to communicate for the Xbox One, as Microsoft has already done for numerous headset manufacturers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you want a wireless headset for your Xbox One, you can buy one right now. Just check with the headset manufacturer first. I doubt Sony is going to reach out to Microsoft/Xbox and say "Hey, we'd like to make a headset that works with your Xbox" but it's
 up to Sony to do that. Blaming Xbox for not working with brand "XYZ" headset doesn't seem feasible to me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And in regards to PC headsets, well again, its the headset manufacturer that has to make their own drivers for their own headset to work on a PC.<br />

<p>Hi Eileen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that the computer shutsdown unexpectedly on Windows 10. I will certainly help.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the system's power settings are incorrect or due to software conflicts.</p>
</span><span>
<p>I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
</span><strong><span>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Run the Power troubleshooter</p>
</span></strong>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with your system's power settings. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open <strong>Control Panel </strong>by right click on <strong>
Start</strong> Button.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> In the search box, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Click on the <strong>view all </strong>option on the left panel.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Run the <strong>Power </strong>troubleshooter.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Enable Safe Mode with Networking to check if the issue occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: Safe Mode with Networking</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check if the issue occurs in <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Safe mode with Networking</strong> starts Windows in safe mode and includes the network drivers, services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer below link to Enable Safe Mode with Networking.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span>Start your PC in safe mode
 in Windows 10 </span></span></span></strong></a></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Please restart the computer to start in normal mode.</span></p>
<span><strong>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2: Perform Clean Boot</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode, then perform a <strong>Clean Boot
</strong>to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do this, refer below article on how to perform a Clean Boot in Windows.<br />
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></strong></a></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The troubleshooting steps in the above link are meant for windows 8, however, you can use the same
</p>
<p>for windows 10 as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the status of the issue and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Problem uninstalling Netflix app after windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problem uninstalling Netflix app after windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've updated my computer to windows 10, and all apps were working fine since before it. Then, I decided to downgrade the windows back to the 8.1 version (which I prefer for particular reasons), and now I'm having problems running several apps. So far, all
 of them I could repair by the windows store, except for Netflix.</p>
<p>When I try&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">to uninstall and install it again, the "uninstall" option when I right-click the app isn't appearing, and I tried all the troubleshoot diagnostics and steps posted on the
 forums so far. Nothing worked. The app doesn't runs, nor repair or update, it does just nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The only update that is not installed on my computer now is the new version of the windows. The firewall is allowed, antiviruses updated, admin settings done, windows installer unregistered
 and re-registered, hardware and devices updated, etc.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also, when I try syncing licenses, it says that all apps are up to date.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Ps: not sure what it means, but I've noticed the following information after running the 'apps troubleshooter':

This list of errors did not help me too much, but I've FINALLY MANAGED REPAIRING THE APPS!!!!!!!!! Actually, I finally could be able to uninstall and reinstall them!<br />
<br />
Here is what I did:</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">First, running the Command Prompt as Administrator I've entered:<br />
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore\AppxManifest.xml<br />
<br />
Then, Running Powershell as Administrator, again I've typed Get-AppxPackage *netflix* | Remove-AppxPackage<br />
and with that I noticed that the path was being showed as<br />
C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\4DF9E0F8.Netflix_<strong>2.14.0.13</strong>_x64__mcm4njqhnhss8\&nbsp;<br />
but it happens that the actual path on my computer was from another version:&nbsp;<br />
C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\4DF9E0F8.Netflix_<strong>2.15.0.14</strong>_x64__mcm4njqhnhss8\<br />
<br />
Having this, I decided to rename the folder to match with what was being showed on Powershell (from 2.15.0.14 to 2.14.0.13). For that, I set my user as the owner of the folder, disabled all inheritance and also gave my user full control permission and deleted
 all others from the advanced security settings. Following this, a new error appeared to me on powershell when trying to remove the appxpackage:&nbsp;<br />
Remove-AppxPackage : Deployment failed with HRESULT: 0x80073D04, The signature is invalid. To register in developer mode, AppxSignature.p7x and AppxBlockMap.xml must be valid or should not be present.<br />
<br />
By that, I deleted both AppxSignature.p7x and AppxBlockMap.xml files from the Netflix renamed folder, and then I ran again the Get-AppxPackage *netflix* | Remove-AppxPackage on Powershell and VOILÀ!&nbsp;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The broken app was finally gone and I could just install it normally back from the Store!!!!!!!</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Renaming other apps that were also not running/uninstalling to previous versions also worked just fine to remove them using Powershell.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I hope this helps anyone else with the same problem as me. Thanks for everything!<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two type of accounts usually you've on personal Windows 10. One is Microsoft account and another is local account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're on Microsoft account, you need to use its password to login and unlock system after sleep. To change Microsoft account password, you can go to&nbsp;<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/security</a>&nbsp;and
 click <em>Change password</em> link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you don't want to use Microsoft account password on your system for anonymous reason,
 password, or you can even go with blank password as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change a local account password, refer this support article:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4490115/windows-change-or-reset-your-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4490115/windows-change-or-reset-your-password</a></p>

            <p>Hi Juniper,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend rebooting the device in safe mode and check if this will do what it should. Starting the Windows in safe mode disables any third party software that may have been loaded into your computer; that may be causing the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we suggest <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
running the Windows app troubleshoote</a>r; this will scan your computer for errors and will attempt to correct them - should it find any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, if none of those work, we strongly suggest either doing a <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-10-system-restore/e984de0e-cf80-4352-976a-135bf081008c">
System Restore</a>or getting in touch with the computer manufacturer for further assistance; as they may have solutions specific for your device. Doing a system restore will allow you to set the computer back to when the computer was working
 properly.</p>

 I do not believe it is their problem. The reason for this is because I directly plugged my laptop into the modem and (after running a speed test) was receiving speeds up to 30 Mbps. However, when I connected my desktop and ran the same speedtest, it would
 be inconsistent and could go from 2 Mbps to 12 Mbps and then 22 Mbps. It is pretty much all over the place. Also, I am now realizing that the lights on the modem and on my computer tower are orange/yellow. I am not sure what I can do to figure out the issue
 and how to fix it. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</span>

<h2>            Problems with MPEG in Movie Maker</h2>
                    I cannot get MPEG files to open in movie maker.&nbsp; I get audio, but no video.&nbsp; I see that past solutions suggest converting to MP3 or MP4.&nbsp; Any suggestions on a good converter?&nbsp; Past suggestions send you to dated websites.

As you mentioned that videos are playing in media player. So I would suggest you try to reinstall the movie maker and check if it helps.

<h2>            Modern Warfare 3, modded lobbies out the wazoo</h2>
                    <p>I decided to buy mw3 for my Xbox one because it just became backwards compatible, one of my favorite CoD games. But to my disappointment, it's full of modded lobbies. It's a serious issue I wish Microsoft would take action in fixing/stopping. Unless mw3 gets remastered (which I doubt&nbsp;it will now), I won't be playing it ever again.</p>

                    I've been trying everything to fix this issue that reps recommend on here but everything I try to do has the yellow &amp; blue admin symbol next to it and can't make any actions at all. My start button won't even work for some reason and have to do windows
 key + x to restart or shut down. Not able to uninstall anything, open certain icons, or click on apps that I have. This all started yesterday when the storms were really bad and we had a power outage for a few hours. Haven't had any of these problems till
 yesterday.

            <p>I know what Anas is talking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What he means is, at least for Windows 7 Pro, if a user was remotely connected to a machine, and another person physically stepped in front of the machine that was being remoted into. You would see the standard Windows login page, and the user profile that
 has someone in an RDP session shows up on the profile icon with text below it indicating that someone is actively in a remote session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, if you try to log on the machine, if I recall correctly it lets you know you will terminate that active RDP session. Either way, it distinctly informs you of an active RDP session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 10, the login screen described as such shows no indication whether a user is logged in or not via RDP. Additionally, if you log in, it just logs in normally, whilst terminating the RDP session from the other user. Further along this line, if the
 RDP user tries to log back in after being terminated, the user physically on the machine will just see his session switch back to the login screen. So Rishad is incorrect in indicating you can view the RDP session in real time on the physical machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I concisely explained this scenario, but it has bothered me too that Windows 10 does not warn of an active RDP session in progress, and to the unaware, wouldn't even realize whats happening when the above behavior I just explained is experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that being said, I'd really like to know if there is a way to make these RDP mechanics behave more like Windows 7 did, as it was a lot more convenient to the standard user from an informational perspective.</p>

            Copies of Windows 8 available for purchase will not run on ARM processors. <br />
<br />
You can install Windows 8 on some tablets - but the tablet must have an x86 processor instead of ARM.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
However, you can buy Windows 8 tablets with ARM processors:<br />

android tablets are run by arm-designed processors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you want this, you can purchase a windows 8 RT tablet.</p>
<p>windows 8&nbsp;RT operating system license is not sold at retail stores.</p>
<p>it is bundled with the tablet by the&nbsp;manufacturer.</p>

android tablets are run by arm-designed processors.

<p>windows 8 RT operating system license is not sold at retail stores.</p>

Microsoft has explicitly stated that Win RT software WILL NOT be available in any way other than pre-installed by an OEM on their hardware.</p>
<p>So unless MS changes its mind in the future (unlikely I suspect), the answer to your question is "No!"</p>

TREVOR! At last a real person rather than the 'automated responses'. Thank you! Now, my next question is 'why not?' I, and I'm sure millions of others, would pay money for ARM based windows RT software&nbsp;(are you listening automated systems?)&nbsp;and break things...

            I'm part of that "other Million" who wants to install Windows 8 RT on my Arm based Android Tablet!
<br />
<br />
My guess is there is more testing to be done before a installable version may be released! if at all!!!<br />
<br />
I've been using Windows 8, but would like to use it on my tablet without having to buy more hardware. I'm certainly not junking my perfectly good existing tablet hardware to grace some undesired landfill!<br />
<br />
Hopefully MS is listening :)<br />

<h2>            Signing in to windows 10 with work email account</h2>
                    <p>I have been given an Office365 account for work, and will be using it on a laptop that is owned by me and currently set up for personal use.&nbsp; I want to have two user login accounts, one personal and the second one using the work account.&nbsp; To do this I seem
 to need to have a Microsoft account in the work email address, but Microsoft will not let me create one - the instruction is to use a personal or Outlook.com email address.&nbsp; It looks like I am being directed towards "Access work or school" in Settings/Accounts,
 but this doesn't look like it will give me the complete separation of work and personal access that I am trying to create.</p>
<p>Does this mean I have to build a work-around using a third email address and then just configure Office/Outlook to the work account email once logged in using the third non-work email?</p>

            So the way it works is you can only have one Microsoft account logged in at a time attached to your windows account.
<br />So can not have 2 Microsoft accounts logged in a the same time.
<br />You could have 2 Microsoft accounts on the PC but you would have to switch between accounts, kind of a hassle.
<br />I have 3 Microsoft accounts and what I have done is setup my personal as the main one so the one that is assigned to my local account.
<br />I did this by going to start - settings - accounts and then adding my Personal Microsoft account to the login.
<br />Then for my o365 and azure accounts I just add them in Windows Mail.
<br />
<br />Does this make sense?

<h2>            On Windows 10 how do I copy or import a photo from my email to my Photo Gallery&#63;</h2>
                    With my Windows 8 I was given the option on a photo sent with an email to either save it or open it. If I chose to save it, I could tell it where to send it. I am not given this option with Windows 10, only given the open command.
