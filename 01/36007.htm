            <p>If its a retail copy of Windows 8 you installed yourself, you will need to first remove it then proceed to install and on the new computer and reactivate by telephone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it came preinstalled on the computer, you cannot transfer it to another computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To install an upgrade version of Windows 8, you must already have Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP installed on your PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you formatted the drive before the upgrade version of Windows 8 was installed, you won't be able to use your upgrade product key to activate Windows 8. To activate Windows 8, you'll need to install your previous version of Windows, and then reinstall
 Windows 8. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> then click<strong>Run</strong>, then type:
<strong>slui.exe 4</strong></p>
<strong><br />
</strong>
<p>2. Next press the 'ENTER' key</p>
<p>3. Select your 'Country' from the list.</p>
<p>4. Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.</p>
<p>5. Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.</p>
<p>6. Explain your problem clearly to the support person.</p>

            Actually, it's not "xp". These are Greek letters, "Chi" and "Rho" who stand for "c" ad "r", the first two letters of the name of Christ. In 312, when emperor Constantin was marching with his army, he looked up to the sun and saw a cross of light above
 it, and with it the Greek words "en touta nika" ("in this, win"), a phrase often rendered into Latin as "in hoc signo vinces"&nbsp; ("in this sign, you will win"). He then decided that the military standards used in his later wars should show the Chi-Rho sign.
 The Windows XP logo it's a big cross with the word "Windows" that sounds like "win does", that is "[this sign] will do the victory", and the Chi-Rho sign, a clear reference to Constantine and the symbols of the Roman Catholic Church (Bill Gates says he's atheis
 but his wife Melinda is catholic). They don't want the people know because they are afraid of the reaction of the muslim world.

 and system errors however after running for some hours it stopped in stage 5 at about 44%. I had to reboot out of chkdsk and&nbsp; ran it again and I left
<br />
it overnight but it had stopped again about the same place....after which when I rebooted a third time it attempted to chkdsk again but I stopped it and booted into windows only to see a blank white screen with no desktop icons and when I used cntrl alt delete
 I got the splash page with task manager, switch users etc. up but when I attemped to run task manager that didnt show up either&nbsp; this happened twice....i tried to boot into safe mode and got the screen list but pc then rebooted and didnt attempt to chkdsk
 this time but I got my desktop&nbsp; back ... any advice greatly appreciated...

<p><span><span>Hi
</span><span>jameshunter,</span></span></p>
<p><span>There are chances that the non Microsoft services interruption takes place while running chkdsk. I would recommend you to start the computer in safe mode
 and run chkdsk successfully. To do this, follow these steps.<br />
1. Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.<br />
2. Select an option when the Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.<br />
3. When the Boot menu appears again, and the words "Safe Mode" appear in blue at the bottom, select the installation that you want to start, and then press ENTER.<br />
For your reference, I’m adding a link that talks about “A description of the Safe Mode Boot options”:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222</span></span></a></p>
<p><span>Once the computer has booted successfully in safe mode, try the following steps to run chkdsk successfully.<br />
1. Click Start, type cmd, right click on cmd and then click “Run as administrator”.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
2. At the command prompt, type the following command and then hit enter.<br />
chkdsk /p<br />
3. Once the above command is run and if you see any errors,&nbsp;then run the following command and then hit enter. Running this command will fix the errors found on the drive.<br />
chkdsk /r</span></p>
<p><span>To graphically perform the actions, follow these steps.<br />
1. Click Start, click Computer.<br />
2. Right click on the drive where you want to run chkdsk and then click Properties.<br />
3. Click the Tools tab.<br />
4. Click Check Now… button under Error-checking.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
5. Check the disk options and then click Start button.<br />
6. Restart the computer once the chkdsk has completed successfully.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Warning:</strong> Microsoft does not recommend interrupting the CHKDSK process. Microsoft does not guarantee the integrity
 of the disk if the CHKDSK program is interrupted.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.<br />
All the best!</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods:<br />
</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>a.&nbsp;Press WINDOW+X.<br />
b.&nbsp;Click on command prompt admin.<br />

            <p>I have tried at least 10 online suggestions to bring the snipping tool back to life.&nbsp; NONE work including the above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 7 Home Premium and have also noticed that some MSFT updates are bringing in Windows 10 updates which may have something to do with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The snipping tool is very useful and the world wants it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried the One Note snipping tool but that is too much work in comparison for a simple snapshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE BRING THE SNIPPING TOOL BACK AND PLEASE TELL US A REAL WAY TO FIX THIS.</p>

            <p>Been there, done that, with the same results. Apparently the tune-up tool in Zone Alarm doesn't like Snipping Tool and eliminated the commands in .exe. Also I don't understand why MS does not offer a reinstall. I use it all the time on my Win 7 desktop but
 am forced to use Office Screen Clip on my Win 8 laptop. One of the many reasons not to download Win 10.</p>

            Youre over-whelming the OS from its defaults..1st,Win OS can only run with 1 Firewall,Windows firewall must be disabled if running 3rd party,(why would one install 3rd party)....Cookies/history from web gets deleted with Internet Options/settings..Google
 Chrome &amp; its up-dater that no longer works,can be accessed by typing in run or cmd: services.msc&nbsp; in msc,scroll to service,double click,set to: Disable or Manual start..

<p>There is a setting in Google Chrome that allows it to continue running various tasks in the background after you have closed the browser window. If this is allowed in your Google Chrome&nbsp; settings, then it can indeed be running even when there is no visible
 window. Personally, I don't allow Google Chrome to continue running in the background/ But that is for you to decide. To solve your immediate problem though, I suggest you turn off (don't allow) this option at least temporarily:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Start Google Chrome. There should of course be a visible browser window.</li><li>Access the Google Chrome menu by clicking on the three dots at the top right corner of the browser window (it's just below the standard Microsoft icons to minimize maximize and close the window).</li><li>Select "<em>Settings</em>" from that menu. Some basic Google Chrome settings should be displayed in the browser.</li><li>Go to the bottom of the "<em>Basic Settings</em>" page and click on "<em>Advanced</em>".</li><li>Locate the "<em>System</em>" group within the "<em>Advanced Settings"</em>. Its near the bottom of this second settings page.</li><li>One of the "<em>System</em>" settings is "<em>Continue running background apps when Google Chrome is closed</em>".<br />
Turn this option <strong>OFF</strong> by sliding its little button to the left.</li><li>Close the Google Chrome browser.</li></ol>
<p>There should now be no complaints about Google Chrome still running when you think it isn't.<br />
<br />
If you would like to re-enable this feature later, just follow the same 7 Step procedure above.</p>
<p>Of course to re-enable the feature, replace "<em>Turn this option <strong>OFF</strong></em>" in Step 6 with "<em>Turn this option
<strong>ON</strong></em>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

            <p>There is no such option after 30 days (or after 10 days once the anniversary update is installed.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrades from Vista to Windows 10 are not supported - even if you installed Windows 7. Reason: Hardware old enough to be installed on a Windows Vista computer is not likely to be supported on Windows 10.</p>

            Hi Thomas.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is in-depth help here for DISM:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/7808-dism-repair-windows-10-image.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/7808-dism-re...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that it's System File Checker that actually scans and fixes broken System Files.   So only if it fails to fix the files after 3 separate passes do you need to confirm the integrity of the image file it checks them against and replaces them from.  
<br />
<br />As Andre also said you can skip all of this by running a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Thomas, in Command Prompt, whenever you use a forward slash to add a switch to a command, it must be preceded by a space, otherwise the command will fail !

<h2>            OneDrive Folder Gone From Navigation Pane After Switching Accounts - Thread moved to a more appropriate forum category.</h2>
                    <p>I switched my OneDrive account to a different one, and when I went into File Explorer to view the files, there was no icon in the Navigation Pane. I am able to find the folder in C:/users/myname, and access it, but it doesn't show in the Navigation Pane
 of File Explorer. I have tried the following:</p>
<p>-Resetting OneDrive</p>
<p>-Uninstalling and reinstalling OneDrive</p>
<p>-Signing in with a local account and then signing back into my Microsoft account</p>
<p>-Changing folder save locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OneDrive for Business folder is still in the Navigation Pane but my OneDrive Personal is not. I believe this is a specific bug/glitch with my system because on my Surface Pro 4, both OneDrive Personal and OneDrive for Business are in the Navigation Pane,
 even after switching accounts.</p>

</p><p>Does this happen with other applications with sound? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Skype only rings when the flip cover is open,&nbsp;the cover&nbsp;may be obstructing the speakers on your device. Please check if the flip cover is blocking the sound.

    <title>Unable to associate ZIP files to another program - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to associate ZIP files to another program</h2>
                    <p>Hi all!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 8. I configured WinRAR to handle ZIP files and everything worked fine. But this morning, this setting has suddenly changed: now, if I double click a ZIP file, it is opened using the built-in Windows 8 function. I have tried to re-associate
 WinRAR to ZIP files, even to uninstall and reinstall it, but nothing. I have even tried to install 7-Zip and associate ZIP files to it, but with no success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, I have noticed that, when I right click on ZIP files, the "Open with" command is missing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What could be the reason of the problem?</p>

<p>Thank you for the response.</p>

<p>I'm sure I didn't make any changes to the computer. What do you mean with "re-install Windows 7 zip"?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried all the steps you have specified, but with no success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is another strange thing: in the Default programs, if I use the option to Associate a file type or protocol with a program, the .ZIP extension isn't listed.</p>

<h2>            DirectX Internal system error</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded Gta V and it didint start, i fixed the error but the game had no sound, so i search it up and it says that it is a directX problem, tried opening DXSETUP from (E:)/Steam/steamapps/common/grand theft auto V/_commonredist/directX/jun2010 and i
 got the internal system error, and now even some of my other games that were completely fine stopped working, i've tried using sfc /scannow and it found no errors, tried intalling it in Safe mode and the same error appeared, tried using System administrator
 to see if was a permission problem and still the same error, tried modifying a registration key on regedit to trick the computer into thinking it had an older version of directX and still the same error, i reinstalled my graphics card driver and still the
 same error, i'm almost at the point of pulling my hairs and throw this computer out of the window, i've had to format my pc and reinstall windows at least 5 times in the last 3 months, i am absolutly not willing to do it another time, can someone help me before
 i go insane?</p>

                    <p>First time, I have installed Windows 10 Pro on the partition 2 with a DVD, but I cannot find the key on the box. Then I have tried to reinstall it with the right key, it been working, but next I have get the message: "The selected disk has a MBR partition
 table. On EFI system, Windows can only be installed to GPT' (I buyed a laptop Lenovo with free MS dos). I have formatted partition 2 and it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>

            Hi Delia,
<br />
<br />To convert your Drive to GPT: 
<br />
<br />At the very start of the Installation Process, press Shift + F10, or Shift + Fn + F10 to open Command Prompt 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />diskpart 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />list disk 
<br />(Make note of the disk number you want to convert and enter it into the next command - replace disknumber) 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />select disk disknumber 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />clean 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />convert gpt 
<br />
<br />Then close Command Prompt and begin the installation again . . .       
        </p>

            Hey Delia_dflor,
<br />
<br />There is a way to convert your disk from MBR to GPT. You can follow this set of instructions here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-setup-installing-using-the-mbr-or-gpt-partition-style" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardwa...</a>
<br />
<br />When you're greeted with the Windows Setup window with the Windows logo and the menu items such as keyboard layout, hit SHIFT + F10. 
<br />
<br />Now you're in Command Prompt. You should then enter: diskpart 
<br />
<br />...that would bring you into DiskPart. 
<br />
<br />In DiskPart, enter the following: list disk 
<br />
<br />See what best represents your disk, your disk is probably the largest (or smaller if you have a boot drive). 
<br />
<br />If you've determined what disk number it is, perform the rest here, line-by-line: 
<br />
<br />select disk x
<br />clean 
<br />convert gpt 
<br />exit 
<br />
<br />x = that would be your disk number. You can then proceed with the installation process. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if you need any additional assistance, and good luck.

    <title>Gamhouse games are broken and will not run on Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> traviserck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamhouse games are broken and will not run on Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I've just discovered that none of the Gamehouse games at gamehouse.com will run on Windows 8.</p>
<p>I tried the compatibility assistant running it in various modes to try to get it to work and that includes running as administrator.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I've attempted to redownload the games and the gamehouse overlay is what the problem.</p>
<p>When you launch the game after the gamehouse installer installs them you see the windows circle thinking but</p>
<p>nothing runs.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem occurs on every single gamehouse game since they all use the overlay from gamehouse.</p>
<p>Gamehouse is a division of Real Networks and they have been notified but the obvious solution is going to probably</p>
<p>have to come from Microsoft.&nbsp; I can't see a viable option for Gamehouse to patch every single game they have.</p>
<p>So, the question for Microsoft is that it's easily reproducible and I've tried to find the problem by running the compatibility</p>
<p>assistant, run as admin, run in safe mode, and even redownloading the games and looking at the event viewer.</p>
<p>The event viewer doesn't even show anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We need Microsoft to fix this for all of us in the Gamehouse community.&nbsp;&nbsp; This isn't just one game this affects the entire community.</p>
<p>Please help us with a compatibility fix!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Travis Erck</p>

            <p>Please don't hold your breath. I have been going between the forums from game house and Microsoft and both state its the other fellows responsibility.&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;state that programs that worked on windows 7 will work on windows 8, after having customers run
 in compatibility mode and as admin, then they refer you to the programs maker(game house).</p>
<p>Game house says it is the new operating system and even though everyone knew this was coming any programs purchase before the release won't work. They do state they are working with the games creators, but &nbsp;It is most likely a way of saying sorry but you
 bought the new system and your&nbsp;games that&nbsp;we told you were yours only works on the old so I guess&nbsp;you will have to buy new releases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tangent games which came preinstalled on my windows 7 still work even after I upgraded to windows 8. and Microsoft's compatibilities page for games&nbsp;shows the same.&nbsp;Any new games from game house &nbsp;work with the occasion glitches though such as error message
 saying file missing.</p>
<p>uninstalled and reinstalled seemed to correct issue for the two games it happened on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well your right.&nbsp; It has gone back and forth.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I have over 300 games purchased through gamehouse (originally was Real Networks) and I'm having to flush over 1000 dollars in games down the toilet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lesson learned.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am now using BIg Fish which their game client works well with Windows 8 and doesn't have the terrible game overlay gamehouse uses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gamehouse claimed it was game compatibility.&nbsp; No it isn't.&nbsp; The same games I'm repurchasing on Big Fish work fine.&nbsp; You
 know why?&nbsp;&nbsp; Because Gamehouse put a DRM overlay on the game that's why.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I did check on DRM laws and DRM in software is supposed to be entirely transparent to the user and furthermore it's supposed to be non-invasive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft is right.&nbsp; Gamehouse is responsible.&nbsp;&nbsp; The games without the Gamehouse overlay work fine as Im repurchasing the one's I really play and like with BIg Fish.</p>
<p>That tells me it's a Gamehouse issue and as such when your a member your membership of the game purchase comes with a 2 year "warranty" that if the game is removed or doesn't work due to things like that they are technically supposed to refund your game
 in credits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I think this is more of a DRM issue rather than a breach of agreement for members.</p>
<p>And I'm so angry at this since its the DRM that broke it and their overlay that I'm hoping people start getting their cage rattled so badly that this turns into class action.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is completely unacceptable.</p>
<p>It's their 2 year agreement, its their DRM that broke it.&nbsp; That makes them 100 percent responsible.</p>
<p>The games themselves run fine on Windows 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; The INVASIVE and INTRUSIVE DRM overlay they put on it BROKE the damn game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So in that case I think we can nail them into the wall with this one.</p>
<p>BIg FIsh is going to get a lot of new customers out of this one unless Real Networks does something drastic to keep customers.&nbsp; After losing over a grand they can kiss my you know what.</p>
<p>At least with Big Fish I won't have to worry about this.&nbsp; The way they implement DRM is not invasive.</p>
<p>They use a game manager and the games themselves are not touched.&nbsp; The same games I have on Gamehouse are working at Big FIsh.&nbsp; Imagine that............that's proof that Gamehouse is lying about this.&nbsp; IT's their DRM overlay that broke all the games not
 the games themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jerks.&nbsp; They had a freaking year to fix this before we all learned about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crappy company.&nbsp; Stay away from Gamehouse.&nbsp; The way they've handled this is POOR.</p>
<p>F.&nbsp; I suggest people flood the Better Business Bureau with complaints and make them hold up to their 2 year game policy of games that are removed from the library or are incompatible that you hopefully you purchased that warranty as I did.&nbsp; They are lying
 about it being the games because then the warranty doesn't apply.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's why their lying about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The games themselves as I said work fine.&nbsp; I've played the same ones on Windows 8 through Big Fish.&nbsp; Why lie?&nbsp; Because then you can't use the 2 year agreement
 if it's a game issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it's not.&nbsp; There software is causing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That makes them liable and the warranty you bought completely enforceable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope they get what's coming for this.&nbsp; I feel they have treated the cusomters poorly about it and should have been offering game credits for this.&nbsp;&nbsp; Instead they are lying and saying its the games that are incompatible and they are working on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah
 then why do the same games work eveyr where else!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They are lying to us is why to get out of having to honor that 2 year warranty on your purchases that's why!!! &nbsp;&nbsp; I've always been skeptical of digital downloads.&nbsp;&nbsp; And thought to have the real thing in
 your hand is better.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After my experience of direct 2 drive being bought by GAmefly and that fiasco and now this fiasco of DRM overlays I'm done.&nbsp;&nbsp; Screw digital downloads your going to get F'd in the end and the only person to blame is you.&nbsp;&nbsp; After all
 this i'm a firm believer that you should purchase a hard copy of something.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LEsson learned TWICE now.</p>

            <p>I am with you on this. I have been their customer since 2000. Issue after issue. I did not have the warranty because when I&nbsp;signed up did not have it, teysimply stated that once you purchased a game you could download it anytime. That's&nbsp;right, I was told
 in&nbsp;writing that the games were mine and whether&nbsp;I remained a&nbsp;member or not the real arcade account would always be&nbsp;there. If you go into support link it tells you to go to the account and all the&nbsp;purchased games are there.&nbsp; when it switched to web access rather
 than&nbsp; game download manager there were a lot of issues that they never really addressed, games missing not working , they blamed it on microsoft, first XP service packs then it was Vista's fault, then issues with the browsers themselves and Norton, mcfee But
 once they switched to game house, and then started blaming the windows 7, and not telling everyone the game credits(20 free games&nbsp;) should have been used within so many days of the switch&nbsp; to game house ,I left but all my games were there, now for the last
 year or so they are disapearing and the company says that since I cancelled my membership I have no recourse, no free support to get games back,LOL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now it is another chance for them to screw the customer again and blame it on the new operating system,
</p>
<p>Ral networks has been using the DRM since the nineties with their music and video,Thy know all the ins and outs,&nbsp;&nbsp;you know the music as raphsody, and&nbsp;the realplayer for video and music.do a search for realnetworks on wikipedia. they led the way in streaming
 content on the internet so they know exactly what they are doing.Before game house it was called&nbsp;real arcade&nbsp;and the DRM has been the cause of most issues that they still blame on companies like microsoft.

            I too, have been mistreated by Gamehouse. My first incident was that I had downloaded Yahtze Download Edition, and was told in the very beginning I would be able to download the games I purchased forever, becaused I wanted to get a cd to be sure I would
 have it. Then my computer crashed and I had to get a new one. They told me that the games weren't working because of a problem that needed Microsoft's attention. And that I would not be able to get my Yahtze back because the company pulled the game. I lost
 a couple of other games for that same reason. I feel cheated and angry every time I think of it. I'm certainly done with them, and thank you for steering me in another direction and being able to possibly get some of my games back.<br />

            And, I, too, have the same problem.&nbsp; Although at this point (April) they seem to have fixed the layer on some games, but not on others.&nbsp; About a third of my games download and play on my new computer, while a full third do not.&nbsp; Like you, I've tried all
 the compatibility features.&nbsp; There is no consistency -- Peggle works, Peggle Nights does not.&nbsp; I'm going to put down a virtual box with windows 7 on it and set the games up there.&nbsp; Then I never have to be exposed to game house again.

            Big Fish games (any of them from PlayRix) are not compatible with Windows 8 (they worked well in Windows 7) and the troubleshooter just deems them as incompatible no matter what you set it on.&nbsp; The games even crash while testing them in the troubleshooter
 mode.&nbsp; The Big Fish Monopoly crashes as well, along with Redemption Cemetery. This is too sad and Windows needs to fix this!!!&nbsp; I'm tired of having bought dozens games that worked in Windows 7 to have them crash and burn in Windows 8!<br />

            <blockquote>Big Fish games (any of them from PlayRix) are not compatible with Windows 8 (they worked well in Windows 7) and the troubleshooter just deems them as incompatible no matter what you set it on.&nbsp; The games even crash while testing
 them in the troubleshooter mode.&nbsp; The Big Fish Monopoly crashes as well, along with Redemption Cemetery. This is too sad and Windows needs to fix this!!!&nbsp; I'm tired of having bought dozens games that worked in Windows 7 to have them crash and burn in Windows
 8!<br />

I'm actually running Windows 7. Just a couple of months ago I started having issues with every game (old downloads and new ones). I get through the download/installation successfully and then all I end up with after that&nbsp; is a blank blue window. It's the smaller
 Gamehouse window that normally pops up with the options to play the free trial, or unlock the full version. Nothing happens after that. Like I said, even games that I had installed on my computer over a year ago aren't working. I tried running various different
 games in just about every different compatibility mode, didn't work. I've tried Tech. Support with Gamehouse. I had a guy in India drag me through a lengthy remote assistance session just for him to tell me he doesn't know what the problem is. Then tells me
 that a level2 Tech. will call me back at a later time to try again to work through the issue. I just about at my wits end with this. I am really close to just calling it quits with Gamehouse. I too started playing when it was Real Arcade. Any thoughts on the
 fact that I am having this issue with Windows 7. Could it be a Windows update that recently took place? Maybe a change in the service pack? Just wondering...<br />

            Just a note that as time has been passing Gamehouse has been patching each game up to run with Windows 8.&nbsp; Unfortunately what this means is no game that is currently installed on Win 7 and then upgraded to 8 will work its going to break it.<br />
<br />
Any game you had must be reinstalled and downloaded old installers are now bad as the DRM has been updated so an old game that did work will now break as they move the games to be also Windows 8 compatible.<br />
<br />
This is a nuissance to have to redownload your games but it's required.&nbsp;&nbsp; The DRM and overlay contacts gamehouse everytime you launch.&nbsp;&nbsp; So what did work will get broken.<br />
The only fix is to redownload the game that is on the list below:<br />
<br />
The list of games they have converted and updated are:<br />
<br />
https://support.gamehouse.com/entries/24110742-Which-games-are-Windows-8-compatible-<br />
<br />
Go to this site and REDOWNLOAD the games you own.<br />
If its' not on the list your out of luck untill they add the game.<br />
It has been a very long slow process over the past year.<br />
<br />
This includes even if your on Windows 7 and the game is working or broken.<br />
The DRM overlay communicates to the Gamehouse authentication servers.<br />
So it would not shock me if they broke Win 7 compatiblity in the process of the updates.<br />
But the games have been updated and it wouldn't surprise me if people are suddenly noticing<br />
that even on 7 as another user mentioned that it stopped.<br />
<br />
It's all the DAMN DRM so redownload it if your game is on the list and it should work fine.<br />
Now Windows 8.1 is coming in a month that is supposed to fix alot of heartaches and I hear it's good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My real concern now is it going to break again!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then again the preview has been out for a long time so I hope GAmehouse has been making sure....yeah
 right just like last time when Windows 8 preview was out for a full freaking year while they did nothing.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Steps to downgrade windows 7 to xp<br />
<br />
STEP 1. Open your Windows 7 drive (generally C drive) and make sure that you haven’t removed the Windows.old folder, which was created by Windows while installing Windows 7 on XP drive. Remember, without this folder you won’t be able to proceed further.<br />
<br />
STEP 2. Now, check the size of Windows.old folder by right-clicking and then selecting properties. You need to make sure that Windows.old folder must be less than two times the amount of free hard drive space available on Windows 7 system drive (C drive). If
 the Windows.old folder size is two times larger, disable system restore utility and also use disk cleanup tool to get some free space.<br />
<br />
STEP 3. Insert your Windows 7 installation disc into DVD-ROM and restart your system. Press any key when prompted to boot from DVD.<br />
<br />
STEP 4. Choose your language, time, keyboard type and then click on Next button to continue.<br />
<br />
STEP 5. In the Install Windows screen, click Repair your computer option to get System Recovery Options.<br />
<br />
STEP 6. Now select your Windows 7 OS and note down your Windows 7 Drive letter before clicking on Next.<br />
<br />
STEP 7. In the next window, click Command Prompt to start downgrading from Windows 7 to XP.<br />
<br />
STEP 8. At first you need to transfer all the data of your Windows 7 drive to a folder. So type the following commands one by one and then press enter after each command (here we’re assuming that “D” is your Windows 7 drive letter).<br />
<br />
D:<br />
<br />
Md Win7<br />
<br />
Move Windows Win7\Windows<br />
<br />
Move “Program Files” “Win7\Program Files”<br />
<br />
Move Users Win7\Users<br />
<br />
Attrib –h –s –r ProgramData<br />
<br />
Move ProgramData Win7\ProgramData<br />
<br />
Rd “Documents and Settings”<br />
<br />
STEP 9. Next, you need to copy all the contents of Windows.old folder to the drive. Again, follow all the commands given below one by one and then press enter after each command.<br />
<br />
move /y d:\Windows.old\Windows d:\<br />
<br />
move /y “d:\Windows.old\Program Files” d:\<br />
<br />
move /y “d:\Windows.old\Documents and Settings” d:\<br />
<br />
STEP 10. Next, you need to restore the boot sector by typing the following command:<br />
<br />
E:\boot\bootsect /nt52 d:<br />
<br />
STEP 11. At last restore the boot.ini file by entering the following commands:<br />
<br />
Attrib –h –s –r boot.ini.saved<br />
<br />
Copy boot.ini.saved boot.ini<br />
<br />
STEP 12. Now type Exit and restart your system to get back to Windows XP again.

<p><strong><span>Can I downgrade my OEM version of Windows 7 Professional to Windows XP Professional?</span>
</strong></p>
<p><span>For a limited time of 18 months after the general availability of Windows 7 or the release of a Windows 7 Service Pack, whichever is earlier, the OEM license of Windows 7 Professional
 and Windows 7 Ultimate will include downgrade rights to Windows XP Professional. After that period the OEM license will enable downgrade rights to Windows Vista Business.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Krish, yes i did tried out those troubleshoots and no error pops up, i tried to go on my joysticks properties on advance settings and i performed the tests, everything's fine i.e the
<strong>buttons</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>analogs&nbsp;</strong>and <strong>vibrations </strong>
works very well, how ever, when i open a any game e.g like modern combat 5, and i go on controllers to change from
<em>keyboard</em> to <em>gamepads</em>, it only shows a <em>keyboard </em>and no <em>
gamepads</em>, in other games it show the <em>gamepads </em>but when i want to select, it says"no gamepads connected". am using a desktop running windows 10 with no bluetooth and the
<em>gamepad </em>am using are INTEX USB GAMEPAD model No.IT GP02. Can you please search for me a solution Krish i really want to use the controllers and not the keyboard.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I had this problem also. I don't know if it works for you guys but after much tinkering around I have figured out the solution. Now I believe this will only work if you upgraded to windows 10 from a previous version whilst still using the USB gamepad in
 question. If you had a fresh install of windows 10 (ie format HD and stuff) and still have this problem then I believe you all you may need is to update windows.<br />
<br />
My USB controller is plug and play and could not use the above mentioned method. Instead I devised this method which worked:<br />
<br />
1) Go to control panel then select devices and Printers <br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6716ad8-fff2-432c-b3d0-a2d3ffe4f9d9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f6716ad8-fff2-432c-b3d0-a2d3ffe4f9d9" /></a><br />
<br />
2) Right click on usb game controller icon and select remove device. Allow windows to remove the drivers.
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30c10817-3693-4bf6-ac53-292a0577ef5b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30c10817-3693-4bf6-ac53-292a0577ef5b" /></a><br />
<br />
3) Unplug your USB Controller and then plug it back in. You should find that the drivers will reinstall themselves and will now work on windows 10.
<br />
<br />
Reply to this post to let me know if this has worked as it has for me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 17/01/16: I have noticed that this fix will need to be repeated every time you restart your PC; Unfortunately the changes (for some odd reason) do not stick and you will be required to reinstall your drivers like the above post every time you shutdown/boot
 your PC. <br />
<br />
It's a pain I know, unless someone else knows better (please share your knowledge) this is the only way I know how to deal with Plug and play controllers at the current moment in time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Namaste. </p>

    <title>Windows 10 Setup will not close - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dianerobbel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Setup will not close</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 setup got to "checking for updates" and hung on that screen. &nbsp;It stayed that way for hours. I tried to close the program and got this "Setup is cleaning up before it closes" (this may take a few minutes) - and has been on that screen for over
 12 hours. &nbsp;I'm worried that if I just shut it off, it will not work right due to left over windows 10 partial installs. &nbsp;What do I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was on my Gateway NE5700u, running Windows 8.1</p>
