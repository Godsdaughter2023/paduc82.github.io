    <title>User Profile Service Failed the Logon&#47;User Account Logon - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            User Profile Service Failed the Logon&#47;User Account Logon doesn&#39;t match up with correct User Directory</h2>
                    I have an approximately 3 month old Win7 Home Premium 64 bit computer. The computer was originally set up with 2 admin user accounts, "Scott" and "Diane." "Scott" was the main user, while "Diane" had never really been configured or used and was essentially
 a bare desktop. <br />
<br />
On a reboot, the main user account ("Scott") would not log on, with the error message "The user profile service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded." The other admin user account ("Diane") was able to log on. I spent several hours searching the
 internet under the "Diane" user account to try to find a solution, which ultimately led me to a solution posted at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/130095-user-profile-service-failed-logon-user-profile-cannot-loaded.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/130095-user-profile-service-failed-logon-user-profile-cannot-loaded.html</a>&nbsp;involving
 corrections to the user account profile through regedit.<br />
<br />
Everything appeared to work fine when I followed the outlined steps. I was able to log on again as "Scott" without the failed logon error message. However, when I logged on as "Scott," I was essentially logged on as a new user, with a bare desktop, etc.<br />
<br />
Within windows explorer, if I open up the C: drive and look at users, "Scott" is there, and all of the expected folders (desktop, my documents, etc.) still have all the files in them from my original user account "Scott." However, there is also now a new user
 listed within the users folder called "Scott.DESKTOP." The folders under that user are empty, and presumably, that is the user now associated with the log in "Scott." I also looked within "control panel/add or remove user accounts" and there is the one user
 account named "Scott." There is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span> a separate account named "Scott.DESKTOP."<br />
<br />
If I attempt to open up any program that requires configuration (Windows Live Mail, ITunes, etc.) when I have logged in as "Scott," the program treats me as a new user, and I fear it would be a lot of effort and would create some potential problems to move
 all my files around so that my emails, my ITunes files and libraries, and probably a bunch of other things I haven't thought of yet would be configured to fall under "Scott.DESKTOP" as opposed to "Scott."<br />
<br />
To summarize, within c:users, there is a user folder named "Scott" and a new user folder named "Scott.DESKTOP." When I login as "Scott," it takes me to the desktop of user "Scott.DESKTOP" as opposed to the desktop of user "Scott," and I don't seem to have any
 way of actually logging in as the original user "Scott."<br />
<br />
Is there any way that I can re-associate the logon "Scott" with the original user folder structure that still appears within windows explorer under the user name "Scott?" All the correct files/folders/information are still there. For example, the folder "Desktop"
 within C:Users|Scott still shows all of the shortcuts, folders, etc. that I had on my desktop. I just don't seem to have any way of getting there.<br />
<br />
Two other potentially relevant pieces of info: During one of my failed attempts to log on, prior to attempting the solution referenced above, I received a different error message, which said "Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\Desktop is not accessible.
 Access is denied." Also, at one point, a dialog box opened up stating that "This copy of Windows is not genuine." However, I just closed the box and proceeded, and that message never reappeared. I am confident that was a strange side effect of whatever problem
 I am having, as my copy of windows is OEM and I have never had an issue with my copy of windows, updating windows, etc. before.<br />
<br />
Also, in the course of attempting to solve the original problem, I attempted to use system restore from safe mode, since some folks had said that this solved their problem. I had 4 restore points to choose from. The two most recent were both on the day the
 problem arose. System restore itself appeared to work, but they did not solve the log on problem. However, system restore would not function with the two older restore points (3 days before and 6 days before the problem arose). If I tried to restore to either
 of those restore points, system restore would begin and would then stop with an error message that "instruction at -----referenced memory could not be read." I am not sure if the system restore issue failure is somehow connected to the logon problem or not.<br />
<br />
Any help would certainly be appreciated.<br />

<div>You may find it simplest just to copy the whole tree of files under Scott, to scott.DESKTOP.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This isn't a perfect solution, but it will get you back things like the stuff on your desktop and documents etc.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You might want to take a look at this blog entry which is referenced from the page I believe you used:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.brooks-bilson.com/blogs/rob/index.cfm/2009/1/5/Fix-for-Vistas-The-User-Profile-Service-service-failed-the-logon-User-profile-cannot-be-loaded" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.brooks-bilson.com/blogs/rob/index.cfm/2009/1/5/Fix-for-Vistas-The-User-Profile-Service-service-failed-the-logon-User-profile-cannot-be-loaded</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>See whether the folders it mentions exist on your system and clean them up if needed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Option 1 at this link</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Should be what you need to do to regain access to the old profile--you may want to double check whether the steps there correspond to what you are seeing now.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>(I know that was what you originally used--but going through it again might enable you to see a typo or some other issue that would correct the original problem.)</div>

<p>Thanks, Bill.&nbsp; I did look at the blog entry.&nbsp; I don't seem to have the extraneous files he mentioned, so I don't think I have his scenario.&nbsp; I will try to run again through the first option decribed in the site I linked, in case I did something wrong.&nbsp; I
 guess another option would be to run system restore to one of the recent restore points&nbsp;which predated my attempt at option 1 (I do seem able to do system restore to more recent restore points, but that doesn't solve the logon problem), and simply try again
 to see if it works correctly the second time around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A number of people who have had similar problems have indicated that system restore solved the problem.&nbsp; However, as I mentioned above, I get an error message if&nbsp;I try to restore to one of the older restore points that I have available.&nbsp; I'm not sure if
 that probelm is related or not, but if I could figure out a way around the system restore error, I might be able to solve the login problem without jumping through all these hoops.&nbsp; Do you have any thoughts as to how I might be able to do a system restore
 here.&nbsp; FIY:&nbsp; I have tried system restore both witihin Win 7 and at boot.&nbsp; Within Win 7, it just hangs and at boot, I get the error message mentioned in my original post.</p>
<p>If I do simply decide to copy the folder tree to the new user, can you give me any advice as to what I would need to do to get my old email messages that would be sitting in the "scott" inbox into the new inbox for "scott.desktop?"&nbsp; I also am a bit worried
 about whether there will be any issues if I simply copy&nbsp;my itunes folder from "scott" to "scott.desktop."&nbsp; Another issue is that I have an online backup process in place, tied to specific folders&nbsp;under "scott."&nbsp; I assume I would have to start over with that,
 if I move everything to scott.desktop.</p>
<p>Do you have any thoughts on these issues (or any other issues that I may not be smart enough to identify)?</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Scott</p>

    <title>Application fails with 0xc0000142 after installation of Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Application fails with 0xc0000142 after installation of Win 10 Creators update.</h2>
                    I have an application that no longer works after installing the Creators update of Windows 10. To verify this, I have used Hyper-V instances of fresh installations of Win 10 Anniversary(1607) and Win 10 Creators(1703). The application works as expected
 on Win 10 Anniversary (and has since Win 7), but not Creators. The application fails to start with a 0xc0000142 status in a message box. I've turned on loader snaps and that shows that the initialisation routine of Kernelbase.dll is failing during DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH
 and returning 0xc0000142.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The application in question is a console app, which functions as an updater application: it creates a temporary copy of itself which it then launches, that temporary copy overwrites the old copy, which it then launches. The application fails with the above
 status in this case, but when run manually by myself, it is successful. The application binary is exactly the same accross the two Windows versions, but behaves very differently. It is a C++ application built with VS2013. One more piece of potentially relevant
 information: the application uses the Apache Portable Runtime to spawn processes, not straight win32 calls.<br />
<br />
I don't know how to debug this problem any further.<br />
<br />
Loader snaps partial output below:<br />
LdrpInitializeNode - INFO: Calling init routine 00007FFFEB74BEC0 for DLL "C:\WINDOWS\System32\KERNELBASE.dll"<br />
LdrpInitializeNode - ERROR: Init routine 00007FFFEB74BEC0 for DLL "C:\WINDOWS\System32\KERNELBASE.dll" failed during DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH<br />

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Regarding your issue, I would first suggest is to
<br />Try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

<h2>            Surface Pro3 - Crashing on waking with the docking station connect to an external monitor</h2>
                    <p>I have a core i5-256gb surface pro 3 that's been demonstration repeated driver_power_state_failure BSODs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm uploading the dump file to my one drive right now, but until then, my "analyze -v" of the minidump is pasted below. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me it looks like the capacitive button driver is causing the fault. &nbsp;Has anyone seen this before? &nbsp;Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The surface started behaving like this a week ago. &nbsp;I believe now that this is a result of poor shutdown behavior rather than poor startup behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sequence is this. &nbsp;After using the surface, I'll shutdown the system (not sleep, nor hitting the power button). &nbsp;The screen goes black and when I turn it back on, the surface logo pops up, but I get no spinner, and it hangs there. &nbsp;Eventually I'll see
 the driver_state failure. &nbsp;Or I can preempt it by forcing the full power off by holding the power button and volume up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I boot after the full power cycle, the surface boots up normally and promptly as expected. &nbsp;I thought about utilizing sleep instead of full shutdown instead, and found that if I hit start-&gt; power-&gt; sleep, instead of shutdown, nothing happens at all.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to comb the logs again, and see if I see any system errors. &nbsp;When I looked through the first time, there was nothing standing out. &nbsp;There were a couple time related issues, which reminds me that if left off for a while, the tablet seems to lose its
 ability to hold time. &nbsp;I'll boot it up and it will be off by a day or more. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a docking station with the tablet. &nbsp;Now that I think about it, this has been happening since I've really started using the docking station regularly. &nbsp;I think that I need to see if the same behavior occurs when shutting down out of the tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get home I'll check the device manager for banged out or other devices. &nbsp;I'm wondering now if it's not seeing something with the dock station.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh and yes, I can confirm that all firmware and updates are installed. &nbsp;I made sure to do that immediately.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Using a brand new Surface Pro 3 i7 and now 3rd Surface Pro 3 Dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 1st 2 Docks had significant issues with recognizing an external monitor when re-docking or waking from a sleep while docked. I&nbsp;tried both Mini DisplayPort to VGA adapter and also to HDMI with the same results.&nbsp; I did extensive tests with the Surface
 and could get the ext. monitor recognized sometimes and fail sometimes with the following scenarios tried multiple times with different results regularly:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Powered On before docking ... Powered On after docking ... Wake up from sleep while docked ...
</p>
<p>and maybe some scenarios I don't remember.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My conclusion was that the 1st 2 Docks would not be suitable for reliable consistent output to an external monitor.&nbsp; My 3rd Dock has been a very different story.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st, when I opened the package I noticed the white cloth-type&nbsp;wrapping the Dock was in was very different.&nbsp; It was more of a wrap-around and not a bag -- actually a better design.&nbsp; Wouldn't matter except this made me strongly believe I had a Dock from&nbsp;new
 lot number batch from manufacturing. (I had read in one forum someone that was asked his Dock's Serial Number and they sent him one presumably from a newer serial # batch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd, this 3rd Dock has worked wonderfully well.&nbsp; I have not found a way to force it to NOT recognize the external monitor after some 20 tests in different scenarios of docking, un-docking, sleeping, waking, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3rd, I did discover one significant issue that I can 100% duplicate every time (in appx. 10+ tests).&nbsp; If the Surface Pro 3 is POWERED OFF or SHUTDOWN while DOCKED, it ALWAYS hangs at the boot logo screen with "Surface" -- then the only resolution is to do
 a "hard" power off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can live with this by just making sure I un-dock before powering off.&nbsp; I'm hoping this will get resolved in some update.&nbsp; I hope this helps someone with similar problems.</p>

            <p>@jojopool - that last part is exactly the issue I'm experiencing. I Decided today to swap out the dock and see if that makes a difference (this sfc3 was working fine with another dock, previously. I bought another for my wife when i got a sfc3 for work and
 gave her the existing sfc).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought the dock on amazon for Christmas, and i think i got it from a 3rd party vendor because it came already opened. Still looked new, but i should have known better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im anticipating that the dock is the problem at this point after clarifying over the weekend that there's no problems with shutdown/bootups out of the dock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the info!</p>

            <p>I have narrowed things down to the Monitor or cable that is connected to the dock. As the issue does NOT occur when the monitor cable is unplugged from the dock station.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like Jojopool, my issue only happens when in the dock, and it seems to happen 100% of the time. &nbsp;Jojopool's description of the issues he faced lead me to think about the differences between my dock station and my wife's and the only real difference is the
 monitor. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Her's is an LG 24en33tw-b (I think, going by memory, not sitting in front of it). &nbsp;Mine are hans-sprees. &nbsp;My monitors have hdmi, and hers is only vga or dvi. &nbsp;I have a displaylink adapter and a displayport to hdmi changer, whereas she is just using a DP
 to DVI connector. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm inclined to believe it's the monitor at this point, and not the cable. &nbsp;It could be some issue with displayport to DVI conversion that maybe I wouldn't have with VGA. &nbsp;I updated the driver of the monitor from generic, to the specific model driver, and
 still got the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be testing a couple further things tonight:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will plugin an older dell monitor that has vga/dvi, using the existing cable. &nbsp;If i still have problems, I'm going to track down a DP to VGA cable and see if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, I suppose I'm going to start looking for monitors unless someone has any suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no banged out devices in device manager. &nbsp;The dmp is still obscure ACPI.sys like above. &nbsp;The tablet works great except for booting up after shutting down while docked. &nbsp;It also worked very well while docked in my dock station... which, as near as
 I can tell, is identical to the TWO I've tried on her desk. &nbsp;No revision number differences. &nbsp;Part numbers are the same, and serial numbers are not wildly different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone with another suggestion?</p>

            <p>So - I tried with an old monitor... same problem. &nbsp;Which kind of lead me back to believing it's the cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a DP to VGA cable that I tried out, and same problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... after all that, I decided to put the i5 SP3 on my dock station that I use for my i7. &nbsp;This is the rig that I used as my primary setup for about 3 months with the i5, before handing it to my wife. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm totally confused. &nbsp;Recap of the symptoms:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shutting down while in a dock station causes the next boot up to essentially fail. &nbsp;I have to hard boot (volume up and power button) to get it to respond. &nbsp;The tablet worked for months in a dock station with no problems. &nbsp;I even reset the OS and tried it
 again thinking it was a bum driver... same thing. &nbsp;I bought another dock station to test that out, and same thing. &nbsp;I tested in a dock station setup that works flawlessly with my other SP3 and same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I unplug the monitor from the dock station, the problem doesn't happen at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone suggest something else? &nbsp;My wife is about ready to shoot me for the trouble...</p>

            <p>No - Not domain joined.</p>
<p>I'm not using an official surface video adapter, though I never had problems until recently.</p>
<p>Yes, standard image.&nbsp; When I reset it recently, I used "reset to factory settings", though I didn't force it to delete all files, but I did use the destructive re-install, not the one that keeps programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit -&nbsp; I just created a local account.&nbsp; After shutting down cleanly, booting up and logging in with the new local account, the same issue occurred.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, with the monitor plugged into the SP3 directly, I didn't encounter the problem with multiple reboots and sitting in the docking station.&nbsp; The issue ONLY occurs with the monitor plugged into the docking station directly.&nbsp; And seemingly any docking station
 with a monitor plugged in. (I have another sp3 rig with other monitors that my SP3 works in, but this one does work in either one).</p>

</p><p>I have been having VMMAdmin crashing issue for a long time and I have searched on google and Microsoft how to fix it and few other people having the same issue but there is no solid resolution I could found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just right-click on my VM and selected property and it crashes. When I clicked on the Debug button, I found that it's WPF error as below</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>System.TypeInitializationException was unhandled</strong><br />
<strong>Message: An unhandled exception of type 'System.TypeInitializationException' occurred in PresentationFramework.dll</strong><br />
<strong>Additional information:&nbsp;</strong><br />
<strong>The type initializer for 'Microsoft.VirtualManager.UI.WpfControls.ElementHostGC' threw an exception.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to run Rollup 11 but it does not help me. Is there anyway to fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help me, much appreciated </p>

<h2>            how do i print selected tif pages</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I receive lots of faxes as .tif files.&nbsp; I now use windows 8 and the handling of these is not great.&nbsp; I am now using Windows Photo Viewer to open them.&nbsp; However, the print options are not designed for faxes, they are designed for photos.&nbsp; I frequently want
 to print a few pages of a long fax.&nbsp; The only printing option that I can find simply prints the whole fax.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there an alternative?</p>

<div>=========================================</div>
<div>The following freeware will allow you to print any page of<br />
a multipage TIFF file. When you go to...File / Print...you<br />
can choose which page or pages to print.<br />
<br />
Also...it can extract all the pictures from a multipage <br />
TIFF file...and you can save them separately.<br />

    <title>Mic stops picking up my voice after a minute - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> asap coby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mic stops picking up my voice after a minute</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>Was wondering if I could get some help with my problem. Starting yesterday, my headset would stop picking up my voice after about a minute from being plugged in. I can still hear the people I am playing with/in a party/etc., but my mic will just stop picking
 up my audio. I can fix it by unplugging it and plugging it back in, but the same thing occurs. My mic doesn't show the orange logo to say that it's in mute, and muting/unmuting does not fix the problem. My friends say that my voice is loud and clear when talking,
 so I don't think the mic itself is dying. My NAT is open and has never been a problem, so I highly doubt it is my connection. I don't have another controller/mic to test this, but wanted to see if anyone else has had this occur before I go ahead and buy another
 one. Let me know if this is fixable, what is at fault, and whatever else I can do to attempt to fix this. Thanks!</p>
<p>-Coby</p>

<p>by chance, it could be that the usb piece is not snug.</p>
<p>What headset are you using?</p>
<p>If its the default one, I would assume that its either the wires have moved around or that the usb piece may need to be wiped off with a dry, and soft fabric.</p>
<p>Nothing wet or moist.</p>
<p>The other possibility is that the batteries are dying or not strong enough.</p>

<p>My mic just stopped picking up my voice completely, ad sometimes I can hear a crackling sound from my mic. My mute and volume buttons work fine. i use my phone charger instead of batteries, I recently used batteries to see if it would work but nope.</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>The password&nbsp; your email account is different from the Microsoft account that you use to log in to Windows (even though both use the same email address.) First off, please open up the following link on your current computer:</p>
<p>https://account.live.com/resetpassword.aspx </p>
<p>Click &amp;quot;I forgot my password&amp;quot; and then click Next. Enter your email address (the one you use to log in to Windows 10) and the captcha code provided, and then click Next. Follow the on-screen directions; you will be able to reset and create a new
 password your Microsoft account this way. The password your email account will still remain as it was earlier; you just changed the password your Microsoft account (that uses the same email address.)Next, please use the newly created password the login screen,
 on your laptop.</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 Start Button broken among other things. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dingledingle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Start Button broken among other things.</h2>
                    <p>I have just installed Windows 10, upgrading from Windows 7 and many utilities are not working</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Start Button does not work when clicked on, simply changes to the load cursor and does nothing.</p>
<p>Both the Windows Store and Edge Browser are nowhere to be seen. I saw the Windows Store Icon but It wouldn't launch and then disappeared from the taskbar.</p>
<p>The Search bar also does nothing when clicked on and I cannot type in it.</p>
<p>The Action Center Icon does not work when clicked either.<br />
</p>
<p>I have tried creating a new account on my computer to see if it was a problem with the account I carried over from Windows 7, but when I go to the account settings to create a new one it says I need an app from the Windows Store, which I cannot access.</p>
<p>I have also tried various fixes suggested like running commands through PowerShell and the Command Prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to say I'm not very good with this stuff so please keep it in simple terms</p>

<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the problem has not been fixed through this. When I ran the SFC scan, i responded with "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows did not find any integrity violations" and when I restarted my PC nothing
 had changed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I don't believe I have, made any changes to the PC before the problem began, My PC was custom built so I don't think it really has a make, and the problem began as soon as I upgraded
 to Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If it is needed, I do use a Nvidia GPU, which I have heard has had some problems with Windows 10, but I don't know if this would have anything to do with my current problem.</span></p>

<p>Hi Crystal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that the issue remains after you have done several troubleshooting steps. We would like to ask a few questions to further investigate the concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>When did you start experiencing the erratic cursor?</li><li>Can you confirm if you made any software changes prior to this concern?</li><li>What were the programs running when the issue occurs?</li><li>Does the issue still persists when the device is in tablet mode, no mouse and type cover connected?</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, try to download the recovery image <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here
</a></strong>to use it in resetting your Surface to its factory condition and check if you experience the same behavior.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: Make sure that you always back up your files to avoid losing your data.</p>

<p>I have reset it to factory condition but the issue still unsolved. It was not that worse just after the reset, it only happen occassionally for a few seconds. However, at the next time I turn on PC, it become serious and most of the time i need to use keyboard
 or touch screen to make any moves.</p>
<ul>
<li>When did you start experiencing the erratic cursor? ----- i think in late Aug, i tried to revert the update but things didnt get better</li><li>Can you confirm if you made any software changes prior to this concern? ----- i cant remember, it seems it started since i turned on the pc in late Aug</li><li>What were the programs running when the issue occurs? ----- cant tell. the cursor couldnt be controlled at all times when i surf the internet; the problem persist when no software running and just show desktop, but may stop for a while occasionally; sometimes
 it happens even before i login to the window&nbsp;</li><li>Does the issue still persists when the device is in tablet mode, no mouse and type cover connected? ---- yes</li></ul>
<p>Please tell me what i can do to solve it. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Edge Some Favorites dissapear and old ones keep rearranging</h2>
                    After spending hours trying to re-arrange, organize, delete, add favorites I had imported from IE11 into&nbsp;a structure that made sense to me (a feet made&nbsp;nearly impossible&nbsp;by the lack of a good organization&nbsp;tool/structure within Edge).&nbsp; I have come back
 to find some of the favorites had moved back the&nbsp;root/base level outside of the folders I had created.&nbsp; I found that some of them moved around within the folders and&nbsp;some of my favorites are just gone.&nbsp; Needless to say I am very disappointed and need to know
 how to correct and fix so things stay put in the future????&nbsp;

</p><p>SearchUI.exe (Cortana) is constantly accessing the Internet, and it mostly downloading
<em>something</em> at 10+ Mbps:</p>

<p>
</p><p>However, I've disabled it in Group Policy:</p>

<p>
</p><p>It's not Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I disable web search, it doesn't happen; however, the search window closes after a couple of seconds due to refreshing of Cortana process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>So at this point I've stopped all future Windows 10 deployments/upgrades and hopefully a fix from Microsoft will be coming sometime soon, because as the second thread mentions, I'm starting to see these problems on the original RTM installs now as well since
 the Windows Updates that came out this week.</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>The registry change to grant "ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES" full control of the HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes registry key and all below it fixes the problem for my broken users.&nbsp;&nbsp; (follow the links above for more specific information).&nbsp; Edge, Cortana all
 work correctly and the gigantic Cortana downloads cease after applying the registry key permission change.</p>

<span>Few months ago I noticed that from time to time my taskbar icons blink. It's like refreshing. This happens at random times, when I surf web or browse
 files. It's just quickly blinks. Often during the blink there is also spinning mouse circle appears for a 1 second. This happens once in 5-10 minutes. Not much, but still, annoying and most important, very distracting when you see them blinking. This is the
 example of the blinking:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://i.stack.imgur.com/MiDti.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://i.stack.imgur.com/MiDti.gif</a><span>&nbsp;As

 I have several PCs with Windows 10, none have this blinking.</span><br />
<span>I also noticed that during the blink Windows Explorer usage increases to 0,1-0,2%. There are no programs which uses lots of CPU. All usage is normal.</span><br />

<p>Thank you for that information. There might be a third-party software that is causing the issue. That being said, did the issue return right after performing a clean installation of Windows 10? If it did occur even without installing any apps, can you tell
 me about the Windows 10 installation media you used to perform the clean installation? There's a chance that the ISO file you used is corrupted, thus causing the issue. I advise downloading the latest ISO file for
<em>Windows 10 version 1803</em>. You can refer to <em>Andre Da Costa</em>'s <strong>

<h2>            Ghost Recon F.S., motivo del retraso&#59; no tener competencia.</h2>
                    
<p>Haciendo eco de una noticia de Eurogamer, UBISOFT ha dado como motivo del retraso que el juego no salga con otros titulos FPS/TPS belicos.</p>
<p>Asi lo atrasa hasta el primer cuarto del 2012.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lo que a mi personalmente no me hace ninguna gracia por que yo se que comprar y eso me da que pensar.</p>
<p>Es decir, que entiendo que el juego ha dejado de ser el Ghost Recon de siempre para pasar a ser un hibrido de otros titulos de xbox 360 como lo es el Crysis, por decir un ejemplo.</p>
<p>Asi que eso hace que dude mas en su compra.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lo que yo me pregunto tambien, ¿no ibamos a participar en la BETA del juego los que compramos el SCC?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>La gente si sabe lo que quiere comprar lo que pasa es que como normalmente no tienen criterio ninguno se van a comprar un Call of Duty modern refrito 3 e vez el Ghost Recon que la verdad es que tiene muy buena pinta o un Battlefield 3.</p>
<p>La verdad es que &nbsp;amí me da igual que lo retrasen siempre que saquen un buen juego y no un truñaco.</p>

<p>No se... a mi que se dejen de tonteria y lo saquen ya, por que para mi el juego que se cambia de fecha (por que se deduce que no es por que no este acabado) deja bien claro que la propia desarrolladora entiende que el titulo que salia en la misma fecha,
 &nbsp;va a tener mas calidad en general.</p>
<p>Asi que ya sabemos que si iba a salir el mismo mes del GOW 3, pues este es mejor que el GRFS.</p>
<p>Nota: no se la fecha exacta que tenia, luego lo del GoW3 es un decir.</p>

<p>Está muy claro que es por un tema de estrategia de marketing, salen demasiados juegos y no quieren arriesgar, hay mucha inversión por medio, yo en parte lo entiendo.</p>

<p>Si, yo tambien entiendo eso.</p>
<p>Mi critica es precisamente esa, que no se trata de que el usuario entienda a la empresa, sino al reves.</p>
<p>Y parece que UBISOFT no entiende que los usuarios que han jugado al Ghost Recon, sera fiel a dicha saga y los casuales son solo eso, casuales. Compran lo mas barato y simple, mientras divierta o haiga mucha gente.</p>

</p><p>I work in a team that wants to send SMS messages to people attending a meeting for them to confirm attendance.&nbsp; Rather than have the message to come back to a Skype account we want them to reply to a mobile phone number.&nbsp; It won't always be the same phone

    <title>How do I import contacts into a category in Windows Live Mail - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I import contacts into a category in Windows Live Mail contacts.</h2>
                    I have followed your instructions as outline in "<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/5b626553-7c28-4b10-88c1-45a61be53ba6">If you need all the contact data for the members of a category...</a>"<br />
<br />
How do I now import those contacts (each category saved in a separate folder), back into a category in my Windows Live Mail contacts.&nbsp; I can do some by creating a category and selecting contacts as "listed" in the category folder; but some of the categories
 contain upwards of 100 contacts.&nbsp; That would take a while.<br />
<br />
When I selected "Import / Business card .vcf" and selected one of my category folders created above, WLM just imported into "All Contacts" and did not give me an option to import into a category.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To import into Windows Live Mail keeping categories intact, use Windows Contacts as an intermediary:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type <strong>contacts </strong>into the start search box and press <em>Enter</em>. This will open the Windows Contacts folder for the current Windows user.</li><li>If the folder contains any contacts and is in use for some reason (like synchronizing with a mobile device), copy the folder and paste back to the same place to safeguard the contents of the folder. Empty the folder called
<em>Contacts</em>.</li><li>Create new folders within the Contacts folder to match the folders of VCF files.
</li><li>Use the <em>Import &gt; vCard </em>function to import batchwise from each folder of VCF files. Use Select All (Ctrl-A) to select all the VCF files in a folder to import all of them at once.
</li><li>After each import, move the&nbsp;contact files&nbsp;into the corresponding folder.</li><li>Open each of the folders in turn and use <em>New Contact Group</em> to create a group with the category name you want eventually to use in Windows Live Mail. Then use the
<em>Add</em> button in the contacts group dialogue to select all of the contacts in the folder and add them to the new group.<br />
You should now have a number of folders inside Contacts, each containing a number of .contact files and a single .group file.</li><li>In Windows Live Mail's contacts window, use <em>Import &gt; Address book for current Windows user.
</em>Categories will be created automatically containing the members of the Windows Contacts groups.
</li><li>You can either keep the new folders in Windows Contacts as a backup, or delete them all and then copy the contents of the
<em>Contacts - Copy</em> folder back to restore the status quo. The <em>Contacts - Copy</em> folder can then be deleted.</li></ol>
<p><br />
You could have avoided all this simply by signing in in Windows Live Mail. This would synchronize all your contacts and categories with those at people.live.com, so to reproduce them on a new installation or another Windows account or another computer, just
 sign in with the same account. <br />
