<h2>            Window 10 Solitaire Collection black screen after advertisement</h2>
                    <p>I have an Xbox identity that was created in connection the the excellent "Flight" program that was terminated before completion.<br />
<br />
Have for several months successfully signed into the W10 Solitaire Collection and now do so intermittently.<br />
<br />
The front page loads and I am correctly logged in and I open the &nbsp;Daily Game Competition and then select the game I wish to play. &nbsp;An advertisement then plays after which a black screen appears with a small note at the bottom with a link to avoid adverts.<br />
<br />
Wondered if the fault was a deliberate attempt to pressure me to use a paid for upgrade so clicked on the link (hope it was not malware!) but I am security protected by several programs.<br />
<br />
Tested the pay one month subscription option but this was slow, did not complete and eventually returned to black screen.<br />
</p>
<p>Subscribing to the premium scheme is therefore not the answer<br />
<br />
For me Windows 10 has been a disaster. &nbsp;I was very happy with Windows Live Mail but there were problems accessing Hotmail accounts. &nbsp;I have ended up using a non-Microsoft product as dealing effectively with multiple Hotmail and GMail accounts.<br />
<br />
For some reason my Office Microsoft Office 2007 stopped working after a Windows 10 Upgrade. &nbsp; Rather than spending hours trying to sort Microsoft problems out I have opted for a free office program that for me is providing better service than the Windows products.
 &nbsp;How silly it is that many people cannot read Microsoft Word documents when prepared and saved as current documents</p>

    <title>Unable to open Quicken 2017 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to open Quicken 2017</h2>
                    Last week I was running Quicken 2016 under Windows Vista. I uninstalled Quicken 2106 and installed Quicken 2017. It would not open. Spent somewhere around 6-7 hours with Quicken support and several case numbers. We uninstalled Quicken 2017 and reinstalled
 Quicken 2016 from the download but now it wont open either. Thankfully I have all my data stored on an external drive. Help!!!

<h2>            Xbox 360 and Backwards Compatible won&#39;t sign into Live</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to play a game and the system won't connect to live. I'll start a game up, have to manually sign it (which takes FOREVER to finally do) then it won't connect to Live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've hard reset my console, power cycled my console and router to no avail. Also I've tried to re-download my profile but it checks the network status for ages then then says it can't connect to Xbox Live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm on my Xbox One I'm connected just fine, but if I play a BC game it won't connect and gives me the error code: 8015190B</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is quite frustrating and I would love to find some kind of solution as the ones I've found online haven't been helpful.</p>

            Thank a lot sir for all the help, I can not restore, no create as restore point. &nbsp;I am able to use my computer, only for certain areas. I can not run any of the above suggestions.
<div><br />
<div>I even loaded Microsoft fit it and it found a pile of errors. &nbsp;I ran it any way.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When somewhere, they ask for a code, I have two original Window basic, and then I upgraded. &nbsp;I had flaws with the basic edition, and I guess, some in the 7 edition of Windows.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am going to see if I can get the people to come to my apartment and see what is wrong, as I am not a technical person, in any way shape or form. &nbsp;But thanks, I will try and see is some can work, and will let you know.</div>

            Thanks, I guess my old age, is not working to good. &nbsp;I can not get by the prompt. &nbsp;All I get, a notice on my computer, saying (i.e., to create a restore point, or trying to use an earlier date, to re establish my system to a former state, I have never
 seen an error as listed in the above. &nbsp;I guess, I will have to close this now. &nbsp;I do want to thank all of the people who have tried to get my back on track.

            <p>Hello, Theresa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be best if you started a thread of your own in the Security, Privacy and User Accounts forum found by clicking the link below .... Note the dropdown menus</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/security">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/security</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If dealing with a virus, I suggest you do the following before continuing </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reboot your computer and begin tapping F8 key</p>
<p>Select Safe Mode with Networking</p>
<p>Download the following tool and run a full scan to rule out malware</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=16" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=16</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reboot to Windows when finished</p>
<p>Have you looked in Event Viewer &gt; Application Logs for Errors, Event ID #'s relating to the passkey issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look in your owner's manual for passkey references or go to the manufacturer's site and locate the manual to find the passkey information you need.&nbsp; You might also contact the manufacturer of the hardware for assistance in obtaining the necessary passkey
 information.</p>

<p>
</p><p>About the easiest way to do this after the Windows process was removed would be with a 3rd party utility named WinAeroTweaker.... It's free...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you launch the installer you will have an option to install, or use as "Portable"...</p>
<p>I would advise using Portable...</p>

</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us. We are sorry to hear that your touch cover is not working after the upgrade.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Dose the cover not work at all? Or, keys work but not the touchpad? </p>
<p>Does it work intermittently? </p>

            <p>thanks for the reply. &nbsp;the cover is totally lifeless. it doesnt appear in device manager at all either. it was fine before the upgrade and indeed i used it to run the upgrade...</p>
<p>
</p><p>i found the above and followed them with no result im afraid. &nbsp;there is also a routine about removing it via device manager but i cant as it doesnt ever appear</p>
<p>
</p><p>my plan is to roll back to w8.1 and try again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>its no big deal. i did my s1 pro before my s3 pro for this very reason!</p>

any ideas before i roll back?</p>

            I had the same thing happen on my Surface Pro 1 today, and was able to resolve it by shutting down, enabling all accessibility features and then disabling (the ones available on the log in screen), then manually going into tablet mode (under settings),
 then disconnecting and reconnecting the type cover. I'm not sure which of these steps resolved it, but I think it may have been the tablet mode and disconnect/reconnect keyboard.

            <p>I'll try to outline the steps, but I am thinking some of these are coincidental, but none would hurt. (Hint: use a USB keyboard and mouse to help make these adjustments.) Be sure you are not docked or have any external monitors connected.</p>

<li>shut down</li><li>disconnect the type cover</li><li>boot up</li><li>before logging in, go into the accessibility icon on the login screen. turn all 3 on. use touch for this.</li><li>log in</li><li>go into settings | system | tablet mode</li><li>switch the "make windows more touch-friendly when using your device as a tablet" to a different setting than it has. save the settings</li><li>snap connect your type cover now</li><li>shut down</li><li>boot up</li><li>go into the accessibility icon on the login screen. turn all 3 off. use touch for this.</li><li>log in</li><li>see if type keyboard is still not responding go to step 7.</li><li>hopefully you are enjoying your now-working type cover. I think this the issue is caused by something in the new windows 10 tablet mode detection.</li></ol>
<p>Since I was not able to recreate the problem and re-test these steps, they are from memory and they could probably be refined. Please reply with a follow-up posts if you have success with a variation of the above.</p>

<h2>            Reinstalling Windows 10 After Upgrade and Recovery to Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some years ago I bought a PC with Windows 7 and then took the free upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Due to some issues, I recovered my PC to its original SO (W7) through the Recovery Partition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way in which I can get the free Upgrade to Windows 10 again? If Yes, would you please tell me how?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lautaro.&nbsp;</p>

<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.

<p>
<span><span><span><span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</span></span></span></span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter,
 you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>you already own</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>to

            Hi Frederick
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Windows Updates
<br />
<br />In the list of Pending Updates, do you see that listed?
<br />
<br />If so, you can stop Windows 10 trying to install that update that you clearly don't need . . .
<br />
<br />Download the tool from the link below, run that, in the list of pending updates, select that update and click 'Hide' that will stop windows from attempting to install it: 
<br />

            Hi Frederick
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate the effort you put in to fix the issue and sorry for the inconvenience you are facing.
</span><span>Most of the issues are fixed by installing
<strong>Windows Updates</strong> make sure that your system is up-to-date. Type <strong>
Windows Updates</strong> in search bar and select <strong>Check for updates</strong> from the results. If updates are available, try installing them and check.
</span><span>You might also get this error message when you are trying to install Windows feature that might need .NET framework to work. To troubleshoot this error, I would suggest you to try the steps
 below and check if it's enabled:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press <strong>windows key + R</strong> to open the run command.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type <strong>appwiz.cpl</strong> and press
<strong>enter</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on "<strong>turn windows features on or off</strong>".</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Locate<strong> .netframework</strong> and
<strong>check </strong>it if it's unchecked.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click "<strong>O<span>k</span></strong>" and reboot your computer.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>Check if you are able to install the language pack.

<p>Hi Mary Hester,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have incoming call in Skype for Business, it will ring on your computer or cell phone because you have installed Skype for Business app in computer or cell phone. Skype for Business app will let you know you have an incoming call. For the Polycom
 phone, based on my understanding, it doesn't have a Skype for Business app. So, it won't have a ring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

</p><p>I appreciate your response, but the Polycom phone has settings for Skype for Business (Lync) in the phone and I found online instructions from S4B on how to setup.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have called Polycom and Microsoft.&nbsp; Microsoft says it is a Polycom issue and Polycom says it is a Microsoft issue so were are stuck in an infinite loop between providers.&nbsp;

<p>Since based on your description, the issue just happens to the Polycom phone, thus, the issue should be related to Polycom phone. Regarding this, we are unable to troubleshoot with the&nbsp;Polycom phone. Looking forward to your understanding.</p>

<h2>            Installing Apps from the Store on corporate computer</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to install apps from the Apps Store using a corporate computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We use a <strong>.pac</strong> file to provide the Automatic Configurations settings.
</p>
<p><a href="http://pac.zscaler.net/firmenich.com/proxy.pac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pac.zscaler.net/firmenich.com/proxy.pac</a></p>
<p>The option automatically detect settings is also checked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever I try to install or update apps the Store says Installing at the top right hand corner, clicking shows the app pending. and the Metro tile shows pending.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is as if the access to the store is not using the proxy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My network guys have also been involved and after them running a few netsh commands on my machine, concluded that the Store access seems to be bypassing the proxy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also get the following error</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Something happened and the App couldn't be installed. Please try again. Error code: 0x8024401c"</p>

<h2>            windows 10 pop3 email issues</h2>
                    <p>I have just received a new laptop that has windows 10 preinstalled i am unable to get receive any emails using a pop3 gmail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have tried to set up the account in both outlook and in the messaging app, yet neither of these work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have directly copied over the exact settings from a windows 7 machine that works perfectly. when doing so i don't get any error messages and i does send out an email to the gmail account its associated with that i can see on the windows 7 machine in outlook.
 both the mail app and outlook on the windows 10 laptop refuse to receive any emails from the gmail pop3 server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have scoured through the forums and different web pages finding anything from security settings, privacy settings, settings on the gmail itself (which would mean it wouldn't work on the other machine) and other ideas but no matter what i seem to try neither
 outlook or the email app will populate the inbox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>again just to be clear, i am not receiving any error codes or messages when setting it up in either application. both seem to be correctly configured but simply will not receive any emails into the inbox or any other folders for that matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any ideas on what could be the cause of this?</p>

</p><p>We realize the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your computer installed with any third party Antivirus or Online security software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see you telling that the problem is appearing with both Mail app and Office Outlook. I guess there might be some problem with the Gmail settings causing this behavior. I mean to say, problem with the port or incoming/outgoing server settings. Try to remove
 and reconfigure the account again to see if it makes any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find the root cause, try to setup another email account (I.e. Outlook or Yahoo email account) to see if it works fine. This will give the clue on the root cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case your computer is installed with any Antivirus or Online security software, then ensure that it should not be causing any issues. If possible, try to disable it for a moment to see if everything works fine.</p>

            <p>i have a separate e-mail that i use for personal mail, that also doesn't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>there isn't any third party anti-virus software installed on the new laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>there weren't any updates available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>again this same email works perfectly fine using the windows 7 computer with the exact version of outlook installed on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this tells me that the issues lies within the operating system/setttings somewhere that i have been unable to find or am unable to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have since set it up as imap which does work, however with pop three the option for "change folder" was available letting me send all of the emails to the place i wanted them to be at. trying to this the other way instead populates gmail with folders which
 is in no way ideal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it's working, not the way that i want it to. but it is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you have any further ideas of what might be causing this please let me know.</p>

<h2>            PC Will not connect to certain Wi-Fi Network, but other devices will</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It happened randomly while I was watching a YouTube Video. The stream suddenly stopped, and when I checked the Internet Connections, it said the connection was limited, as it sometimes does. Usually, I just disconnect and reconnect and it
 starts working again. This time, however, when I attempted to reconnect, it said&nbsp; "Can't connect to this network"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found this odd, as this has never happened before. I checked my phone, to see if the modem was down, but my phone was still connected to the Wi-Fi just fine. I decided to restart my computer, as that usually fixes most small issues. Upon
 reboot, it still said that it could not connect to the network. After this, I tried restarting the modem using the internal gateway on my phone. This did not work. I tried unplugging my modem for 5 minutes and plugging it back in, again, to no avail.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, I made my PC forget the network, and tried to re-enter the WEP Key. Still, no luck. I began to think that there was a problem with the internal Wi-Fi card in my machine, so I checked the device manager. It claimed that the device
 was working properly. I opened a Mobile Hotspot with my phone, and tried having my PC Connect to that, and that DID work. Desperate, I tried updating the LAN Card driver software, rolling back the driver software, using Google's DNS Servers, using ipconfig/flushdns
 in command prompt, and tried connecting again every time. Still, no luck. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, other devices still connect properly, and no other device is using the same IP Address. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling my LAN Card, which also did not help. I currently have my PC Connected via USB Tethering on my Android phone,
 which is essentially using my phone as an alternate LAN Card. Again, it appears that the problem is with that specific LAN Card and that specific modem. I am really hoping that this can be solved in the modem settings, or in some exe buried deep within the
 system32 folder. Thank you for any help.</p>

            <p>Hi Isha, and thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fixed the problem a while ago by uninstalling MS Build Tools 2013, but now the problem has returned. I have tried Clean Boot and Safe Mode, but the problem persists. Also, when I open the properties for my Wi-Fi, I don't see a tab for Wireless Networks.
 All I get is Networking and Sharing. My PC is an Acer Aspire TC-105 on Windows 8.1. Thanks for any further assistance.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Based on the issue description I understand that after restarting Windows 8 computer from standby mode few Apps, Desktop Shortcuts and data is missing.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand it must be frustrating, but rest assured, we are here to help you and guide you in the right direction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would really appreciate if you can help me with the following information.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>-Did you make any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Boot the computer in safe mode and check whether the issue persists, if the issue does not persist then perform clean boot and check whether the issue resolves.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed. Please click on the mentioned link below.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If everything works fine in safe mode then some third party services are causing the problems, so to know which service is causing the problem we need to perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2</span></b></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "<b>clean boot</b>." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Follow <b>step 3</b> to reset the computer to start as usual after the clean boot process.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Keep us posted if you face any issues on windows in future. We will be glad to help you.</span></p>

            Hi<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks for the suggestions - unfortunately that has not worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not make any changes to the computer -&nbsp;I was using it in the morning and everything was fine, when I opened it out of standby in the afternoon the problem had&nbsp;occured.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Whilst the apps seem to have come back, all my desk top and start menu links are still missing.&nbsp; More importantly to me all my music and photos are still not visible even though around 40gb of the hard drive has been used (by what I believe to be the music
 and photos).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I have noticed that the recovery drive (D) says it only has 2.5gb remaining of a total 20gb - could my missing data be stored there? if so how can I access it?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Any further suggestions greatly appreciated?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Many thanks

It's reassuring to see the all follow ups to this unresolved issue (not)....I have the same problem. Most of the apps have disappeared from the start screen..."all apps" gives the same result...search function will not detect programs that I know are still
 on my computer...is it possible to go back to windows 7 without losing anything? Windows 8 sucks :-(<br />

<h2>            need to move downloaded games to a second user profile</h2>
                    <p>I have a windows 8 new computer</p>
<p>I created an admin profile and downloaded free games.. Also purchased one game.</p>
<p>Then I set up kids profiles .. went thru all the hoops to protect. When I open the home screens, the kids profiles do not have the games.. purchased or free on their start page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>VERY FRUSTRATED! How do I move the game to their screen? I tried looking at the cloud but seems like no way to grab them. Help</p>

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to have a Microsoft account set up for your Store purchases using that account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of your information for purchased or free apps, credit card and other information&nbsp;is stored on the Store servers. When you log on with that account you will see all of that information including&nbsp;your installed apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you log on to your account in the Store, you will see this information regardless of which user account on the PC you are using. See the following links for the detailed information.</p>

<p><span>Were you in the "My Documents" folder or do you mean the "Documents" folder?&nbsp; If you somehow gained access to the My Documents folder in Vista, that could be the
 cause as it is not supposed to be modified in any way since it is not a real folder but a junctiion point.&nbsp; There's nothing that can be done about that now (unless the system restore works to fix the problem).&nbsp; I do not understand how you deleted the desktop
 items from the Documents folder - I could see if you were messing with the Desktop folder but this I don't understand.&nbsp; Right click on the desktop and click Refresh to see if that helps.&nbsp; Also try rebooting to see if that restores the desktop.&nbsp; Try booting
 into safe mode and see if it has a desktop or if it is missing there as well.</span></p>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong><span>BEFORE</span></strong> the
 problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.&nbsp; This usually doesn't work with documents (and I don't think it will resolve the problem as described), but it's worth a try.</span></p>
<p>Check the Recycle Bin for the desktop items and if they are there restore them and you're back in business.</p>
<p>It sounds like you deleted your desktop items during your cleaning.&nbsp; Go to C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Desktop and see if it has any items in it - if not, they were somehow deleted.&nbsp; Do the same for C:\Users\All&nbsp; Users\Desktop and see if there are any items there.&nbsp;
 If not there, proceed with trying to recover them as follows:</p>
<div>
<p><span>If you have Vista Business, Vista Ultimate, or Vista Enterprise you may be in luck.&nbsp; They have what is known as Shadow
 Copies which are saves of deleted or modified files which can be retrieved in case the changes/deletions were done in error.&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/shadow-copy.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/shadow-copy.aspx</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 further information on how to use this feature at: </span><a href="http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/howdoi/?p=145" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/howdoi/?p=145</span></span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
If you have Vista Basic or Vista Premium, Shadow Copies is not available; however, there's an alternative that's free and mirrors the functionality of Shadow Copies called Shadow Explorer.</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/recover-files-with-shadow-copies-on-any-version-of-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/recover-files-with-shadow-copies-on-any-version-of-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Though it won't help you this time, it could very well save you in case this happens again.<br />
<br />
In case this doesn't work (not all files are available through Shadow Copies - it occurs periodically), here are some additional free recovery programs which might help:<br />

 Recuva ONLY - do not purchase any products that aren’t free – here or in any of the other links – I’m just suggesting the FREE options and have had problems with some of the commercial ones)</span></p>

<p><span>Files aren't actually deleted until they are overwritten (though they're no longer available through conventional methods).&nbsp;
 If you decide to try these recovery programs, you should stop using your hard drive<strong>immediately</strong> so you don't overwrite the data you are trying to recover.&nbsp; Slave it to another PC and run the recovery from that PC.&nbsp; Even now you may have permanently
 lost some of them if you're using that same PC.&nbsp; If you can't do that (slave to another PC), you run the risk of overwriting the data with every action you do on the PC (but you still may be able to recover some or most or even all of the files - it's a matter
 of luck).<br />

Only you can decide if the data is important enough to take the PC to a data recovery expert to recover the files (they will have better programs and equipment to do so than any of us do and than I provided above).&nbsp; Do NOT go to Geek Squad or any of those big
 store centers - they mostly don't know what they're doing - take it to a data recovery expert.&nbsp; It will cost quite a bit and they usually offer no guarantees.&nbsp; The decision is yours.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck and I hope this helps!</span></p>
