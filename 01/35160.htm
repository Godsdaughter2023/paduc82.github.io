<h2>            Epson Photo Print</h2>
                    <p>I have the Fall update of Windows 10 and, like others, the Photo Print module for my Epson Home Expression XP 445 no longer works.&nbsp; I have re-installed from the original Epson disc, updated the print driver and deleted the temporary files as suggested elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a screenshot of the error message that I receive...I have ample memory memory available!</p>

            Hi Vijay...thanks for your reply. Ok, I did completely uninstall and reinstall from the original disc to begin with, when it didn't make any difference I uninstalled completely again and downloaded from the Epson website....but still no difference. Feeling
 at a loss really as to what to try next&nbsp; I suppose the next Windows update might address it????

<h2>            Windows Defender won&#39;t let me to open startup programs</h2>
                    Hello, I have a Vista ultimate on my computer. I use Norton Security. I want to&nbsp;delete some programs&nbsp;in startup. Go to Control panel, clicking on Startup programs- the windows open saying that Windows Defender is turned off... I&nbsp;click on the link&nbsp;to turn
 it on- nothing happens.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I go to Computer- Manage- Windows defender- to turn it on- green line starts loading, then it says "Windows Defender stopped... because it won't needed" or smth. like that. Looks like I've got this problem after I installed Norton.
 There are options to turn off Firewall and Antivirus- if I use them nothing changes.&nbsp;Any suggestions?

            How do you scroll through the photos as on W7 as the arrow keys are no longer functional. I will not load photos on the computer hard drive for obvious reasons and I need to use it like it has always worked on XP, Vista, W7.... &nbsp;I own a ACER F550C. &nbsp;This
 is simply ridiculous. I am one step away from waxing W8 from my hard drive and loading W7 Ultimate and be done with this .......&nbsp;

<p>I'm not sure how you are accessing the photos on the external drive, but you might try this...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right click on your Desktop and select "Personalize" and then "Change Desktop Icons" on the upper left. Here you can select COMPUTER and others that will give you a bit of Win 7 back....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you have COMPUTER on the desktop, just double click it, double click your external drive, and you should be able to view your photos like before...</p>

            Hi, The solution to this problem is to right click the folder in your external hard drive and select "include in library" and then select pictures library. Now you will be able to scroll because the pictures are within your "library" :/

            <p>Have you tried shutting the system down when it gets to that point by using the ON button?&nbsp; A bit risky, but may resolve it.</p>

</p><p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that has windows 7 with the same bitness (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp;
 You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, you are likely into a re-install.&nbsp; Takes a lot of time, but not all attended time.</p>
<ol>
<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp; You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose that.</li><li>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.</li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have a disk, borrow one from a friend.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting here. I understand that you are having issues with Photo Gallery. To further isolate the issue, I would like to ask some questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the issue happen to all of the photos you are trying to edit with "fine tune"?</li><li>What are the file types you are trying to edit?</li><li>How do you exactly upload to Twitter?</li><li>What is the version of your Photo Gallery? To check, press <strong>ALT + F</strong> in Photo Gallery then click
<strong>About Photo Gallery</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>
<p><br />
Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

            Thank you for your reply. I should have known better, Windows updates were holding my PC hostage. After a few hours of installing updates it is okay. Edited photos take &nbsp;only 8 seconds for saving.
<div><br />
<div>I cannot resolve the Twitter issue,however. I would normally just click on the 'plug-in' icon at the top of my photo gallery page and could post many photos at one time to Twitter. Now it says that it is uploading to Twitter ,but then says it failed,'0
 files uploaded'.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The other 'plug-ins' work fine, I can upload directly to Skydrive, a hundred photos in a minute. Or to facebook,or you tube.</div>
<div>&nbsp;I cannot upload directly to Flickr,although I have an icon for the 'plug-in' at the top of the page. Flickr uploads I must make from the Flickr page.</div>

            Thank You, Sometimes just asking you seems to provide good luck, the Flickr finally worked, it asked for and authorization, I said yes, and it gave me an authorization code ,and it works. I'd been hoping to use Flickr more often since they increase storage
 to a TB. I use Skydrive mostly &nbsp;for my website.

            Hello, I’m Virginia an independent advisor here.
<br />If your Bluetooth is disabled then do the following to enable it.
<br />Uninstall the device from device manager and restart bluetooth service. 
<br />Start &gt; services.msc 
<br />Right-click "Bluetooth Support Service."
<br />Choose Automatic.
<br />Go to device manager and&nbsp; right-click on your computer name and click "Scan for hardware changes"
<br />Install the bluetooth device drivers from the manufacturer's website, if any.

<h3> st4vros84  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX One S &#38;amp&#59; 4K PC Monitor - no no</h2>
                    
<p>So I eagerly unpacked my shiny new xbox one s and 4K PC monitor only to be disappointed to discover that they currently wont work together!</p>
<p>After a bit of back and forth with a support representative he conceded that currently xbox one s only supports 4K TV's!</p>
<p>My monitor: 
AOC U2879VF meets the required specifications namely, HDMI 2.0, 3840x2160 @ 60hz and works fine with other 4K devices (PC GTX 980), Samsung UHD bluray player.</p>
<p>All I am met with after a few seconds of a black screen when trying to enable 4K using the monitor is a message saying my TV does not support 4K which I know is a load of rubbish!. I have used both the supplied HDMI cable that came with the XBOX One S and
 also the one supplied with the 4K monitor...</p>
<p>Any idea if we'll be getting an update to fix this and if so when?</p>

<p>The HDMI handshaking surrounding 4K is still a bit iffy in places. Some 4K TV's had issues until their manufacturer's released firmware updates to the TV to correct the problem.</p>
<p>Unfortunately firmware updates to PC displays are very rare and sometimes not at all possible, only the factory can update it.</p>
<p>You should contact AOC and see what they say, they're probably going to point the finger at MS but that is not necessarily the source of the problem. Microsoft may or may not get around to fixing it, unless you can get a response from someone &amp; they raise
 the issue with xbox team.</p>
<p>Temporary Workarounds</p>
<p>1) Get a HDMI 2.0 switch for hanging more than one device off a single port, this will sit between the display and xbox acting a go-between for HDMI handshaking and may resolve the problem (xbox sees switch and monitor sees switch but not each other).</p>
<p>2) Get a HDMI 2.0 to DisplayPort 1.2 adapter, again same principle</p>

<p>Thanks but isn't that for connecting a DP device to a HDMI 2.0 input on the monitor? my monitor already has HDMI 2.0 input which I have connected to the output on the XOS. Not sure how this adapter would help as it's for converting DP (which obviously the
 XOS doesn't have) to HDMI 2.0.</p>
<p>Incidentally the monitor also has a DP 1.2 input which works @ 4k 60hz &nbsp;when connected to the DP output on my graphics card. I understand what you are saying about the switch (so the XOS sees the switch first rather than the monitor) that to me however would
 suggest the problem is the with the XOS rather than the monitor, given that I know the monitor works fine with other 4K capable output devices. The more I look around the more I see reports of problems with the XOS and peoples 4K displays, the common denominator
 appears to be the XOS.</p>

<p>Linked to the wrong adapter, I meant an adapter that will turn your HDMI 2.0 output into DisplayPort which supports 4K. It's really just another alternative to the switch, go with whatever port you have free.</p>
<p>Yeah some of the problems are on the Xbox side for sure but in most cases those will be resolved as almost all TV's these days have built in internet access with firmware updates so the supplier can correct the issue or MS can correct it on their end whoever
 gets their first so to speak.</p>
<p>PC displays do not have this luxury so you are dependant upon Microsoft being aware of the issue and fixing it. Raising Microsofts attention on this is tricky, personally I think you'd stand a better chance of getting AOC's attention given they are less
 likely to have the constant support issues MS faces every day then if you're lucky AOC talks to MS sending them the right info about the display (don't expect anything overnight, weeks at best).</p>
<p>The other option is you manage to get someone at Xbox support team to go buy your very display, tests it with an Xbox to see were it's going wrong then fixes it in a firmware update down the road.</p>
<p>Lastly you might want to try the Xbox preview program, it's possible the issue is fixed in beta builds of the Xbox OS but this means running an unstable build of the OS until the next official release.</p>
<p>That's really all you can do, the switch might get up and running at least until a proper fix is in place (which may never come, I've seen HDMI handshaking issues with AppleTV &amp; FireTV's that were never fixed)</p>

But, if you think it's&nbsp;confusing in the land of Xbox, it's far worst for PlayStation.&nbsp;Sony is still having issues getting the PS4s to work with their&nbsp;own 4K TVs. The key&nbsp;phase and specification&nbsp;to look for is <strong>HDR10</strong>, see "Troubleshooting 4K and HDR on Xbox One S" at support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/troubleshooting-4K-and-HDR-on-xbox-one-s . I did some checking and I regret to say I did not see anything about <strong>HDR10</strong> listed in the specifications for U2879VF at the AOC Web site.&nbsp;It's not only about hardware compatibility and resolution, it's also about&nbsp;copyrights and DRM.</p><p><br /></p><p>I know, it's a bummer...</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>The simple thing to do is do not buy any 4K computer/PC display, they have not been properly tested against game consoles. HDR10 is not supported by Windows OS yet, it will be sometime next year and there are one or two PC display makers jumping on the HDR bandwagon but again avoid these.
</p><p>It will probably take another year or so for PC display makers to properly test against game consoles and get their act together, if you feel like risking it I suggest sticking to Samsung or LG PC monitors as they may at least share some development with their TV lines and in turn may be tested with Xbox 4K. </p>

<h2>            How to get Windows 7 Pro to install a usb jump drive.</h2>
                    
<p>I have Windows 7 pro installed on two machines, a laptop and a desktop.&nbsp; The sandisk cruzer jump drive installed and is readable without a problem on the laptop, but on the desktop it only installs the U3 drive, but not the data drive.&nbsp; Is there a security
 setting that is preventing its installation?&nbsp; If so, what is it?</p>

            Hi BarryDorsey,
<br />
<br />I understand that this is a new computer, however I think it would be beneficial to perform a few system repairs to see if this will resolve your issue. You can do this by following the below steps:
<br />- Open Command Prompt (search for it within the Windows start menu &gt; right-click &gt; run as administrator)
<br />- Enter: sfc /scannow
<br />- Once the scan finishes, enter: dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />- Once the scan finishes, reboot
<br />- Once logged back in, see if you can use File Explorer as per normal
<br />
<br />Please let me know how this goes.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan       
        </p>

<h2>            Tips on beating a 4-star expert daily challenge</h2>
                    
<p>Been wanting to post this since end of last month. Just got myself to do it today. It seems the Facebook page is terribly deserted (last activity was several&nbsp;months ago) so I&nbsp;think&nbsp;its best to share my&nbsp;thoughts here.</p>
<p>Last month on Feb 23 there was a 4-star mix &amp; match&nbsp;challenge. I had tried more than&nbsp;200-300 times to beat it, but constantly ended on disappointment. Most&nbsp;of the time when I&nbsp;reached the last (13th) level there was 10&nbsp;seconds or so left so it's just impossible
 to clear it. I was about to give up (as I believed 95% of other players had already long ago).</p>
<p>Then came Feb 28 evening.&nbsp;All other 83 out of 84 challenges of the month had been cleared with ease, just this tough nut left. With about 30 mins to midnight, thought I'd give it one last try. So placed my multi-touch tablet on a high bench, and stretched
 my shoulder muscles (as I knew they would be sore afterwards).</p>
<p>Then it's 25 mins of intensive shoulder/arm/elbow/wrist/finger movements. Incredibly, during the who-knows-how-many-th game (depending on progress I could restart the game after anytime from&nbsp;10 seconds to 3 minutes),
 finally I was smelling success. Most of the levels were cleared without much trouble, including the dreaded 9th.</p>
<p>But I knew it didn't mean much. The most critical was always the final one. Even if you play so well to go into it with 20-25 seconds on the clock, if you allow your mind to lapse and screw it up, then all will be in vain (as it has happened multiple times
 before).</p>
<p>Finally&nbsp;reached the final level. I was so focused I didn't even had time to glimpse the clock, but must had over 20 seconds left. Fingers were tapping like crazy, but still missing a touch here or there. Then came the dreaded 10-second&nbsp;countdown with more
 than half of the board left. Hearts pounding towards the throat (I always wonder has any player suffered from heart attack playing this stupid game?), but the finish line was in sight. Finally, with a hectic series of lightning quick taps, all clear! The clock
 showed 2 seconds left. At least it wasn't 1 or 0 second, both of which I had done before.</p>
<p>So this was how I beat the (almost) unbeatable challenge, which I think only 5% or less of all players could do (and&nbsp;curse the developer for only allowing us 6 whole days to tackle it!). I will share some tips and thoughts in the replies below!</p>

<p>The following tips are generally about the Feb 23 4-star mix &amp; match challenge (which will be recycled in a couple month's time). I can't say it's THE toughest one out of the whole "bank" of daily challenges (there're also a few 3/4-star tap tower challenges
 that's extremely diabolic, plus some other evil mix &amp; match challenges requiring us to solve 14+ levels in 3-4 mins). But I have to say if one can beat this one even once, one should be confident in beating 99.9% of any challenge with a few tries at most.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are my tips for this challenge to solve 13 levels in 3:30, should it ever appear again:</p>
<p>1. TRACK YOUR PROGRESS: which is the most important key point. This game is utmost unforgiving, in that if you fall behind, there is very tiny chance to catch up. Simple division gives you an average of 16 seconds for each level. But you know some of them
 take way longer (e.g. the huge 9th with 100+ tiles stack up), especially the ones at the end, so you need to kill off the easy levels in much shorter time, sometimes as few as 10 seconds.</p>
<p>For this particular game, you need to clear the first 3 levels no later than the 2:50 mark (i.e. 40 seconds), the next 5 levels by the 1:40 (i.e. 70 seconds), leaving you 100 seconds to deal with the last 5 levels. If at any time you see you're behind, don't
 bother to continue, just hit the bottom right corner icon and reset the game. Often when it shuffles 3 times in the same level, you know it's time to reset.</p>
<p>This is a physical challenge, and you need to conserve your time, muscle, and most importantly, nerve. Can't afford wasting these on lost causes. Remember, it takes just one success to beat the game, and there's absolutely no shame in quitting early on certain
 fails.</p>

<p>2. TAP IT THE FAST WAY: I know some people play this game using mice &amp; keyboard. That's usually good enough for other modes and challenges, but not this one (well perhaps a hardcore online gamer with years of mouse-pointing skills can pull it off, but certainly
 not the average player).</p>
<p>Do it with a multi-touch (e.g. 10-point) touchscreen device. AND USE BOTH HANDS. That way you can kill a pair of matching tiles in one tap. I suppose one can do it with 2 fingers in one hand but personally I find it most comfortable using 2 middle fingers.
 Of course, the ideal way is to use 4 or even 6 fingers to kill off 2/3 pairs with a single tap, but it's probably only possible at the end stage of each level, certainly not at the very start.</p>
<p>Also, placement of your device and stature are important. Personally I use a 10" tablet, so I don't know what it's like to use say, a touchscreen monitor to do this, but I think it would be quite comfortable to play, especially if you adjust your sitting
 distance for your arm lengths.</p>
<p>Anyway, as previously mentioned I place my tablet on a high bench about 15 degrees inclined towards myself, at a height where my elbows are folding at right angles (sort of like a praying mantis). I personally find this the most comfortable stature to give
 me endurance for long intensive tapping.</p>
<p>Of course, everyone has different preferences. Just find your most comfortable configuration and tap away!</p>

<p>3. FINISH FAST: near the end of each level, you typically have 4-5 distinct pairs left in easy-to-see locations. In the relaxation mode or other easier challenges this is probably time to sit back, relax and coast. BUT NOT HERE. Either kill them in 1-2 taps
 using multiple fingers, or do it pair by pair in extremely quick succession. We are talking a period of 1-2 seconds here, tops. Trust me, you'll notice the general improvement in your speed if you can grow the habit of killing the last 5 pairs or so in each
 level within 2 seconds consistently.</p>
<p>4. START FAST: during the start of a level, often we will spend a few seconds inspecting the layout, picking the best pairs to kill (e.g. those involving edges of long rows). BUT NOT HERE. Especially the ones with lots of tiles. Just kill off any pair you
 can spot at a glance, even those single tiles at the corner (in other modes we'd reserve them till later stages). That's because the system will shuffle for you constantly, even if you're stuck for 2 seconds. So there's no point to keep the layout "nice &amp;
 clean". Anyway if you kill off enough pairs at the start the board will be cleaned up very quickly. And this also applies to the time right after a shuffle.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>5. NO ROTATION: well this may be debatable, but I personally don't find any justification to rotate the board in this mode, again because the system will shuffle the board if you don't kill a pair in 2 seconds. Say you're stuck from the current angle. So
 if you rotate, perhaps you will find a pair immediately and continue your chain. But often you'll need a second or two to spot a pair, and the system might just shuffle before you kill them, rendering the whole action a waste. And usually you're stuck from
 the current angle because your layout is messy, in which case a shuffle is often a better fix from that situation.</p>
<p>Saying that, there is actually an exceptional situation where you HAVE to rotate the board: if you're left with 2 tiles, and they are perfectly overlapping one another from the current angle. But I don't think this happens very often, and even if the overlapping
 is slightly off one can usually kill them easily by tapping at the correct corner of tiles.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>6. SOMETIMES GENOCIDE IS GOOD: if possible, always try to kill multiple pairs of the same tile as much as possible. Once a type of tiles is completely extinct, it cannot confuse you anymore. And a board with fewer types of tiles is always much easier to
 solve than a board with a lot of different tiles!</p>
<p>7. LEARN THE TILES: perhaps this point is more important for challenges like tap tower. Often you see free tiles hiding behind other tiles, just showing a small corner. If you know your tiles you can often determine its value just from this corner, and kill
 them quickly.</p>
<p>Also, some types of tiles are very confusing by nature, like the pink squares &amp; diamonds, the series of blue patterns, etc. Knowing the tiles well can help you avoid mixing them up. In this game, taping a wrong pair will result in immediate shuffling, which
 in certain situations might make you want to pull out all your hair!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>8. KEEP YOUR NERVE: well this is easier said than done. Like I said in tip #1 if you feel the current game is too hopeless (e.g. multiple shuffles in quick succession, stuck for 5-10 seconds after a certain shuffle), don't hesitate to reset.</p>
<p>However, time and time again you will find yourself in the middle of a good run and have cleared the first 9-10 levels in a 200+ long combo chain. It's important to keep a level head and avoid spotting too long for the next pair to keep the chain going,
 or hastily tapping a pair of similar but unmatched tiles.</p>
<p>You don't need a 400 long chain to beat the game (would be cool to achieve this though). Even if the system shuffles and breaks the chain, don't get too dejected because you're still in a great position. Just quickly kill a few pairs to get out of the current
 level and start another long chain!</p>
<p>Similarly, once you reach the last level with around 20 seconds left you'll feel the huge pressure to not choke it away. But the last level is not something you can kill off in 10 seconds. You need to be patient and peel pairs off one by one. In a sense
 this is like holding the ball at the end of a basketball game when your team is down by 1. Being "clutch" is definitely not throwing the first shot available, but to patiently create opportunities within the allowed time frame so as to have the best shot for
 a buzzer beating game winner!</p>
<p>And finally, there's the annoying &amp; distracting 10-second countdown, which can throw you off at the very last. Well if you can't train your nerve to deal with it effectively, one way to do it is to mute your system or wear a headphone to block it out! Needless
 to say it is probably unwise to watch the clock during the final level, as it can cause you unnecessary stress and distraction. Just focus on beating the game or let the system surprise you by announcing "time up"!</p>
<p>So here are the 8 tips I can think of for now. And hopefully they can also be applicable to other very touch mix &amp; match challenges. Some are even helpful for the harder tap tower challenges. If there are other serious and keen Taptiles players reading this,
 you are welcome to share your tips and thoughts about the game here too! :-)</p>

<p>1. No, now using only Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I do not show Adobe Flash Player installed right now. Does not show up in listing of installed programs. Should it be installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3, Yes, KB4038788 is failing to install now. KB4034674 is now not showing up as an update to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Added comment. I cannot find how to turn off auto update for Windows 10 updates and it keeps trying to run an failing over and over again when I have the computer turned&nbsp; on. How do you do this while I am trying to resolve this issue?</p>

<p>John, I asked when you <em>uninstalled</em> the Trend Micro application? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Had your Trend Micro&nbsp;subscription, if any, <em>already expired</em> by the time you uninstalled it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: "Mar 17" tells me nothing - e.g., what happened on "Mar 17?" does "Mar 17" mean March of 2017, 17 March 2015 or...?</p>

<p>In answer to your question, I am not sure exactly when Trend Micro was uninstalled but it had not expired. I am pretty sure it was in early&nbsp; March 2017 (not sure of exact date). I had installed Windows 10 and was having a lot problems following the installation
 of Windows 10. My HP laptop was extremely slow and almost unusable. With my son's help, we decided to do a clean install of Windows 10 after reformatting my hard disk, saving all my files and taking off all my software I was using. Trend Micro was one item
 and it was never reinstalled to the best of our memory. It is definitely not installed now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, it appears I had installed adobe flash player previously, probably as a plugin and there had been a couple of security updates done by Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps explain more of what was going on back in March 2017.</p>

            <p>It may be old fashion, but manually uninstalling and installing graphics drivers is still the most reliable method, imo.</p>
<p>You will need to prevent Windows Updates from installing or reinstalling graphics drivers though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Download your driver of choice from Nvidia:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
NVIDIA Driver Downloads - Advanced Search</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>- The method below will help prevent Windows doing driver updates .</p>
<p><span>R/click on the <em>Start</em> button and select <em>Control Panel</em>. </span>
</p>
<p><span>Select <em>System</em> &gt; <em>Advanced system settings</em>. </span></p>
<p><span>Click the <em>Hardware</em> tab &gt; <em>Device Installation Settings</em>.
</span></p>
<span>Select the “<em>No, let me choose what to do</em>" option.</span>
<p>- This may be all that is required, but to be safe also use the Show/Hide tool below (These two options</p>
<p>should not need to be done again when you update drivers in future).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- After you uninstall the current graphics drivers via <em>Programs and Features</em>, and before you reboot after
</p>
<p>uninstalling the Nvidia graphics drivers,&nbsp; run the <em>'Show/Hide' </em>tool from the article below to prevent
</p>
<p>Windows Updates from reinstalling it's driver of choice during the post uninstall reboot.</p>

</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to temporarily prevent a Windows or driver update from reinstalling in Windows 10</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>( Display Driver Uninstaller is&nbsp; a popular alternative for uninstalling graphics drivers, and useful if a driver
</p>
<p>install has become corrupt as DDU does a more thorough job of removing files than Programs and Features.</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Install the driver you downloaded. When installing the Nvidia drivers select the 'custom' option and</p>
<p>only select the components you use for installation. The minimum install would be the driver and PhysX.</p>
<p>Reboot....</p>

<h2>            Recent updates crippled 8.1 with MCE</h2>
                    <p>Last time I shut down the Media Centre sometime last week it asked if I wanted to install updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've come to use it for the first time again today and the MCE button on the remote didn't open media centre. I've got the keyboard out and the whole PC is crippled. The only way to access the tiles screen is via the Remote Desktop app on my phone. From
 there I can open MCE, but it's unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back to the desktop, using the keyboard, the right-side menu popped out once - I clicked Search (to find System Restore) and nothing happed. The menu doesn't appear anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CPU is running at 7%, Memory 28%, C: 0%</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got into the Recovery Control Panel using recent places from the Start menu (that was a one-shot attempt too) but System Restore won't start/load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing works. I don't know what to try...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can't even turn it off cos neither the Start menu nor right-hand side bar work.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is the biggest f**k up I've seen since using Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When MCE eventually does load, my movie library appeared as a black and white screen of floating menu tiles. It looks like an analogue TV that isn't tuned in properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm not going to try and download new graphics drivers, I'm just going to roll-back as far as I can in System Restore, disconnect from the internet, and hope M$ manage to fix this almighty error at some point in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those with broken laptops/PCs, you have my sympathy. Just be aware Android is no more reliable when it comes to updates. We're all at the mercy of a deadly update whenever the Beta testers just can't be ****.</p>

<p>You will not get a free gamertag change.</p>
<p>You get one free change from a generated tag to a personal one within 30 days of starting your account or,like in your case,if your tag violates the CoC it is changed to a generated tag for free.</p>

<h2>            Nat type&#58; moderate &#91;Fritz&#33;Box 7490&#93;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>

<p>I have a Fritz!Box 7490 modem but my nat type wont go to open it stays at moderate. I tried: UPNP, DMZ (Exposed Host), port forwarding. I turned the Teredo filter off. I can maybe get for 1 day a nat type open but after that it's on moderate again. I'm out
 of ideas and i already called my ISP they said it is a known problem but they don't have a fix for it :/ I hope someone can help me with this issue.&nbsp;</p>
