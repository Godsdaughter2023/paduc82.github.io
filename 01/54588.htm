<h2>            Pop-up window in bottom-right corner</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I keep getting this pop-up window coming up when I use any software. When it first appeared, I think it said that something wasn't able to run properly, but now it just says "Navigation to the webpage was canceled." &nbsp;</div>

            <p>That's malware (malicious software designed to force advertisements into your computer).&nbsp; It's like a virus, just differently motivated.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you don't have a virus/malware/spyware scanner, or yours is outdated, I recommend going here and installing this one from Microsoft.&nbsp; It's free and always will be:</p>

<h2>            System freeze randomly after installing Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: windows 8 freezes randomly</p>
<p><br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
</p>
<div>I just bought windows 8 Pro. It worked fine for few days then started to freeze randomly.<br />
Sometimes after 10 min from start-up or 30 min.<br />
I tried the following command:</div>
<div><span>bcdedit /set disabledynamictick yes</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>It now freezes less frequently.</span></div>
<div><span>But, Is there a way to solve this problem once and for all?</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Thanks,</span></div>
<div><span>Ahmed</span></div>

            <p><span>Hi Ahmed Elshaer,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and thanks for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
As per the description provided, it looks like your system is getting freeze randomly.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It would be grateful if you can reply to this question in order to assist you further.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
1. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?<br />
2. Is it happening while accessing any particular application or program?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Run the System Maintenance troubleshooter and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + W’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) Type troubleshooter in the search box and then press enter.<br />
c) Select Troubleshooting. Click on view all and select System Maintenance.<br />
d) Click next and follow the on-screen instructions.<br />
<br />
Note: I would suggest you to disconnect all the external devices other than mouse and keyboard and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span>Method 2:
</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><u><span><br />
Clean Boot</span></u><span> will check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Step 1: </span></p>
<p><span>A) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.<br />
d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.<br />
e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.<br />
f) On the ‘Startup’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.<br />
g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.<br />
d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></p>
<p><span><br />
After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Step 7: </span></p>
<p><span><br />
Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>A) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>Try to update all the drivers and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a) Press Windows Key +R, type devmgmt.msc to open the Device Manager.<br />
b) Expand the Drivers, click on the driver.<br />
c) Click on Properties, click on Driver tab. <br />
d) Click on Update Driver.<br />
e) Restart the system.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
NOTE: I would recommend you to check the System Event Logs for Bad Block errors.</span></p>

            Thanks a lot Vijin for the fast detailed response!<br />
<br />
I tried the first solution and re-enabled the dynamictick (since it didn't help a lot earlier).<br />
The computer didn't freeze till now. So, I will be evaluating it before confirming the solution.

            Hi Vijin,<br />
<br />
during the past two days, I tried the first and the third solution but they didn't work.<br />
So, I tried the second.<br />
It is really painful since i had to restart several times and specially that the computer works for random time before freezing (10 min to 2 hours).<br />
<br />
When i disable all the services, the computer works fine.<br />
but i can't know which service is causing the issue :( since the computer always&nbsp;freezes&nbsp;whenever any service is enabled.<br />
<br />
So, Is there a utility or a program that can help at this situation?<br />
<br />
I really appreciate your help.
<div>Thanks a lot,<br />
Ahmed</div>

            One more thing.<br />
I forgot to mention that i didn't make a clean install. It was an upgrade from windows 7 ultimate.
<div>Also, I forgot to answer your questions above.<br />
<p>1. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>nop, it appeared shortly after upgrading<br />
2. Is it happening while accessing any particular application or program?</p>
<p>It happens when using my usual apps (chrome + firefox + windows mail and recently the store)<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your help,<br />
Ahmed</p>

            <p>I am experiencing random freezes as well. In my case everything freezes except the mouse. I can move it around and click on things but nothing happens. I see freezes randomly from 15-180 minutes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I tried running bcdedit /set disabledynamictick yes as recommended by <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_cp-performance/google-chrome-causes-my-computer-to-hang-up-and/a0903d3e-b2e3-4286-95e6-8d6f16631c1d">

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried backing out services and rebooting, doesn't help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lenovo x220 tablet</p>
<p>Intel HD3000 video</p>
<p>8 GB ram</p>
<p>512 SSD</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm getting close to reverting back to Win 7 as well. It's happening to a LOT of people if you do a Bing or Google search.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Update: I finally figured out the issue causing my freezing issues. It was the SSD drive. It seems that Win 8 has issues with SSD drives. I was able to switch back to Win&nbsp;7 and everything ran fine. I then wiped the disk and did another install of Win 8...problems
 RETURNED!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Saw in some other posts that people had random issues with hard drives, so I bought a brand new OCZ Vertex 4 series SSD and did another install. Problems gone!&nbsp; It's a bit upsetting though as I had just bought the original Crucial M4 hard drive about 1 year
 ago (a 512MB that cause me over $700 bucks at the time. I also wasted about 4 days of trying to resolve the problem. The new one is still about $600 bucks, but, after having used SSD I won't go back to regular drive. The performance is worth the money for
 me, and for what I do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At least I was able to re-purpose the old SSD drive. I put it in my MB Pro and it's now a screamer too!</p>

            Hi I was using windows 7 on my laptop then upgraded when windows 8 was in evaluation. After the upgrade I noticed it was freezing randomly 1-3 hours. I sent the laptop off for repair and it was downgraded back to windows 7 (new hard drive).
<div><br />
<div>Now that a lot of time has passed I decided to upgrade again from win 7 to 8. I expected the small or in the case big bugs to be fixed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now my laptop freezes almost every 3 or 4 hours. I am currently trying everything and analysing drivers etc. I have noticed acer have just released a 'before you upgrade' pack. Which is now no use to me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will keep trying anyway.</div>

<h2>            &#34;Fix on the web&#34; when logging in to account</h2>
                    When both of my children are trying to log on to their accounts on the Xbox 1, which we have had for just two days, we are getting the error message "Fix on the web". It was working perfectly well earlier today. I can log on to my account perfectly normally,
 and Xbox live seems to be working okay, so I know that's not the problem. I have tried hard rebooting the console, with no effect.

<p>Hi Brad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens when they try go into their account from the account selection screen on the Xbox. There is a secondary screen which comes up with an error code, which is 0x8000ffff.</p>

<p>Hey there Andrew!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you guys are experiencing this issue. </p>
<p>We do have some steps provided from our <a href="https://support.xbox.com/error-code-lookup?code=0x8000ffff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Error &amp; Status Code Search </a>for that error.</p>
<p>I would review and try the steps&nbsp;there if you have not done so already. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not resolve the issue, I would then make sure that your Network connection tests alright and then try a soft reset of the console.
<span>
<span>It's a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Just
 make sure that before you go ahead with it, that you do know all of the sign-in information for any/all of your accounts</span></span><span><span>(<strong>as</strong></span></span><span><span><strong>they

<p>These so-called "Microsoft" Tech Companies either want to sell you worthless software, or gain Remote Access to your Computer to try and&nbsp;steal your Banking and Credit Card details and to also carry out an Indentity Theft on you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If you had given them Remote Access</strong> and if&nbsp;you do Internet Banking, contact your Bank, explain it to them and change Passwords.</p>
<p>If you use your Credit Card online, cancel it and get a new one issued to you.</p>
<p>And the only way that you willl know that you are free of them is to save your Data and do a clean install of your Operating System.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Microsoft does not contact you, unless YOU have made prior arrangements with them to do so.</p>
<p>There is a section in the link I&nbsp;am supplying you&nbsp;about this at the end of it</p>

    <title>Auto-pairing bluetooth headset without pin - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gigiipse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Auto-pairing bluetooth headset without pin</h2>
                    <p>I have a Gembird BHP-002 Bluetooth headset. I was able to install it and make it work on my Windows 7 laptop. The problem is that every time I disconnect it&nbsp;from the laptop (restart, shut down or&nbsp;I turn the headset off) I need to uninstall it and reinstall
 the drivers in order to enable it back on (windows finds the necessary drivers automatically).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The headset automatically&nbsp;tries to connect to the last device it was connected: if I use it on the phone when I turn it on it will look for the phone and connect to it, same for the laptops. When it tries to connect to the laptop I get a message telling
 me that a device is trying to connect to it but when I try to accept it, it asks me for a pin, which I don't have as the headset doesn't have/require one,&nbsp;not can I&nbsp;enter a it, so I have to go to Bluetooth devices, remove the device and use the wizard to add
 it back. Every single time I want to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it has any importance I use the headset on the following devices (the problem is with both laptops):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell Vostro 1500 laptop with Dell Wireless 355 Bluetooth Module (Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR).</p>
<p>Dell Latitude E5420 laptop with Dell Wireless 375 Bluetooth Module.</p>
<p>Nokia Lumia 800&nbsp;mobile phone</p>
<p>Nokia Lumia 625 mobile phone</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible for windows to somehow&nbsp;remember the device and not need to add manually after each time it disconnects?</p>

            <p>Hi and thanks for the answer but I don't think you understood my problem, perhaps I didn't explained it clear enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to pair it to all laptops/phones at once, it is impossible to do that. I want to use it on a single device at one time. I listed the devices in order to show you that the problem exists on two differentb laptops and that the feature I want to
 use is supported by the headset as is able to connect to the mobile devices ok. Also I stated that the device works using the wizard (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/connect-to-bluetooth-and-other-wireless-or-network-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/connect-to-bluetooth-and-other-wireless-or-network-devices)</span></a>
 but I have to go to Bluetooth Devices and remove from them and then add it back using the wizard every time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to go through the wizard every time I turn my headphones off and on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here is an example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I'm using the headset listening to music on my laptop.</p>
<p>2. It's late and I turn the computer off to sleep.</p>
<p>3 Next day I turn the computer on and I want to watch a movie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to get the headset to work I must remove the headset from "Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Devices and Printers" and then I must "add device" and wait for windows to search online for drivers (which it should have as the headset worked on this
 same machine the last day).</p>
<p><br />

<h2>            Marvel Vs Capcom Origins Demo needs unlocked</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I actually writing this post to ask for help with the game Marvel Vs Capcom Origins. I know its one of the games that have been discontinued from xbox arcade but right now all i have is the demo version on my hard drive. I love this
 game very much and back when it was on sale, i wasn't exactly in a position to purchase it as my system had failed and needed parts replaced. Almost a year later, I finally get the console back after a costly repair job, only to find out that this game is
 no longer on the marketplace. I understand the situation with the game itself as I read all about it, but i REALLY love this game and its never going to be sold again in this format. Probably ever. I have the demo currently on my hard drive and it just needs
 to be unlocked. I'm more that willing to pay the full price of the game if necessary. I want to keep this classic with me as long as possible because the way it was presented and the features it offered were unique. If anyone can help me with this problem,
 plz contact me on the number on file for the COGzero gamertag. Any help on this matter would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long time fan,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alex Torres</p>

<h2>            Will reinstalling windows 10 delete data in other drives&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I have a question that is rather simple. Here's the situation: I want to reinstall windows on my computer because I feel like windows are being buggy lately on my pc. It works great on my laptop but my pc has software issues. The best thing we can do
 is reinstall windows on the troubleshooting page. I have two other drives on my computer I want to use for backup and I'd like to know if those drives will be wiped if I reinstall windows?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have 3 hard drives and 1 of them will get windows. Will the other 2 stay unaffected? (I want them to stay with their data)<br />
I don't mind losing the files on the hard drive I want windows to be running off of since I hope to back up the important things to the other drives.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Jorti
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If you are doing a manual reinstall, you can specifically choose the drive or you can reset and just the local drive where Windows 10 is affected.
<br />
<br />Here are the steps how to do a Reset:

    <title>Direct X Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hollyw94  say:</h3>
<h2>            Direct X Issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently treated myself to a new low-end gaming laptop in the form of a Dell G3, but I'm having major issues running several games. I discovered this first while downloading and attempting to run Skyrim Special Edition on the new laptop, and it gave me
 the error "The code execution cannot proceed because X3DAudio1_7.dll was not found." I had similar notifications pop up with XINPUT1_3.dll and d3dxd9_42.dll. As many forums suggest, I try running the DXSETUP.exe in the Direct X files, but it returns with "An
 internal system error occurred. Please refer to DXError.log and DirectX.log" I downloaded the DirectX Runtime June 2010 and restarted the PC, but to no avail either. I tried running it as an admin and disabling my anti-virus too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My dxdiag says I'm running Direct X 12 and that there are no issues, and my drivers are up to date. I've also tried the sfc/scannow command and found no problems. I tried copying the missing .dll files from my old laptop, but that didn't work. According
 to <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/directx-issues/017a1caf-12e7-409b-b6c8-2ffe8d213e18">
this thread</a>&nbsp;it might be an issue with Windows 10 version 1803, but I have no previous version of Windows to restore to!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

<p>- You do <em>not</em> need the <em>DirectX SDK </em>to run games. This is a developers tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- There is no issue with Win10 1803 and Skyrim. A lot of people who are trying to run Win10 on older graphics hardware may be</p>
<p>having more issues with games with 1803, but recent machines would only have a problem with 1803 if the update corrupts Windows
</p>
<p>during the update process.</p>
<p>- Have you run Steam's <em>Verify Integrity of Game Files</em> tool on Skyrim ?</p>
<p>- Your DELL G3 model version has an Nvidia GTX1050 graphics card ?</p>
<p>Have you downloaded and install the most recent graphics and audio drivers for your machine from DELL (as suggested above) ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- When you ran the DX Redist installer where did you unpack the files to before running the DXSETUP.exe ?</p>
<p>( btw -<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> Don't bother with DX 9.0c.</span>&nbsp; The DirectX Redist (June 2010) has all the same files as does DX 9.0c,
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">'new' files</span> not&nbsp; found in 9.0c... The files that are named in your errors. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- If you are having a problem reinstalling DX it may have something to do with files that were not deleted after a prior reinstall</p>
<p>attempt or&nbsp; the copies you used from the other machine ?</p>
<p>Rather than trying to reinstall DX again, try renaming the files shown in the errors, and any others you copied from the
</p>
<p>other laptop, from both <em>System32</em> and <em>sysWOW64</em>&nbsp; and run the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em>DirectX Web Installer. </em></span></p>
<p>This should replace the now 'missing' files with new ones. It will also install any other missing DX files.</p>
<p>After you verify these files have been reinstalled you can delete the files you renamed.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've verified my Steam files, and all is well there. Nvidia is up to date as well. I did have some issues updating my Intel UHD Graphics 630 Driver via a glitch in Dell's SupportAssist, but I believe I've solved that problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially I tried to run the DXSETUP.exe from Steam's files, but that failed. I also tried downloading it and installing it from the Microsoft website you linked to into a desktop folder, which also failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Digging into the system files, I find that the System32 and the SysWOW64 findings don't match? I can find&nbsp;<span>all three "missing" .dlls in the 64 but not the 32</span><span>. Should they
 be the same?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried extracting the missing x86 .dlls from the newly downloaded folder into the System32 as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-restore-a-missing-directx-dll-file-2624516" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">suggested here</a>, but "Access is denied."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does the device have dual graphics, what is the exact model of the one you have. I see in general the G3 has Nvidia graphics but you mention Intel UHD Graphics 630. There seems to be a few variations of Dell G3.</p>
<p>Are you only using drivers from Dell's website or do you use drivers from the graphics website.</p>

                    <p>After getting Windows 10, I couldn't find the guest account. So I went here: <br />
</p>
<p>http://www.howto-connect.com/windows-10-tips-enable-administrator-guest-account/</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I did everything it said (except the last one, which was disabling the administrator). But shortly after, I decided to do the last one, I disabled the administrator account. I must have did something or deleted or typed up something wrong, but now, there
 seems to be no administrator account, and so far I can't do anything to gain the administrator account back! I've tried clicking the media creation tool (which I used to install Win 10) but again, I can't use it because my account isn't the administrator.
 I can't make any other account or manage any other account, nor can I run the command prompt as administrator anymore to change anything. What do I do? Please help, I can't even contact Microsoft for any help (can't schedule a phone call appointment, nor can
 I reach any technical online chat for help.&nbsp;</p>

            I got ya! Alright, so first of all, try to get into SAFE MODE. You can do that by first going to SETTINGS from windows, then click UPDATE &amp; SECURITY, and then click RECOVERY. Then click RESET this PC (I think.. I'm not entirely sure.) Then the computer
 should begin to reset, and you should be able to pick a few options to get into SAFE MODE. After that, you should be able to log in into a SAFE MODE ACCOUNT. Once you're in that account, you should be able to enable the Administrator Account through the ACCOUNTS/MANAGE
 ACCOUNT section, or you can create or assign another account to become the administrator. After that, make sure the ADMIN account is back, and reset the computer and be able to log in. Hope this helps!

    <title>Cannot pin items to start menu on windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wimbekker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot pin items to start menu on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Just upgraded from windows 8.1 to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot pin several programs to the windows start menu. If I click in explorer on a program and select 'pin to start', nothing is pinned to the start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some files are not found on the start menu. I.e. in w8.1 I've had two shortcuts to umlet and sdedit. Both shortcuts are still available in %appdata%\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs. W10 cannot find umlet in start menu but it can find sdedit.
 I cannot drag any of these shortcuts to the start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some applications I cannot drag from the Most used bar (like VirtualBox.exe) but others I can (like cmd).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me with this, I want to be able to have any exe and/or shortcut be available on the start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.s I'm administrator on my system and I've done all checks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Wim</p>

            <p>Hello Mayank-Longiany,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I've restarted explorer. I've restarted the computer many times. I've done checks to see if windows files are ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried to pin items several ways:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- 'pin to start' in explorer context menu</p>
<p>- dragging from 'most used' list,</p>
<p>- make shortcut in %appdata%\...\Start Menu\Programs</p>
<p>- remove shortcuts and 'pin to start'</p>
<p>
</p><p>The action 'pin to start' puts a shortcut in %appdata%\...\Start Menu\Programs, but doesn't put the program in the
</p>
<p>start menu itself. If you type the name of the shortcut in the Start Menu it also is not found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>[EDIT: I may have wandered off from the title because of your mention of the AppData folder,</p>
<p>but have had no problem with R/click and select Pin to Start. However Pin to Start does not add the</p>
<p>item to the All Apps part of the Start Menu. ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>The AppData Roaming folder is, I believe, for when connecting from another computer - roaming ?</p>
<p>If you use&nbsp; - C:\<em>Program Data\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu </em>folder,&nbsp; the shortcuts/sub-folders with shortcuts</p>
<p>will appear on the Start Menu &gt; App Data section (This is the folder I always used in Win7, and it transferred to</p>
<p>Win10's App Data more or less intact).</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Edit - new solution, in edit at bottom of page</p>
<p>-<del> This folder can be pinned&nbsp; to File Explorer&nbsp; icon on the Taskbar if you want quick access.
</del>]</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note that if you have a main topic folder within the Start Menu folder, eg- I have a folder titled Multi-media,</p>
<p>with sub-folders for some programs that contain items other than shortcuts that I never got around to weeding</p>
<p>out (read me, help files, uninstallers, etc.) , this crazy version of a Start Menu will open all those sub-folders and spread out everything within in All Apps alphabetically.</p>
<p>Very messy, and counterintuitive, particularly when you see five read me's with no idea which is which.
</p>
<p>- Once your stuff is in All Apps you can pin shortcuts to the icon part of the Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I learned&nbsp; a trick on these forums last week which acts more like the old All Programs of old. You can</p>
<p>avoid the All Apps part of the Start Menu, and all&nbsp; the attendant MS junk that comes with Win10 by default,
</p>
<p>which cannot be deleted from All Apps, and create a new Toolbar on the Taskbar.
</p>
<p>R/click on the Taskbar and select New Toolbar &gt; browse to the Start Menu (above) and click Select Folder.</p>
<p>It's more or less like moving the Start Menu &gt; All Programs of old to the right side of the Taskbar.</p>
<p>Unfortunately you cannot arrange the sequence of the shortcuts or folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT : For this to work without just opening the Start Menu in a Window, you need to push the label</p>
<p><em>||Start Menu </em>to the right far enough to 'hide' the folder. This way when you click on the double arrow</p>
<p>that appears you will get a list rather than a Window. However dragging the label to the left makes for</p>
<p>easy access to the Start Menu for management.]</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Speaking of the MS junk. You can rid the All Apps section of the Start Menu of this most of what you don't</p>
<p>want cluttering All Apps using the command lines in the article below, but a lot of it is untouchable.</p>

<p>Hi Abhishek,</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you able to play the built-in windows dreamscenes without having any problem?
</li><li>What is current deskscapes version that you’re running? Did you recently upgrade your Stardock deskscapes version?
</li></ul>
<p>Basically, in order for DeskScapes to run, the Desktop Windows Manager Session Manager needs to be running. Check if this service has stopped for some reason.</p>
<p>To check whether the service is started or not, do the following.<br />
1.&nbsp;Click on Start; in the start search type Services.msc and hit Enter.<br />
2.&nbsp;Highlight Desktop Windows Manager Session Manager and start the service if it is stopped.<br />
3.&nbsp;Close the Services window and then try running deskscapes.</p>
<p>If the Service gets stopped again, even after starting it, then it is because the Windows Experience Score for the Graphics has dropped. I would suggest you to update your video card drivers for your computer.</p>
<p><strong>To manually update drivers<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</strong></a></p>
<p>There may be a possibility that sometimes files realted to DirectX might get corrupted. So check if you’re able to run DirectX without any problem.</p>
<p>To open DirectX Diagnostic Tool, click on start and in the Start search type dxdiag and press enter.</p>
<p>For Your Information: The most important key for the Windows Dreamscene or Deskscapes .dream files to work is MPEG-2 Video Codec.</p>

<h3> adam10000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Preview pane for .docx .txt error &#34;The file you are attempting to view could harm your computer...&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I get the following error when I try to preview an Office file or a "txt" file in Windows 10 Explorer in the preview pane, but only in certain folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The file you are attempting to view could harm your computer. If you trust the file and the source you received it from, open it to view its contents"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like it to preview normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have confirmed the the files are "unblocked" and the same error occurs on files I create directly on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the Office 365 repair</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can preview jpg and pdf files without problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>Files are stored in a &lt;user&gt;\sync\ folder which is similar to OneDrive or Google Drive. (see www.sync.com)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I create a Word file in "C:\New Folder" then I can see the preview as expected</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also do not see this problem on "OneDrive", which leads me to presume it must be something to do with the way Sync and preview handlers work together (or don't).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And why doesn't this affect pdf and image files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>

            Hi Adam.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />In addition to unblocking I'd try Taking Ownership of the file or folders to clear from any restrictions:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try creating a Firewall exception for the Sync service you use to give it further clearance:  <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/how-to-open-firewall-ports-in-windows-10,36451.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tomshardware.com/news/how-to-open-f...</a>
<br />
<br />If this is not enough based on how it works properly for all but the Sync folder files, I would contact their Support to ask about this as it is likely a known issue.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> alvy951  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turn on xbox one and no signal.</h2>
                    
<p>I have spent many hours trying to find a solution to this problem and I am very truly peed off.</p>
<p>I bought an xbox one 5 days ago and It seemed to work fine with the short time I played on it. Yesterday I turned it on went to the HDMI channel it is tuned into and it just says no signal. I have tried unplugging the HDMI cable back in and out still no
 signal. swapped the cable for another one still no signal. tried switching HDMI ports still no signal. This method really got under my skin... Bought a new £175 TV hooked it all up and guess what... No signal. I cant understand how this happened the cables
 are not damaged and the TV is brand spanking new!! I know its not the xbox one because when I got no signal with the HDMI on my xbox one I tried it with my xbox 360 and still nothing... I have even talked to a microsoft chat ambassador and even they don't
 know what's going on. They gave me a link to some troubleshoot solutions and they did nothing. Im about to get another HDMI cable just incase the last 2 someone broke but if anyone else is having this problem and knows a solution please please reply!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Im thinking about just returning the xbox one console all together since HDMI is the only way to play it. I have spent nearly over £600 just to play this console and it only lasted 4 days! any solutions please.</p>

<h2>            PC stuck in reboot loop in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: reboot loop windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>i dont know why but every time i start my computer it will restart about 5-6 times before i get to the homepage, i also cant update to the 1511 upgrade either so i dont know if it would be fixed if i did. Im contemplating going back to 8.1 until these issues
 are resolved.</p>

            <p>the problems started when i found one of my memory sticks went bad, i was getting blue screens alot and once i took it out i havent had one since but i still had the issue of my computer rebooting over and over again about 5 times. i did the automatic repair
 tool and got the&nbsp;logfiles/srt/srttrail.txt at the end of it so i went into command prompt and typed in</p>
<p>bootrec/fixMBR</p>
<p>bootrec/Fixboot</p>
<p>bootrec/rebuildBCD</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it seems to be working fine after i did that so ill monitoring my computer and see how it goes. im still unable to install the 1511 update though.</p>

<p>So, does that mean your backup copies also do not load (on that computer or another one - preferably another one)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sounds like you got tagged with ransomware or some encrypting virus possibly...&nbsp; Or your hard drive is going south quickly... Or the system files and installed apps are so corrupt, it's actually unfathomable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you open Word, create a new document with something you can read typed in and save it to the desktop... Close Word, restart the computer and open said document once you get back up and logged in - does that new file look okay?</p>

<p>Sounds like, unfortunately, the un-backed up files are lost, likely due to whatever virus (likely swarm of virii) you had.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My suggestions are as follows:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Find (and collect together) external media / web pages / serial numbers / product keys for the software you have installed beyond Windows 10 itself - in a pile OFF the computer itself.</li><li>Backup all of your personal files, folders, documents, music, images, videos, Internet bookmarks, emails stored locally, etc. to external media.&nbsp; Copy / paste is the most reliable - albeit time consuming - way to do this.&nbsp; Be sure you get EVERYTHING.
<ul>
<li>*If* you are concerned about this step, in that you may miss something, and you have enough space somewhere - make a
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5495-create-system-image-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
FULL system image</a> and/or copy everything under your personal folder (C:\USERS\&lt;your username&gt;) to another location than where you are doing the other backups.&nbsp; This will cover much of what many people might miss...&nbsp; Not everything if you put stuff in some
 non-standard locations or you have applications that save things in unusual places (not in your profile...)</li></ul>
</li><li>Disconnect any external hard drives, printers, etc. from the computer.</li><li><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4130-reset-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reset Windows 10 to a CLEAN state</a>, don't keep personal files, etc.</li><li>Visit the computer manufacturer's web site, their drivers/downloads section for your particular model of computer, and get any/all device drivers and such for your particular model computer downloaded and installed.</li><li><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/4807-check-install-windows-update-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update Microsoft Windows 10</a> until you check and there are no further updates.</li><li>Install your other software packages / applications / etc., activate and update them to their latest versions.</li><li>Restore the personal files and such (see #2) that you were able to salvage back to the proper locations.</li><li>Connect back other external components (printers, scan
 the files/stuff you made and saved SINCE that point... This means you would have a backup of a CLEAN install with everything working well, stable, updated to that point, etc.</li><li>Connect an external drive and use it for <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/75591-turn-off-schedule-windows-backup-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
scheduling backups periodically</a> to it.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
While I have empathy for the lost files you are finding, there is unlikely any way to recover since we have no clue what really corrupted them (likely the virus/virii in question - but no specifics there) - so, it's best you clean up the machine, be sure it
 is cleaned up, start over with a GOOD current backup of everything and continue with a good/solid backup plan in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry I don't have a happier suggestion - but it really sounds like things have gone horribly wrong.&nbsp; All I can suggest is how to clean up afterwards and how to best mitigate the possibility of it happening again in the future.</p>

<p>*shrug* Unlikely, since they are not executables (meaning they run, they are just files you open with other applications.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Essentially, what it looks like happened is you were hit with some encrypting malware that goes thru and "encrypts" all of your personally created files and then is supposed to tell you it did this and might ask you to pay a ransom to get the necessary instructions
 to decrypt the files.&nbsp; Truthfully, the files were likely lost the moment they were 'encrypted', as paying the ransom (if it gets to that point) rarely works and waiting on someone to come out with a decryption key to counter it is a high-odds waiting game
 that will likely never come to fruition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The files (you created) that you backup that are messed up now will just still be messed up.</p>

<h2>            XBOX&#58;360 Not Detecting Hard Drive</h2>
                    
<p>Hiya,</p>
<p>I have an XBOX 360 elite that came with a 120 GB HDD when I bought it (used). Anyway, as I recall, the console recognized the 120GB hard drive when I first turned it on, and I whilst I was transferring files between that HDD and my older one, I had to change
 them. After I finished transferring files from my old HDD (in the console) to the new HDD connected through a transfer cable. After I was done, I disconnected the HDD from the transfer cable and accidentally dropped that HDD. It was fine cosmetically after
 I was done. I then removed the old HDD from the xbox (quite certain I turned it off first) and put in the new HDD but the console didn't recognize it. Then I removed the new one (not sure if I turned off the xbox first) and put in the new one but it didn't
 work either. Since then I've been playing through the new HDD connected through the transfer cable. Can anyone help?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely, Adnan.</p>

<p>yep, sounds like you used a 3rd party transfer cable and turned that drive into the equivalent of a 16 gig flash drive which is why it ONLY works when hooked up via the transfer cable, and once it is done it cannot be fixed, sorry.</p>

Apparently there are many other people wiht the same issue as well.</p><p><br /></p><p>I've just managed to set up Minecraft Windows 10 edition on both my PC and my daughter's laptop, both kids can play individually on the PC and laptop but can't seem to connect to each others game.&nbsp; They are linked as friends and all privacy and security settings are fine.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Has anyone else had this issue and has anyone found a fix? All they wan't to do is play a game together on the same world and Minecraft makes that the most difficult task in the world!</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks in adviance. <br /></p>

            <p>&nbsp;I wanna bump this. I'm having the same issue. It has happened with all the 360 games for the past two months, whenever I try to get it on the xbox, nothing happens. When I try to buy through the windows xbox&nbsp;app, it prompts the browser and I get the following error "The error code is 0X00000005, in case you need it". Up until now I had to get the 360 through the app, that doesn'st work anymore since the beginning of June.&nbsp;</p>
