<h2>            Account Banned and Downloadable Content Gone.</h2>
                    
<p>I have had the same account for almost five years, and over those years, my account has been hacked several times. Each time it was hacked, people would access the credit card on the account, and go on a spending spree. But we always got the account back,
 and everything back to normal. But the last two times I have been hacked, the hacker did something I have never seen before. They had erased all of my achievements (24,000), and my "Zone" was labeled "Cheater," and I couldn't change it. And whenever I would
 unlock an achievement, it would show up. So I called Xbox, and they told me it would fix itself, if I just keep playing. Then my account was hacked a second time, and my Avatar was all green, and no matter what I did I couldn't change it. And my Call of Duty
 4 rank, was changed to an 11th prestige, when it only goes to 10th. I immediately called Xbox begging them to fix it, and the said they couldn't. They said not to worry, and to just keep playing. Well I was still worried, because I know how Xbox/Microsoft
 feel about that type of stuff, so I continued calling to see if someone else could help, and they still "couldn't." They told me it would go away, and I didn't believe them, because I still couldn't earn achievements. Then two days after I called asking for
 help, I got permanently banned, and an email stating why. The reason I was banned, were for the same things I was asking help for. I had literally no control over anything. I have never modded a day in my life. In fact I report anyone who I see mod. Now at
 first when I got banned, I was extremely angry, but then I realized it's not so bad because I couldn't unlock achievements anymore, and I didn't like my Avatar being green. So I created a new account, and figured I could still play all of my games that&nbsp; I
 had downloaded. But when I went to play them, it wouldn't let me, so I figured I had to just re-download them. But when I went to re-download them, it only gave me the option to buy them (again). I had several Avatar items, and add-on/extensions for games,
 that I downloaded from "Games on Demand" in the Game Marketplace. Now even though I constantly asked for help, and had no control over anything, and did nothing wrong, I don't care about the account, but I want the games that I paid for back. If I could get
 the account back, that would be great, but I'm more focused on the games. Below, is the list of all the games, avatar items, and add-on/extensions I have purchased over the years. Please help me get them back. I shouldn't have to suffer for something I didn't
 do, and had no control over.</p>
<p>-Full Games - Assassins Creed (1), Call of Duty (1), Call of Duty 2, Call of Duty 3, Battlefield Bad Company (1), Battlefield 1943, Gears of War (1), Stranglehold, Rainbow Six Vegas (1), Trials HD, Marble Blast Ultra, Saints Row 2, Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon
 2, Uno, Worms, and I think that's it.</p>
<p>-Add-ons/Extension - GTA4 (Lost and Damned, and The Ballad of *** Tony), all add-on for Marble Blast Ultra, All map packs for Call of Duty World at War, all extensions for Assassins Creed Brotherhood, the first two map packs for Call of Duty Black Ops, map
 pack for Call of Duty 4, Call of Duty 2 Bonus Pack, Call of Duty 3 Bonus Map "Champs", Extra album for Guitar Hero Metallica, All map packs and extensions for Halo 3, Halo Reach Noble Map Pack and bonus content, Left 4 Dead (1) Survival Pack, Mirrors Edge
 Pure Time Trials, A LOT OF SONGS FOR Rock Band 2, Saints Row 2 The Unkut Pack and Ultor Exposed, The Saboteur Midnight Show, All extensions for Trials HD, and maybe more, but not that I can remember.</p>
<p>-Avatar Items - Ezio Outfit, Ghost Uniform, and Trials HD Hoodie.</p>

<p>If you truely think your account was not under your control during the times of the ban and the events leading up to it, you can try to claim unauthorized access on your account by calling the support line. Posting in the bans forum would do you no good,
 seeing as you already know why the ban is in place. Unauthorized access is the only scenario that I'm aware of that it would justify a ban being lifted. There is specific information required for these claims, such as console information, incident date and
 some other things that you will be asked should you go this route.</p>

<p>First of all i agree that infections can't make your avatar green, but just joining a JTAGED lobby gives the modder complete authority to your account. Unfortuanately, I would know. I had a friend who did that all the time. The only thing i ever modded was
 my avatar because i thought blue skin was awesome and paid the price. RIGHT AFTER i renewed a 12 month xbox live membership i was banned. On my birthday too. I would do anything for my old DLC's back.</p>

    <title>Redeem Code&#47;Free Month LIVE Gold Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajzombieslyr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Redeem Code&#47;Free Month LIVE Gold Error</h2>
                    <p>Not too long ago (just yesterday), I have bought a 1-Year Membership for Xbox LIVE Gold. I went on to my Xbox ONE, my 360, and even on this website to redeem the code for it, and all were a bust. The Xbox ONE showed the "(0x80a40008)" error code. On this site, I clicked on "Redeem Code" and it sent me to a Microsoft page that couldn't be displayed. I tried to download this profile to my 360 to redeem it, but it kept saying I have to put in my billing address, zip code, etc. Can someone, please, at least tell me what's going on?</p>

<p>A network adapter is usually part of your motherboard drivers.</p>
<p>Make/model of PC? or motherboard if generic desktop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this PC is the Laptop referred to in your other posts, the network adapter is built into the motherboard, and all drivers are obtained from that laptop maker.</p>
<p>It seems to me that you may have obtained your drivers from an unknown web source, which is why they are in zip format&nbsp;</p>

            The website does not show how to install and the new driver is not from the PC manufacturer and that is why I am asking for help. As I am unable to open the zip and install the new driver I can not uninstall the old driver.

            <p>OEM Computer and NIC manufacturers generally supply drivers in executable form, and the driver file should not require unzipping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Be aware that drivers from other sources may not be beneficial to your system, even though they may claim to be ok. See your present situation as an omen, and get your updated drivers from the proper source..&nbsp;

If you insist on 'updating' what may well not need updating, and if&nbsp; the Windows option to decompress files does not work, 7-zip will decompress anything (I think) -<br />

            Please accept my apologies for that omission. My laptop is a Toshiba Satellite Pro L300-1FK and am running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit&nbsp; Service Pack 1.The network&nbsp; adapter is a &nbsp;Atheros AR5007EG&nbsp; and the driver is dated 9/6/2009.&nbsp;When I contact either
 Toshiba or Microsoft I am told this is the latest driver. Trust and hope this helps.

            Which version of Windows are you running?
<br />Have you tried signing out of Skype, restart the computer, sign in again then make another attempt at calling?
<br />
<br />Another thing you can try is uninstall Skype then reinstall it to see if it resolves the problem.
<br />
<br />Are you using Wireless or Wired network?
<br />
<br />
<br />Also sign into Skype for Web to confirm if you are still unable view your contacts to send messages.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Ubuntu (Linux OS)-64 bit on my laptop. I have installed VirtualBox on my laptop, with this I am able to run Windows XP as a guest OS. Now I would like to run Windows 7-32 bit (Professional) &nbsp;as guest OS in the VirtualBox. Is this possible ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also which version should I buy, OEM version ?? or any other ??</p>
<p>Will there be any authentication/installation issues while installing on VirtualBox ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has Microsoft placed any restrictions on installing the operating system in a virtual environment such as the VirtualBox ??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me with this issue, as I am planning to buy a copy of Windows 7.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Yes, it is. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also which version should I buy, OEM version ?? or any other ??</p>
<span>
<p><strong>Because Windows 7 is in limited stock because Microsoft ended sales in October 2013, this has created demand because of its scarcity. This means retail boxed copies demand a premium, while OEM System Builder copies remain affordable.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I would go with the OEM System builder license:</strong></p>
<span>
<p><strong>OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</strong></p>
<p><strong>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</strong></p>
<p><strong>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</strong></p>
<p><strong>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</strong></p>
<p><strong>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</strong></p>
<p>
<span><span>
</span></span></p><p>
<span>
</span></p><p><strong>There is nothing wrong with using it too, especially since all future releases of Windows will be full versions anyway.
</strong></p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Will there be any authentication/installation issues while installing on VirtualBox ?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>No, it will activate just like on a physical computer. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Has Microsoft placed any restrictions on installing the operating system in a virtual environment such as the VirtualBox ??
</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me with this issue, as I am planning to buy a copy of Windows 7.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Karan Shetty, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes you can download Windows 8 in one computer and install it in another computer.</p>
<p>However you can install it only in one computer, <span>as you only have one product key. If you want to install it in other computer, you need purchase additional licenses.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To download and install it in another computer, follow the steps:</span></p>
<p>a. Use the <b>Upgrade Assistant</b> to qualify the PC and pay for it.</p>
<p>b. When the <b>"Install Windows 8</b>" message appears, select "<b>Install by creating media</b>" to create a bootable USB flash drive or an .iso (a disk image) file.</p>
<p>c. Wait for the Assistant to download the Windows 8 Pro installation package and create the bootable media or .iso file. The flash drive must be having 3GB or more of free space available.</p>
<p>d. Burn the .iso file, if that's the path you chose, to a blank DVD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you need further assistance, please reply and we will be happy to help you.</span></p>

            <p>Additional info ref. your query, you will need to ensure the PC and laptop are you capable of&nbsp;operating on the same bit system (32 bit or 64 bit), as the download will only download the bit system for the PC which it is downloaded to.</p>
<p>If your PC is 64 bit it will download only W8 64 bit OS.</p>
<p>If your laptop can only run 32 bit OS, the download will not install on laptop.</p>
<p>The upgrade does not allow upgrading from 32 bit to 64 bit</p>
<p>Can I upgrade from 32 bit OS to 64 bit OS?</p>
<p>Yes, but you can't do this using Upgrade Assistant. If your PC has a 64-bit capable processor (CPU) but is currently running a 32-bit version of
<span>Windows</span>, you can install a 64-bit version of
<span>Windows&nbsp;8 Pro</span>, but you'll need to buy it as a DVD and perform a custom installation. If available in your country or region, you can buy
<span>Windows&nbsp;8 Pro</span> from a participating retail store. You can also buy it online from the
<span>Microsoft</span> Store in Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and United States.</p>

<p>I'd much rather prefer buying the DVD, but I guess in India you can only buy it from Flipkart. (<a href="http://www.flipkart.com/microsoft-windows-8-professional/p/itmdf3njpfk7vbc4?pid=OPSDF3KZYV7AZTRH&amp;ref=fd99610c-2efe-4054-ad18-0f6237b8aa49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.flipkart.com/microsoft-windows-8-professional/p/itmdf3njpfk7vbc4?pid=OPSDF3KZYV7AZTRH&amp;ref=fd99610c-2efe-4054-ad18-0f6237b8aa49</a>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My&nbsp;confusion now is that whether the version on sale is a full version DVD or an upgrade. The guys at Flipkart are confused and don't really know. Secondly, I'm using Windows 8 RTM Build 9200 (Un-Activated) on my Laptop. If I buy this DVD, would I be able
 to do a clean install and have it ACTIVATED (a lot of people are clueless if this is possible), or would I have to revert back to Windows 7?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would really appreciate some clarity on the same. I can't wait to get my hands on a full version licensed copy. - Thanks.</p>

            <p>First:</p>
<p>If you want to use the upgrade version you need to re-install W7, it will only install on a previous qualifying (Legal)&nbsp;version of W7, Vista or XP.</p>
<p>Second:</p>
<p>There is no upgrade path from any pre-release version of W8 ( RP, CP, RTM.)</p>
<p>You can purchase a<em><u> W8 Pro (OEM) version</u></em>, which is used to install W8 onto PC's without a qualifying version of Windows pre-installed.</p>
<p>This is the version you will need if you do not choose the upgrade path, the price of this version is approx. $140 (Aust), the upgrade versions are approx. $60 (Aust).</p>
<p>You link unfortunately does not work for me.</p>

<p>I'd suggest following Prakesh's directions if you wish to download since you can do it on the laptop in question.&nbsp; As for the link you provided, if you scroll down to the full description of the software, under General Heading, Additional Features, it does
 state: "Full Package Software"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure the laptop meets system requirements:</p>

            <p>If you have already installed on the first computer, you would have to recover the previous operating system which would wipe Windows 8 out of the system. You can then redownload from the link you were given and create the necessary media in order to install
 it on the new computer.</p>
<p>One license per pc/laptop unit</p>
<p>If you intend to keep it on the first computer and wish to install it on the new computer, you will have to purchase a separate license then follow Praseetha K Nair's suggestion:</p>

            thanks for the quick reply.<br />
have not installed the upgrade. was waiting for the right new laptop to buy and did not want to wait until close to expiration date for the offer.<br />
<br />
'You can then redownload from the link you were given': is this the ms email with the
<br />
'PROMO CODE' and instructions to 'Download Upgrade Assistant', and other instructions? would it involve paying again? would use the same laptop where the download is currently saved.<br />

<p>Yes, use the same laptop you originally used unless the new laptop is 32-bit while the older laptop was 64-bit or vice-versa.&nbsp;&nbsp;If previously downloaded and the system was 32-bit, that is what you downloaded.&nbsp; You'd have to use a different 64-bit laptop to
 get the 64-bit version and I believe that would entail paying for another copy.&nbsp; If both are the same, you're free to download again.&nbsp; Remember to select

    <title>Cast to in Edge doesn&#39;t find any devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tryggr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cast to in Edge doesn&#39;t find any devices</h2>
                    Since upgrading to Creators Update Edge no longer works for using Cast to. I have 2 PCs that I use to Cast to 2 Xbox Ones. Prior to the update this worked 100%. Since the update there is no combination of devices that works. If I open a movie in Movies
 &amp; TV app, then try to cast to Xbox, it works properly. But in Edge, if click the ... and choose Cast media to device, the computer opens the Connect fly out and there are simply no devices that are found. I'm starting to see more buzz around the internet on
 this, but no solutions yet. Can anybody help me out?

<p>Some of your questions would be answered if you read my earlier posts. SFC isn't the solution either. This is clearly a setting that was changed in the new builds. Do you have any internal resources you can query about this? Rather than just pasting in canned
 answers for built in tools that aren't the solution?</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>recently I can't enable the "File and printer sharing" in my network settings anymore. It takes my selection when I click on it but it will not be saved. On looking back after saving "File and
 printer sharing" is on disabled again. With that I can't see other members in my little home network anymore.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I've tried some tips from the internet searched in Google but nothing would help.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I don't use any extern tunig tools, anti virus sofware etc. I'm using the Windows Defender and the other in windows integrated programs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It's running windows 10, vers. 1511, build 10586.1045 on my laptop. I bought it with with original preinstalled windows 8.1 nearly 3 years ago.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After changing up to Windows 10 there were no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>But now ....</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Maybe someone has a good idea or solution for my problem.</span></span></p>

    <title>No volume control for USB Audio Codec recording device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            No volume control for USB Audio Codec recording device</h2>
                    
I'm not sure if this is a Windows XP issue, a driver issue, or an issue with the software I am<br />
using.<br />
<br />
I recently purchased an ION TTUSB10 turntable and am trying to use the Audacity software <br />
which came with it to record from some of my old vinyl for transfer to MP3 files. My problem<br />
is that when I go into Control Panel/Sounds and Audio Devices/Audio, the Sound Recording<br />
Default Device shows USB Audio Codec which is correct; but the Volume and Advanced buttons<br />
are disabled (grayed out). I can still record OK, but I have no way to adjust the input level.<br />
How do I get the Sounds and Audio Devices to give me this control?  Please help!<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

<p>Hi itseileen - Appalling you (and the other 5 people) have not had any answer to this problem! I hope you still checking in here because I have EXACTLY the same problem (apart from the turntable) and if you have found a solution I would like to know it please.</p>
<p>I think this is an issue with Audacity because it seemed to happen to me AFTER I uninstalled Audacity. There is a wiki article that refers to "problems" with Audacity and I have read loads of other people with similar greyed out sound buttons.</p>
<p>I have updated my DirextX to latest - no change to problem.</p>
<p>I have updated onboard soundcard driver - no change to the problem.</p>
<p>I have tried the Microsoft on line fix it tool and this actually increased the problem from a greyed out recording volume button by adding a greyed out recording Advanced button - so I got both your problems (thanks Microsoft).</p>
<p>So we got a problem - we come here for help and get... ziltch!</p>
<p>Come on Microsoft - help PLEASE! Loads of people got these greyed out button issues - what the ansa?</p>
<p>Some people (I read) have unistalled and reinstalled XP and still the problem is there - obviously a corrupt/missing bit of code somewhere but in my Devices manages I have NO waring sybols against anything in the list including hidden devices.</p>
<p>Bit of a glitch.</p>
<p>Look forward to reply..........</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And the reply, Treblis ain't gonna please you. Its not an MS problem nor is it an Audacity problem There is absolutely no need to re-install XP nor Audacity..</p>
<p>The turntable doesn't need any drivers - its plug and play. What you will need is a working sound device to enable playback and correct recording etc.</p>
<p>I would suggest you take a good look at your sound drivers (check in device manager and see if there are any problems).They may be corrupt, for whatever reason. Itseileen - you should do that as well.</p>
<p>Try un-installing any mention of a sound device and its accompanying software, then download the latest XP specific drivers for it from the makers§your PC or laptop maker's/your motherboard maker's website and install.</p>
<p>If either of you have any problems locating the relevant sound device drivers, re-post with full PC/laptop specs (make, model, ref number etc) and those of your sound device.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Jerry</p>

<p><span>Thanks so much for reply.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I take back about Audacity – but Jury (here) still out on the Microsoft on-line ‘fix-it’ tool and now something else… read on.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I think Microsoft is good. I appreciate how problems and conflicts and data corruption can occur with so many different manufacturers and suppliers of hardware and software components.
 And then there are the users (like me) that occasionally screw things up, like in my own instance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, before I post into forums for help I have usually exhausted myself in trying to self-fix my own problems which I usually manage until time like this. So, your assistance is much
 appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope we can sort this greyed out buttons thing because I see a lot of folks are having similar problems.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ok, here is how it happened to me.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I built this system myself 12 months ago and took care to ensure all the installed components were compatible with each other.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Everything was running fine until a few weeks ago when I needed to transfer some old audiocassette tapes to my computer and to do this I installed Audacity.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Audacity is a simple tool but I could not get it to run properly and there seemed to be a conflict between it and the default Sound Card that meant I could not record or playback
 sound until I had put a tick into the Mute volume on the Windows Volume controls going through Control Panel Sound and Audio Devices.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anyway, I&nbsp;muted the sound and Audacity worked and got the audiocassette transfer finished and forgot about it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A few weeks later I installed and ran a Click &amp; Convert Transfer analogue Video to DVD/PC device with its software driver and bundled Arcsoft ShowBiz video editing software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This conversion device connects to the computer via USB2 port and Sound Card Input jack and the Audio (white) and Video (yellow) connection sockets on the Camcorder.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The first few analogue videos to PC conversions were great in both sound and picture but after converting a bigger video I noticed I had lost sound and vision synchronisation. There
 was an echo like there were two sound devices playing at the same time.<span>&nbsp;</span>If I muted Click and Convert sound I transferred a silent sound track and so the only other option (I thought) was to mute the Windows Volume as before –&nbsp;and this
 worked in as much as the echo effect vanished but the out of sync sound problem was still there. So, I could hear the sound on the conveted video file but it was still out of lip sync. Sound and vision played through the camera were in sync - so the prblem
 was happening in the transfer/playback through the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I figured&nbsp;the sound lag was because I had tried converting too large a video file and the system was lagging somewhere. So, how to fix?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Well, I don’t use Audacity anymore so I uninstalled it using Control Panel and re-booted and tried a new video conversion but now there was no video sound being converted with the
 Click and Convert device. Mmmmm.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What I wish I had done at this time was check to see if Windows Media Player sound was still working but…ah, hindsight.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anyway. I uninstalled and re-installed Click and Play – but still got no sound recording in video audio conversion using this device.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Somewhere about now I noticed the Volume control button in Windows had greyed out.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I thought I might have corrupted a windows XP file by installing then uninstalling devices and other software so I ran sfc /scannow now and it did ask for the XP Home disc to copy
 repair some files. After sfc the Volume button was still greyed out. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, I went onto the web and Microsoft site to see if maybe this problem had occurred to others and I see many had so then I see a Microsoft online tool to check my sound so I ran
 it – it found a problem with the Default Sound and asked if I wanted it fixed – I clicked OK – it fixed it – but when I went back to System Volume control in Sound and Audio Devices (via Control Panel) I found the Volume and now the Advanced tabs were
<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">both</span></em></strong> greyed out!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It was time for a System Restore – so I went back to point before the Microsoft Fix it but<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">both</span></strong> the greyed out buttons
 were both still there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As I was in the process of sorting this matter out –<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">would you Adam &amp; Eve it</span></em></strong> – the Power Supply Unit<span>&nbsp;</span>(650W)
 suddenly packed up! </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So that had to come out of the computer go off to get replaced as faulty and hence few weeks delay during which time I did not sit on hands but twiddled fingers (using another pc) researching online&nbsp;into
 possible causes of the greyed out buttons during which time I posted my help into this forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Phew! Still with me…?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After I installed the new PSU – I tried to play a music CD and got message pop up “WMP can’t play the file because problem with your sound device”. Oh great!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Uninstalled Click &amp; Convert – still no sound in WMP.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ran full anti-virus – system clean.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ran Device Manager –<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">no</span></em></strong> problems showing with any device (!).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps you guess by now I am on a curve learning about audio and video file formats and conversion and video players, etc. Live and Learn, ay.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I updated and installed latest DirectX from Microsoft – but it made no discernable difference.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, I went back to my system build files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Motherboard: Asus P5Q Pro Turbo. This has High Definition (HD) Audio<strong><em>and</em></strong> legacy AC’ 97 on-board.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To complicate matters (I don’t know why) there are 3 on-board sound devices listed:</span></p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>ATI High Definition Audio Device (Manufacturer:
 ATI Technologies Inc)</span></p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>Via High Definition Audio (Manufacturer: Via
 Technologies Inc)</span></p>
<p><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span>ASUSTek Virtual Capture Device (Manufacturer:
 ASUSTek).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>BIOS: American Megatrends date: 04/13/09 Ver. 08.00.14</span></p>
<p><span>BIOS Revision: ACPI 0401</span></p>
<p><span>SM Bios Version: 2.5</span></p>
<p><span>CPU: Intel Core2 Duo E8400 @ 3.00GHz</span></p>
<p><span>Speed: 3000Mhz</span></p>
<p><span>Memory: G.Skill DDR2 800 x 2</span></p>
<p><span>Memory Capacity: 4GB</span></p>
<p><span>HDD: 2 x Western Digital 156GB (SATA)</span></p>
<p><span>Graphics: ATI Radeon HD 4300/4500 1GB DDR2 on-board memory. HDMI, DirectX 10</span></p>
<p><span>Operating System: XP Home SP3.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Strangely, there are<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">no</span></em></strong> reported problem or error symbols in Device Manager or in System Information.<span>&nbsp;</span>Everything
 listed is as OK. There are also <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>no</strong></em></span> conflicts showing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I Figured maybe on-board sound data was somehow corrupted and that definitely some audio codecs were missing or corrupted which was why Windows Media Player could not play a bog
 standard Audio CD – albeit a very old Kool and the Gang CD.<span>&nbsp; Remember, I first noticed problems with sound during the Audacity audio cassete conversion weeks ago.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, First call onto Asus (motherboard) website to identify any on-board update Sound Card drivers available (VIA Technology website advises people with Via on-board sound cards like me to download
 new drivers direct from motherboard manufacturer).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I find on ASUS website there is an VIA HD Audio Device update download for my make and model – so I download it and saved it to a separate folder on the HDD.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Going into Device Manger to install the new updated driver from where I saved it on the HDD I discover that XP cannot detect the new driver because it does not ship with a .inf file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Doh!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The new driver package ships with an Intelligent Setup.exe file so I try running this but this does not install properly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So I emailed Asus for help and they reply 48 hours later I need to install from Microsoft the<strong>Hotfix KB835221</strong>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Went onto Microsoft website to find KB835221 and could<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>not</strong></em></span> find it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Instead I read in various Microsoft Forums all about problems caused updating and getting HD audio to run properly in XP because Microsoft are not shipping HD Audio drivers with
 Service Pack 3 and then how (to complicate even more) <strong>Hotfix KB888111</strong> must be installed first and how others have had huge problems trying to update HD update drivers even after installing both these Hotfixes from Microsoft and how some people
 have problems and others no problems.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Bear in mind – all I want is an .inf file in an updated sound card driver file download from ASUS or VIA for XP Home to install it no problems from the Device Manager Update Driver
 button. Oh well. No joy there then.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Seems like a bag of worms to me.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Apparently I have to make a special written request to Microsoft to be able to download KB835221 and KB835111 and even then I might make this problem WORSE!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, to get WMP running I updated and installed new audio and video codecs – and now I can play audio CD’s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So WMP player now works fine again. I wonder why it stopped working? Obviously one or more codecs must have been deleted/corrupted somewhere along the line.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My Windows Sound and Audio Devices Volume and Advanced buttons<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>are still greyed out</em></span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span></strong> re-installed Click and Convert or Audacity……, yet.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Interesting reading a Microsoft Forum post about problems with XP and HD Audio drivers.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><em>Apparently, if<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">before you install XP</span></strong> the BIOS is tweaked to turn<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">off</span></strong>
 HD Audio and then XP is then installed and the machine re-booted into BIOS and HD is then turned back on – HD Sound then works.</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As a matter of fact I turned off HD sound when I was setting the computer up simply because the front panel connector leads didn’t reach the connection post point on the motherboard
 and so, until I bought some extension connection cables, I turned off HD Audio in the BIOS before I installed XP and set the BIOS to run with legacy AC 97’.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After I got the extension cables I connected these and turned HD Audio on in the BIOS and have enjoyed HD until… well you know the story now.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have thought about getting a new dedicated PCI Sound Card but I have read how others have done this but still – the Volume Button (and sometimes Advanced Volume) button(s) remain greyed out.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems to me that what seems to be happening to me (and possible some others) is the on-board sound devices (e.g. VIA HD Audio) are overriding the XP (default) Audio device and
 making itself the Default Audio device (as it perhaps should) so recording and playback volume is controlled using the VIA HD Audio on-screen Audio Interface and not the Windows Audio and Sound Devices in Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, in summary, I seem to have a working Sound Audio system on my computer but now with glitches that may or may not work with other devices and/or software I might install later
 and – <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">which is maybe worse</span></strong> – there seems to be a headache looming for me if I try to update my on- board VIA HD Sound card driver with Hotfix’s and I need to make a special request to Microsoft
 to get the fixes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You know plectrum, after reading pages and pages of forum posts – some going back to 2006 with this problem and more – the brain eyes and body all get befuddled.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, can you tell me the back-story to the KB835221, KB835111, Hotfix issue? How do I get them and will they sort out the greyed Volume and Advanced buttons?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most importantly - what do you think I need to buy/get/install in Sound Card devices/software to get the Hardware Sound Buffering issue sorted out? What is Hardware Sound Buffering
 anyway?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems to me the out of sync sound issue is quite common and can be quite easily sorted out using something like VLC Media to stop the problem. VLC Media comes from the same stable
 as Audacity.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope I have not bored you to zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz, but we are trying to find a solution and understanding.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There seems to be an issue with Microsoft and HD Audio Drivers being or not being shipped with SP3 and this is still unresolved - is it?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I look forward to reading your reply.</span></p>
<p><span>Cheers!</span></p>
<p><span>Kind regards.</span></p>

<p>It was tough going but yes, still here.</p>
<p>If you have sp3 installed, shouldn't need the hotfix mentionned. Try this, but first put your XP CD in your player/burner, do not let it autostart. Then :</p>
<p>Start &gt; Run &gt; type in "msconfig" (without the " ") &gt; OK (or enter) &gt; Extract &gt; make sure your source is the drive letter of your CD/DVD machine that you put the XP CD in &gt; for the destination brouse to c:\windows\system32 &gt; extract the file and overwrite
 if necessary &gt; Re-boot.</p>
<p>Do you have the mixer/volume back ?</p>

<p>the plectrum, Thanks for reply - thought best to give you whole story of what I did and also I was mindfull of the many other people who read these posts to help themselves see what others (like me) have done - but after doing as you suggest - in answer
 to 'Do I have mixer/volume back?' - short answer is - no.</p>
<p>Nothing changed - In the Sounds and Audio Devices Propeties Box the Default Recording Device&nbsp;does&nbsp;have the Volume button but clicking on it takes to a Recording Control (mixer) Box where the Volume Slider control is still greyed out. Also in the Sounds and
 Audio Devices Properties Box the Default Recording Device Advanced button is&nbsp;still greyed out.</p>
<p>I am going to run some more recording tests in next few days and will post the outcome in here.</p>
<p>Thought you might like to read what the ASUS technical reply I received to&nbsp;my driver install query read like:</p>
<p><em><strong>Is the OS you use XP+SP2 or XP+SP3?<br />
If it is XP+SP2, please install the KB888111 and then install the following driver to have a try.<br />
If it is XP+SP3, please install the KB835221 and then install the following driver to have a try.<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p>Makes me wonder what these guys really know (or not). I must say their "have a try" advice seems a rather<em><strong>plucky have&nbsp;a go</strong></em> that didn't inspire any confidence. Before I did anything about their advice I searched my registry and did
 a&nbsp;system Search for both Hotfixes mentioned and they did<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>not</strong></span>&nbsp;show up on my system which made me think they were therefore not installed - but I definatley am running SP3.</p>
<p>Any other thought in the meantime please let me know.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p><br />
No.</p>
<p>Am now (more) confused here...</p>
<p>Please help me to clarify:</p>
<p>In your previous post you wrote "if i have sp3 installed I should not need the hotfix".</p>
<p>I have sp3 installed. I am running Windows XP Home (32-bit) Service Pack 3 Version 2002.</p>
<p>I checked into the "support.microsoft.com/kb/835221" link you suggested in your last post before I posted my long (zzzzz..) post.</p>
<p>I did not install the Hotfix then because I was not sure it applied to me because in the Hotfix preamble Microsoft itself states (et al) "the KB835221 Hotfix applies to Windows 2000 platform x86, Windows XP platform x86 and Windows Server 2003 x86", "this
 Hotfix release supports HD Audio and modern implementations that are known to Microsoft as of March 19, 2004". "The (hotfix) package will not work on High Definition Audio implementations that are disclosed to Microsoft after this date". Furthermore,&nbsp;Microsoft
 warns "installing the wrong Hotfix can damage your system - if not sure - don't install the hotfix".</p>
<p>I was not sure about the hotfix so&nbsp;I did not install - hence my posts into here.</p>
<p>My system build (Asus motherboard) is all 2009, I am running XP Home (32bit) SP3 Ver: 2002&nbsp;and so it seemed to me the hotfix 835221 does not apply to me because my build and SP3 is after March 19 2004 and (I assumed)&nbsp;ASUS would have notified Microsoft during
 the following 5 years of the VIA HD Audio on-board their own motherboard manufacture. I could be wrong.</p>
<p>So you see Jerry I am between pillar and post (literally) you say I shouldn't need the hotfix if I am running SP3 (i am) - Asus say "try this hotfix... and see" (!) and Microsoft appear to say "don't install if you not sure, hotfix won't work for HD installations
 after 2004" and it appears the HD Audio hotfix (KB835221) comes with SP3", so (as you wrote) I shouldn't need to install it. Confused? I am.</p>
<p>The thing is though - my HD Audio playback and recording was all running (no buttons or sliders greyed out) well until I installed Audacity - this being in common with itseileen who started this string (and dissappeared hence...!).</p>
<p>Further, I understood your second to last post to mean NOT to install and run KB835221 because I have SP3 and in the light of the above it seemed to me if I installed it i could damage my own system.</p>
<p>cheers.. i look forward to your reply.</p>

<p>Hmmmm. I see the confusion !</p>
<p>OK, you shouldn't need the Hotfix - I merely wondered if you had tried it.</p>
<p>Lets go back a bit. The ATI (an output on your video car) will be updated whenever you update your video card drivers (its part of the package).</p>
<p>So : drivers from ASUS. Installing Audacity should have NO effect on your audio drivers - it merely uses what it finds. However, the fact that you un-installed it, did you, by error, uninstall anything else ?</p>
<p>Go to Asus, search for P5Q Pro Turbo then audio drivers:</p>
<p>http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx</p>
<p>I note in a post above you were looking for an .inf file. Don't bother.</p>
<p>Uninstall "Via High Definition Audio (Manufacturer: Via Technologies Inc)" then double click on the .exe file you donwloaded and install it. If you get a meesage saying the driver signature has not been recognised by MS (or similar) ignore it (its safe)
 and continue the installation.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<p>Hi Jerry - Am sure I did not unistall anything in error and if something in Windows XP was corrupted&nbsp;the files should be protected and repairable&nbsp;which is why&nbsp;I ran sfc from a copy i made of the i386 folder from the xp install cd i placed on my hdd.</p>
<p>The point i was making about the missing .inf file from Asus driver download was if there was one i could have updated the driver from Device Manager but as there wasn't an .inf I had to do as you suggested and remove Via HD Audio and then run the new driver
 .exe file&nbsp;but the problem then was it didn't install properly (had to run the .exe file from Start&gt;Programs - everytime I wanted Audio!)&nbsp;so I emailed Asus about that and they replied.... you know... "try instaling Hotfix KB385221". At this point i got dizzy
 AND confused so have been posting into here for help/advice.</p>
<p>Iseileen and I have the same issue that seems to resolve around the installation of a USB Sound connected device (mine was the Click &amp; Convert Video product). There issue for me using Click&amp;Convert was sound became out of Sync with Video conversion and so
 I unistaled C&amp;C and that was when I noticed the greyed out Volume button - which I tried to repair with a System Restore but as that failed I tried Microsoft on line Fit-It tool and that greyed out my Anvanced settings button as well!!</p>
<p>Shame Iseileen is not posting any news - why start a thread and then drop it? Oh well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I have now installed some recording software (not Click&amp;Convert !) and I will run some recording tests - it could be that the Microsoft on line Fix-it tool fixed something it shouldn't have but for some unknown reason I was unable to un-fix the
 fix-it with a SysRestore.</p>
<p>I will have more details after I run the recording tests - so, stand by...</p>
<p>regards and cheers!</p>

<p>Ok - well I have just blitzkrieged my ears!</p>
<p>Seems the problem is "sorted".</p>
<p>It appears that the Microsoft Fix-it tool fixed it so Via HD Audio is the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>only</strong></span> default&nbsp;device to control Recording Volume and Advanced Volume button and slider settings and it has, therefore, greyed out these controls in Sound &amp; Audio Devices. In short, VIA HD Audio is now the only device to control Recording
 Volume - and it works!</p>
<p>Before the Fix-it I could control Recording Volume using both Windows (Sound &amp; Audio Devices) and the Via HD Audio interface - but when I installed and ran Audacity I had to mute (tick) the Recording Volume in Windows to get it to record sound - and this
 was the workaround I used.</p>
<p>The other problem I encountered (soon after the Audacity expereince) was with out of sync sound&nbsp;using another product which I wrongly attributed&nbsp;to an Audio issue when it was&nbsp;something else that screwed&nbsp;some codecs&nbsp;so I could not play audio CD's in WMP.
 Sorted that now with installing K-lite.</p>
<p>In a nutshell - the Microsoft Fix-it tool seems to have &nbsp;made a Recording default device decision for&nbsp;me and muted the Windows Volume controls - permanently (!). No going back there then.</p>
<p>Thinking (as you do) when this volume control problem occure that I should update my on-board sound drivers I went off to Asus and - well thats a separate issue - I will have to tackle them about why they suggesting I download a hotfix (with serious implications)
 that I dont need.</p>
<p>I must add my thanks to you Jerry - which I do - and say one of the good things about these forums is to&nbsp;check things out with others more experienced before doing anything - and Microsoft ARE doing what they can to issue warnings to the unwary.</p>
<p>Hope Itseileen got it sorted but would have (perhaps) saved time/effort, etc if shared in here. Oh well.</p>
<p>Cheers Jerry.</p>
<p>p.s. I will post back in here anything "interesting" Asus say about how to install their VIA HD Audio driver update but don't hold your breath - have been reading lots of forum posts from frustrated Asus users&nbsp;about their drivers - and lack of them. Probably
 a common issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Stop windows from defragmenting my SSD&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an SSD and had disabled scheduled defragmentation.</p>
<p>Today I opened "drive optimization" only to find that scheduled defragmentation has re-enabled itself most likely after a windows update.</p>
<p>As a result of this my very expensive SSD has been defragmented God knows how may times!!!!</p>
<p>So not only is stupid windows not smart enough to automatically disable scheduled defragmentation on SSD drives, but even after I go through the trouble of disabling it I still have to watch over it like a hawk to make sure stupid microsoft doesnt mess it
 up again.</p>
<p>And when stupid microsoft ruins my drive will they pay for it? - NO!!!!</p>
<p>Please start wring your stupid software properly so it at the very least vaguely reflects its outrageous price!</p>

            Hi Bob I get this all the time when I teach the Windows 10 course and I will tell you what I tell my students.
<br />Yes, Windows does put all your drives even if they are SSD in the Weekly defrag schedule.  
<br />However, Windows will NOT defrag an SSD weekly, at the most it does this once a month.  And you are right that SSD drives don't get fragmented as often but they still can get fragmented.  So the defrag utility will first check to see if if requires a defrag before defraging.  It actually does that on all types of drives.
<br />And for SSD drives it doesn't do the same "traditional defrag" as with HDD drives.
<br />It actually uses a TRIM feature to defrag SSD drives.
<br />So you don't need to disable it all.  I have a laptop that has a SSD drive and it has been running Windows 10 for 2 years with defrag enabled it is absolutely fine.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Take care.

            According to this post by Microsoft's Scott Hanselman, it should not do any harm:
<br /><a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheRealAndCompleteStoryDoesWindowsDefragmentYourSSD.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheRealAndComplet...</a>
<br />
<br />It likely is enabled because you have the Volume Shadow service enabled and or you are using System Restore.

    <title>windows 8 update error 0xc000021a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rashj  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 8 update error 0xc000021a</h2>
                    I already have windows 8 installed in my laptop I bought about a month ago. The usual "update and shut down" option turned up and I clicked on it. It said "this app is preventing from shutting down". It always comes that way..so I clicked cancel this time.
 Nothing happened after that. All I got is a blank screen. It wouldn't shut down. After restarting, automatic repair started with the result "couldn't solve" and error "0xc000021a".&nbsp;<br />
All I can find online is people trying to upgrade from other OS. I tried restoring which dint finish even after like an hour. The last time I restored it finished in like 15 mins. I tried refreshing. It finished but it came back to the "advanced options" menu
 again. I'm trying to recover now using the DVDs which have the recovery media.&nbsp;<br />
What has happened to it? Is recovery the right option?

            <p><span>Hi RashJ,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>As I understand you are unable to boot your computer in normal mode after update error 0xc000021a
 and takes to advanced options.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check in safe mode,
</span><span>Use the Windows 8 DVD and try booting in safe mode.
</span></p>
<span><span>Windows</span></span><span> Startup Settings (including safe mode)</span>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the issue doesn’t persist in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using
 a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>To set the computer in clean boot, follow the steps from the link:

<p><b><span>NOTE:</span></b><span>
 make sure you perform “<b>Step 3</b>” to <b>
reset the computer to start as usual</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the above doesn’t work, you may try to boot from the Windows 8 DVD and try performing a
<b>Reset your PC </b>from Windows Recovery Environment.</span></p>
<p><span>To perform Resetting the PC on Windows 8 computer follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a.
<b>Insert the media</b> such as (USB or DVD) and restart your computer</span></p>
<p><span>b.
<b>Press F12</b> key (typically this is F12, but it can differ between computer manufacturers)and choose the drive that you inserted the installation media into.</span></p>
<p><span>Once the Windows Setup window appears, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click Next and select
<b>Repair your computer</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>d. You will then see a blue screen and an option to choose. Choose the option
<b>Troubleshoot</b> and select
<b>Reset your PC</b>.<br />
<b>Important:</b> While performing the resetting of the PC there are chances of losing the data on your system.</span></p>
<p><span>All of your personal files will be deleted and your settings will be reset. Any apps the came with
 your PC will be reinstalled, but all other apps will be removed.</span></p>
<p><span>Please perform these recommended steps, review the additional information provided and post back if
 you are still experience the issue. I will be glad to provide you with additional options available that you can utilize to get this resolved.</span></p>

    <title>How do I update my restore partition from Win 7 to 8&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jayrunk  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I update my restore partition from Win 7 to 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; In January 2013 I upgraded from Win 7 Home Premium to Win 8 Pro, via download. On 5/15/13 I attempted to boot up, only to discover my boot directory and system in general, had been completely corrupted. I was fortunately able to save all my files, but
 my OS was gonzo. I found&nbsp;many ignore commands sprinkled throughout my OS, which is why I believe it must have been a virus, and sadly I believe that virus to have come through the Windows store via a game update. Of course I have no way to prove that, but
 I digress.</p>
<p>&nbsp; My restore would not function, so I was forced to refresh back to the factory installed Win 7, and then wait through another 5 hour download to re-install Win 8. I have completed a backup on an external hard drive, but I don't know if that includes my
 OS. What I need to know is: How do I overwrite my Win 7 restore partition with a Win 8 restore, or is it even possible?
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Appreciate any help you can give me, and thanks for your time.</p>

 the complete hard disk and then you may install Windows 8 on it and then create a system image from its installation on a different partition on the same hard disk or on an external hard disk. To create a System Image of your Windows 8 PC, you may refer to
 the article: “How to create a system image to refresh your Windows 8 PC” from this link:</font></p>

    <title>Wired Xbox One Controller disconnects randomly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rippendeil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wired Xbox One Controller disconnects randomly</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Problem:</strong> Controller disconnects while wired with an USB-cable. Also disconnects wirelessly. This happens really randomly, sometimes it disconnects for a minute and nothing works, sometimes disconnects for a second. The next day it can work
 3 hours without problems. With a different Xbox and the same controller and cable everything works fine. I have the adapter attached and a headset connected. When the disconnect happens I will lose all control but I will be able to hear my party and the game
 sounds.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What I have tried, unsuccessfully:</strong></p>
<p>- Different cable and controller</p>
<p>- Removed all wireless devices near the console</p>
<p>- Removed metal/other objects that could disturb the signal</p>
<p>- Hard reset the console</p>
<p>- Removed the power cable before and after the hard reset</p>
<p>- Plugged the power brick directly into wall, not in a divider</p>
<p>- Reset the factory defaults</p>
<p>- Tried all the usb-ports</p>
<p>- Sent Xbox to a repair center, they probably did nothing to it though I clearly stated the problem</p>
<p>In conclusion I think this is probably a hardware problem but apparently at the support center they didn't find anything. Any advice and other techniques that I should try? Other users have reported the wireless problems but I couldn't find a thread about
 WIRED stuff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've had this happen on occasion.</p>
<p>When it does, although it reconnects on it's own, I remove the batteries for about 10 seconds, then put them back &amp; trun the controller on.</p>
<p>Seem's I'm good for the rest of my current session then.</p>

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click
<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick
<br />
reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.
<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,
<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model
<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate
<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -
<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party
<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device
<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for
<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after
<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually
<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers
<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as
<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check <br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows
<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be
<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then
<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />
