            Work.exe apparently is malware of some sort --&gt; <a href="http://www.threatexpert.com/files/work.exe.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.threatexpert.com/files/work.exe.html</a><br />
<br />
The good news is that your antivirus or antimalware protection software has detected and deleted or quarantined at least part of the malware (the file work.exe itself).&nbsp; The bad news is that the setting within Windows that tries to start the malware when Windows
 starts is still there.<br />
<br />
What is the name of your antivirus application?&nbsp; Is its subscription up to date?<br />
Do you have any additional antimalware application running?<br />
<br />
First, download, install, update, and run full scans with both of these free scanning tools:
<p><br />
<a href="http://malwarebytes.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes AntiMalware</a><br />
<a href="http://superantispyware.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SUPERAntiSpyware</a><br />
<br />
Don't run the scans simultaneously.&nbsp; They may take a while, so start one up and then go do a non-computer chore for a while.<br />
<br />
If the scans don't fix the problem (and they may not, because the actual malware file has already been dealt with), then download and run
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Autoruns</a>.&nbsp; Click the "Logon" tab and look in the "Image Path" column for the dll named in your error message.&nbsp; If it isn't shown in the Logon tab, click the "Everything" tab and use
 the File &gt; Search tool.&nbsp; An idiosyncrasy of the Autoruns search tool is that you have to move the selection line below the "found" item before you "Find Next."<br />
<br />
Once you find the line with the offending file, either "Delete" it or (if you want to be safer) uncheck it.&nbsp; The latter prevents the line from being executed but you can reactivate it later by replacing the checkmark.</p>

    <title>How to hide backup files&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timo123456  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to hide backup files&#63;</h2>
                    I believe that, somehow after changing some settings (which ones, I can't remember and can't seem to find), my folders display all backup copies of the files in the folder, each one of these has the name of: "backup of ___(name of file)__.wbk"<br />
<br />
How can I hide these backup files (like I believe they always had been up until I made that change)?<br />
<br />
It's Version 5.1, Service Pack 3, Windows 2007<br />

            <p>Hello Tim0123456,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would suggest trying to perform a system restore, to a point in time prior to the changes you made.&nbsp; Please let us know status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Restore:&nbsp; Windows XP</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306084</a></p>
<p>This article describes how to use the System Restore tool to return your computer to a previous state. System Restore takes "snapshots" of critical system files and some program files and registry settings and stores this information as restore points.

<h2>            Choose who will give permission, sudden content restriction</h2>
                    
<p><span>When I try to go on some of my games it comes up with "choose who will give permission" and then says that the game is rated above my content restrictions, ask a parent to sign in and try again. So I sign in with my parent account and try again but
 still it says choose who will give permission. So I go to my settings and then content restrictions, under account. It tells me that my access to content is appropriate up to age 15 and to change it I have to go to my parent accounts settings and go to family.
 So I switch back to my parent account and go to family and my account isn't there, so I try to add my account by selecting add to family however once I put in all my accounts details it says that "another user on this device uses this Microsoft account, so
 you can't add it here" . I have never had this issue before and it started yesterday, I have also tried hard resetting several times.</span></p>

            You can wait. The process above is if you don't want to wait and want it immediately. Sometimes, third party AVs do interfere with few people while installing feature upgrades. Hence, this instruction is to be on the safer side.

<h3> mbird4  say:</h3>
<h2>            dotnetfx35setup.exe install issue with the program trying to run vs_setup.MS_</h2>
                    I have gone through just about as many links and trouble shooting as I can stand.&nbsp; Downloaded the full installer package (dotnetfx35setup.exe) for .NET 3.5 and I am getting the same error.<br />
<br />
I am fully aware that the .MS_ file should actually be a .MSI (Microsoft Installer)a file but the question here is "Why is this package trying to run vs_setup.ms_ instead of vs_setup.msi?"<br />
<br />
Other questions are as follows:<br />
<br />
Tried to expand the .ms_ file into a .msi file then attempted to run that file to no avail.<br />
Tried to copy the .ms_ file to a file named .msi then attempt to run that file to no avail.<br />
<br />
This is happening on Windows Vista Ultimate edition.<br />
<br />
Any ideas or input would be VERY USEFUL.&nbsp; I have been working on this issue since 4:30 AM and it is now 10:18 AM.<br />
<br />

            This was apparently only being reported on the .NET KB951847 patch and had nothing to do with the .net Framework 3.5 for my system which is KB959209 which after uninstalling and re-installing has now removed the .net framework update from being needed
 in my Windows update history.

            Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I would try performing a repair upgrade; since this would downgrade the installation to build 16299.15. 
<br />
<br />This is only if you are running Windows 10 1709.

            Hello,
<br />This most probably is due to a faulty charger or a battery.

<p>It can't be the battery - it was fine.&nbsp; It was plugged in and I had left the lid open to my laptop&nbsp; because the computer said 'updating bla bla do not shut down' but when I went to get it later that day it would not go on without the AC adapter. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi js
<br />
<br />Why do you want video files form your website to open in a standalone Windows Media Player?
<br />
<br />If you are developing a website, you want your video to open on the web page in a HTML or Javascript player
<br />
<br />Websites need to be compliant with all platforms, including Windows, Mac OS, iOS Android, and Linux, Windows Media Player only exists in Windows . . .
<br />
<br />Do you truly want to force the video(s) to play in Windows Media Player?

                    I have Windows Media Player for Windows 7 and on the left side of the "library" page there is a list of different media sections (Library, Playlists, Music, Videos, Pictures, Recorded TV and Other Media). &nbsp;In the "other media" section a file title is listed
 as an MP3 title that I did not mean to be registered in my library. &nbsp;I've tried to delete the listing and there is no apparent file on my hard drive. &nbsp;<span>
</span>How do I get rid of this listing. &nbsp;I would even be willing to uninstall the WM Player, but cannot figure out how to do so.

<p>4.2 Reload WMP - Control Panel, Programs and Features, [left-hand side] Turn Windows features on or off, Media Features, set the Windows Media Player checkbox, Yes, OK, Restart the PC.</p>
<p>At the end of 4.2 you will effectively have a new installation of WMP.</p>
<p>Best of luck,</p>

<h2>            What the Hell is Going On&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've never had issues with the MP before, but today I'm having, well... let's call it
<em>severe</em> issues. First, everytime I get into a lobby, the host leaves (or gets booted) as soon as a 4th person enters -- this happened 6x in a row. On my 7th attempt, we get into a game, but the host left (or got booted) immediately after round 1 ended.
 I try again, but the host left (or got booted) in the pre-game lobby, but this time, instead of a load screen, my TV goes black forcing me to dashboard. When I loaded up the game again, I got the following message that I've never seen, nor heard of, in my
 6 years on XBL:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi72.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fi192%2fbostonmovie%2fDSC01704.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only have 1 console&nbsp;&amp; have never played on anyone else's Xbox other than my own. Finally, after successfully reloading the game yet again, I get the infamous Mass Effect "a sign in change has occured." So seriously, is this just me or what? WTF is going
 on here?</p>

<p>Just to be on the safe side I'd change the password to your account. That message in the pic usually means that someone has recovered your profile on to another console.</p>

<p>Apparently EA's side of things was compromised a little while ago, so if you used the same password to your EA account as you use to your gamertag, then you could be in trouble.</p>

<p>I have been having issues on and off lately too. &nbsp;EA servers have never been stable in any of their games. &nbsp;Also having major issues with the Scorpion. &nbsp;Sometimes it shoots right through the floor, walls, and the enemies. &nbsp;Thats a huge pain in the butt when
 it happens. </p>

<p>I've had the problem with the console freezing and forcing me to turn off / restart my console when I get killed in SP, or giving me the dirty disc error which is BS, my disc is spotless. It has been getting progressively worse (happening more and more frequently)
 for me.&nbsp; I got that same message as you, OP, either last night or the night before, can't remember which but it was when playing SP. From what I've gleaned from other posts, it seems to be a problem with EA's servers (there's a big surprise) and something
 about your profile being corrupted during syncing of data between the console and their servers. I guess they're supposed to be working on patching that as well, but don't really know much more than that.</p>

<p>I've only seen the "sign-in" error once and had it freeze up on me a few times, but it's always when the single player game is loading after I've died. &nbsp;I know that there is some sort of new DVD format that some of the newer titles have adopted and there
 have been some compatibility errors as a result, Arkham City sports this new disc format and has had the same freezing problem and, ironically, the "fix" for that game is to not sign in&nbsp;until after you've started the game so don't be too alarmed by the "sign-in"
 error, we're starting to see some cracks with the older technology not keeping up with the new...:-)</p>

<p>That error posted doesn't look like the normal EA server sign-in error. That is a dashboard notification which is why extra attention should be paid to it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Just about every time I turn on the game I get the in-game sign in error which IS a problem with the EA servers authentication. Likely it forces the game to restart as it also closes/flushes any connections or ip addresses that remain in their server cache.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>(EDIT: Just thought of something... are you saving to the cloud or did you recently change those settings?)</p>

<p>Because the same problem has come up with other games that aren't EA Games I'd lean towards it being an XBOX Live Profile "authentication" that is somehow related to the latest DVD format that's being targeted for use in future platforms, just uneducated
 speculation on my part, for what it's worth, try signing into XBOXLive AFTER the Main Menu appears, it works like a charm for Arkham City when the same problem came up in that game...:-)</p>

    <title>Bitlocker Reactivates Itself After Being Deactivated - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kcurry7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bitlocker Reactivates Itself After Being Deactivated</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Book 1, i5, 256GB SSD running Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For various reasons (which I will not disclose here), I try to keep bitlocker turned off. I deactivate it, make sure it completely deactivates and unencrypts the drive. I check it over a few hours to make sure it's completely turned off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I check it over a period of days to make sure it's still turned off. After a few days to a few months, it turns itself back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had gotten lax in checking it recently and didn't catch that it yet again turned itself on, until I got the bitlocker recovery screen this morning. Turned out, it turned itself back on in February (That's when the most recent key was created).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting very irritated by this turning itself back on constantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do NOT have any corporate or school accounts on this computer. I only have my standard outlook account on here, with my email program having the standard free non business accounts from yahoo, gmail, comcast, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked, double checked, and triple checked for viruses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done recoveries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done complete reinstalls from recovery flash drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has done complete reinstalls from regular Windows Pro flash drives because their Windows Surface flash drive wouldn't work for some reason (This is from when I discovered it was reactivating itself and I couldn't find the recovery key).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done reinstalls from a flash drive I created when Microsoft offered Windows 10 upgrades for free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time I have gone in and purposely deactivated bitlocker only to have it reactivate down the line for no obvious reason. I should not have to constantly deactivate bitlocker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY does it keep reactivating itself? It's a complete pain in the wazoo!</p>

<p>I'd like to say thank you for catching that scam post (not the above quote -&nbsp; the one that was removed) on behalf of myself and other Windows users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was going to report it before seeing the update with the warning and answer removal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember fellow Windows users, Microsoft employees will almost always direct you to an official Microsoft web page for contacting the company, never use letters in place of numbers (scammers do so to avoid filters and certain scripts meant to locate such
 scam answers), and they know how to properly format a.m. and p.m. You also will not see spelling and most grammer mistakes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway... Has anyone else had this issue with bitlocker?</p>

<p>I don't want to be rude, but please, do not try to answer the question unless you have read what I wrote and understand the issue. The answer provided does not in any way address the issue nor even come close. It doesn't even seem like the title of the thread
 was read. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not need help de-activating BitLocker. I have no problems de-activating BitLocker which I made clear in the original post to the thread. I am very thorough and make sure that it is completely de-activated and unencrypted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is BitLocker re-activates by itself days to months AFTER it's been de-activated and confirmed to be de-activated and the drive is completely un-encrypted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used the Graphic User Interface to De-Activate BitLocker.</p>
<p>I have used the Command Prompt to De-Activate BitLocker.</p>
<p>I have used PowerShell to De-Activate BitLocker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time, it re-activated, by itself, without any input from myself, seemingly around the time of the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I REALLY do not want to have to write a script and schedule it to run automatically on a daily or weekly basis to keep my drive unencrypted. The idea that I may have to do so for something that shouldn't even be an issue really irritates me.</p>

    <title>Xbox One Download Error &#61; INSANE USAGE SPIKE - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One Download Error &#61; INSANE USAGE SPIKE</h2>
                    
<p>So I'm up really late figuring out our sudden spike in data usage. We're at 187% of our data cap for the month and needless to say the overage charges are ridiculous.</p>
<p>How did we go from averaging 268 GB to going to 655 GB this month? At first I chalked it up to my wife binge watching Downton Abbey. Who knows, maybe it was because I was playing The Division for hours&nbsp;<span>on end. Okay, fine, we used a ton of data, I'll
 live with the consequences.</span></p>
<div>
<p>After we cut out all the streaming and gaming, the data kept piling up and up and up, so I turned off the router to stop the bleeding. With one day left on our cycle, I turned the router back on. Within 6 hours, we had used 70GB of data! WHAT THE?!?!</p>
<p>I hop on my router to check things out. No unknown users on the modem, everything looks good there. Bandwidth looks fine as well. Turn on the Xbox and the data absolutely SPIKES! A constant stream of about 50 Mbit/s.</p>
<p>After a bit of digging. One of the Games For Gold (Sunset Overdrive) downloads errored out at 23% but KEPT DOWNLOADING. It was in a perpetual state of download. It never reached 100% and just kept downloading and eating data. It was downloading at about
 a rate of 10GB/Hr. My cable provider said some days it ate up 170GB. I cancelled the download and now we're at 160 bit/s! Thank you jeebus!</p>
<p>What was supposed to be a "FREE" game has cost me $60 in overage fees. That's right, nothing in life is free.</p>

<p>I'm experiencing a similar situation downloading Sunset Overdrive, however I was stuck at 87% I had left it to install in the background thinking 13% of a twenty something Gig game shouldn't take much more data. but when I came back it was still at 87% and
 under network settings it shows (bandwidth history) 7GB/Hr. Unfortunately I only paused the download and this seemed to resolve the issue but then today I looked at the history and again its been downloading 7Gb for who knows how long as it only shows the
 past 12h, so canceled the download and have to look forward to some ISP data cap fees also :(</p>
<p>to give you an idea this month the only other game I downloaded on the xbox was Defence Grid 2 = 1.5Gb</p>
<p>and according to the xbox network stats I'm over 200Gb of bandwidth used this month already!</p>

<p>Well guys here 2 weeks later I figured out Live Gold and ivi.ru. I had a gray dynamic ip, online 2ip he defines as Novosibirsk, like all the rules, but thanks to the forum xbox man with the nickname Ngocphi I was able to understand the problem, but the fact
 is that sometimes my IP gray why suddenly bore my location or in the United States or in England, I learned in the history of your account (<a href="https://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com</a> here.) Along the way, communicating with
 FLeSH_56 (cool dude, do not let me stop searching for the truth), I came across the website http: / /pr-cy.ru/ buyout me that I have not Novosibirsk IP in general, and Novokuznetsk and what is left office, there I learned that my gray ip is listed in the black
 list for spam and advertising, and even what that crap. Screens do take off in my forum provider, they give me white ip for a few days. And now came home from work and popytvshis download Bad Company 2 and ivi.ru I did not get an error, all loaded swinging.</p>
<p>I note that many once told me that it cant play Bad company 2 and ivi.ru as Dark Sider 2 for gold rocking bang and all other programs. It turns out the game selectively checked by 80% against the ip download your place. That is, if I downloaded successfully
 Dark Sider 2 curves with their ip then the next time after removal I can not download.</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The first three partitions you create are
<font><span>primary</span> partitions. These can be used to start an operating system. If you want to create more than three partitions, the fourth partition is created as an extended partition. An extended partition is a way to get around a limit on the number
 of primary partitions a basic disk can have. An extended partition is a container that can hold one or more logical drives. Logical drives function like primary partitions except that they cannot be used to start an operating system.
<br />
<br />
</font></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Since you are able to view the partition from Linux Operating System, I would suggest you to take a backup of all the files from there.</strong> And then try these steps.<br />

<p>Why not just get rid of Norton? Next to McAfee it is probably the worst choice for security you could make. I recommend ESET NOD32 (commercial) or Avast Free, both of which work perfectly on Windows 7.</p>
<p>Otherwise, back up your data and do a clean install of Windows XP if you don't have a Windows.old folder.</p>

<p>You can't use System Restore to do that. The only to get XP back is to<br />
reinstall it cleanly.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong> what you want to do is very much a mistake, in my view.<br />
Windows7 is much better than Windows XP, and Norton is one of the two<br />
<strong>worst</strong> anti-virus programs available.</p>
<p>I would keep Windows 7 and use one of the following:</p>
<p>For an anti-virus program, I recommend eSet NOD32, if you are willing<br />
to pay for it. If you want a free anti-virus, I recommend one&nbsp; (only<br />
one; never install more than one) of the following three:</p>
<p>Avira<br />
Avast<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials</p>
<p>You also need anti-spyware software. I recommend that you download and<br />
install (both freeware) MalwareBytes AntiMalware <strong>and</strong><br />
SuperAntiSpyware. </p>

<p>Hi Miriam, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The amount of time your battery lasts will vary depending on the kinds of things you do with your Surface. Also, the batteries are not customer replaceable.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20443/windows-10-battery-saving-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> on how you can extend the battery life of your device.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are other steps you can perform that can help the battery of your Surface to last longer:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This will automatically install any missing driver and firmware updates for your device<span>.
</span><span><span>Click&nbsp;<span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here&nbsp;</a></strong></span>to learn how to run the toolkit.
 After running the toolkit, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4036280/surface-force-a-shut-down-and-restart-your-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">force shutdown and restart your device</a></strong> to ensure all updates are
 applied.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Check the Power mode slider</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Surface devices have a configurable Power mode that lets you choose between Best battery life and Best performance.</span><span> The setting is configured separately for when the device is plugged and when it is on battery. This allows a customer to
 have this set to Best performance while on PSU and for it to automatically change to a different setting, like Recommended, while on battery.
</span>The Power mode slider is found by clicking the battery icon on the Windows taskbar. For best battery life, the slider should be set to Recommended.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Run Power troubleshooter</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Open <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>Troubleshoot
</strong>&gt; <strong>Power </strong>and then select <strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Check Battery saver settings</strong><br />
<br />
Battery saver extends battery life by limiting background activity and push notifications. Open
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>Battery</strong>. Check if
<strong>Turn battery saver on automatically</strong> is enabled and that it is set to at least 20%. Also, check if
<strong>Lower screen brightness while in battery saver</strong> is also enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Check app usage</strong><br />
<br />
Unnecessarily running programs can cause slow system behavior and affect overall stability of your device.<br />
<br />
Open <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>System </strong>&gt; <strong>Battery </strong>
and then select <strong>See which apps are affecting your battery life</strong>.<br />
<br />
From <strong>Time period</strong>, select <strong>6 hours</strong>, <strong>24 hours</strong>, or
<strong>1 week</strong> depending on which period is closest. From <strong>Show</strong>, select
<strong>Apps with usage</strong>.<br />
<br />
Look for apps that have high battery consumption. If there are apps with high usage that you're not using, you should close them.<br />
<br />
If the apps start automatically, open <strong>Task Manager</strong> and then select the
<strong>Startup </strong>tab. You can disable any apps that you don’t need to start automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of the steps worked, <strong>reset your Surface</strong>. This will help you determine if the issue is software or hardware related.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>
<p>

<p>Hello Miriam, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for updating us. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps we've provided you are just ways on how to improve the battery life on your Surface Pro 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The estimated battery life may go<strong> up to 9 hours</strong> of video playback. However, it will still depend how fast the processor is, as it would require more power to operate. Screen brightness, power mode, apps running on background and external
 devices also have an effect on battery life. Can you tell us what is the average battery life you're getting from your device? What are the usual activities you do on your device?
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response. </p>

<h2>            Windows Backup on an BitLocker Encrypted Drive</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is my setup. I have Drive C: witch is a physical HDD and Drive D: witch is again a physical HDD. Both Drives are encrypted with BitLocker and I backup my C: drive to D: using Windows Backup. Although the Backup is scheduled every Sunday, it fails because
 the destination location, D: drive is locked. And I have to manually unlock the drive before the Backup begins</p>
<p>From Backup settings I am unable to find a way to provide the unlock password into Windows Backup.</p>
<p>So the question is: Is there a way that Windows Backup automatically unlock the drive before the backup and lock it back when it finishes ?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
