<h2>            XBLA and DLC on 2 Xbox Ones in Same Household</h2>
                    
<p>We got a Day One and it's in my sons' room, figured I'd move it back and forth as necessary. &nbsp;That's just not going to work out as well as I'd like so I'm going to buy a second Xbox One within the next few days. &nbsp;My XBL account is gold and on the Day One
 so the boys should have online gaming access with their silver accounts, no problem, without my having to be signed in on the Day One. &nbsp;I'm going to download my XBL account to the new Xbox One, probably put their silver accounts on there as well. &nbsp;Again, not
 a problem, as each account will only be signed in on one Xbox One at a time. &nbsp;But how's it going to work for XBLA games and DLC? &nbsp;I'm figuring I should buy and first download all digital content on the Day One under my account so that should give the boys
 use of it without me having to be signed in on the Day One. &nbsp;Then redownload the XBLA games and DLC I want to use on the new Xbox One. &nbsp;I'll have to be signed in on the second console to use the digital content, but, again, I don't have to also be signed in
 on my sons' Day One, the original download console, for them to use the content -- still only a single sign in required for my account. &nbsp;(Obviously we probably can't be playing the same digital games and/or DLC on both consoles at the same time, but that's
 not a problem, either.)</p>
<p>Does this make sense per XBL digital content policy? &nbsp;I don't mind buying the second Xbox One but I don't want to have to buy two copies of the same games and DLC for the same household. &nbsp;They don't have to be played on both consoles at the same time but
 I don't want to have to buy them twice to be played at all on both consoles.</p>

<p>If you make sure the one in their room is the HOME console, you should be fine. Any digital purchases can be accessed on any other system you sign into with your profile. Far as I'm aware, say you buy the digital version of BF4, they could be playing it
 on the HOME console while you play on the other. </p>

<p>Heya buddy,im not looking forward to having to call xbox support tomorrow as I have come across a few things now that just dont make any sense with the licences,the profiles permitted to use dlc across the family on the xb1,for one forza has some right issues
 with the dlc, forza vip pass downloaded to one of the family profiles, yet can only be used by that one and if you try to buy it for another the xb1 just says its already installed but unusable,im waiting till I can get on the phone with them to make sure
 its sorted and in minimum amount of time.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>And I completely relate , as it involves my kids too,but having the xb1 since launch its one of the many tweeks they will have to patch in time if there is no immediate fix,im hoping to get a new xb1 soon as next payday comes for exact same reason so thanks
 for starting this thread.</p>

            <p>Hiya, the VIP Pass for Forza 5 is not able to accessed by multiple accounts. The content is licensed to one profile, and you would need to repurchase that content for any other profile that wanted to be a "VIP."<br />.</p>
<p><strong>VIP Car Pack (and VIP Benefits)</strong><br /> The VIP Car Pack is included with the <a href="http://forums.forzamotorsport.net/forums/permalink/6260803/6129908/ShowThread.aspx#6129908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FM5 Limited Edition</a> package.&nbsp; This pack is available to standard version owners for digital purchase separately, via the Store from the console dashboard, and from within the game (selecting the VIP Rivals group).&nbsp; It includes 5 car models that are not available in the standard game installation or in any other pack.&nbsp; These cars do not come with designs or tuning setups as the Day One and Limited Edition cars do. The VIP car pack does not gift any cars to your garage (other than the note in Benefits); you will be able to rent the cars for Free Play and Multiplayer use but they must be bought with credits or tokens to add them to your My Cars collection or for use in Career or Rivals events.&nbsp; Note for family consoles: only the account that is logged in
<ul>
<li>1965 Shelby Cobra 427 S/C</li>
<li>1987 RUF CTR Yellowbird</li>
<li>1991 Mazda #55 787B</li>
<li>2011 Ford F150 SVT Raptor</li>

<p>This might not be relevant, but the Call of Duty DLC has always been per user not per console or per house, it can make it very expensive.</p>
<p>Just to add, if your wanting to play games together I think you will also nee to pay for two copies if you want them to be on seperate consoles, of course you can split screen</p>

<p>Thanks for all the answers. &nbsp;Yeah, I'm not too worried about some kinds of DLC like Call of Duty and VIP passes. &nbsp;I'm used to some or even most of those being single-user deals because the game's publisher decides that's how they're going to do it for DLC
 packs. &nbsp;Though, yeah, it is annoying, considering you're sharing those things with your kids, not your buddy who lives across the country. &nbsp;I'm more concerned if I buy like Crimson Dragon or Max: The Curse of the Brotherhood, that we'll be able to play it
 on both Xbox Ones, not necessarily at the same time, though that would be nice if we could. &nbsp;And also for playing together online I generally expect we have to have two copies. &nbsp; Sometimes we wait for price drops, or buy one and rent second.</p>
<p>The Xbox One in the boys' room is set as the HOME console, on my profile and their profiles. &nbsp;For safety's sake, I'll make all digital content purchases from that console and then redownload to the second console.</p>
<p>Anyway, my brand new second Xbox One is sitting by my desk right now so here in a bit I'll set it up and see how it goes. &nbsp;I'll report back, though I haven't bought anything digital yet so I may not be able to tell too much just yet. &nbsp;I wonder if the day-one
 edition DLC for Forza, Dead Rising 3 and Ryse will redownload to the new console and play on it. &nbsp;Kinect Fitness is tied to gold accounts so I should be able to snag that no problem. &nbsp;What about Killer Instinct? &nbsp;Was that a day-one thing only or is that a
 gold thing, too? &nbsp;I guess I'll find out.</p>

<p>Okay, everything went super smooth. &nbsp;Except for I didn't have the Kinect plugged all the way in when I first started up and after the Xbox One did the initial update just plugging the Kinect all the way in, it wasn't recognized, and I had to completely pull
 the power from the console to get the Kinect recognized. &nbsp;I was worried I somehow wound up with bad Kinect -- I've haven't heard of people with failed Kinects but you never know -- and I'd have to drive all the way back to the store and swap out for another
 Xbox One. &nbsp;But it was fine after all.</p>
<p>Anyway, as to putting my account on the Xbox One. &nbsp;Seamless, no problems, synced my game saves, did not force the new console as my HOME console, left the Day One as my HOME console, I successfully redownloaded and installed the Forza 5 Day One DLC which
 other accounts on this second Xbox One probably have to have me logged in to use, but that's no problem. &nbsp;You can't be logged into two Xbox Ones at the same time but I'll never have a situation where that's an issue. &nbsp;I'll make purchases and downloads on my
 HOME console, my sons' Day One edition, and because I'm XBL Gold and that's my HOME console and the console of original download, they'll have full access to online play and to any digital content -- provided it's not some of the aforementioned single-user
 DLC like some Call of Duty DLC and various season pass or premium pass programs; and with those it wouldn't matter anyway because it's single-user no matter who's logged in.</p>
<p>Also redownloaded Killer Instinct, no problem.</p>
<p>If you've got some money sunk into your home theater system and you haven't bothered setting up the TV features, let's do that, shall we? &nbsp;I can now definitely see what Microsoft is up to here. &nbsp;You don't have to have the most common components in the world
 for it to work. &nbsp;First of all, it really works, and it's not just a gee-whiz gadget tack on. &nbsp;Let me put it this way, my wife is tech-savvy enough, she as smartphone and a tablet, etc., but she is completely impervious to shiny neat-o-keen but pretty useless
 tech stuff, and she LOVES it. &nbsp;Tell it Xbox On and the TV and surround receiver all turn on and with the proper delay so nothing gets hung up missing the HDMI signal. &nbsp;The cable box integration is great, at least for Verizon FiOS. &nbsp;I don't watch much TV --
 I mean, I watch a couple shows I record every week and I watch a ton of movies, but just TV for TV's sake not so much. &nbsp;But my wife enjoys crashing after a long shift at work and watching National Geographic or Lifetime or Discovery or TLC, a large variety
 of channels that you have to remember the 3-digit HD channel numbers or jump into the cable box guide and scroll forever to get to the HD channels. &nbsp;Not anymore. &nbsp;You just say "Watch National Geographic," you're there. &nbsp;You can set it up so if there's an HD
 version of the channel it hides the SD version of that channel, so it always goes to the HD channel.</p>
<p>I also get the whole original content management thing. &nbsp;It just makes more sense with total system voice control not to have get up and put in a disc to play a game. &nbsp;That content management system came with drawbacks, of course, but I do understand why
 they tried it. &nbsp;You can still do pretty much the same thing if you buy all your games as digital but if you like to buy on disc you've got to go put that disc in. &nbsp;I prefer discs, probably because I'm old enough I'm just used to physical media, and without
 the binding to accounts content management, well I have to go put the disc in. &nbsp;Not a big deal but still once you have it all working together you can see why an account content-linking system does make a fair amount of sense.</p>
<p>In summary, keeping two Xbox Ones in your household is just not a problem. &nbsp;It's essentially transparent, except you should buy and first download content on your HOME console, and when you start a game, the sync process will take a little bit longer since
 it will probably have more data to sync. &nbsp;But you can play on either one, don't have to manually copy data from the cloud. &nbsp;Switching consoles every day or once a month, like playing on your usual console. &nbsp;It's a very, very good implementation and they're
 still early into it.</p>
<p>As for the current console generation, we have a WiiU, a PS4 and now the two Xbox Ones. &nbsp;I'm not much of a console warrior, don't get into the squabbles about what's "better." &nbsp;I like games and any console maker that can provide me some good games well,
 sooner or later, I'm in. &nbsp;But if Microsoft is aiming to be the center of your home entertainment world with the Xbox One, it's the only current generation console even closing to being that. &nbsp;And the first-party launch titles are great, too. &nbsp;Some will appeal
 more than others based on individual tastes but they all have things to recommend them.</p>
<p>Sorry I've gone on so long but there's a lot of wow factor when you set everything up properly and especially going through the process of maintaining two Xbox Ones in the same household, how just flat easy and painless it is.

    <title>Windows 8.1 wakes up but no monitor display - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronpaull  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 wakes up but no monitor display</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Win 8.1 Pro 64bit on my newly built computer: Asus Sabertooth 990FX R2.0 motherboard with updated drivers, AMD FX 8350 CPU, 16Gb Coarsair ram, EVGA GeForce GTX 770 graphics card with updated drivers.</p>
<p>The computer goes to sleep when it should but upon wake up does not display anything on the screen. You can hear everything working the way it should upon wake up, but no display. I can hit the 'Reset' button and it will then reboot and display properly.</p>
<p>I have seen in the forums that this is a big problem and there are many suggested fixes. I have attempted disabling the USBs, reinstalling the graphics card, checking for motherboard and graphics card driver updates - all to no avail.</p>
<p>This is a Windows 8.1, a Microsoft problem - are they going to fix it! IS there a fix now? Or do I have to live with this?</p>
<p>I hope I have as good a luck with this question as I did the last. This seems like the place to come for help. I attempted getting help directly from Microsoft and they passed the buck stating it was the graphics card not them.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Ron</p>

<p>Sounds like it could be treating your monitor as a secondary display.&nbsp; In that case try pretending that you can see the primary display in order to switch it.&nbsp; E.g. press Win-P, CursorUp, Enter.&nbsp; Watch (and listen) for changes...</p>

<p>I do have another monitor. Have never had experience setting up two before so will have to go figure that out. I have the directions in my EVGA materials so can find it pretty easy.</p>
<p>Finding the power supply for the other monitor however might take a few days. Will check back once I have tried this.</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion.</p>

                    I got a SanDisk recovery error code OXC 0000098 with file :boot\BCD. How do I make my SanDisk install usable again? The error message is the boot configuration data file doesn't contain valid information for aa operating system.&nbsp; You'll need to use recovery
 tools. if you don't have any installation media (like a disc or USB device), contact your PC administrator or PC/Device manufacturer,

</p><p>My Windows 8.1 App Store Is&nbsp;Not Working This has been going on for months! I can't update any apps and the error message I get is "We weren't able to connect the store. This might have happened because of a server problem or the network connection timed
 out. Please wait a few minutes and try again ERROR CODE: 0x80070002" I have pressed Try Again countless times and my internet is perfect and when I do the trouble shooter it says, Windows Store Configuration may be damaged and the status is always detected,
 same goes for Display driver adapters might be out of date and the status is detected always never fixed and I updated my computer today and it still doesn't work. I ALWAYS check for updates so this doesn't happen.&nbsp; Can anyone help me get my store running
 again? I have a HP Pavillion Windows 8.1 laptop. </p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>It could be difficult when things don't work the way it should be on your computer. It’s unfortunate that you are unable to connect to Windows Store. Appreciate your efforts which you have put in
 in order to fix this issue. This issue may occur if Windows Store cache is corrupt or if the app settings are incorrect. It can also happen if any third party security program installed the computer that blocks the&nbsp;store from accessing the Internet connection.
 Let’s try to narrow down to see what exactly is causing this issue and try to fix it.</span></span></p>

    <title>Converting offline account to Live account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nytwyng  say:</h3>
<h2>            Converting offline account to Live account</h2>
                    
<p>Our son's had an offline account on our 360 for the couple of years we've had the console.&nbsp; For his birthday earlier this week, we decided to allow him to "graduate" to an Xbox Live account, to make use of the multiplayer aspect of some of his games.&nbsp; We
 followed the instructions, choosing "Join Xbox Live" from his account, but, on entering his age, hit a roadblock because he's under 18.&nbsp; Fair enough security measure.&nbsp; So, I followed the steps that I found online to create a child account for him, went through
 the verification of an adult account, but it created a new gamertag for him.&nbsp; No big deal...we can go in and change it later.&nbsp; So, I went back to the 360, logged into his offline account, chose "Join Xbox live"...and got an error that the email address was
 already associated with an Xbox Live account.</p>
<p>Tried changing the offline gamertag to the new Live one...same error.&nbsp; Tried the steps I found in the forums for transferring gamertags to a different Microsoft account...got a message that it "couldn't be done at this time."</p>
<p>I've contacted chat support, and was informed that there was nothing they could do.&nbsp; They recommended posting on the forums so that a Moderator could contact me by PM to see if there's anything they can do regarding the inability to connect the offline account
 to the new Live account...that it would be up to them.</p>
<p>So, any assistance that a Mod could provide would be appreciated.&nbsp; The alternative of saying that he'll have to lose existing game history and saved games just to get multiplayer access isn't an ideal one.</p>

<p>Nytwyng - It's uncanny that you posted this. &nbsp;My wife and I did the same thing with our son this Christmas. &nbsp;And, much like you, we're coming up against the same issues with upgrading his offline account with an Xbox Live account. &nbsp;I look forward to hearing
 what the Mods say as well, as I would hate to deliver the news to my son that he'll have to replay his previous achievements over again (not a conversation I'd prefer to have, as I think you wouldn't either). &nbsp;Good luck!</p>

<p>As of now, no PM's from a mod, and as can clearly be seen, no replies here in the thread.</p>
<p>While I understand and appreciate the security measures Microsoft has put into place to prevent kids from getting access to Xbox Live content without parental approval, the process for creating a child account AND verifying parental approval is neither customer-friendly,
 intuitive, nor convenient. &nbsp;Having to jump between console, computer and back, just to upgrade an offline account to Live is cumbersome, and getting those two accounts (offline and Live) synced should not be this difficult.</p>

<p>Mine hasn't stopped playing. &nbsp;He's just advancing further and further in games with his offline account...progress that will be lost should we have to use the unnecessary scorched earth approach of him starting all games over again with the unrelated Live
 account.</p>
<p>Interesting side-note: &nbsp;It appears that the suggestion made by a community ambassador and my reply to it are missing from the thread. &nbsp;At the very least, they're not visible from the phone I'm using to make this post.</p>
<p>Still no sign of contact from a mod, though. &nbsp;And the transcript of the chat that I requested still hasn't shown up in my email. &nbsp;I'd love to be able to verify that I understood the chat agent's instructions properly. &nbsp;Supposed to be an automated system
 to email the transcript once the chat is complete if you click that button during the chat. &nbsp;I did. &nbsp;That was Saturday. &nbsp;This is Wednesday. &nbsp;Still no transcript. &nbsp;Thinking him being able to do something like, I dunno, play with his friends is an unreasonable
 expectation?</p>

<p>Because you created the new account on the website, you would need to download the gamertag to the console in order to use it -
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../profile-move-delete</a> &nbsp;However, this will be a completely new account from his offline account and your son would still have to start over on the new account.

<p>I am also having the same problem. &nbsp;My daughter has had an offline profile for a year and we decided to make it a live account. We chose "Join Xbox Live" from her account on the Xbox, but since she is under 18 I had to follow the steps to create a child
 account for her on the computer and went through the verification of an adult account and it created a new gamertag for her. From the Xbox, I logged into her offline account, chose "Join Xbox live"...and got an error that the email address was already associated
 with an Xbox Live account. &nbsp;How do I turn her offline account into an under 18 live account so she doesn’t lose her game progress?</p>

<p>I'm having the same issue. &nbsp;My son has an xbox 360 with an offline profile. &nbsp;I'm trying to convert that to a live account. &nbsp;I tried signing up for the live account from the console and was unable to continue because of the age restriction. &nbsp;So I went online
 and eventually figured out how to create a child live account (an unnecessarily cumbersome process). &nbsp;I then logged back into the console with my son's profile and tried to sign in to the live account. &nbsp;That just takes me back to the profiles screen. &nbsp;So I
 logged into the profile again and tried to sign up for xbox live. &nbsp;I was able to complete the sign up process but received an error about the email address being associated with an existing account. &nbsp;So, does anyone know the exact steps I need to follow to
 convert my under-13 son's offline profile to an xbox live profile. &nbsp;This really shouldn't be so difficult.</p>

<p>Well, Smwunches, there's no way TO create a child account from the console. &nbsp;Any attempt to do so directs you to the web site, as we've seen not only from my story, but others in the thread. &nbsp;As for the mods' abilities, one of two situations then exists--</p>
<p>1: The chat support rep knew he couldn't do anything about it and, rather than giving me a firm answer, gave me bogus &nbsp;information to get me off his chat line and onto a wild goose chase.</p>
<p>2: I misunderstood the instructions...a possibility, and one I could verify if the chat transcript I requested EIGHT DAYS AGO had ever arrived.</p>
<p>Either way, that's poor service.</p>
<p>This shouldn't be such a difficult process as, as we can see, there are others attempting to do the very same thing for the very same reasons. &nbsp;Seems like a poor model for customer retention. &nbsp;With the latest generation of consoles now on shelves, if our
 kids will be forced to start from scratch simply to access online multiplayer capabilities, choosing a new console comes down to the best option for the least money...there's less incentive to remain loyal to the Xbox platform.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>There are 2 files shown under KB4093118 (windows 7 x64) in the Microsoft Update catalog site</p>
<p>I have downloaded both the files, but when I&nbsp;try to run&nbsp;either of them, I am presented with a message asking me to&nbsp;choose&nbsp;the program&nbsp;to open the file.</p>

<p>Since you've already downloaded both, run the<strong> .exe</strong> file instead of
<strong>.msu</strong>. It acts as an installer of a KB update. Make sure that you don't relocate those files to another folder when you execute the installer.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply</p>
<p>I noticed that the downloaded file extensions were _msu and&nbsp; _exe. Presumably changed during the download process?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I renamed&nbsp; _msu to&nbsp; .msu</p>
<p>Disabled MS security essentials (as advised)</p>
<p>Ran the .msu update.&nbsp; This proessed for a while, but then failed.</p>

            I've been having this issue for sometime. I've opened a case several months ago that cost us $499 Microsoft Support when you do this Microsoft only wants to resolve the problem for one workstation...LOL. I've opened another case at a cost of $499 and was
 told I needed to reinstall the OS....LOL. When I refused they have pasted on to someone else who is trying to get me to do the same thing. It is crazy to think that there something messed up with workstations when all other updates install with no issues but
 the rollup will not. I've tried all your recommendation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for your update.</p>
<p>Like you, I think it's&nbsp;absolutely crazy that Microsoft are suggesting that re-installing Windows is an acceptable solution to this issue</p>
<p>All Windows updates are successful, apart from the Monthly&nbsp;Quarterly Roundup Updates</p>
<p>Why would you need to re-install Windows to address this particular issue?</p>
<p>Very disappointed with Windows support for this issue!!!!</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestion I did try this and it did not resolve the issue I guess I am just going to Use CS5 White Rabbit which works perfectly although I cannot get Adobe bridge to open either from CS5 or stand alone quite disappointing as I used the
 bridge all the time in photoshop.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your suggestion however I have bought another laptop and gone back to using windows 7 professional
</p>
<p>where I have no problems running CS 5 or CS 6 and other programs that did not work well on Windows 10 maybe in the future Windows 10 will become as reliable as win 7 till then I will stick with 7.</p>
<p>Windows 10 works OK as a basic platform but I believe it still needs a lot of work.</p>

    <title>Anyone remember or played the Xbox 360 indie game series Decay&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jane doe xbl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Anyone remember or played the Xbox 360 indie game series Decay&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Like the title says, has anyone ever remember the Decay series? Or played it? I did. And it was a darn good game, one of the best indie games I ever played.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Info for those who haven't played, or never heard of it: "Decay" was a 4 part game series, found in the indie games section of the Xbox 360 marketplace. It was a "point and click" game with horror elements, and had some puzzles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game itself is gone, but the memories I have playing it are still here. The purpose of this post is all about remembering the game, for those who did play it. The following is my experience with the game, years ago on my old Xbox account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first started playing it, I was definitely liking the game. I hadn't really played many horror games yet, plus I was still kind of a chicken when it came to them. I was drawn into Decay's story, as it was strange. I had to find out the reason for
 all the strange happenings in the game, why they were happening. Some of the puzzles were fun too.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Bottom line, is that I loved the series.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when I find out that the indie games were taken off the store, before I had a chance to buy them again on my new account? I was crushed. Heartbroken, even. The fact that I could never play Decay again? It devastated me.</p>

</p><p>I know it's kind of silly to be upset over a game like this, but I can't help it. There's a hole in my heart (not literally!) that just won't seem to mend, because the game is gone.</p>
<p>

<p>It's just too bad that it was taken down with all the other indie games. :( But the sequel is available on the Xbox One, so it's not all bad! The original is better in my opinion, but "Decay: The Mare" is still pretty good.</p>

                    We just bought an HP computer with windows 7. We are trying to connect to the internet wirelessly. It gives us the option to set&nbsp;&nbsp;up a new wireless network. We selected it. It then pops up with a bubble that says broadband connection. Well we don't need
 broadband we need wireless. Why is the computer not giving me the wrieless option with the broadband option? How do i find the wireless option to set up a new network?

    <title>Cpu usage spikes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cataliniancu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cpu usage spikes</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Hello ! My PC specs are the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - AMD Ryzen 1600x &nbsp;&nbsp; CPU</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Nvidia Gtx 1060 6gb GPU</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - 8 GB DDR4 RAM ( 2400 MHz)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Asus B350 Prime Plus Motherboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Sometimes I get those weird spikes ( they come and go ) lasting for 1-2 seconds of 100% CPU utilization. In idle state the CPU utilization stays between 5-10% ( up to 20% if im browsing the internet and having programs like Steam, Discord etc running in
 background), but when the spike comes I can see how the pc freezes for 1 second ( typical lag freeze) and how the cpu utilization rizes to 100% CPU then jumps back down to under 20%. I have waited with taskmanager such a spike and discovered that when it happens,
 System NT Kernel &amp; System is the one process that its sudently eating up all the CPU resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I tried updating all the drivers and im still having the problem. Here is a Windows Performance Record
<a href="https://1drv.ms/u/s!AgeoTO-vk3Dkgzoq-P-IyblO-yZ6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> where I left the pc running for 45 minutes and I saw atleast 1 spike happening in those 45 minutes ( I kept going away from the computer and coming back).</p>

<h2>            Problems with Mail, Calendar &#38; People</h2>
                    I have a problem with Mail, Calendar &amp; People. Windows Store says that i have them installed, but i do not see them. Instead, I see a install called "Microsoft.WindowsLive.People" in the installed apps section of the start screen. When I click it, it says
 "This app can't open" and provides an option to go to the Windows Store. Windows Store then says that "This app needs to be repaired", and tries to repair it. A "Mail, Calendar &amp; People was installed" notification pops up, but i cannot find any of the three
 apps. I have found that I can launch the Mail app by clicking that notification, and I can launch People through the Settings app(the account picture menu). However, it is called "Microsoft.WIndowsLive.People" in that menu. In addition, I cannot see the Mail
 app i launch through the notification in the win+tab app switcher. I can only get to it from alt+tab.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue still persists try to create new user account.
</span><span>If you create new user account nothing will be lost, it is only the thing that it would be in the other user account which you are using right now. However creating new user account is a diagnostic step, if everything works
 fine in new user account we can easily move the files and programs to new user account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, for now please try to create new Microsoft user account as an administrator from the link provided below. Make sure you should follow the steps mentioned under

</p><p><span>Thank you for the update on the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If after coating new Microsoft account issue persists you may need to uninstall it and reinstall it from the Store app.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can re-install the <strong>Mail,Calendar, People and Messaging&nbsp;App </strong>

<p><strong><span>Important</span></strong><span>:- Uninstalling "<strong>Mail, People and Messaging&nbsp;</strong>" app results in loss of the Apps and the respective data in the Apps,

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>

<ul>
<li>Press the <strong>Window key + R </strong>to open <strong>run </strong>box.</li><li>Type <strong>services.msc</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Double-click <strong>AppX Deployment service.</strong> </li></ul>
<p>If you receive a Configuration Manager message, click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>In the <strong>Startup Type</strong> list, click <strong>Automatic</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Make sure the <strong>status </strong>should be <strong>running.</strong></li><li>Close <strong>Services</strong>.</li><li><strong>Restart </strong>the computer and check the status.</li></ul>

            It was a service pack upgrade. Now the screen locks every four or five minutes as if it is going in to lock mode after a period of inactivity. Streaming Netflix is not a period of inactivity. The password is entered at the main Windows start-up screen.
 It has nothing to do with Netflix. Also ... it happens when watching iTunes movies as well. It is the same screen that appears when I turn on the computer in the morning.

<h2>            Synaptics Touchpad PS&#47;2 Port problems in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP Pavilion dv6-2150us. The touchpad works and so do the left and right buttons, but the scrolling and "one click" features no longer work. Windows 10 says I have the most up to date driver. 19.0.12.95</p>
<p>
</p><p>The articles I've read suggest that older drivers might work, but Windows 10 continues to default to the newest driver. Sorry, I'm not a very computer savvy, so should I just wait until there is another driver update? Thanks.</p>

            <p>The problem is that The Synaptics touch pad in the HP Stream 11 works with Win 8.1, but when I installed Win 10, the touch pad doesn't two finger scroll. When used with a usb mouse, Win 10 is wonderful, but a laptop should not need a mouse when it's on your
 lap, should it? &nbsp;Tell the truth...is there a fix coming for this problem or am I (and hundreds of other frustrated Win 10 wanna-users) out of luck?</p>

            Just re-install them.&nbsp; You can use your apps on up to 81 different computers/devices (a play on the Windows 8.1 name, but basically infinite).&nbsp; But to do that, you have to install them separately, you can't just transfer the files in other words.

    <title>Hp Mini moving extreamly slow. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Hp Mini moving extreamly slow.</h2>
                    I have an hp mini running windows 7 ultimate with a 32 bit operating system which I purchased in October of 2010. Since early last year it has been extremely slow and I can't seem to figure out why. I have very few programs and I'm only using 36.9 GB out
 of the 216 GB the device holds. It became so overwhelming that in January of this year I decided to return it to factory condition. This worked perfectly but only for a while. I defragment my disk and free up disk space regularly and I've even purchased CleanMyPc
 Registry Cleaner, but with no success. Is there any tool I can download from the Internet that doesn't cost much and will definitely solve this issue for good, or anything else you suggest?

<p>Have you additional toolbars installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Possibly an addon is creating the problem</p>

<p><span>In Windows 7 use Ctrl+Shift+Esc rather than Ctrl+Alt+Del. It gets you to Task Manager quicker. When the computer locks select Task Manager, the Performance tab, Resource
 Monitor, and Memory tab. What are the figures for Hardware Reserved, In Use, Modified, Standby and Free?</span></p>
<p><span>How much RAM is installed?</span></p>
<p>Registry cleaners provide negligible benefits and&nbsp;have the potential to create insoluble system errors that can only be resolved by reinstalling Windows and all that entails.&nbsp;</p>

In addition to Gerry's suggestions,&nbsp; do you have McAfee SiteAdvisor installed with Google Chrome.&nbsp; It is known for sluggish page load.&nbsp; Disable if applicable and try browsing.</p>
