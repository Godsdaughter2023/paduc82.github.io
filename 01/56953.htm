<p><strong><span>Hi Prasad_cvs,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1. What error message do you get in device manager?</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>2. At what stage of installation do you get the error message?<br />
3. Do you get any kind of error code?<br />
4. Which option do you choose when selecting the adapter through options?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may use the manual method as explained in the below provided steps and check if this helps -</span></span></p>

 Menu Orb.</span></strong>In the search box type&nbsp; <strong><span>hdwwiz</span></strong> and then click the&nbsp;<strong><span>hdwwize.exe</span></strong>
 program link.<br />
b. Now the Add Hardware wizard should be open. Click&nbsp; <strong>n<strong><span>ext</span></strong></strong> through the first page, and then on the second select&nbsp;<strong><span>install
 the hardware that I manually select from a list (Advanced)</span></strong>.&nbsp; Click &nbsp;<strong>n<strong><span>ext</span></strong></strong> to continue.</span></span></p>
<p><em><span>c. Scroll down</span></em><span><span>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Has anyone really found a solutiont to this. I'm looking at Windows Live and it looks like all it does it provide the ability to swicth identities on the fly when you send / reply to an email. It doesn't really provide that separation that OE's identities
 did.</p>
<p>And looking at other services, I haven't found one yet that offers this. All of the mail providers seem to think it's a great idea to have all of your email from multiple accounts in one place. Well, that doesn't work so well for someone managing several
 different businesses.</p>
<p>Hope someone else has found what many of us are apparently still looking for.</p>

<p>let me clarify something. I did look at the wmid feature, but that looks like a 3rd party and the webiste for that product doesn't provide any contact information nor does it say anything about wmid working on windows 7. The "what to do with windows 7" page
 actually suggests the following options:&nbsp; 1) don't upgrade to windows 7&nbsp;&nbsp; 2) run Windows 7 in xp mode.</p>

<p>Damn it <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Haze</span>!</p>
<p>I knew the game would flop with making a PS3 only move, but why'd it have to take out any chance of playing Timesplitters on the 360.</p>
<p>Free Radical had so much potential &amp; one game knocked everything off track.</p>
<p>Any Timesplitters gamers out there?</p>
<p>I'm still hoping for a XBLA version of 1 &amp; 2, at least.</p>

<p>We are not getting more Timesplitters because the game isn't that popular. Not nearly enough people care about the series to keep it going. It's simple as that. Haze(which WAS terrible) has nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>I recall being on these forums back before its release &amp; some little nub went on a whole tirade about how HAZE will 'beat' anything on the Xbox because it was exclusive to PS3.&nbsp; One of those kids I'd love to know how much he is playing Haze at this point.
 I wasn't sure why Free Radical would not try to create a game for the Xbox gamers, but it could of been better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just another failure from Sony's camp.</p>

<p>oh, uh, what makes you think I listened?&nbsp; It was just some nitwit on the xbox forums bragging about PS3 exclusives, something that still happens today.&nbsp; Although Haze is not a renowned exclusive in the library of PS3, it was before release.&nbsp; If it were an
 amazing game it could of spun many sequels or possibly helped Free Radical maintain to create more Timesplitters titles.</p>
<p>Considering Haze's general consensus is that it is below par, I couldn't help but wonder what if they didn't continue on that project &amp; went a different route.&nbsp; With a Multiplatform release of Timesplitters 4 in 2007-2008, Free Radical could have become
 very viable in the gaming industry.&nbsp; If it were a great game of course.</p>

    <title>WINDOWS 10 UPGRADE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikelobianco  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS 10 UPGRADE</h2>
                    I want to upgrade form windows 7 to 10. The PC tells me when I try the graphics controller won't support 10. The controller is a Intel 82865G. Is there a up date for this controller or am I wasting my time?

            <p>That's probably a question best sent to either Intel, or even better to the company that makes that model of computer (they are the ones that are ultimately responsible for the driver, even if the controller itself was made by Intel).&nbsp;</p>

Can you share the model of your computer?</p>

            Its a Dell Dimension 3000 but has had some up grades a while back. I think its time for a new computer. I contacted Intel support for a driver update but they said the driver I have has no more support or updates available. I will try calling Dell. Thanks

            <p>This confirms GPU was last supported for XP:&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/graphics-drivers/000005526.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Supported Operating Systems for Intel® Graphics Products</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was even Windows 7 supported then I'd say you could save a backup image and try it, or shrink C to test install as a Dual Boot.&nbsp; I've been able to get most GPU's rejected by GWX app to work for Windows 10 (just not for heavy gaming).&nbsp; But the last
 Support for that GPU is XP so it crosses over from possible to doubtful.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet if you wanted to try a test install, you could try installing the GPU driver in
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Compatibility Mode</a> to see what kind of resolution you get, whether Sleep and Hibernate work.&nbsp; More likely you'd get stuck with a stock driver that doesn't support anything and has poor resolution.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
And that's just the GPU.&nbsp; The rest of the hardware must be old too?&nbsp; If so I'd think about buying a new PC which comes with Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before offering guidance, I ought to point out that spending any money or expending any effort on upgrading your computer to Windows 10 is an act of blind faith.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>Until you do the upgrade &amp; start doing all your normal computer tasks, you will not know if its performance is consistent &amp; acceptable.</li><li>Until you do the upgrade &amp; start doing all your normal computer tasks, you will not know if its annoying habits are acceptable to you [it does not really have more annoying habits than Windows 7, they are just different annoying habits].</li><li>Even after you do the upgrade, you will not know if your computer will last long enough to make the investment in money &amp; grey hairs worthwhile.</li><li>Consider investing that money &amp; those grey hairs in getting,&nbsp;or preparing to get, a replacement computer.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; Watch&nbsp;a new computer do some of your common tasks so you can see the improved performance you might get from buying a new computer instead of buying a new OS for your old one.&nbsp; Just for example,
</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern WiFi &amp; Ethernet cards operate at far higher speeds than were possible&nbsp;a few years ago&nbsp;- you are likely to be astounded by the difference in speed.</li><li>Modern computers are also likely to astound you with their processing speed.&nbsp; I do not know what you use your computer for but I do some minor video editing and what takes my old computer a few minutes is done in a few seconds by a modern computer.&nbsp; This
 time comparison would also apply to other processor-intensive tasks.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; Search the <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Dell user forums</a> for reports by users who have installed Windows 10 on&nbsp;your computer model**.&nbsp; In addition, search this forum for your computer model in case anyone has reported useful information about installing &amp; using&nbsp;Windows 10 on it [search both the
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Windows 7</span></a>&nbsp;&amp; the
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Windows 10</span></a> sections of this forum].&nbsp; You could also search the internet generally but that would take a long time and might get you nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3&nbsp; If your software is also old then search the publisher's support site &amp; any user forums for reports from users who have used your version with Windows 10.&nbsp; Upgrading / replacing your software also adds to the money, time &amp;&nbsp;effort you need to invest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4&nbsp; Investigate hardware drivers - it may not be the dead-end that it appears to be.&nbsp; See
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/96eddd4e-4b0a-46f1-8c71-96ff380ad272?threadId=03aef37a-f353-4449-89b4-37f417c8a102">
Where to get hardware drivers</a>&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>5&nbsp; Run the upgrade checker and consider the discussion of compatibility in <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-windows_install/windows-7-81-10-compatibility-testing-for-windows/310e06a4-b181-45ec-ae6d-ee93a1632932">
Windows 7, 8.1, 10 compatibility testing for Windows XP, Vista - WiKi</a>&nbsp; Even though the Wiki was written for older OSs, it contains useful information about Windows 7 compatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6&nbsp; Do not start an upgrade until you have </p>
<ul>
<li>made a system image </li><li>checked your Windows 7 installation disk can still boot the computer</li><li>checked that you&nbsp;can read&nbsp;your Windows 7 Certificate of authenticity's product key correctly</li><li>backed up all your own files, any downloaded application installation files &amp; any other application product keys</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>7&nbsp; Install Windows 10 for testing before spending money.&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>You can make your own installation disk.&nbsp; &nbsp;I suggest that 32 bit Windows&nbsp;10 Home is&nbsp;an appropriate choice. &nbsp;See the&nbsp;procedural&nbsp;guide &amp; links in
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 app.</li><li>Install your most demanding applications &amp; hardware and use them&nbsp;- prove that the expected benefits are real &amp; that the anticipated shortcomings are acceptable</li><li>Be ready to accept defeat and to console yourself with the fact that your Windows 7 computer will remain supported &amp; hence useable online until Tuesday 14th January 2020.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If it is any encouragement, I have successfully installed &amp; used Windows 10 on an eleven year old Dell Inspiron 9300** [originally XP] &amp; a six year old Dell Inspiron 1545 [originally Windows 7].&nbsp; &nbsp;Whilst I succeeded in these endeavours, it took a&nbsp;fair amount&nbsp;of
 experimenting &amp; backtracking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>** <em>The only shortcomings I have found on the Dell Inspiron 9300 are that the PowerCfg utility -BatteryReport command does not work and Task scheduler cannot wake the computer from sleep or from hibernation [even with the correct settings made].&nbsp; I can
 live with this but you might find shortcomings that render the computer useless for your purposes.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have been&nbsp;in contact in the Dell user forums with another Dell Inspiron 9300 user who, after a successful test installation of Windows 7,&nbsp;has also upgraded
 from XP to Windows 10 but has had terrible trouble playing videos on his one [I have no such problems] even though we have the same model with, apparently,&nbsp;the same specs and we both use the same drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, experiences vary</em><em>.&nbsp; I no longer have
 any problems running Windows 10 on my Inspiron 1545.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck,</p>

    <title>How Do I Do The Equivalent Of Making Subst Mapping Permanent&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saberman  say:</h3>
<h2>            How Do I Do The Equivalent Of Making Subst Mapping Permanent&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8.1 Pro</p>
<p>Surface Pro 2</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to replace laptops with Surface Pro 2.&nbsp; The laptops normally have C; and a 407 GB&nbsp;V: partions which the applications expect.&nbsp; Unfortunately, The C: partition of my Surface Pro 2 cannot be shrunk lower than 241 GB which does not leave enough room
 for a 407 GB V: partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I could get around the problem by creating a folder C:\V and using Subst V: C:\V</p>
<p>This works if I enter the Subst command after&nbsp;each login.&nbsp; It does not persist across logins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried using a .reg file:<br />
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\DOS Devices]<br />
"V:"="\\?\\C:\\V"</p>
<p>Note: The double back slashes become single ones in the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This created a V: drive but with a ?.&nbsp; When I tried to open it I got: V:\ is not accessible.&nbsp; The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried:<br />
"V:"="C:\\V"</p>
<p>Same results as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried using a .reg file:</p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Run]<br />
"V Drive"="subst V: C:\\V"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This did nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't use Net Use to do the mapping because that requires setting up a share.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to get the equivalent of: Subst V: C:\V</p>
<p>but persistent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>I should learn to type.&nbsp; The correct syntax is:<br />
</p>
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\DOS Devices]<br />
"V:"="\\??\\C:\\V"</p>
<p>Note the double ?.</p>
<p>That works.</p>
<p />

            1. NEVER inport or export a .PST file, it loses data.&nbsp; Make a copy of your .PST file when Outlook is closed to make a full backup of your data.&nbsp; If you ever have a problem, simply reconnect the copy:<br />

<br />
2.&nbsp;If you can&nbsp;run Setup from the Outlook 2000 install CD, it should give you the uninstall and repair functions.&nbsp; Note that Outlook 2000 is not fully Vista compatible, you should consider upgrading to Outlook 2003 or later.]<br />

<h2>            FEEDBACK PROBLEMS</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm playing to xbox since xbox is born, and my reputation was absolutely good because I'm a fair player....but&nbsp;now, that&nbsp;I'm playing to Dead by Daylight, it happens something. When I&nbsp;play the role of the killer I usually win,&nbsp;so other players&nbsp;send a negative feedback about me for revenge. I'm a fair and polite player and I think that this behavior is not fair at all. And I'm really upset about that.</p>

<p>I pay to play&nbsp;quietly, to enjoy myself, I&nbsp;never use a bad language and I never do glitches, bad messages&nbsp;or unfair things.</p>

<p>You can check all the proofs on my account and you can see all the messages I received from this other players.</p>

<p>I am a lawyer and I know my rights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This situation must be solved immediately.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks</p>



<p>Harry</p>

<h2>            C&#58;&#92;Windows&#124;System32&#92;Config&#92;System &#43; Win Recovery Help</h2>
                    
<p>The other day I got a blue screen of death and when I rebooted I got the message that "the following file is missing: C:\Windows|System32\Config\System use Recovery Console and press 'r' at the first screen to repair".</p>
<p>I know there are articles about how to fix this, but I have an additional problem. I've put the OEM disk from Dell in and loaded up the console, but after I press "r" for repair, it says at the bottom "examining 245300 MB on drive 0... on iastar..." which
 I assume is the harddrive with my OS loaded on to it. This screen NEVER ends and it just keeps saying "examining". I've left the computer on for hours and nothing.</p>
<p>Apparently this happens before I'm given any access to the command prompt within Recovery (from what I've read)&nbsp;so I'm really stuck as to what to do now. None of the answers seem to have this problem mentioned them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would really appreciate any help that any of you could give me!</p>

<p>What did you do after the BSOD to initiate the reboot?</p>
<p>In between the time of the BSOD and the reboot did you pull the power plug, pull the battery, use the power button to restart, etc.? &nbsp;</p>
<p>These can cause corruption in the file system which must be fixed before you do anything&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>If any of those events have occurred (or even if they have not occurred), you should verify&nbsp;the integrity of your file system before doing anything else (especially "trying" things).</p>
<p>It makes zero sense to start trying to copy files around on a hard disk that has a corrupted&nbsp;file system so this must be fixed first using the XP chkdsk program, and fixing that may resolve&nbsp;your issue entirely. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the XP Recovery Console to verify the file system on your HDD and correct any problems&nbsp;and then try to boot your system - this may be all you need to do. &nbsp;Or, you are welcome to&nbsp;just start trying things that might work.</p>
<p>Boot into the Windows Recovery Console using a bootable XP installation CD, or create&nbsp;a bootable XP Recovery Console CD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come a store bought system. &nbsp;If&nbsp;you are not sure what kind of bootable CD you have, make a bootable XP Recovery Console CD&nbsp;and &nbsp;be sure.</p>
<p>You can create a bootable XP Recovery Console CD when no XP media is available by following&nbsp;the directions in this link:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic276527.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic276527.html</a></p>
<p>After booting into the Recovery Console, you should be in this folder:</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS</p>
<p>For each of your hard disk partitions, you should then run:</p>
<p>chkdsk /r</p>
<p>For example, from the Recovery Console prompt, enter:</p>
<p>chkdsk c: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;It may take a long&nbsp;time to complete or appear to be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is&nbsp;still flashing, it is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount to &nbsp;be sure it is still
 making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>The chkdsk /r needs to complete without any errors, so you may need to run it&nbsp;multiple times until it does.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer and report&nbsp;back with your progress.</p>

<p>I wasn't at home when I got the BSOD. I came home and I discovered it, I have no idea how long it was like this. Anyways, I pushed the power button to restart it.</p>
<p>As I said, I've tried using the recovery console with the Dell "reinstallation CD" but it freezes up when it starts to examine the drive. So everything you said about using recovery console is useless to me.</p>
<p>Thanks though.</p>

Ok, I will try the recovery disk, thanks. I'm really desperate at this point!</p>

<p>I may be wrong but, it does not sound like you are booting from the disc. Are you receiving the prompt to press any key to boot from a cd? If you are and are receiving the BSOD you may have a hardware issue.</p>

No, I am loading the initial recovery console screens fine.</p>
<p>I load up my computer and get the "DELL" screen. Then it says "To load from CD press any key" so I press any key.</p>
<p>Then a blue screen comes up that says "Windows Recovery Console XP".</p>
<p>Then the bar at the bottom says "Loading..." and a billion different driver names appear.</p>
<p>After that it says "Starting up Windows"</p>
<p>After that I get a blue screen of death.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I use my Dell recovery disk, I get through all of those steps, except at the end I get the "to install Windows XP press Enter. to repair Windows XP press r. To exit without saving press F3". I've tried pressing both enter and r and it has the same result.
 It says "Examining 250000MB disk on drive 0 on iastar" then it hangs and hangs and doesn't continue. This is the exact problem that another user posted in this thread.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I honestly have no idea why this is occurring. I can only speculate that you have a hardware issue which sounds like either bad ram or more likely the hard drive. I may be entirely wrong however. Usually bad ram will cause file copying failure during installation.
 I would recommend you visit the website for your hdd to see if there is a DOS test you can burn to a disc then boot from. If you are unable to locate one for your particular hdd you can try Seatools by Seagate which will work with most hard drives. Be sure
 to choose the DOS version however and not the windows version. You can also check the ram with memtest. Each of these are bootable versions.</p>

<p>Maybe I'm using the wrong terminology... When I put the disk in, I press a key to boot from the disk and then I get a blue screen that says "Windows Setup". On this screen there is a bar at the bottom of the screen that says "loading drivers". Then it says
 "Setup is starting Windows".</p>
<p>With the Dell disk, it progresses past this screen to the "to install windows press enter, to repair windows, press r" screen. With the disk I made using the instructions on that link you provided, I get a blue of screen death.</p>
<p>Once I press either "enter" or "r" with the Dell disk, I always get hung up on the next screen that says "examining 250000mb on drive 0 on iastar". I guess I never even make it to the Recovery Console. This is my problem.</p>

<p>Midway no longer exists as a company, and nobody else has the distribution rights. Since there's no license, and nobody to "send the money to" these games can't be sold. So there you go.</p>

                    Hi! I'm a student attending West Chester University of Pennsylvania and I was looking to get the windows 10 upgrade to the student edition. I know on the website it says that this is a free upgrade however when I enter my universities information nothing
 pops up it doesn't bring me to a new screen or anything it just says, "You've selected a country and a state please enter your institution" If anyone knows the solution to this please let me know! Thank you!

<p>Are you using the 'On The Hub' Page to upgrade to Windows 10 Education free for students?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On that page, usually you enter your location and then when you start to type the name of your school/university it will autofill and then you will be presented with a list of free and discounted software available for that region and college, you then click
 on your selected software, in your case - Windows 10 Education</p>

<p>I don't have cancel button/link in upgrade to&nbsp;Windows 10 (see screenshot below).</p>
<p>I can uninstall and disable KB3035583 - it removes icon, but will it cancel the&nbsp;update?</p>
<p>If I re enable and install this KB again&nbsp;then it looks that it cancelled, i.e. I can click to reserve again, again don't see cancel button. All done with reboot after install/uninstall KB.</p>

    <title>How to make this annoying notice go away&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to make this annoying notice go away&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8 is the most useless OS I have ever used. It is NOT conducive to multi-window manipulation. I multi-task all the time while on the pc and W8 is a lame excuse for an OS. I've used all of Microsoft's OSs since before 98. In my opinion, the best was
 XP with W7 very close to being a favorite. Ok, how do I get rid of the notice that has affixed itself to the left side of my computer screen. Here a snap-shot of the thing. Upon starting you don't see it, it appears once an app is opened.</p>
<p>

            <p>OK. </p>
<p>Swipe the notice down and to the left. You may have to experiment with the cursor movement but it will go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, you do realise that Windows 8 has <strong>desktop</strong> mode, that acts and looks almost exactly like Windows 7? (There are some minor differences, but nothing that can't be worked around).</p>
<p>Go into the Desktop (if you don't know how, then just type <strong>desktop</strong> in the Start screen) and you can multi-window to your heart's content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Windows 8.1 (which you should have by now) you can tell your machine to boot directly into the Desktop, bypassing the Start screen completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click on the Taskbar in the desktop, choose Properties, and on the Navigation tab and check the option as below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71f95a24-5c92-40f9-b7f3-662502389a55" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing you need to do is to make sure you have Desktop versions of the modern apps you use - such as Adobe Acrobat Reader etc.</p>
<p>You also need to set IE (if that's what you use) to always open in the desktop version.</p>
<p>Do that in Internet Options.</p>

            <p>It's baaack! Now the "signage" is back with still no way to get rid of it. It takes up about 2.5 inches of real estate of the left-hand side of my display. Plus it's position so that it's above other windows, hiding to content of anything below it.</p>

</strong>and name it <strong>EdgeUI</strong>.</li><li>Next, select <strong>EdgeUI</strong> and then in the right side pane, right-click and create a new
<strong>DWORD (32-bit) Value. </strong>Name the new value as <strong>DisableHelpSticker</strong>. Double-click on
<strong>DisableHelpSticker</strong> and enter<strong> 1</strong> in the Value data box. Click&nbsp;<strong>“OK”</strong>.</li><li>Restart your PC and the <strong>Help Stickers</strong> should no longer be visible</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your edition of Windows has the <strong>Group Policy Editor</strong>, then you can use it to disable these Help Tips or Stickers. Navigate to User Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Edge UI. Double-click on

<p>I am an everyday player. Played HC Headquarters and loved it. Why **** with something that is or should I say was very realistic for a game that is. I should not have to pay something I don't want in-order to wait for the HC game I want to play. If I would
 have know these changes were going to be permanent I would not have bought the new map pack. Sure Core guys hate HC players and HC players hate Core guys but hell how many chioces does the CORE game mode have verses the HC game mode..Thanks for *** up the
 best game out there,,,,or was the best game out there. I am not going to purchase the new MW3 game in NOV because of this. I mean why pay $70 bucks plus this new charge they want to try and hit me with for a game that they can just go in and freaking change
 at any time.&nbsp; Looks like COD just lost me (and i know i am not the only one)&nbsp;as a customer.&nbsp; Maybe next time some dum-@@@ will think a little before changing a game that people loved just the way it was. I mean its was the #1 game for a reason,,,,,,,,,NOT
 FOR MUCH LONGER!!!!</p>

            Hi Alan, I have researched that and as far as I can tell, it is not possible to move that Virtual Desktop panel back to its original Position in version 1803, though most users are looking to do that, so hopefully Microsoft are listening . . .

<p>Hi JWIGGI,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;What is the file format of the scanned pictures?</p>
<p>You may open the scanned picture using photo gallery by following the below steps:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Right-click the <strong>file</strong> that you want to <strong>open</strong>, and then, depending on the type of file, either click Open With or point to Open With and then click
<strong>Choose Default Program</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;Click the program that you want to use to open this file.<br />
3.&nbsp;<strong>Do one of the following</strong>:<br />
•&nbsp;If you want all files of that type to open in the same software program, select the Always use the selected program to open this kind of file check box, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.<br />
•&nbsp;If you want only that file to open in the software program this one time, clear the Always use the selected program to open this kind of file check box, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Change the program that opens a type of file</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Change-the-program-that-opens-a-type-of-file" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Change-the-program-that-opens-a-type-of-file<br />
</a><br />
You may also use the photo gallery to scan the pictures and directly open it using photo gallery.</p>
<p>Using Windows Photo Gallery, you can scan, edit, and organize pictures. The scanned pictures are automatically stored in your Pictures folder, just like pictures that you might import from a camera.</p>
<p>In order to open the scanned pictures using windows photo gallery you will need to use windows photo gallery to scan the picture and later open it using it.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
To scan a picture using Windows Photo Gallery</span></strong><br />
<br />
Before you begin, make sure that you've installed your scanner on the computer and that the scanner is turned on.
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Windows Photo Gallery by clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button, clicking
<strong>All Programs</strong>, and then clicking <strong>Windows Photo Gallery</strong>.
<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;Click <strong>File</strong>, and then click <strong>Import from Camera or Scanner</strong>.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;In the Import Pictures and Videos window, click the <strong>scanner that you want to use</strong>, and then click
<strong>Import</strong>.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;In the <strong>New Scan</strong> dialog box, click the <strong>Profile list</strong>, and then click
<strong>Photo</strong>. The default settings for scanning a picture are automatically displayed.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;If you're using a scanner with a document feeder, click the <strong>Paper size list</strong>, and then click the size of the picture that you've placed on the scanner or click the size that most closely matches the picture.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;Click the <strong>Color format</strong> list, and then click the <strong>color format that you want the scanned file to display</strong>.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;Click the <strong>File type</strong> list, and then click the file type that you want to use to save the scanned file.<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;Click the <strong>Resolution (DPI)</strong> list, and then click the <strong>resolution</strong>, in dots per inch, that you want to use.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;Adjust the brightness and contrast settings or type the values that you want to use.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;To see how the picture will appear when it is scanned, click Preview. If needed, modify the scan settings, and then preview the picture again. Repeat these steps until you're satisfied with the preview results. Some scanners might require you to place the
 picture in the document feeder each time that you scan.<br />
<br />
11.&nbsp;Click <strong>Scan</strong>. When the <strong>scan is complete</strong>, Windows Photo Gallery prompts you to
<strong>tag</strong> the picture so that it's easier to organize or find later. <br />
<br />
12.&nbsp;In the Tag these pictures (<strong>optional</strong>) list, type a tag name, and then click
<strong>Import</strong>. Windows Photo Gallery displays the picture so you can view, fix, or organize it.</p>

            <p>Yor PC wouldnt have come with a disk, but it would have had a hidden recovery partition which you should have accessed following the Acer instructions in order to create the recovery disk set.</p>
<p>You cannot format your drive from within win, doing so would be like sitting on a branch and cutting the branch off, fortunately win will prevent you doing so.</p>
<p>Follow the instructions on Acer site to restore your PC to factory condition using the hidden recovery partition. You will lose everything on the PC as I dont suppose you backed anything up to external media.</p>
<p>And dont install any 'SpeedUpMyPc' type of programs, doing so can render the system unuseable</p>

            <p>It sounds as though the&nbsp;"Active" or "Boot"&nbsp;partition has been changed to some other one. Borrow a windows 7 disk, boot from DVD, go to Recovery-&gt;advanced-&gt;command prompt.</p>

<p>LIST DISK</p>
<p>SELECT DISK &lt;hard disk number, usually 0&gt;</p>

<p>SELECT PARTITION &lt;the OS partition number, usually 2&gt;</p>
<p>ACTIVE.</p>

<p>Sorry about the delay, I've been trying to get a clip just to show exactly what's going on but every time I either forget to record one or ShadowPlay had decided to stop Instant Replay.&nbsp; I'll keep trying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>I recently upgraded my CPU and motherboard.&nbsp; I can't recall if this issue occurred before then but it's possible that it started only after the change.</li><li>Here is my system setup:&nbsp;https://pcpartpicker.com/list/Q7QRxG</li><li>I am the only user of this computer</li></ol>
<p>Regarding method A, I have restarted my computer (and thus explorer) multiple times ever since the issue started occurring but it continues to happen.&nbsp; As for method B, the Windows Audio service was already set to automatic and restarting it did not fix
 the issue.</p>

    <title>How to enable image preview in Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgimarokov  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to enable image preview in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    Good day. From recent updates, sadly I noticed that image preview is no more available for image thumbnails. Also sadly, Windows Image Preview app was removed and now we can only use Photos. Why is that and is there by any changes to re-enabled it back
 so I can preview images? Thanks.&nbsp;

<p>Sure thing, previews should be working by default but perhaps some settings have been corrupted. &nbsp;I would check these:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Search for an open Folder Options, then on the View tab make sure the very first checkbox about icons is off (unchecked)</li><li>Search for and open Settings, then go to Apps (this may be on the first page or under the System section, depending on which updates you have). &nbsp;In the list of apps, find Photos and click it to enlarge it. &nbsp;Choose Advanced link, then click Reset to repair
 the app.</li><li>Right-click any photo file, choose "Open with" and "Choose another app". Pick Photos in the list and then click OK.</li><li>Restart and open a file folder to see if thumbnails display now.</li></ol>
