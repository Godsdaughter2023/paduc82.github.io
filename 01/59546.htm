<h2>            Dell computer not supported for Windows 10</h2>
                    When I went to the Dell web site I discovered that my two year old XPS 8500 was not supported by Dell for Windows 10.&nbsp; I did not mean to install Windows 10, but I clicked on something and all it would let me do is install.&nbsp; The Microsoft application said
 my PC was supported.&nbsp; The Dell web site says to contact Microsoft.&nbsp; Windows 10 is running and appears to be functioning correctly.&nbsp; I discovered that for a month I can revert back to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; What should I do?<br />

    <title>Hauppauge HVR950Q There But Not There - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> big_sky_bob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hauppauge HVR950Q There But Not There</h2>
                    A while back I purchased the Hauppauge HVR950Q Model 1191 Hybrid TV Stick for my computer, an HP a1700n with AMD Athlon 64 X2 Dual Core Processort 3800+ and 2 Gigs of Ram.&nbsp; I was hoping simply to plug in the TV cable coming out of the wall adjacent to
 the computer, plug the stick in the USB and be able to view and possibly record live tv.&nbsp; After installing the provided software and subsequently updating to the latest version, Windows seemed not to have a problem recognizing the device.&nbsp; It shows up in Device
 Manager, under Sound, video and game controllers as three separate entries: WinTV HVR-950 Audio, WinTV HVR-950Q ATSC/QAM Capture Device, and WinTV HVR-950Q NTSC Capture Device.&nbsp; So far so good, or at least so I thought.&nbsp; When I went to open the provided WinTV
 7 Software and went to Settings/Devices, nothing showed up.&nbsp; OK, well let's try the Windows Media Center setup, same thing, no device found.&nbsp; I called Hauppauge and they had no answer, other than to remove and reinstall the latest software.&nbsp; Nope, nothing.&nbsp;
 I started trying other software, The Nero/Tivo, SageTV, and several others.&nbsp; All recognized the device and seemed fine &lt;?&gt; although all&nbsp;wanted money, on top of the money I'd just paid Hauppauge for their software.<br />
<br />
So, my question: what can be done to rectify this problem, if anything.&nbsp; I'd sure appreciate some guidance down any path to victory.&nbsp; I started eliminating resident apps thinking one of them might be conflicting but that yielded no results as well.<br />
<br />
I'll be anxiously awaiting any kind of help with this issue.&nbsp; Need more information? Please ask, I'm always here.<br />

<p><span><span>Hello Big_Sky_Bob,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For the Hauppauge HVR950Q to work with Media Center, you will need to download and install their 'WinTV installation for Windows Media
 Center' This should help you recognize the device from the Media Center: </span>

</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also make sure that you uninstall the driver and download the latest driver from the 'Hauppauge' website.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try to install the latest driver and check if you can get this working.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here is a link that I found that might help you.</span></span></p>

<p>Irfan,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response.&nbsp; I've tried everything you mentioned, actually just updated to a new software version just this morning, but still no recognition of the device, either in Media Center, or the WinTV 7&nbsp;software provided with the device.&nbsp; Also, quite
 regularly, I receive warning boxes with messages such as: <br />
<br />
Capture plugin for the USB devices stopped working and was closed...<br />
Windows Media Player has stopped working...<br />
Digital Cable Device registration application stopped working and was closed....<br />
<br />
I'm still left wondering why the device shows up in Device Manager, but is not recognized elsewhere on the system, short of a few third party programs I've tried. ($$$)<br />
<br />
Perhaps an upgrade to Win 7 might clear up the problem &lt;?&gt;<br />
<br />
Thanks again and have a great weekend,<br />
Bob</p>

Hi Big_sky_Bob,</p>
<p>I would suggest that you remove the TV tuner card from the computer using the device manager and later remove the TV tuner card from the computer and then connect it back to the computer then use the below link and download the software for windows media
 center from the below link and make sure that you follow the instruction in the link on “<strong>Win TV installation for Windows Media Center</strong>” and later download the driver update.<br />
<a href="http://www.hauppauge.com/site/support/support_hvr950.html#cable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hauppauge.com/site/support/support_hvr950.html#cable</a></p>
<p>Now open Windows media center and run the TV setup again, check if it works.<br />
1.&nbsp;On the <strong>start</strong> screen, scroll to <strong>Tasks</strong>, click <strong>
settings</strong>, click <strong>TV</strong>, and then click <strong>Set Up TV Signal</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;Follow the steps to <strong>connect a TV signal</strong>, depending on the type of tuner or tuners that the cable is connected to, as well as the type of programming to which you subscribe.</p>
<p><strong>Set up a TV signal in Windows Media Center</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Set-up-a-TV-signal-in-Windows-Media-Center" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Set-up-a-TV-signal-in-Windows-Media-Center</a></p>

<p>If the above step fails then try the steps mentioned in the below link and check.<br />
<strong>Media Center Error in Vista Premium: Tuner Not Installed</strong><br />
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;docname=c01187871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;docname=c01187871</a></p>
<p>If you still have issues with the TV tuner card you will need to contact Hauppauge for more information.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!<br />

<h2>            Spinning circle in login screen on Windows 10 won&#39;t stop</h2>
                    <p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9ea3ba8-b208-4666-8dbd-31a28e8f0639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9ea3ba8-b208-4666-8dbd-31a28e8f0639" /></a>I
 &nbsp;opened my laptop one day and once I typed in my password, it took me to this black screen where I only could see my mouse. I could hit ctrl alt del and task manager would not pop up after hitting it, my computer wouldn't restart or shut down. I let it sit
 and when I came back I opened it up again and the login screen where I type my password was already loading with the spinning circle even when I did not enter anything. It's been sitting loading overnight and all day and nothing has happened. I turned it off
 by hitting the button and I clicked all kinds of buttons but nothing would work. Ctrl alt delete doesn't work and the only button that does is the power button. Mouse still works though.&nbsp;I thought letting the computer die instead of shutting it off since I
 couldn't click the button. It went back to that loading login. I even removes the battery and put it back in. It still went back to the loading circle...</p>
<p><br />
I just really want to know what's going on and how I can fix it without spending money on someone to come by and look at it. Please help me. I will post a picture of what it looks like now. <br />
It happened the 27th at about 3:20 est. At first it was a black screen when I turned it on and at about 7 or 8 it did what the picture looks like, lost the spinning circle. It stayed like this all day and until now which its's about 7:55 est and it hasn't changed.
 The only thing done was that we never really turned it off. We kinda closed all the programs and closed the computer, it hasn't been turned off in a while unless it dies. It's always 100% cause it never leaves the charger. It only about two years old. This
 began to happen after we turned it off the morning of the 27th.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>I also can't get the boot menu button to work. F12 right when I turn it on doesn't work...I had a Toshiba Window &nbsp;8 laptop and I updated to Windows 10 a couple months ago.</p>

<p>i had the same problem when i first played the game, but the farther you are in the game also helps. i beat the main storyline and started hammering on the 100% achievement, and i noticed i was able to get them. im stuck now at 98.7% i think, i hate playing
 the poker on there!</p>

    <title>Cannot disable automatic updates on Windows build 1703 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jean-thomas morin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot disable automatic updates on Windows build 1703</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So a few months ago I had to roll my computer back from Windows build 1803 to build 1703 due to many unsolvable bugs involving my GPU. Ever since, Windows has been trying to automatically download build 1803 everyday. I searched online for advice on how to
 turn off automatic updates, and none of them worked. I tried to go to services.msc and then putting the startup type of Delivery Optimization &amp; Windows Update to 'disabled', I also tried to change the Group Policy settings, as well as changing options in 'Choose
 how updates are delivered' in the Advanced options of the Windows Update settings tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of them worked, and a few days ago, without my knowledge, Windows had redownloaded build 1803. There was nothing I could do to prevent the installation &amp; the problems came back. I now successfully went back to build 1703 and I am worried that Windows
 automatic updates might mess everything up again.<br />
<br />
If anybody has another solution to this quite bothersome feature of Windows, please let me know.</p>

<br />Windows is really persistent and usually will force you to update eventually. But you can stop it from updating for a while with these fixes.

            Regarding the issue, I would like to let you know that controlling Windows updates is somewhat difficult in Windows 10, but you can see the options here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />If you have Windows 10 Pro , Methods 4 and 5 are the best way to resolve this as Windows would always ask you to before downloading updates.
<br />Another way would be to use a 3rd party app like Stop Updates10. which allows you to disable Windows 10 Updates with a single click.
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-updates-windows-10-stopupdates10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-updates-win...</a>

<h2>            Movie maker says files are corrupt when they were playable just a moment ago&#33; Help&#33;</h2>
                    <b>I make movies with my Sims 2 game and I use WLMM a lot to edit them. However, as of late, &nbsp;if I start making a project, it will say my files are corrupt when they aren't! For example, lets say I put a clip recorded from the game into my movie. &nbsp;It will
 work perfectly fine, no problems! I'll add captions, music, and sometimes snip and clip the video for better motion with those stubborn Sims! Perfect! Well, I'll save the project so I don't lose anything if the maker decides it wants to crash during movie
 saving. I'll go back and review as I do the entire time that I'm making the movie. &nbsp;All the music remains, but where are the captions and the videos? I pause the playback, double click the clips, and see the little error symbol inside my clips. I decide that
 maybe if I save the movie, it will re appear. well, no such luck. The maker gives an error saying to retrieve all missing files and delete all the corrupt ones. &nbsp;I sigh, delete the file, and remake the entire video. None of the clips are deleted from my computer
 and play just fine on their own.</b>

            <p>My suggestion would be to convert all your video clips to .wmv format (and your music to .wma format) to avoid the crashing issues.&nbsp; At least try that with a couple clips and see if it helps. Freemake Video Converter (freemake.com) does a good job of this,
 though there are other options if you want to do some research.&nbsp; If you do install FVC, pay attention to what is checked to install; I usually uncheck everything and only install the program.</p>
<p>As for working in a prior version of Movie Maker, you can certainly try.&nbsp; You can't transfer a project file, but you can transfer the source files (photos, videos, music).&nbsp; The older versions had less compatibility with different video types, but again if
 you work with .wmv files, you'll have the most success.&nbsp; You can also consider installing&nbsp;a prior version (e.g.
<a href="http://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Movie Maker 6.0</a>) on your Windows 7 system and see if that works better for you than Windows Live Movie Maker. You can have both on your system and they won't conflict.</p>

<h2>            Extended desktop shows no image only black screen</h2>
                    Laptop: Sony VGN-AR38G;<br />
<br />
Video card: Nvidia GeForece Go 7600 GT;<br />
<br />
2nd Monitor: LCD TV (plug and play, connected to laptop via VGA cable).<br />
<br />
<strong>Problem: extended desktop shows no image only black screen.<br />
<br />
Self diagnose:<br />
<br />
TV and VGA cable are both functioning fine</strong> , because I unplugged the VGA from AR38G and switched it onto another laptop, and the TV displayed the extended desktop perfectly.<br />
<br />
So the problem should be within AR38G, right?<br />
<br />
All the drivers are up to date, and there hasn't been any new installations.<br />
<br />
Could this be caused by any power input/output problems? Does the VGA consume any power?<br />
<br />
My laptop has been acting strange lately, say I switched off the lamp, and the speaker will go dead, then I'll have to unplug and plug in the audio cable connecting the speaker and the laptop to resolve it. Since the lamp and the laptop share the same extension
 board, could it be some power problem disturbing the internal DC of the laptop? <br />
<br />
<br />
Many thanks in advance.<br />
<br />

<h3> suegoff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade can&#39;t open Microsoft Word doc</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my laptop from Windows 7 to Windows 10 in October of 2015. This was done through the Windows Update options. I immediately could not get my Microsoft 10 word documents to open. I received the error, 'Word experienced an error trying to open the
 file'.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I upgraded my Office from Version 10 to Version 13 Pro Plus&nbsp;and still got the same errors.</p>
<p>I did the repair&nbsp;and the supposed 'fix' which is to <strong>Update Now</strong>. After install the update, the Office version should be 15.0.4745.1002 or later. The version is currently
<span style="color: rgba(54, 54, 54, 1)">15.0.4833</span></p>
<p>None of these fixed my issue. I have about 60 important documents that now only open with notepad having&nbsp;jiberish.</p>
<p>I have searched on here and do not see any further fixes for this. </p>
<p>Anyone know of something else I can try?</p>

<p>Chances are (99.99%) the computer came with a Norton or a McAfee free-trial preinstalled. Both applications are
<em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We&nbsp;need to do a&nbsp;little more "digging," I'm afraid:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the <em>full name</em> of your currently-installed <em>third-party</em> anti-virus application or security suite -&nbsp;i.e.,
<em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em> - (if any), and <em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription
</em>(if any)<em>&nbsp;expire?</em> </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What third-party anti-malware applications (i.e., <em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>) are installed, if any?&nbsp; What third-party firewall, if any?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Is&nbsp;KB3172985&nbsp;or&nbsp;KB3163912 [&lt;=PICK ONE!]&nbsp;listed in <strong>Installed Updates
</strong><em>(not <strong>Update History</strong></em>)? [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. How about KB3173428, KB3172983, KB3172987, KB3159635,&nbsp;and/or KB3125217?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Is <strong>Adobe Flash Player </strong><strong>v22.0.0.209</strong> installed? TEST HERE USING&nbsp;INTERNET EXPLORER OR EDGE
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>6. Is Firefox <em>version 47.0.1</em> (or higher) and/or Google Chrome <em>version&nbsp;</em><em>51.0.2704.106</em> (or higher) or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., CCleaner's <em>Registry Cleaner
</em>component;&nbsp;Registry Mechanic; <em>System Mechanic</em>; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Total System Care; Advanced System Optimizer; Comodo System Cleaner; Glary Utilities; Registry Booster;
<em>McAfee QuickClean</em>; <em>AVG Quick Clean</em>;&nbsp;<em>AVG PC TuneUp</em>; Norton Registry Cleaner;

    <title>How to stop MS ads constantly popping up in Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shoya52  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop MS ads constantly popping up in Win 10</h2>
                    <p>I've been struggling with Windows 10 for about a month on my new laptop and finding it increasingly irritating and interfering. I just cannot believe this is what MS programmed into the OS. Here's the biggest issue of concern: no matter what I'm doing, what
 program I'm working in or what else may be happening, every half hour or so yet another Microsoft Ad pops up. EX: I was trying to finish a complex Word document earlier today. I stopped to look up some figures and pop...up comes a box extolling the virtues
 of some add-on for Word. Yes, I can X out the ad, but in the process it moves my cursor from where I stopped in Word and slows the entire system down to a crawl while I wait for the ad to disappear. A few minutes later, another box appears telling me all about
 OneDrive. *^%&amp;! I already know about OneDrive. This ad/advice thing crops up at least a dozen or more times a work session.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then there's the Cortana irritant --- I don't want/need a voice that crops up every so often trying to tell me how to use my system! I also don't need the all too frequent pop ups telling me how to do things I have known how to do for ages. IF I need help,
 I know how to find that help off and online. All of this -- the constant "helper" pop-ups, the ads for MS products for which I have no use and the Contana voice gobble system resources, cause the system to stall/freeze and slows down whatever task I am attempting
 to accomplish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In an attempt to stop all this garbage, I've...under Settings -- shut off all notifications including "tips, suggestions, tricks"; Turned off the "auto" switch for Cortana. Even when turned off, or checked not to respond to voice, the thing keeps talking
 - UGH.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep thinking there is something I'm overlooking. Why would Microsoft design an OS that is so intrusive? Ideally, the OS runs in the background allowing you to work, not fight it constantly. Well, at least that's what I would hope, but then I'm not an
 expert. Please, if anyone can help me tame this things, offer some advice. Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

            Thank you for the ideas. I have sent feedback and hope someone can tell me how to resolve this highly irritating issue. With 16GB RAM I shouldn't be having op issues, but every time one of these irritating pop-ups comes along, the system slows to a bare
 crawl. When I check task manager, the highest usage (usually huge) is Cortana or one of the pop-up programs. UGH! Thanks again -

<p>Hi DarkUltra,<br />
<br />
Lags and stutters are normal when performing a stability test since your app is stressing your hardwares. If you were not experiencing these before, there is a possibility that this could be due to software conflicts. With that said, I suggest updating your
 apps to the latest version to avoid compatibility issues.</p>

<h2>            Unable to print pictures but can print documents in Windows 7</h2>
                    Printing pictures<br />
My printer will not print pictures but it will print documents.&nbsp; I just had my d and c drive partitions changed and increased.&nbsp; Would this cause a problem in that regard?&nbsp; I haven't had other problems (so far).&nbsp; It goes up to the point after you have selected
 how you want to print prictures -- 4x6, 5x7, contact sheet, etc.&nbsp; After you click "print" you can see the little swirling button to show it's doing something and then it just quits and stays on that screen.&nbsp; Has anybody had this problem or heard of it before?

<p><span><span>Which application are you using to print the photos?<br />
<br />
First, make sure the color cartridge is not empty.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I f you are using Windows Photo viewer to print, then you will not be able to print a single 4x6 photo, as Windows Photo Viewer does

<h2>            Xbox account permanently suspended and it&#39;s killing me</h2>
                    <p>Hello. My name is Marley Gabor. I had to make a new account to post here because my main account, Marleyg4 is banned. Permanently. I'm 23 years old, don't have a job, live with my mother, don't have a car or a license, and am going to school part time. I haven't had a relationship for the past year and half since my boyfriend broke up with me, and even before that I've pretty much had no one in my life.&nbsp;I have no friends outside of xbox, and my overall quality of life is pretty awful. The only solace I've had since I got it in 2007 was my xbox 360, and later my Xbox One. A couple of days ago I received a 2 week chat ban from xbox, and this apparently triggered a permanent ban for my account. This isn't the first time I've been banned, or the second or third. I understand that i am toxic, but I have been trying so hard to be less so than&nbsp;I was when I&nbsp;was first banned back in 2015, and I think i have gotten better, if not only marginally. I am not a bad person. I am not a h

            My account was also worth around $2,000 and it's permanently gone because it stated that "this account has a pornographic profile picture" but it's a selfie of me with glasses. And my account is just gone like that is very frustrating. I can feel your
 pain. And Microsoft should see what they've done to their loyal customers who've been treated with an unfair enforcement.

<p>
</p><p>If pics don't attach in the desired size you can instead choose Insert&gt;Files to have them all a uniform size.&nbsp; Remember to attach multiple files to hold Ctrl when you select them.&nbsp; You can also give yourself checkboxes for choosing at Control Panel&gt;File

            I had this problem also.&nbsp; Instead of "attaching" photos use the insert option.&nbsp; You do this by clicking in the body of the email and the insert photos options will become available.&nbsp; Hope this helps anyone else with this same issue.

<h2>            Keyboard goes to shortcut when num lock is on</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 and an hp keyboard from a previous computer.&nbsp; When the num lock is on, if you hit the shift key at any time the keyboard automatically goes to shortcuts and internet menu options instead of capitalizing the letter.&nbsp; You can not use the
 shift key at all if the num lock is on.&nbsp; Also, when I am working in programs, i.e. photoshop cs 2, when I try to use any of my shortcuts to speed up production, they don't work.&nbsp; I went in to edit shortcuts to make sure it was not the program and instead of
 certain shortcuts when using&nbsp; [ ] and { } keys, the keyboard types a foreign character in it's place, even when num lock is off.&nbsp; I have tried 3 different keyboards (2-ps2 and 1-usb) and restarted the system several times, uninstalled and reinstalled the program
 but still have the same problem.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 10 update seems to be stalled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grw1177  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update seems to be stalled</h2>
                    <p>I have a relatively new laptop with Windows 7 home premium. &nbsp;I downloaded the Win 10 update, but it seems to have stalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen just shows what I assume is an icon of a body/head, my name under that, a blue window on the right, and a series of dots going around in a circle under my name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been going on for 3 days now. &nbsp;It seems like the computer may be going into hibernate mode which is slowing the installation, but I thought the installer would've disabled this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does look like the hard drive is doing something as the light comes on like it is writing or reading the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something I can do to turn off the hibernate mode at this point, so that the install will complete without me having to sit and watch it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually pretty much did this on my own by accident because I took it with me when I was travelling. &nbsp;I also booted into system tools and did a complete system check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, it did boot up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One critical program does not work, but after research I found that it is not compatible with Windows 10. &nbsp;I found a workaround, but have not had time to investigate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks again for your reply.</p>

            NO, I do not believe you can dual boot 98 and Vista.&nbsp; You can Dual boot XP and Vista.<br />
<br />
May I suggest you try another Forum.&nbsp; This Forum supports Windows Vista and Microsoft hasn't supported Windows 98 in some time.&nbsp; You "might" get help over on the XP Forums.&nbsp; (Links provided by Support Engineers from this site, I snagged them from another Post)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi DCH5876, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you do not need to worry about licencing and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            You will need to download Media Creation Tool to install Windows 10 Pro as highlighted in below process.
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            If you are Performing a Clean Install by Booting from the Windows 10 install disk:
<br />
<br />Try simplifying your configuration by keeping only your mouse and keyboard attached, that means:
<br />
<br />    Disconnecting multiple display monitors.
<br />    Remove discrete video cards, use the on-board graphics if your motherboard supports it.
<br />
<br />    Swap out memory modules - a RAM module might be corrupt - you can also ensure RAM sticks are installed slots 1 and 3. Your RAM modules might be corrupt, try scanning them for errors. 
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/use-the-memory-diagnostics-tool-to-check-for-errors-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/use-the-memory...</a>
<br />
<br />    If you have more than one hard disk installed, disconnect all except the target disk where Windows 10 will be installed.
<br />
<br />    Reset your BIOS Defaults.
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />    Disconnect all external devices, since connected devices can sometimes confuse setup. 
<br />
<br />If setup is successful after performing these tasks, you can reinstall each removed component.

            I see the board uses DDR2 technology with maximum memory support of 8GB.
<br />No wonder why Windows 10 is running slowly on this. If you need performance, upgrade the motherboard and CPU.
<br />I have an i3 board and Windows 10 doesn't work on that too properly on 4GBs of RAM.

            INF_LOC is a file used by Windows for storing information about drivers. It is used internally by Windows when installing and configuring drivers, and acts as a cache for driver data. It is saved in a plain text format and can be viewed with a text editor such as Notepad.

            Hi Brian <br />
<br />
Inf files are typically belonging to a deice driver, there are thousands of those on your PC
<br />
<br />
Because you have unhidden data on your PC, you will now see a lot of those . . . <br />
<br />
Where exactly on your PC are you seeing the inf files? <br />
<br />
If you are ever worried about an inf file, right click it and choose 'Open With - Choose Another App - Notepad'
<br />
<br />
Generally those are human readable and you will be able to see what device driver the inf file is for . .

<p>Ok thanks, they are in the driver repository. I have alot of dll files that are duplicated ending with .exe.</p>
<p>when I ran the attrib comand I stoped it about 3 seconds after I started and still could not see the begaining when I scrolled up. it just seams like a lot to be on a fresh drive. I just replaced the hard drive and installed windows from USB. When I set
 up I used My microsoft account to get started. I wanted to see what and how mutch data was on my disk while it was fresh. I have ran the comand before but never had this much data show up on the screen.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Brian
<br />
<br />You have nothing to worry about that driver repository folder is vast and contains many duplicates of Dll's and exe's this is all very normal, it basically contains all the common drivers that Windows can use for plug and play and also for a lot of known legacy devices  . . .

 location. It took me to a shortcut. I loged out of my computer and turned off the power after being in safemode. When I turned the computer back on it loaded into safemode. &nbsp;I was unable to load back in to anything other than safemode so I reset the computer

<h2>            Asus N56VZ black screen after windows install &#47; restore</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 1 year old Asus N56VZ which had Windows 8 pre installed. I decided to do a factory reset (there is a recovery partition on the hard drive) which would include formatting the C drive. The reset worked and I logged into windows 8 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The asus software and windows were doing updates and I left them overnight. The next morning I found the laptop on but with a blank black screen - no mouse cursor, nothing. I pressed the power button for &nbsp;4 seconds to power off which it did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then switched it back on and it comes on but the screen is black (back light is on). There is no hard drive activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now every time I switch on, I just get a blank black screen. I have tried pressing F9 or delete to get into the bios but nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i removed the hard drive and put it into a caddy so I could connect via USB to my other laptop and copy the data across (from the D drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>i reinstalled the hard drive into the Asus but there is no change whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have the license key for Windows or a DVD version of W8 and cannot access the bios either. In fact none of the key presses have any effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas what I could do?</p>
<p>Is there a way to do another reinstall from the recovery partition?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks :)</p>
<p />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue may occur due to the hardware damage.</span></p>
<p><span>Since you are not even able to login to BIOS this could be due to the SMPS, Display or RAM issue.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Are you getting any kind of beep sound?</span></p>
<p><span>2. What happens when you try to login to BIOS? Do you receive any error message?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may remove the Battery and connect to the AC adapter and check if it makes any different.</span></p>
<p><span>You need also contact the

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply... I did remove the battery and used the AC adapter to power the laptop and it started up fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated to Windows 8.1 Update 1 and all was fine until this morning when i got the black screen again. Again, i removed the batter and used the power adapter and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do anyone have any idea why this happens with the battery in the laptop? Is it a hardware problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again !</p>

            <p>Do you know if the computer instaled the Windows 8.1 upgrade? I had the same issue when updating to Win 8.1. I did a system refresh, and the computer was back to normal with Win 8.0. I read somewhere that this issue had something to do with the graphics
 card driver, not a hardware issue per se. Maybe you can try this before having to send some serious bucks in hardeware.<br />

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>Thank for being there.</p>
<p>Im using a PC with a MSI 81M P33 motherboard with onboard Intel(R) HD Graphics.</p>
<p>Installed memory (RAM) 8GB</p>
<p>Monitor SyncMaster 720N</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this setup with Windows 7 before I upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I tried to upgrade the motherboard's driver to suit windows 10.</p>
<p>I also tried to remove some software which I felt could be the cause, problem still persisted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much</p>
<p>ed</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The error that you are having happens when your computer encounters something it doesn’t know how to process. Meaning, there are old drivers that are in conflict with your new driver. To fix this, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Boot your computer in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Safe Mode</a>.</li><li>Once in Safe Mode, uninstall your graphics driver. </li><li>After removing the graphics driver, restart your computer.</li><li>Download the most updated graphics driver from the manufacturer and install it. If it ask to restart your computer for the changes to take effect, do so.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Give us an update on the result. </p>
