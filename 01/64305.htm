<h2>             Lack of Avatar Clothing for women</h2>
                    
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Whats up with the Avatar Marketplace?</span></p>
<p>Let me start with saying this.</p>
<p>As we know&nbsp; the Avatar marketplace has been releasing items&nbsp; for quite some time now.&nbsp; And something has been bothering me quite some bit...</p>
<p>Women don't get near the same amount of clothing&nbsp;items compared to the guys. "For instance", Look at the clothing brands, "Billabong, Creature, Santa Cruz &amp; Independent. Boys get&nbsp; 27 items in Billabong clothing &amp; women get 6 items.
 Why is it that the guys get Shorts, Flannels, T-shirts, Tank-Tops, pants &amp; hoodies?..&nbsp;And all&nbsp;that the girls get are Beanies, hats&nbsp;&amp; Skateboard props?&nbsp; i feel a lack of released items for women.&nbsp; Guys have a total of 192 tops at this time &amp; girls have 120.</p>
<p>i find this alil messed up.. Even when the South park clothing was released i wanted a t-shirt for my avatar but there wasnt any for the girls.. Girls got 11 items with only the&nbsp;gangs hats &amp; props..&nbsp; The Guys got 23 items &amp; got
 the gangs full outfits, t-shirts &amp; props.</p>
<p>I guess my question is, why isnt something being done about this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>graver, &nbsp;more and more females are playing games than ever before, and if microsoft were to include more female avatar items then this would attract more females to gaming, knowing that they will not be excluded in the gaming world, and rather be welcomed
 in. I myself know that from a womens perspective, some are often intimidated from getting into games because of the lack of features aimed at women, or to welcome women in. Another thing that often annoyed me was that we hardcore female gamers are often patronised
 by only given cutesy avatar items, and cutesy games aimed at us. While of course, as any other female, i love cutesy things, but am also partial to a bit of mw3 and a portal gun prop. I wanted to dress up as jack skellington, but jacks costume was only available
 for male avatars, so i had to make do with the lounge pants and shirt instead. I think Microsoft need to keep more up to date with the times, and realise there are more girl gamers around then ever before. They could at least make the majority of their avatar
 clothing unisex, available to both geners of avatar.</p>

<p>I don't know why they have items that only fit one *** in the first place. I want to get a Final Fantasy XIII shirt of Lightning but no. All of the T-Shirts featuring the female characters are for girls only.

            Generally speaking, you may be given the option of where to install to during the actual installation itself. If it doesn't present this, then you are out of luck. Sorry!<br />

            You may be able to install it on another drive but it will have components on "C" and will run on "C" so why would you want to?<br />
<br />
If it is a large program (like photoshop) and you want to save space there are other ways.<br />

            <p>I have a small SSD 60GB hard drive "C" so running out of space and when I download a program and want&nbsp;to install&nbsp;it, it just goes and installs to the "C" drive without asking where to install the program.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Microsoft Office 2010 from drive "F" where I was able to direct the installation to and I haven't got any problem running all the different components.</p>

            <p>There is no DOS prompt in win7, there is a cmd prompt which only gives access to certain commands. Typeing help at the cmd prompt gives the cmd listing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a program doesnt have a custom install option then its a badly written program, and cannot be installed on another drive.</p>
<p>Even if you install to the none system drive many files will be written to the system drive</p>

            <p>Microsoft Office 2010 is installed on my "F" drive with 618MB.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Can you tell me how I can install Microsoft Silverlight on my drive "F" as once it is downloaded if I click on the downloaded .exe file
 it installs to the "C" drive without allowing me to install to another drive. This program alone is taking 41 MB on my "C" drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Why can't Microsoft include the "Add new program" that was part of the previous versions of Windows? All these Microsoft geniuses working
 in Windows should be able to cram this in the Windows 7 without any difficulty and it would be a great service to the community.
</p>
<p>Thanks for the help</p>

            <p>You cannot, probably because silverlight has to be installed to the system drive.</p>
<p>On this particular system the C drive, with libraries located on a seperate drive, consumes 130GB less 8.5gb of program files (which includes Ofice)&nbsp;and 20gb of downloads leaving about 100gb for the system</p>

            Unfortunately, Microsoft had originally designed Windows so as to have every program on drive C.&nbsp; Newer and never versions of Windows programs stated to have a different install drive option but some developers still do not provide such an option.<br />
<br />
Silverlight is not a normal "program" but a Windows "component" and it needs to reside with Windows.<br />

            the games won't even show up on the facebook APP but if you open up IE or Chrome and go to Facebook that way you will see the games and be able to play them.

<p>With the install disk you can format the hard drive during the install. Backup important files first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Format a Partition/Hard Drive with the Windows 7 Installation DVD </strong>
<br />
<br />
You can format a partition with the Windows 7 installation DVD: <br />
1. Boot from the DVD <br />
2. Click Install Now <br />
3. At the setup screen, click Custom (Advanced) <br />
4. Click Drive Options <br />
5. Select the partition(s) you want to format - make sure you chose the CORRECT partition<br />
6. Click Format - this will delete EVERYTHING on that partition <br />
7. Create a new partition.<br />
8. Continue with install on the formatted drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If Windows 7 was preinstalled:</strong></p>
<p>OEM computer manufacturers are required to provide one way of reinstalling Windows 7. You should have either 1) a restore partition on your hard drive (check your manual), or 2) Windows 7 install/restore disks. Unfortunately most only provide a restore partition.<br />
<br />
Contact the OEM computer manufacturer and ask them to send you an install disk for your computer - they may or may not do it. If they agree to send you one they may charge a small fee.<br />

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets start with my laptop. I own a Lenovo Y510p laptop with windows 10 installed on it. Hopefully there is no problem in the device because I could connect to my home wifi without any trouble. My college has a special log in system where you have to manually
 set up a connection and put your own credentials. Ill write the procedure;</p>
<p>Security type: WPA2-Enterprise</p>
<p>Encrytion: AES</p>
<p>Network authentication method: PEAP</p>
<p>Uncheck verifying servers identity by validating...</p>
<p>Check Specify authentication mode and select user only then put ur credentials.</p>
<p>I did all this but it doesnt connect at all. I seek help from IT but they couldnt solve it. It instantly says Cant connect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome and thank you for posting your query in&nbsp;Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your issue description, I understand that you are only unable to connect to college Wi-Fi. Since you are getting no issue with connecting to home Wi-Fi network, I suggest you to contact your college IT for support. There should be some setting which
 is preventing it to connect to Wi-Fi. I suggest you to contact them for assistance regarding this issue, Furthermore have a look at this article and check if it helps:</p>

                    I bought a Surface Pro 4 last year, November. My issue is half of my screen start shaking, erratically. I only use laptop for writing papers and research purposes, never do heavy stuff or download heavy files.

<p>Hi Sankalp,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be experiencing this problem on your Surface Pro 4 because of a hardware or software issue. We'd like to ask some questions for us to know what to look into. Kindly answer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the problem start after installing new programs or updates?</li><li>When does the issue usually start to occur? Is there a specific program or activity that triggers it to happen?</li><li>Does the shaking stop by itself or do you have to do anything to end it?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest you check the update history of your device to see if an update started the problem. For your reference in checking the update history, you can open
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023505/surface-install-surface-and-windows-updates?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this link</a>. Go to the <strong>See your update history</strong> section of the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hi Ruz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your prompt response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, I am not sure it happened due to the updates or new programs. However, I experienced some coloured flickering; it happens when I scroll down, which is too minute to notice sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen shaking started since yesterday, to be specific October 19. Also, I noticed it shakes half of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Indeed, the screen shaking stops by itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>Sankalp</p>

            Honestly, I am not sure what you are saying. However, this problem is widespread among the users of Surface Pro 4. On the other hand, Surface Pro 4 community members seemed quite confused to resolve this 'shaking' issue, as they don't have any relevant
 and legitimate answers. In my view, this problem is more from Microsoft updates than the individual users. Rest is up to you.

<p>It is Microsoft RESPONSIBILITY to fix this.&nbsp; I have the same issue.&nbsp; All forums suggest it is a hardware issue.&nbsp; Don't waste time on the help lines / installing software.&nbsp; This is serious.</p>

            What is a 'phantom touch input' - why do call it that when all USERS have described it as a 'shaking issue' which is completely different from touching issue?&nbsp; Just be honest and say, we don't know what is happening but we are working on it and will resolve
 asap.&nbsp; And for those of you who bought the Surface 4 outside the USA here is where you can go for help - and then give out a list of indeed where one can go for help please...... please..... thank you.

<h2>            Changed D partition to active to try to fatory reset - Can&#39;t restart</h2>
                    <p>HP laptop with windows 7 home premium.&nbsp; - windows 10 installed on its own. I put it back to 7. Had issues with reboot loops and apdata files empty for some programs that would not delete, update or repair, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tried to do image backup 5 times to external
 drive and failed.&nbsp; Made "transfer copies of personal files". Tried to make repair disk.. nothing happened.&nbsp; and tried to do a factory reset. Got an error telling me the backup drive was not available, to insert repair disks. Tried repair disk from my PC..
 would not run.&nbsp; Would not access on reboot with disk in drive.&nbsp; Tried several fixes found on HP forum... none worked.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On drive manager D drive shows as being there, and containing 18+gb worth of stuff, 2 or 3 gb available. Yet when I tried to open it is said the folder was empty.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All attempts to reset to factory failed because this file is there but it isn't..&nbsp; I tried changing that D partition to active and rebooting to see if it would restore from that.. as per advice on HP's support forum page.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I get failed restart because
 device is unavailable. Have tried F10 on startup to change boot order trying to get it to re-install from the PC repair disk. No go.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This computer came with windows 7 factory installed. No original install disks.&nbsp;&nbsp; I think going from 10 and then back to 7 messed up the recovery partition.&nbsp; Also 'restore to earlier date is only keeping restore points from the past couple weeks. Full restore
 back to 7 going back on the computer was further back. </p>
<p>
</p><p>All attempts to order recovery disk from HP go in circles.... no way to submit or get free phone assistance from them since laptop is beyond warranty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have ordered windows 7 recovery disks elsewhere online.. but while waiting for those is there anything
 else I need to do, or could try to get it to at least boot up to desktop again.&nbsp; I keep getting the text screen saying "startup failed..." "... required device is inaccessible"&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>At the moment I've taken the battery out on the advice of a friend.. who said to remove the battery for an hour or two and then put it back and restart.. but since i fiddled with the drive settings we're both thinking the battery trick is unlikely to help.&nbsp;
 I probably should have come here for advice before fiddling around on my own.&nbsp;&nbsp; But all the forum notes mentioned "starting up with F11" etc.. that wasn't working on the computer either.&nbsp; The F10 bios thing is the only thing I can access on startup.. but I
 have no idea what to do with that at this point that might fix the computer.. is there something I'll need to do in Bios before trying the repair disks when they get here?</p>

</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Re-build Windows 7 </strong></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you had or have Windows 10 installed</strong>, you are unlikely to ever get Windows 7 working again satisfactorily unless you do a complete re-install.&nbsp; The Windows 10 reverting program just does not do the job correctly, and will leave your system
 in a state that you will not find satisfactory.&nbsp; &nbsp;In this case, a System Repair disk is not going to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you have a corrupted Windows 7 system</strong>, you are trying to recover, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that
 has windows 7 with the same bitness (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp; You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best alternative strategies to rebuild are the following in preference order:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it.&nbsp; You access this before Windows starts using a special key that can varies by brand.&nbsp; F11 is the most common. This is an option only if the installed
 hard drive is the original.</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp;(<em>This is not an option when recovering from a Windows 10 installation</em>). You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose
 that.</li><li>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; If you are not using a brand new disk, when it shows the screen to select where you want to put Windows, click on the Advanced link and delete all partitions.&nbsp; Do not install
 any software until after ALL Windows Updates are installed and Device Manager shows all devices installed.</li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp;
<em><strong>If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.</strong></em></p>

            <p>Thankyou for the quick honest reply.&nbsp; I do not have an original install disk since the computer came pre-loaded.&nbsp; I don't know anyone that has one I can borrow either.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I will have to purchase a new copy of Windows 7 then.&nbsp; Still cheaper than trying to buy a whole new laptop!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm actually relieved that there may be a way to fix the computer after all - was really afraid I may have turned it into a brick.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might have more questions in a few days once get the new install disk. </p>

            <p>Thankyou Canadiantech!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got an install disk with Windows 7 64 bit for "refurbished pc", and thankfully it came with a registration key. &nbsp;&nbsp; It took me a while to get the computer to actually look at the disk as the function keys still seemed to not always
 work on restart.. it was trial and error finding a menu option to force the computer to boot from the cd drive rather than the hard drive.&nbsp; But I got it there, deleted all the partitions and let it install.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Antivirus back on, and ready to re-install other programs and dump my photos and music back into it.&nbsp; YAY!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One question.. I see in the Computer screen listing drives now.. no longer a D: Recovery drive.&nbsp; Actually D: is now designated to the cd/dvd drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I go about rebuilding a recovery partition? Or is that not possible or not worth the trouble to fiddle around with now that things are running ok?</p>

            <p>I believe it is likely the Win10 install wiped out your recovery partition.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do yourself a favour.&nbsp; BEFORE you install any apps or Data, or AV, do this.&nbsp; If you do this, you will never again have to re-install, need a disk or a product key.</p>

Clean Install tip
</p><div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<em><strong>before</strong> </em>any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<em><strong>+</strong></em>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive, you will have a precise duplicate of your system as
 it was at that point.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for PLUS R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>

            <p>Actually I was just about to try to save an image backup file directly to an external hard drive.&nbsp; I was able to use that function to fix my PC after I had the same win7, win10, win7 issue.&nbsp; That computer at least the D:recovery partition wasn't damaged
 so it worked.&nbsp; Unlike the laptop wher that partition got messed up.&nbsp; When I tried it with the laptop it kept failing right at the end, probably since the recovery drive was messed up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have 2 problems on the laptop since the rebuild. I'd like to resolve (or decide to ignore)&nbsp; before doing an image backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - I cannot get the touchpad to turn off so I can type without bumping it or dropping a thumb even near it and sending the cursor all over the place while typing. Touchpad will not turn off when I plug in a usb mouse which I prefer to use.&nbsp; Under mouse
 settings the touchpad is listed as a mouse plugged into the internal mouse port.. This computer has always had it like that but the option to disable when USB mouse is in use is not there. The option for disabling the internal mouse port in that screen is
 grayed out, so I can't even do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- Screen savers will not run.&nbsp; "The screen saver can't run because it requires&nbsp; a newer video card or one that's compatible with direct3D.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are these issues possibly because I used a PC install disc rather than one for Laptops?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can live without the screensaver if there is no easy way to fix it, since the sleep function still works.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the mouse vs. touchpad.. I never use the touch pad. I prefer mouse.. would it be ok to just go into the port manager and uninstall the internal mouse port?&nbsp; That seems to be the only option I have that might work... or should I try a windows 7 repair
 disk (I ordered one that should be here in a few days) Would that correct a PC install on laptop if that indeed is the issue?</p>

            <p>You are going to spend many, many hours with a likely outcome at the same point.&nbsp; Save yourself some time now and do a re-build of Windows 7.&nbsp; Delete all partitions except for the OEM partition during the install process.</p>

            <p>I thought that was what I just did...option 3 from your first reply. Deleted partitions and did a clean install. Only have C drive partition now. Maybe I just need to let it do some more reboot updates. I thought it was done yesterday but today it had a
 bunch more. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't care if the screensaver works or not but the touchpad issue is a bother. I can't even shut it off by pushing the led button on the top corner.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The install disk I used was for "refurbished pc"... should I have gotten one that was specifically for laptop?</p>

            <p>Sorry.&nbsp; My misunderstanding.&nbsp; Glad you did the clean install.&nbsp; A windows install disk is a windows install disk. The only install disk that would have been different is one that would have been made for your specific make/model PC that comes with the drivers
 for the unique features in that laptop.&nbsp; There isn't such a thing as a laptop disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can deal with that by going to the support site of that make/model and finding, downloading and installing the drivers.&nbsp; One of them should be the touchpad driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you download and install the OEM touchpad driver, the software there should offer you the opportunity to shut if off or at least lower its sensitivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The majority of laptop users do not use their touchpads at all and disable them.&nbsp; Most use an external mouse, which actually is better for your hands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The built-in Win7 screen savers should work.&nbsp; Have you tried using your photo folder as a screen saver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What kind of "windows 7 repair disk?"&nbsp; The only repair disk you should use is free and you can make it yourself in 5 minutes.&nbsp; It is called System Repair Disk.&nbsp; &nbsp;All you need is a blank recordable CD.&nbsp; Start, All programs, Maintenance.&nbsp; Use that disk to
 Boot the PC and it will load its own OS and offer repair options. NO, it will not fix the problems you describe.&nbsp; This disk can be useful sometimes to repair a system that will not boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can not replace the video in your system, so you will have to live with that limitation.</p>

            <p>That's ok.&nbsp; I was unable to make a repair disk from the laptop. I tried using a repair disk I made from desktop after restoring THAT one from the same kind of update issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; Laptop would not accept that repair disk for the factory wipe.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The install disk I used, I ordered online fairly cheap (Amazon) &nbsp; It was a system rebuild disk for refurbished pc. It&nbsp; came with a new key code, which I did use. This laptop was refurbished when I got it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I can ignore the screen saver issue for now.&nbsp; If I have issues with viewing other video things I'll come back to that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sleep mode still works so that's fine for what I use the computer for.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is ok then to disable the "internal mouse" touchpad by uninstalling the driver for it?&nbsp; (or l at least uninstalling it until I have time to hunt own an HP laptop touchpad driver...&nbsp; I've found so far, the HP customer service stuff to be very limited,
 especially for computers that are way beyond "warranty expired".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I'm in the middle of a family crisis and it may be while before I can get to it, but I need to use the laptop and this touchy touch pad is driving me nuts while I type.</p>

I have 2 card readers, one says I need to format the card which is ****. And it does not even recognize my built in card reader. Thanks for forcing people to upgrade without having some essential things fixed. Any suggestions? I have check updating drivers, and all of that already. Went through device manager etc as well.

<p><strong>try clicking tools; click updates.</strong></p>
<p><strong>---</strong></p>
<p><strong>or click the drop down arrow on the bar where the icon should be; </strong>

            I'm running out of ideas. Please note that even if you don't have the app, and you don't reserve, you can still get the free upgrade to Windows 10 using .ISO files. You will need to make a bootable disk to install it.

            <p>Sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using an .ISO file is just another way to install Windows. All the setup files are condensed into 1 file, called the .ISO file. Using a special tool, you can extract the .ISO file to a DVD or USB drive, which can then be used to install Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a fairly simple process, and it doesn't require any special knowledge. There's lots of great wiki articles right here on the Community you can use to help you, and you can always ask.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The .ISO files for Windows 10 should be set for 7.29 or so.</p>

    <title>Windows Server 2008 and Time - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steven welsh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Server 2008 and Time</h2>
                    <p>I have recently taken a position which has me learning at a geometric rate.&nbsp; My server knowledge is fundamental and I am involved with 3 Server 2008 and&nbsp;Linux Mailserver. (I have not even started looking at Linux - Eeeek!)</p>
<p>Anyway, feeling my way with all of this,&nbsp;i have a situation whereby the PDC (I think that is what it is called) has the time off by about 10 minutes.&nbsp; Subsequently every PC in the building is off as I guess they are set to follow the PDC (I believe i have
 2 DC's).&nbsp; I typed in <em>net time</em> into a Cmd prompt and it pointed toward one of the servers i have.&nbsp; I assume that this defined that this was the server dishing out time across the network.</p>
<p>I started by just changing the clock on the server.&nbsp; (Told you I was green).</p>
<p>I then found the following article: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/816042" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/816042</a></p>
<p>Aha, i thought, nice and easy, follow the instructions but, then after step 4 i found:
</p>
<p>"<strong>Note </strong><var>Peers</var> is a placeholder for a space-delimited list of peers from which your computer obtains time stamps. Each DNS name that is listed must be unique. You must append
<span>,0x1</span> to the end of each DNS name. If you do not append
<span>,0x1</span> to the end of each DNS name. If you do not append
<span>,0x1</span> to the end of each DNS name, the changes that you make in step 5 will not take effect."</p>
<span>,0x1</span> to the end of each DNS name, the changes that you make in step 5 will not take effect."</p>
<p>Disaster!!!&nbsp; What does this mean?&nbsp; Peers are clearly not people with bladder issues but, if my&nbsp;understanding is correct, these are locations dishing out the correct time externally.&nbsp; However, this may be completely whacked and this may be part of the distribution
 of time internally.&nbsp; I JUST DON'T KNOW!!!</p>
<p>What about the DNS?&nbsp; How did this get involved?&nbsp; Do i need to worry about it.&nbsp; As i wanted to learn, i was avoiding Mr Fixit but, should i just blindly let him take the lead.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Can someone just invent a time control GUI?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i started to look at just doing this internally, (other option in the above KB) it started going on about not letting the PDC not synchronising with itself.&nbsp; How do I stop that.</p>
<p>I have people moaning about the Computer times being off and i cannot rectify.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be truly gratefully appreciated. In respect of your answers, I humbly await.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

            So that article discusses quite a bit more than you need to know to sync from a time server.&nbsp; It's a good article but overload if you're just starting out.<br />
<br />
Here's how to sync your PDC's time with an external time source.<br />
<br />
Open Command Prompt and copy/paste the following:<br />
<br />
w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:"0.time.windows.com 1.time.nist.gov" /syncfromflags:manual /reliable:yes /update<br />
<br />
That should be it.&nbsp; What it's doing is syncing with 1 of the 2 time servers - time.windows.com and/or time.nist.gov.&nbsp; You can add more by incrementing the numbers and adding the time server you want.&nbsp; You can also replace the two I included if you like as well.<br />
<br />
All of this assumes you're on a Physical Domain Controller.&nbsp; If your DCs are virtualized, you most likely will have to run the command on the Virtualization Host.
<br />
<br />
Also, in the future, anything server related is better posted on the Technet forums:<br />

<h3> scarlettwallace  say:</h3>
<h2>            Jensen SMPS-1000 Bluetooth Wireless Tower Speaker stopped connecting to my computer.</h2>
                    <p>I have a SMPS-1000 Jensen Bluetooth speaker/radio that I enjoy connecting to my computer to listen to music and videos with in my down time.&nbsp; All of the sudden, it just stopped working.&nbsp; It won't even show up as a sound device when I'm trying to select it
 as my main sound device.&nbsp; The only way I can get it to pair is if I remove it from my computer, then add it as a Bluetooth device.&nbsp; It never connects, though.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did my usual thing that tends to fix it, uninstalling it from devices and printers, resetting the actual Bluetooth device, then adding it as a Bluetooth device again on my computer, but that isn't helping anymore.&nbsp; I contacted the Jensen company, they
 said there were no special drivers that the speaker came with or needed.&nbsp; I don't know if this will help, but here's a picture of me trying to connect it and listen to music with it.</p>

            <p>Hi Scarlett,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li><li>Have you tried any other Bluetooth device on this computer? Was the result same?</li><li>Did you make any significant changes prior to the issue?</li><li>Are all the device drivers and Windows updates updated?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Try the below methods and see if it works for you.</p>
<p>

<p>I once was able to send images to my computer from my phone through Bluetooth, but I can't figure out how to do it again.&nbsp; No, I don't recall making any major decisions worth noting when it comes to changing the system.&nbsp; Just deleting the win 10 files.&nbsp;
 All drives seem to be up to date except my Nvidia graphics card, but that shouldn't effect anything relating to Blue tooth.&nbsp; I've tried updating my audio related stuff, but every time I do, it says that they're already up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>&nbsp; I tried the troubleshooter, it found one thing that wasn't working correctly, but then it fixed it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it didn't help with my problem.</li><li>&nbsp; For the Bluetooth support service, it was already on.&nbsp; I restarted it, but to no avail.</li><li>&nbsp; Audio Sink and Remote Control were already selected as I have tried that before.&nbsp; There was no Hands-free Telephony option.</li></ol>
<p>
Checking through My Windows updates again, I found a few I hadn't installed yet.&nbsp; Here's a picture below.&nbsp; None of them are a Win 10 update, right?&nbsp; I don't want Win 10.&nbsp; If it's there, which one do I avoid to not accidentally invite that thing into my computer?<br />

 has NO PROBLEM finding the device...&nbsp; It still doesn't play music, however.&nbsp; This is getting really frustrating, especially when the people I'm trying to get help from aren't listening to me one bit.&nbsp; The bluetooth speaker is there.&nbsp; It's the SMPS-1000 you
 see in the picture.&nbsp; It's literally right there.&nbsp; I removed the device, then re-added it to my devices a hundred times already.&nbsp; It's not going to work.&nbsp; It's not that simple.&nbsp; The devices get added, but don't work.&nbsp; I can't do anything with them.&nbsp; Now please,
 try to provide me with an actual solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there is absolutely nothing wrong with the Bluetooth speaker.&nbsp; I paired and connected it to my phone and it plays music from my phone just fine...&nbsp; Just not with my computer.&nbsp; The computer is the issue, but I don't know how to fix it.</p>

<h2>            Is there a way to activate Windows Hello without having to buy an extra camera&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows Hello unavailable</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to activate Windows Hello without having to buy an extra camera? I have a webcam and I removed the IR filter and I'd like to try out Windows Hello, but even though the setting can be found in the search function, it won't show up in the actual
 settings menu. I've read online that you're supposed to get a certified camera with 3D technology, but spending at least 100 USD just for a log in method is way too much money for me and I doubt the function will be used by a significant amount of people this
 way. I also doubt the technology is 3D only anyway, as the Lumia 950 only has one lens to look at your iris.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a developer version or something that lets you choose a different device? Or perhaps a way to fool Windows into thinking the camera has 3D technology so it can just try to scan my iris? I tried installing the Intel driver, but it failed as it didn't
 recognize my camera. I understand Microsoft doesn't want any consumer to use any device in order to ensure Windows Hello always works well, but completely removing the option is something I do not understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hi Simon,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows Hello is a more personal way to sign in to your Surface with just a look or a touch. The front-facing camera recognizes your face and iris, allowing you to sign in to Windows 10 without
 having to touch the screen or keyboard. </span></p>

<p>My question is why should I be not able to use my fingerprint scanner (and the "Hello") because I don't have a suitable camera?</p>
