<h3> victoria_862  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 fails auto repair &#38; triggers BitLocker recovery key</h2>
                    <p>My Surface Pro 3 is just past 1 year warranty repair purchased from BestBuy. It started to fail to recharge past 46%, then stopped starting at all unless it was connected to AC power. I followed MS troubleshooter for the condition that PC will not start
 using battery, and unit comes on under power but is not charging. &nbsp;After following all steps including removing battery driver, the troubleshooter declared my Surface Pro needed service. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when i try to powet it up, it issued message that Automatic Repair needed to be done and a restart attempted. This continued as a loop over and over perhaps 8 or 10 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, trying again a BitLocker message comes up saying i need a recoverykey to access the drive. I do not think I saved a copy of the recovery key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I stuck? &nbsp;Bring it back to BestBuy? Throw it in tge trash?</p>

<p>Hi nacienancon,</p>
<p>In what way doesn't it work? What is happenning? Do you get any error messages?</p>
<p>You haven't given us a lot to go on so more information is needed. May be with a little more information someone can give you some help.</p>
<p>Have you, for example, checked Device Manager to see if you CD drive is listed or whether it is, according to Windows, working correctly, or has a yellow exclamation mark next to it? Go to Control Panel (Start&gt;Control Panel) and click on the Device Manager
 icon. In Device manager look for CD/DVD-ROM Drives. Click the arrow to expand the menu list. You should see your CD/DVD-ROM drive. Right click on this and select Properties. Look on the General tab and check the 'device status.'</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total
<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -
<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue
<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose
<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314060</span></a>&nbsp;- a Mr Fixit</p>
<p>Manually try this fix if the 314060 Fixit did not work<br />
<a href="http://www.pchell.com/hardware/cd_drive_error_code_39.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pchell.com/hardware/cd_drive_error_code_39.shtml</span></a><br />
<br />
The CD drive or the DVD drive does not work as expected on a computer that you upgraded
<br />
to Windows Vista<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929461</span></a><br />
<br />
When you insert a CD or a DVD, Windows Vista may not recognize the disc<br />

<br />
CD/DVD drive does not appear in Windows Vista, or you receive this error during Windows
<br />
Vista setup after booting from the DVD (AHCI)<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD
<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others
<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some
<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.
<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and
<br />
the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course
<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as
<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD
<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />
<br />

    <title>Changed on color depth now no picture - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cajuncartfan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changed on color depth now no picture</h2>
                    <p>I was playing around with my settings after I hooked my Xbox One up to my PC&nbsp;monitor. Picked the wrong color depth and now I can't get a picture. I have the Call of Duty Advanced Warfighter Edition Xbox One and I have tried to do the hard reset as I have seen others state to do to boot into low resolution mode but to no avail. I don't have physical buttons on this Xbox One just capacitive type buttons with custom effects. Any ideas on how I can boot up into low res mode?</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Ok, I figured out that the Xbox One was indeed booting in low res mode ny hooking it back up to my tv temporarily. I was able to set the settings to what they needed to be for PC&nbsp;monitor with no issues. Once I hooked it back up by HDMI to my Dell monitor I have no video. The monitor is on but no picture. So, I hooked it up to my tv again and there is no issues with it. Hooked back into my PC&nbsp;monitor and there is still no video. I have audio and the screen is not a sleep as it is gray but no interface can be seen!</p>

</p><p>Hey there,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sorry to hear the issue is occurring on your monitor still. Have you tried adjusting the color settings back what they were before the issue started occurring?&nbsp;Were these settings adjusted on the monitor itself?&nbsp;If the issue persists, reaching out to the manufacturer of the monitor you own for further troubleshooting will be the next best step since this is isolated to that specific monitor.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Apologies for any frustration this issue has caused so far, but feel free to keep us posted on how it goes!</p>

    <title>Cannot make purchases on Live, add credit cards, or use Paypal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chef mcm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot make purchases on Live, add credit cards, or use Paypal</h2>
                    
<p>I have seen other posts with this same problem dating back over six months, but there does not seem to be any evidence of a solution, or even an acknowldgement from Microsoft of the issue. &nbsp;I am posting to make sure that M$ is aware of this problem and to
 see if any progress has been made.</p>
<p>Problem: After having a functional Live account for years, I suddenly was presented with the following issues:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Cannot use any existing cards to make purchase on xbox console or on xbox.com. &nbsp;The error message on console I states "Sannot authorize payment method...' while on computer it states, '<span>Your payment instrument could not be authorized. Please contact
 your provider, or try a different payment option.'</span></p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Cannot use Paypal to make purchases on either xbox console or xbox.com &nbsp;Same error message as above.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Cannot &nbsp;add any new cards on xbox.com. &nbsp;I repeatedly receive error message stating 'invalid credit card number'</p>

<p>I first experienced the problem over a week ago, and have since spent hours with xbox support to no avail. &nbsp;I have tried the following solutions:</p>
<p>1. Verified xbox account has no holds or issues with Microsoft.</p>
<p>2. Tried 3 different cards from 3 different financial institutions, and checked that there are no holds or freezes on cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Waited well over 72 hours with no account activity to ensure there is not a fraud lock on my xbox account.</p>
<p>4. Cleared the system cache and marketplace cache on my harddrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note, that I have used these cards successfully in the past on Live, and I was currently able to still add and use them on a different Live account on my box and to make a successful purchase of points. &nbsp;I did this while on the phone with a support supervisor
 to demonstrate that it is not a problem with my card but is something on M$'s end, something specific to my account. &nbsp;Interestingly enough, I am still able to purchase xbox games on my windows phone. &nbsp;Additionally, I have checked everything else in&nbsp;<a href="http://live.xbox.com/MyXbox/Profile?gamertag=Mister+Gwyther" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mister
 Gwyther</a>'s thread on the topic of being unable to purchase content.</p>
<p>I feel that I have demonstrated far beyond a reasonable doubt that there is not an issue on my end of things, and that there is some problem with my live account. &nbsp;I am hoping to get some response on this issue. &nbsp;After first bringing in a supervisor to throw
 every excuse in the book at me that could possibly shift the blame to me (despite that I had done my homework and had ample evidence to the contrary), support finally admitted that things on my side look perfect to them, and that they cannot identify the problem.
 &nbsp;The issue was then escalated, and I am awaiting a reply (for up to 2 weeks apparently). &nbsp;Can any of the other people who have posted on the forums with this same issue and have had it escalated with support post if you have received any response and what
 it was? &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p>Also having the same problem. &nbsp;When I try to use my Paypal it states: This action cannot be performed at this time. Please try again later.</p>
<p>When I try to enter either my debit bank cards or my regular credit cards it states that I need to "enter a valid number". &nbsp;Nothing is working and I know it's not a money issue on my part and I know my bank isnt stopping the transaction. &nbsp;I tried 2 different
 bank accounts of mine and it still shows the same thing. &nbsp;The biggest problem is why it states my credit card numbers are invalid. &nbsp;I've tried it with no spaces, with spaces, with dashes... nothing works. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please post solutions.... need a resolution ASAP. &nbsp;Started my Netflix streaming subsciption the other day and if I can't buy a Gold Membership, I am just wasting money with Netflix.</p>

<h2>            Cannot find a way to activate Windows 7 starter</h2>
                    To cut a long story short. I have an Acer Netbook which previously had XP Starter edition installed. As Microsoft are ending all updates and product support for Win XP, I installed Windows 7 Home Premium edition on it to keep it secure. Unfortunately,
 due to a limited processor it didn't run well. I then installed the Windows 7 Starter Edition using an .iso file. Now, the problem is activating it. Unfortunately, when I try to activate Windows 7 Starter using my Windows 7 Home Premium key, it tells me "this
 product key is not supported for this edition of Windows". I got in contact with Microsoft who told me to contact Acer Support, so I did. Acer Customer Support told me that only Microsoft can issue Product Key's. This problem arose with the end of support
 and upgrades for XP. I understand that Microsoft cannot support a product forever, but it seems unfair that I can't use my Windows 7 Home key on a lower spec edition of the same operating system. It's not like I'm trying to upgrade t

            <blockquote>Please re-read. XP is being phased out, so there's zero point in re-installing it as Microsoft are phasing out patches and security updates. I did make recovery discs, but that's not the issue here at all. I could re-install
 XP in no time, but since it's going to be an obsolete OS in a few weeks, there's zero point.

<div>Windows 7 Starter is a stripped down version of Windows 7 Home Premium - specifically designed to be used in netbooks and computers with smaller processors. I purchased a RETAIL version of Win 7 home premium (it wasn't supplied by any computer manufacturer)
 and I would like to activate Windows 7 starter with it. It's the least Microsoft can do, given XP support is ending in April and I paid for Windows 7, which incidentally is intended to be supported until 2020. The problems exists because they will not make
 the licences interchangeable to a lower version of the same OS.&nbsp;</div>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Windows 7 Starter is not free and its not a retail product, it only came preinstalled on new Netbooks. You can install Windows 7 Home Premium and use it just like Windows 7 Starter on your Netbook. Albeit, you will have to do some customization like enable
 Aero Basic (right click desktop &gt; Personalization) and disable some components:</p>

<h2>            control panel says please wait until current program is finished uninstalling...  for 2 days</h2>
                    I have been trying to uninstall Conduit, Search Protect from my Sony Vaio for 2 days.&nbsp; I went to the Control Panel, clicked on the program and then clicked uninstall. That was 2 days ago and the program has not uninstalled yet.&nbsp; It is still listed in the
 Control Panel and when I click on it and click uninstall again it pops up the "Please wait until the current program is uninstalled or changed" box. How do I&nbsp; get it to finish uninstalling?

            Something like this:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Control Manager<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7035<br />
Description:<br />
The MpKsl6e227e70 service was successfully sent a start control.<br />
<br />
I thought I had that noted someplace, but can't find it...&nbsp; <br />
<br />
It is coming from Microsoft Security Essentials when it updates or does a scan (it might only be when it has an update to do).&nbsp; I think it is just a goofy random name so that if your system is afflicted with malicious software the malware will not recognize
 the service and try to kill it (like it might with some other things).<br />
<br />
When there is a MSE update, you will also notice a new Restore Point called:<br />
<br />
<b>Software Distribution Service 3.0</b><br />

<h2>            Ethernet cable might be unplugged or broken</h2>
                    <p>Excuse me sir,</p>
<p>My wifi was working fine till yesterday and i have wlan and i have never used a cable network. When i was gaming suddenly my wifi got disconnected and i could not reconnect to my wifi. I have tried the following steps below,</p>
<p>1)Update the drivers</p>
<p>2)Speed and buffer setting change</p>
<p>3)Checked the BIOS settings</p>
<p>4)Ran cmd commands</p>
<p>5)Ran the troubleshooter</p>
<p>6)Reinstalled the drivers</p>
<p>When i ran the troubleshooter i got an error message which said that my ethernet cable might be broken or unplugged.</p>
<p>So i thought that might be the problem and i checked&nbsp; my bios boot to see if my network could be recognized. I found out that it could not read my network, my wifi card. Could you please tell me if it is an hardware problem or can i fix it through some other
 troubleshooting step which I missed out thank you sir.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<span>P.S i could find my network adapters in boot settings.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>It is an os problem not hardware and the problem is still not fixed</p>
<p>Okay so i wanted to see if it was some glitch so i ran cmd and typed&nbsp;</p>
<p>netsh wlan show networks&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got the following result</p>
<p>Intereface name: Wifi</p>
<p>There are 0 networks currently visible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there i over 6 wifi networks near my house and i can use them on all other devices</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for all your replies I tried everything I will give it for service. Am sure it is some hardware problem and cannot be solved this way. Some part must have been damaged. Thank you for all your efforts.</p>

            <span>Hi vaibhavnayak,</span><br />
<span>go to Device Manager&gt; Network Adapters, select your wi-fi adapter&gt; Energy Saver tab, disable or deselect this option.</span><span>
</span><span>If you do not solve, try changing the driver for your Wi-Fi adapter by following this manual procedure:</span><br />
<span>1) Go to Device Manager&gt; Network Adapters, right click on the network card in use&gt; Update Driver.</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>
</span><span>2) Select "Search for driver software on your computer"</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>
</span><span>3) Select "Choose from a list of drivers available on your computer"</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>
</span><span>4) Windows will propose 2 or more compatible drivers for the network adapter. Select a different driver from the one currently in use&gt; Next. The driver will be installed automatically. Restart
 the PC.</span><br />
<span>Otherwise, download the latest updated driver version available from the PC manufacturer's or the network adapter's website and reinstall it.</span>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your query to Microsoft forum. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the methods below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Unplug all your removable media </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please unplug all your removable media from the computer except the keyboard and mouse, such as removable disks, memory cards and USB flash drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 2: Perform Clean boot and try to install Windows </strong></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Updates.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Perform <strong>Clean Boot</strong> which helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Note: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, follow method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> <strong>Reset Windows Update components and install the update.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<p>
</p><li>Press <strong>Start </strong>on the keyboard, type <strong>cmd </strong>in the search bar　and then select "<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)"</strong> from the menu.
<p>
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Stop the <strong>BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer</strong> and the <strong>
Windows Update Services</strong>. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the "ENTER" key after you type each command.
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>
</strong></p></li></ol>
<ul>
<li>net stop wuauserv </li><li>net stop cryptSvc </li><li>net stop bits </li><li>net stop msiserver
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>Now rename the <strong>SoftwareDistributio</strong>n and <strong>Catroot2</strong> folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the "<strong>ENTER</strong>" key after you type each command.
</p>
<ul>
<li>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old </li><li>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<li>Now, let’s restart the <strong>BITS</strong>, <strong>Cryptographic</strong>,
<strong>MSI Installer</strong> and the <strong>Windows Update</strong> Services. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.
<ul>
<li><strong>net start wuauserv </strong></li><li><strong>net start cryptSvc </strong></li><li><strong>net start bits </strong></li><li><strong>net start msiserver </strong></li></ul>
<p>Type <strong>Exit</strong> in the Command Prompt to <strong>close</strong> it.
</p>
</li><li>

<h2>            My gamertag is supposedly no longer allowed...</h2>
                    
<p>I tried to log into live today, and it wouldn't let me log in saying "In accordance with Xbox Live policy, the gamertag Anuscloud is no longer allowed. You must change your gamertag before playing online again" I would like to be able to resolve this without
 having to change my tag. I've had this tag for almost 2 years now with no problems until now.</p>
<p>I talked to a support member, and he said that it could have been reported for being inappropriate or offensive, my tag is neither. Anyone can report any name for being offensive by these terms. I could have my tag be "Marshmallow Monster" and someone could
 report it because they don't like marshmallows and I would be back in the same boat I'm in now. Or someone could just report your name because you happened to be doing better than them in a game.</p>
<p>All I would like to do is to be able to keep my current tag and continue playing. I don't believe this is an unreasonable request considering it is not offensive or inappropriate name, and I pay so much per month for my live account.</p>

 ban your account from Xbox Live, so keep your next gamertag tame. (And no, there is no exact number given for "too many".)</span></p>

<h2>            Sony Vaio downgrade to Windows 7 - recovery</h2>
                    <p>My Sony VGN AW 390j came with Vista. &nbsp;When 7 was available Sony upgraded me through download for free. &nbsp;I then tried out 10 and have recently had problems and the computer crashed. &nbsp;i successfully got Vista back from the recovery partition but cannot get
 7. &nbsp;Vista is pretty outdated and basically worthless at this point. &nbsp; I purchased Windows 7 from digitalproductkey.com and got a blocked key from them.</p>
<p>My dilemma now is to find out how to get my original windows 7 that was installed through digitall download from sony back?</p>
<p>thanks.</p>

<p>If you purchased the Windows 7 license and it has been blocked, you should check with Microsoft Support that why it is blocked and if there is problem with the retailer , then you should ask them about this.</p>
<p>If you got Windows 7 from Sony, you could contact their support and check with them.</p>
<p>Also, note that Windows Vista is no longer supported.</p>

<h2>            Get rid of silly search suggestions in new Cortana&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have installed Windows 10 Anniversary update and signed out of the Cortana 'Notebook.'&nbsp; In my Cortana Settings, I have turned everything Off (voice recognition, lockscreen, tidbits, notifications, history). I basically now have a local pc/web search box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question: Why does Cortana have to display silly search suggestions (i.e. 'play songs by Drake', 'Alaska flight 32', 'meaning of Spartan') when you start a search? Do they ever go away? I've seen all the suggestions; they just keep cycling through the same
 few ones. There seems to be no way to cancel them, even if you click on them once. I like the search box, but I would like to see these suggestions disappear. Is there some simple setting to do this that I am missing? Thanks.</p>

            There is no way to turn off those examples. &nbsp;They aren't even really actionable suggestions. &nbsp;So your only option right now is to ignore them and search for your own phrase instead. &nbsp;But please hit the Cortana settings menu and click "Feedback" to post
 your request, for sure.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>svchost.exe (Service Host, or SvcHost) is a system process which hosts multiple Windows services. It is essential in the implementation of so-called shared service processes, where
 a number of services can share a process in order to reduce resource consumption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes viruses can spoof themselves as system files.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b>Place the computer in clean boot and see if that helps:</p>

            <p><span>Tony</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here is my on-going list of things to do to reclaim disk space. Most of them are straightforward but if you feel apprehensive or unsure about running
 something, just ignore it. Here they are:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. It may sound strange but download WinDirStat, which shows where disk space is being used, including a nice graphical display. Just let the mouse pointer
 hover over the coloured areas to identify different file types and large ‘chunks’ of used space. Download it here
</span><a href="http://windirstat.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windirstat.info/</span></a><span> Remove the program after you’ve finished
 with it.</span></p>
<p><span>2.
</span><span>Reduce the amount of space used by system restore by g</span><span>oing to
</span><span>Control Panel &gt; All Control Panel Items &gt; System &gt; System Protection (in the left pane) &gt; System Protection Tab &gt; Configure and change the disk space allocation. Also, i</span><span>f you
 have a separate hard drive, more space can be released by moving the pagefile to it.
</span></p>
<p><span>3.
</span><span>Delete any temporary files that may be left over from CD and DVD burning. Navigate to the hidden folder
</span><span>C:\Users\User Name\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Burn\Temporary Burn Folder and d</span><span>elete all the files.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Remove any programs that are no longer used, via
</span><span>Control Panel &gt; </span><span>All Control Panel Items
</span><span>&gt; Programs and Features. You may also want to turn some Windows features off (in the left pane).</span></p>
<p><span>5. Disk cleanup removes unwanted files that accumulate over time. If you have installed SP1 (Service Pack 1) and are satisfied that it is behaving properly,
 a huge amount of disk space can be reclaimed, but be aware that SP1 can never be removed. Run it by going to Windows Orb (Start) &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools. Also, by going to the More Options Tab you have the option to remove all but the most
 recent restore point, which may include old backups. Be aware that by doing this you will lose all other restore points.</span></p>
<p><span>6. If you don't use Hibernation you can save almost the equivalent in hard drive space as the amount of RAM that is installed by turning it off. In a
 Run window</span><span> (Windows Logo key+R),
</span><span>type powercfg.exe -h off (note the two spaces) and press Enter. To turn it back on type powercfg.exe -h on and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Reduce the space used by the Recycle Bin by right-clicking the Bin &gt; Properties &gt; Custom Size and amend as necessary.</span></p>
<p><span>8. Remove any other files that you may have overlooked in the past, e.g. old videos, also look in the Downloads folder for unwanted items.</span></p>

            <p>Both Glary Utilities &amp; Advanced System Care are programs that should be avoided as are any ''SpeedUpMyPC' type programs, they are very likely to cause more problems than they claim to fix, some of which may render your system unuseable,</p>
<p>Win7 contains all the built in utilities to maintain your system, all the time you persist in using such spurious programs theres no telling how they have trashed your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any program sizes seen in Programs &amp; Features, remove a program, cannot be relied upon.</p>
<p>Your system, with a 300gb drive requires a minimum of 15% free space to function correctly (45gb)</p>

    <title>Abnormal CPU Usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rockysandman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Abnormal CPU Usage</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello, I am currently running my laptop from Safe Mode where
 my problem does not persist. Last Thursday, 31st of January, for the first time ever, a few minutes after my PC booted up, I saw the CPU usage icon pop up in the little corner with the other icons where you see it usually pop up when there's high CPU usage,
 but it was there for no reason. I mean, other than Chrome running a YouTube video page, I had no other application that I executed. What happened then was, the CPU usage jumped between random numbers and I experienced slowdowns, until it reached 100% of CPU
 usage, and the PC crashed. I tried rebooting. Even when I don't do anything at all other than turn on my PC in normal startup, the CPU usage continues to jump a few minutes after startup, jumping in random numbers of percentages before reaching 100% CPU usage,
 and then the PC crashes. This persisted this Friday and only in Safe Mode it's not happening. This is new problem for me that I have yet to come across and I don't know what might be the cause but I have some suspicions. I noticed particularly that the TrustedInstaller
 service seems to me to be acting abnormally and taking up some higher CPU usage or memory, but I might be wrong. I think I might be right about this because I've noticed that when I clicked the TrustedInstaller properties to go a directory that's related it,
 it was created right then, on the 31st of January, i.e. this Thursday, after snooping around a bit more I've seen that some Windows Update files have also been created that day. Now I recall seeing TrustedInstaller much earlier before Thursday and having no
 problem with it or related to it for a long time, I think I noticed that this service exists sometime last year, so it appears odd to me that it tells me that all of that has been created last Thursday with no prior history. On top of that, I seemed to experience
 abnormal internet connection, random disconnection every ten minutes or so, before immediate connection again, again all happening from this Thursday.</span></p>
<p><span>Even further than that and also adds on to the abnormality
 is that, as I try to type this message, when I type every several letters that I type, the position that I'm typing from changes, it jumps to somewhere on some earlier line that I typed. Only noticed that now as I'm typing.</span></p>
<p>Piecing all the pieces of the puzzle together, I
 suspect I might have malware or a virus, perhaps some sort of highjacker (?), on my computer. However this explanation seems to me unlikely to be the case, because on this laptop I have not once ever willingly accessed any dodgy website and always kept my
 anti-malware and anti-virus softwares turned on, along with the Microsoft Security Client, and I never downloaded an untrustworthy file on it either. And when my security tools did block potentially dangerous websites and files, I avoided them.<br />

<h2>            Huion 1060 Plus usb-device not recognized</h2>
                    The tablet, when connected to a computer, works normally for 1-2 minutes. After that, the system displays the message "usb-device not recognized" and the tablet stops working, but the slot for the memory card in the tablet continues to work. Repeated reinstallation
 of the latest tablet drivers does not solve the problem.&nbsp;The device and cable connections are fully functional and they worked correctly until the last system update.

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you review the following Microsoft guide:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/2654149/error-usb-device-not-recognized-when-you-try-to-access-a-usb-external" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/265414...</a>
<br />
<br />If issue persist i would suggest you to follow these Methods: 
<br />
<br />Method 1: Run the SFC.

<br />Follow the below steps:
<br />
<br />	1. Open Command Prompt.
<br />	2. Select “Run as Administrator”.
<br />	3. Type “sfc /scannow” without quotes and hit Enter.
<br />Now check for the issue.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Run the DISM Tool.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, I would have you run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.
<br />
<br />	1. Click on 'Start'.
<br />	2. Enter 'Command prompt' in the Search box.  
<br />	3. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command prompt, and then tap or click 'Run as administrator'. 
<br />	4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter.
<br />
<br />Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it.
<br />
<br />Method 3:
<br />
<br />Type the following in a Windows PowerShell as Administrator:
<br />
<br />1.Launch PowerShell 
<br />2.Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3.Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />
<br />Restart your device.
<br />

                    <p>I own 3 Xbox ones, 1 Xbox 360, 1 O.G. Xbox. You would think that I, my wife, and 4 year&nbsp;old can play any game, access Microsoft&nbsp;store purchased videos/Apps anywhere they want at any time they want. As digital purchases are the best way to purchase for us. Well you would be highly mistaken. Even with the wife having her own Xbox Live account on the S so she can play Pubg with me it really just muddies the issue even further. As well my daughter who is right beside her usually wants to play Minecraft or watch videos which I purchased regrettably on my account with a massive catalog of skins, worlds, game DLC purchases for just her and that one specific game..&nbsp; Soo, If I make the XBOX 1 my daughter likes to play "the home XBOX"&nbsp;she can at least play, however then the XBOX S that my wife uses becomes useless outside of her account walling her off from media already purchased if I am signed into the XBOX X in the front room&nbsp;which that XBOX X is actually being used as
