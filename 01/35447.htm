<h2>            Application opens and then disappears immediately need solution fast please.</h2>
                    <p>The application I am talking about is MATLAB.</p>
<p>I was using it this morning when my computer completely froze while MATLAB was running I had to complete a hard restart. Now whenever I try to open MATLAB, it will pop up and then disappear immediately in the taskbar. It won't even open as administrator.
 So I uninstalled it and downloaded it again and the problem is still there. Does anyone have a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running the most recent update for windows 10 on my Surface Pro as well as the most recent MATLAB.</p>

            Hi Fear.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />After uninstalling Matlab, restart PC, then check C:\Program Files in both folders for anything remaining to delete.  If necessary Take Ownership first:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />Also clean out any AppData files for the app in C:\Users|Your User Name\AppData folders after unhiding these in File Explorer &gt; View &gt; Options &gt; Change Folder and Search Options &gt; View &gt; enable Show Hidden Files , approve security box, Apply, Save.  
<br />
<br />Then restart PC and reinstall the app from a fresh download from its website.  
<br />
<br />If further problems contact the App Support to see if there is a known issue.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to your query, please be informed that most of the services that you see in the "services" window are essentials services that allows your computer to run smoothly so we would not recommend stopping the services. However, you can check if there
 are any unnecessary startup items that is causing the system to slow down. To check, press Ctrl + Shift + Esc keys to open task manager, click the startup tab. The programs in startup tab opens and loads automatically every time you turn on the computer. Disabling
 some of these programs can make the computer perform faster. If you see any unwanted programs, right click on it and disable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance, we will be glad to help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to your query, the performance of the operating system depends on the configuration of your computer. Therefore, disabling or enabling the services might or might not improve the speed of the operating system. You can also try freeing up the
 disk space to allot more space to your computer which could be hampering the performance of the system. For help on how to free disk space, refer the article below:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10/how-to-free-up-disk-space-in-windows/2458cc31-bd19-482f-ace5-7e3bd9da8098">How to free up disk space in Windows</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, in order to find out what the different services does, simply click on each services and the description will be given on the left side of the window.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In response to your query, please be informed that any services set to automatic will automatically run when the service is required. However, for services set to "manual", you will need to manually run the service every time you want to run a program that
 requires that service. </p>

<p><strong><span>Not sure if this fits under the 'Hardware and Drivers forum', but I'll give it a try. I Have a Dell Studio 1557 urunning on Windows 7 and about a month ago, I would get a Blue Screen error every time on startup. I believe
 that the error was caused by 'trojan horse agent_rx.j'. This trojan horse was found by the free avg 2011 trial and I read some forums on the issue. I used tdss killer, when I could successfully log in which seemed to do the job. Then, just last night, I got
 another BSOD error, however, I thought that it was just due to the overheating of my laptop, as I had read in various that it easily overheats. Yet today, I received another BSOD error, about three times on three seperate startups. I still believe that it
 may be caused by my laptop overheating, however, I am starting to get concerned. When I successfully logged in on my laptop, I received this message:</span></strong></p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Two good sources of information on BCCode and Stop Code (known as Bug_Checks).<br />
<br />
MSDN - Bug_Checks<br />
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff542347.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff542347.aspx</a><br />

<br />
=======================================================<br />
<br />
Ditch the automatic driver programs as they will all fail eventually and at the worst time. Use<br />
the manually checking for driver methods in the troubleshooter. <br />
<br />
=======================================================<br />
<br />
Last known good configuration only reverts back to the last settings that seemed to work IF<br />
they were recorded. It will not erase your downloaded programs. System Restore is more<br />
involved than Last Known Good Configuration.<br />
<br />
Using Last Known Good Configuration &lt;-- this answers all your concerns<br />

<br />
=======================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving the Problem -</strong> is part of the data page from MSDN and can be a little cryptic.<br />
Basically the rest of the troubleshooter I wrote breaks those down in to simpler steps and<br />
adds a few other options.<br />
<br />
This a link to that complete page:<br />
<br />
Bug Check 0xC000021A: STATUS_SYSTEM_PROCESS_TERMINATED<br />

<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t Factory Reset Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an HP 635 computer with Windows 7. I want to factory reset it. The operating system however, isn't the original OEM, so this means that there is no HP Recovery Manager or things like that. The recovery partition has been damaged, and also wouldn't
 go into the factory reset.</p>

            <p>If the factory restore partition is no longer on your hard drive, and you do not have HP recovery disks, you can NOT do a factory restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best thing to do is to do a clean install.&nbsp; It is called "custom" in the install process.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If you are re-installing Windows 7 after Windows 10, this is the wrong advice, so stop here if that is the case.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy&nbsp;your data off first.&nbsp; If you can not start Windows 7, remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturerâs drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you have a corrupted Windows 7 system</strong>, you are trying to recover, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that
 has windows 7 with the same bitness (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp; You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best alternative strategies to rebuild are the following in preference order:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>âUpgradeâ install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp;You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose that.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is not a valid strategy on a failing hard drive.</li><li>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; If you are not using a brand new disk, when it shows the screen to select where you want to put Windows, click on the Advanced link and delete all partitions.&nbsp; Do not install
 any software until after ALL Windows Updates are installed and Device Manager shows all devices installed.</li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk and a legal product code and the win7 disk must match the edition (home, pro, etc) &nbsp;of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; If you can find
 it, a disk with SP1 (Service Pack 1) is going to save you many hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEVER install anything but Windows Updates until your system is up to date.&nbsp; Once you have the update list, install all of them together.&nbsp; Installing updates in batches will not speed the process or make it better.&nbsp; Next install the following :</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>KB3020369</strong> Win-7 32 <a href="https://download.microsoft.com/download/C/0/8/C0823F43-BFE9-4147-9B0A-35769CBBE6B0/Windows6.1-KB3020369-x86.msu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now proceed to Windows Update and begin the update process.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<em><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">before</span></strong>
</span></em>any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">+</span></strong></em>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive,
 you will have a precise duplicate of your system as it was at time you made this image.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for <strong>PLUS</strong> R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>

<p>Hi William,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This muted speaker could have happened due to corrupted or outdated drivers. To isolate your concern, we would like to ask the information below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes to your PC prior to the issue?</li><li>Have you attempted to perform any of the troubleshooting steps?</li><li>Have you tried setting up <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15054/windows-7-automatically-get-recommended-drivers-updates-hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows to automatically download the recommended drivers?</a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest that you right-click on Speaker Icon, then select Open Volume Mixer. Ensure that all speaker slider are set correctly and noting is selected to Mute. If anything is showing a Mute (I.e. red mute symbol), then try to clear it to
 see if it fix the issue. If problem still persist, try the steps below:</p>

    <title>Nvidia Quadro FX 1500M and Quadro FX 2500M Graphics Driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> srachal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nvidia Quadro FX 1500M and Quadro FX 2500M Graphics Driver</h2>
                    I upgraded from XP to Win 7 last year and it worked fine. Win update recently installed a new driver for my video card and it took two days for me to login to safe mode to remove it but when I removed the bad driver it took out all the Nividia drivers.
 When I try to install the driver from the dell site for my laptop, a Precision M90, it won't install because it says it's for Win XP and shuts down. I have looked on the Nividia site but 1500m and 2500m are not choices so I can't get the driver from the Nividia
 web site. I'm using the generic video driver in windows but it's not very good. How do I install the older driver that worked???????? I need my computer for school and work.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forums and thank you for posting the question. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like Windows update have installed a wrong driver for the display adpater and you are unable to install the actual driver for the card.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's go ahead and perform few troubleshooting steps and try to resolve the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have to download the driver for Windows XP&nbsp;from the manufacturer website and install the driver in compatibility mode.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try installing the driver in compatibility mode and check if that helps.
</p>
<p><span>To install the game in Compatibility mode,</span></p>
<p><span>1. Right click the installation file and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Under Compatibility mode, check the <strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for:</strong> option.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Select </span><strong><span>Windows&nbsp;XP </span></strong><span>from the available options.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

 it's running the standard VGA adapter not the Nvidia Quadro FX 1500m. Is this a hardware issue or a software problem? I was not having any issues before Windows update installed the non Nvidia created driver update which crashed my computer. Thanks.</span></span></font>

            With mfg's like DELL it is generally suggested to use their drivers, but not always.<br />
Try the one from Nvidia below - I think it's the most recent available for your card.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/quadro-win7-winvista-64bit-270.73-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/object/quadro-win7-winvista-64bit-270.73-driver.html</a><br />
<br />
When updating any graphics driver always uninstall via Programs and Features. <br />
Reboot before installing the new drivers.<br />
-If you have problems after installing the new drivers you may want to try the process again and<br />
after rebooting use Driver Fusion to clean files leftover after the uninstall. Reboot again before<br />
reinstalling the new drivers.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://treexy.com/external?url=http://download.cnet.com/Driver-Fusion/3000-2086_4-75748005.html?part=dl-&amp;subj=dl&amp;tag=button&amp;dlm=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Treexy external page</a>
<br />
<br />
-Using&nbsp; Device Manage to uninstall and reinstall drivers will often result in only generic Windows VGA driver being installed.<br />
-I wouldn't think that using a Compatibility setting would help with graphics drivers.<br />
<br />
If it installs at all, it may be worth trying a newer driver for the FX1600m. Stick with a WHQL version,<br />
and not necessarily the latest.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us</a><br />
<br />
btw - Programs like Driver Max are rarely much good, best to do a thorough search of the
<br />
mfg's site, and do a manual download and install.<br />
<br />

<br />
You have setup Windows updates to never install graphics drivers now ?<br />
Actually, it's safest to never let Updates install anything automatically. <br />
-Is it too late to roll back via System Restore ? <br />
If it is too late, there is an option in Programs and Features to <span style="font-style: italic">
View Installed Updates</span> as well. <br />
It may not help restore your original drivers, but if the driver update is still listed there you may want to uninstall that update anyway as it would facilitate installing the&nbsp; original drivers again, if you can source them.
<br />
<br />
<p><br />
Arcane knowledge ?&nbsp; ;)&nbsp; </p>
<p>- No, I just typed&nbsp; FX1500m Windows 7 driver in the search bar at the top of the main driver page
<br />
and browsed through the list of links it lead to.<br />
<br />
Oops - Sorry, I didn't actually hit the Download button. Imagine leaving a download page<br />
with a blank link on the site ???<br />
-I also got distracted with the FX1500m and didn't look for the FX2500m until now.<br />
It's looking a bit like these cards were specifically for DELL ? I see Nvidia don't list the 3500m either.<br />
This sort of thing does happen.<br />
I also missed that you upgraded from XP.&nbsp; When you did this were any new graphics drivers installed ?<br />
Where they Windows drivers ?&nbsp; Try the Vista drivers. There have been people using Vista graphics
<br />
drivers with success on Win7.<br />
Was this the page you used before ?&nbsp; -<br />
<br />
<br />
"I tried installing one of the WHQL files but it tells me it can't find a suitable device. Does this mean my video card on my laptop is bad?"</span><br />
<br />
No, it just means it's not compatible. I thought it was a long shot, but sometimes&nbsp; ....<br />
<br />
Also try the Devzone forums. That is Nvidia's special forums for Quadro and other professional cards.<br />
You may find someone there with top secrete information that I have not been made privy to :D<br />
&nbsp;I'm not sure which would be best as I use the gaming related Geforce forums. Possibly one of the<br />
CUDA forums.<br />

            Nothing worked. I&nbsp; tried installing the driver from dell that came out closest to when my computer was built but it didn't work. I guess I just have to get a new computer. This one is from 2007 and I got it from my cousin when she bought a new one. Until
 then I have to live with the crappy resolution. Thanks anyway. I don't understand most of the jargon you were throwing out above. I know how to install the hardware and the software but any tweaking I don't know what I'm looking at other than what it says
 on the screen.<br />

            Just list the terms you don't understand and I can clarify them. My replies tend to be relatively
<br />
long winded as is, and some people get upset when you explain something they already know,<br />
but I'm happy to define any terminology or go through the steps on how to do a System Restore or change the way&nbsp; Windows Updates is setup, etc.
<br />
<br />
Yes, it's unfortunate that DELL are known for good short term support, but they aren't much<br />
interested in on going support. That they don't update drivers for a system that old is telling<br />
in relation to their propaganda about being a 'green' company. Their allowance of premature<br />
redundancy via something as simple as a driver update may not be exclusive to DELL, but DELL<br />
is right their on top of the list of mfg's of e-waste. Monopoly$oft's policies don't help much either.<br />

            I can't do a system restore because it was turned off. I was taught years ago to disable the system restore because if you have a virus it is saved in the system restore and even if you remove it when you apply the system restore you put it back on your
 system so the first thing you do is disable it so there is no restore point. <br />
<br />
When I upgraded from Win XP no new drivers were installed. As they came up in the list from Win Update I installed them and never had a problem until this last one but it was on my machine for a month or so before it trashed my system. I worked on the computer,
 left it on and went to school and when I got home the screen would not come on so I had to hold the power button to shut the system down. When I restarted it would not even go to the F8 menu until I did the restore option first, which failed. I can't find
 my win 7 disc so I can't repair from the disc and I finally was able to get into safe mode and looked online.

            I ran malware bites and removed one infection which speeded up start up but did not make the graphics better. There are still lines in the background. It took several more hours of trial and error before I figured out it was the graphics driver so I uninstalled
 all Nvidia files in the uninstall programs menu and I've been trying ever sense to get the driver back but none work accept the generic vga driver. As I said I probably need a new graphics card or a new laptop since there probably isn't one that will work
 with this system. This is what the desktop looks like. All the little lighter colored squares even appear at start up on the black screen. That is what I'm trying to get rid of.<br />

<p><span>Hi chu224,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community Site.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>There are no sensitivity settings for keyboard like pointing devices. If you are facing this issue while playing some games then I would suggest
 you to check for the game setting to reduce the sensitivity of the directional arrow keys
<span>&nbsp;</span>and if the issue persists I would suggest you to get in touch with the game manufacturer for additional support.</span></span></p>

                    I had installed Windows 10 when it came out, so I am past the 30 day window to downgrade out of it. I got an update message to "Upgrade to Windows Home Version 1511.10586. I accepted and it has been over 4 hours trying to download and it keeps saying that
 it cant upgrade because there is no Wi-Fi. Then my computer settings won't let me turn the Wi-Fi back on. My Wi-Fi was working perfectly fine until the upgrade started. I am in a loop now because it says it cant proceed due to no Wi-Fi, but it's just not recognizing
 the Wii. My provider (Xfinity) is saying there is no problem with the internet service to my home. It appears the problem is with the Windows 10 upgrade. What do I do to resolve this? I HATE WINDOWS 10! But, now I am left with a useless computer that can't
 continue downloading the update! HELP, please.

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to Xbox Live, but I am connected to WiFi</h2>
                    <p>For the last 3 or so days my Xbox has been unable to connect to Live. I'm fully connected to the internet, but I can't access online games, and I can't watch YouTube or Netflix. I've done multiple hard resets, unplugged the router, and just recently I tried to remove my account from the Xbox and redownload it, but I can't access live to do so. My NAT type is reading unavailable, and I'm able to access my live account on another Xbox, at a friend's house. Obviously this is a local issue, and I've been searching for answers for days.</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/9e7b2996-3fc1-4fd6-a5ae-04ea11c69f9d" title="marayvan123">
<p>
</p><p>First of all, welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype application&nbsp;doesn't have the capability to make calls by itself. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As an advice, please make sure to reset your password by following the steps on this support page:
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa95/how-do-i-change-or-reset-my-password-for-skype?q=password+reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>Resetting your password is an effective way of making sure that only you has access to the account if in case you think it is being compromised. By resetting your password, the system&nbsp;automatically signs you out from all of the devices where your account
 is logged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please check this link for some tips on how you can keep your account secure:

<p>
</p><p>I hope the information above helps.</p>

<h2>            NAT type D&#58;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys. So I've started playing cod since BO2 came out. And my internet is quite fast. However, I have a strict NAT type and already have spent the past year looking for a way to "open" it. I've settled by playing via "Join game in progress." This was
 the only way I could play: By connecting to someone in a game or lobby. However it only works with people who have Moderate or Open NAT types. D: . If you have an Open NAT type (preffered ;) please add me as a Friend so i can join your games. (If you are wondering
 if this will make you laggier. Don't worry, because I will still be using my internet to join the games, I just need your connection as...sort of a gateway to the game :)</p>

<p>If you are online for long periods of time, or play a lot. Please add me as a friend :) When i join your games, I wont bug you with questions. Infact! You wont even know I'm there :D</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have an ethernet hub before my router. One run goes to the router and one straight to the console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Without going through the router you dont have to worry about any of that .............. no nat settings, no port forwarding or dmzs etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Not everyone can do this since many isps have a modem/router combo, but you can pick up a hub rather cheap and it eliminates a lot of the questions about your own connection. There are still other things to look at as far as connection quality goes but
 its an easy fix for some of it.</p>

<p>I have an Ethernet hub from linksys and have not used it since blops2 early on. Maybe I will set it up tonight. I feel as if I get less speed but want my 360 to have an Ethernet connection also.</p>

<p>&nbsp; I know my inlaws have dsl through att and they have a combo setup. I imagine many of the isps are like that.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;No sense in putting it after the router though, as the purpose is to eliminate the router and all its security features. It would only be possible for those who have a separate modem and router.</p>

<p>What gets me is how in the cod ghost game my Nat is open but shows moderate for the 360 and x1. Funny. Soon guess I will be going to staples tomorrow and pick another 25 ft Ethernet wire. I would go now but it &nbsp;is freezing outside. Gotta do some stapling
 of old wires anyway so I'll get that out of the way right now.</p>

<p>might be the level of service you have, &nbsp;many of them show you need to pay this much to do these things online. Sort of an add thing to get you to buy the bigger plans. Yet some take it serious, if your not on the high plan that says online games under it,
 they wont open it.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Like getting Port 25 open, so you can use your own domains for a mail client. Its always an hr phone call to get bumped to top tier service that knows what I need and doesn't try and read me directions to set up mail.</p>

<p>Mine does this to.&nbsp; I am actually playing on the Xbox One, but for some odd reason mine said Open at first, then Moderate the next time I logged on.&nbsp; Also, I had the Xbox One check the internet connection and it said itself that my NAT was Open.&nbsp; The game
 when I load it says Moderate.</p>

<p>TOG I have a linksys 10/100 5-port workgroup switch model ezxs55w. Not a hub. Just did some research on it while I was away a bit and thank God I got this thing back in my blops1 days for like 20 bucks. It has great reviews from researchers and consumers.
 Gonna set it up right now.</p>

    <title>surface pro 2 could be better than wacom Cintiq Companion if you - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> malnu  say:</h3>
<h2>            surface pro 2 could be better than wacom Cintiq Companion if you tried.</h2>
                    <p>Have you seen the new WACOM tablet systems? Way to pricey for your typical street artist, student artist, starving artist, etc... They continue to put their price point so far beyond what the common artist can afford without going without dinner or rent
 for a few months. They need a stronger competitor that could maybe drive their pricing down a bit. I have heard that the surface is supposed to have some features similar to the Wacom, but then I have also heard a lot of points where they seriously lack. I
 have been looking at the Cintiq models of monitors for many, many months now and still can't find myself at a point of being able to justify the cost. I am stuck using my computer to do all my artwork, laptop included, as they didn't come remotely close to
 the cost together. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd love to see a company strong enough to put out a piece of equipment to compete with the new Cintiq Companion, and that can do so at a far more reasonable price point. the tech is out there and available to do so cheaper, cooler (doesn't overheat easily),
 faster processing, better battery life, and can allow for storage locally, or external storage better than usb 2.0</p>

            <p>I agree. Cintiq's are just&nbsp;overpriced external monitors you can draw on (not saying that they aint a great tools for digital artists though). The cintiq companion sounds awesome, but like a lot of people have pointed out, its hard to dish out $2000 - $2500
 for a last generation Intel i7 device&nbsp;with no graphics card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The surface pro 2 sounds like a waaaaay better deal, judging from the specs they've released so far that is. Throw in a keyboard, a bamboo feel pen and you got a more affordable option to the cintiq companion.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wish the 8gb surface option meant there was a surface with an i7 processor. Going to have to wait and see later this month.</p>

<div>its a 6 inch surface pro with 3G/4G for phone calls</div>

<div>same design as surface pro , just very small , 6 inch screen and 6 inch keyboard.</div>

            To be fair, the Cintiq Companion has a beefier Ivy Bridge Core i7, two solid state drive options that do not exist as options with the Surface Pro (unless one does out of support surgery on their Surface Pro), double the RAM memory, and double the pressure
 sensitivity along with pen tilt recognition.<br />
<br />
It would be a nice PREMIUM tablet, but the 13 inches form factor is something that will not travel well with me (after being very accustomed to the 10.6 inches of the Surface Pro).<br />
<br />
If there is any more reason that the Surface Pro right now is great at what it does for its cost, look at older stand alone Cintiqs. Not sure why initial reviewers and blogs gave it a thumbs down in price.<br />
<br />
Either way, you have to admit, Wacom is also approaching the bar with their proposed solution. And for the better to those that need what the Cintiq Companion lines offer.<br />

<div>Ya the specs for hardcore gamers and artists aren't that great for the Surface Pro 2. &nbsp;But it's a sacrifice for a way better price. &nbsp;I'm surprised there isn't really any 'direct' competition with Wacom. &nbsp;I've owned Wacom tablets since Intuos 2 and they
 are really quality products. &nbsp;I use the Intuos 4 right now (bluetooth and usb). &nbsp;</div>
<div>The i7 processor, RAM &amp; SSD makes a difference, etc. &nbsp;Heck it could be used for even used for a handful of nextgen games. The build quality and compatibility with pen/drivers are smooth. &nbsp;Although if I wasn't a professional 3d artist and animator, I would
 go with the Surface Pro 2. &nbsp;It will do the job but will have more headaches.&nbsp;</div>

            The Surface Pro 2 can definitely be used as a mobile art tablet "Art on the Go!", but Microsoft probably wont be using that marketing angle until Apple or Google do it first so they (Microsoft) can play catch-up.<br />

            I just received my Cintiq Companion in the mail last week, and I must say, it's a fantastic device. I had a Samsung Series 7 slate (the predecessor to the Surface), and it was just too small, and not hefty enough. The build on the Companion is great, the
 13 inch screen is a perfect working size. Having the programmable buttons is great as well. I'd still like to give the new Surface a go, but am incredibly happy with my Cintiq Companion purchase.

            Hi everyone! I dont usually participate in these type of discussions but I read them all the time so Im making it a point to give back a little more in my own lame first world kinda way. :)<br />
<br />
First off Im a professional artist. Ive owned a tablet pc in the past that i altered to fit my needs for art. I basically cut a usb key strip (called xkeys) the exact link I needed. It was pretty rad looking and was super useful but then again I like customizing
 my tools for art...I treat this stuff as digital art gear rather than pretty computer tech. Anyways, one of the things I liked when testing the cintique companion was that it had dedicate buttons on the bezel (more on that below). That said I opted for the
 surface pro 2 in the end and honestly she works like a champ. I couldnt be happier.
<br />
<br />
The haswell i5 is actually a good thing...a banging i7 might seem tempting but honestly I cant tell you how nice it is to have loads of battery life when on the go. My last tablet was great, had a discrete (dedicated) graphics card but that and the 13 inch
 screen made it a bit of a beast for a sketch/sculpt book that I was after.&nbsp; It also always had to be plugged in and honestly that sucks. I love taking this little fella to work without the charger, sculpting outside at lunch, sketching in meetings, and coming
 home at the end of the day with 70-80%&nbsp; battery life. Im rarely this happy with my purchase so I just thought I would hare my experience.
<br />
<br />
Oh before I forget, its kinda sacrilegious for me not to pimp out my tech in teems of specs but I think its important/impressive to mention that Im *only* rolling with the 4 gig model. It can handle quite a bit polys which I didnt expect. I usually just block
 in my forms and finish em off on my beast of a desktop but now im finding myself taking my designs further on the tablet alone. I love working on the couch, i hate setting at my desk the older I get. Anyways I wanted to try out the cheapest one they had (you
 can try out any model and return it without a restocking fee if it doesnt push the software and you decide you need more) but they were sold out of the cheapest model so they bumped me up to the 128 gig SSD for free (still with just 4 gig of ram). I was surprised
 to hear these have been flying off the shelves to be honest but now that I own one I get it. Its insane how small it is considering its a full up machine with a 64 bit os and for what I wanted (a truly portable sketch book) the screen is perrrrfect. Ive had
 bigger screens in the past and as nice as they seem it adds allot of bulk that Im trying to move away from. I work on a 30 inch all day so Im a real estate nut but this thing is exactly what I wanted. Anything bigger andit would sit and collect dust. I dont
 need another laptop and everyone here knows that the ipad is fun and games so for me it was between the Surface Pro 2 and the Cintique companion. I use this as a digital sketch book and sculpting on the go and this is exactly what i was looking for.
<br />
<br />
Oh one last thing, I use the modbook wacom tablet pc pen since its got better ergo and 2 buttons.,The pen that comes with it looks pretty but Im used to intuos type pens. Also, I use the art dock which is an onscreen virtual hotkey tool specifically for professional
 artists (Maya, zbrush, photpshop, etc.). It works great...but...its lethal with the steel series touch control sticky screen buttons. Those are my new little best friends with the art dock. Im gonna try and paste this post/experience in other forums too since
 I had a hard time finding any serious art reviews on the surface (aside from penny arcade). Its a really sharp piece of hardware that is powerful and has banging battery life at a fraction of what it should/could cost.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

            LandisFields. Thanks so much for your post. I expecially like the part at the end when u said u use the Modbook Digitizer Pen. I've been looking for a pen that has 2 buttons because im used to that aswell. I took my surface pro 2 back to the store because
 I felt it was one upgrade away from being what I wanted ( I actually wish the screen was alittle bigger because the menus are so tiny in photoshop, and im sure even smaller if you use zbrush?) but after hearing what you wrote;especially about the pen, I might
 pick one again. Your battery life was that good to last you through out the day? Did u turn it off when werent using it, leave it in sleep mode? Anyway im excited to find a pen that works the way I wanted . Great post!<br />

i agree with this totally along with this thread as i am currently on a hunt for a reliable device to create with without the tech of the device becoming obsolete too quickly. very surprised apple nor any pc company has came out and really grabbed this idea
 by the horns. it really is ingenious. cintiqs are too expensive and the "affordable" ones don't have any of the capabilities as the other ones outside of drawing.&nbsp;

Troubleshoot Compatibility</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>This can help with some (but not all) programs/drivers:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next window click "Start the Program" to install it.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in Windows 7.

    <title>How do I combine two videos&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephenzji  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I combine two videos&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to combined two videos. I had an event and one of the videographers forgot to start his camera until 7 minutes into the event. The other videographer caught the first 7 minutes. I want to combine them to make one video. If I edit the first one to
 the 7 minute mark and click on the "O" to mark the end, and the click the "I" to make the start of the other, will they be joined then? Thanks for any help that you can give me.</p>

            <p>Pretty much just like you explained it.</p>
<p>Put the two clips on to the timeline in this order:</p>
<p>1) Clip with first 7 minutes.</p>
<p>2) Clip that starts 7 minutes late.</p>
<p>Select the first clip and set its Out-point, so it ends at the 7 minute mark.&nbsp; If the other clip starts there, you don't need to trim anything else, though you may need to trim a few seconds which you would do by setting the In-point.</p>
<p>When you preview the movie you'll see the first 7 minutes from the first videographer and the remaining time from the second videographer.</p>
<p>Now save your project (File &gt; Save Project).&nbsp; This isn't the movie, it's just the project in case you need to come back and make further edits (e.g. add titles, music, etc.)</p>
<p>Then save your movie (File &gt; Save Movie).&nbsp; This step will create&nbsp;a new movie file from everything that is on the timeline.&nbsp; Remember, you aren't touching your original source files, but the result will be a new movie with the full event.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t connect Wii to Mobile hotspot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaronbrinkley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect Wii to Mobile hotspot</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to use my computer as a hotspot for my Nintendo Wii. I tried using the Windows 10
<strong>Mobile hotspot</strong> feature in <strong>Settings</strong>. It gave me a notification saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>You're sharing your connection over the 5 GHz network band. The network might not appear on devices that can only connect over the 2.4 GHz band.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Nintendo Wii only supports a 2.4 GHz band, on standards 802.11 b/g. As expected, the hotspot did not appear on the Wii after searching for access points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried creating a hosted network through <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, changing my network adapter to prefer the 2.4 GHz band. I have an Intel Dual Band Wireless-AC 7260 internal wireless adapter. Even with no preference though, which is automatically
 5 GHz, the Wii was able to detect my ad hoc network. However, upon trying to connect to it, I received the Wii error code of 51330 both with no preference and by preferring 2.4 GHz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly enough, <strong>Mobile hotspot</strong> still gave me the "<em>5GHz network band</em>" notification even when I had changed my network adapter preference to 2.4 GHz. Also, I do not have the
<strong>Advanced</strong> tab in <strong>Microsoft Hosted Network Virtual Adapter</strong> to change the network band like in my Intel device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to change the band of my <strong>Mobile hotspot</strong> shared connection to 2.4 GHz? If not, how else might I be able to connect my Wii to the Internet through my computer?</p>

            Thank you for your reply. Unfortunately, I have no control over the router settings. I am connected to my university's network. In fact, the reason why I cannot connect my Wii directly to the network is because the Nintendo Wii is blocked by the university,
 probably for security purposes since the Wii is a decade old. I thought I would be able to bypass this. Apparently not.
