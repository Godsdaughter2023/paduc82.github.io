<h2>            Skype for Business not working for mac users - is there a fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A number of mac users are facing major issues with Skype for business when launching the web plugin on Macs, so much so that the only workaround seems to be to use a windows machine or launch windows through parallels (which is hardly a fix for the mac issues
 and costs licenses).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issues include</p>
<ul>
<li>Skype not picking up inputs from the default microphone (plugging in an external mic/speaker can resolve this)</li><li>Skype not showing other participant's screen shares (no fix I am aware of)</li><li>The plugin failing to download for mac/Safari, and then failing installation</li><li>Any attempt to change video (camera) setting on mac/chrome version results in a full crash (with crash report)</li></ul>
<p>Launching on iOS works fine and I've read a mac/safari work around using the 'develop' function to fool the browser into using the iOS plug in but this is not ideal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can the community/support team suggest fixes?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I do not have a Skype for business account but several customers I work with do, and up until the last few months running meetings using the web app option was fine. If I try to login using the Skype for Business desktop app it expects me to have a client
 login (which I do not have).</p>
<p>My default set up works fine on many other conferencing/callings apps including Zoom, Webex, Google Hangouts, Skype (not the business version), MS teams, Slack, Facetime.</p>
<p>The issue is occurring with all the mac users I have asked in our company so far (10).</p>
<p>I have tried with different browsers (chrome and safari).</p>
<p>I am on Mac Mojave 10.14.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sent a crash report recently - would you prefer I paste it into this thread?</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>Owen</p>

<p>Hi Owen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on my experience, for MacOS Mojave, there is a new feature for audio application accessing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Privacy. Then select Microphone in the list. If the Skype for Business web app or your browser shows up there, click the check box to enable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned, the issue happens to all Mac users in your company you asked, may I know if all of these users are using Skype for Business web app? Have you tried to change another network environment to check the outcome?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the crash report, you can paste it to a Word or Text document and send it to us in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessage/inbox">
Private Message</a>.</p>

<p>As Iry Chen pointed out, if you are using OSX Mojave 10.14, there is a new feature for audio application accessing: System Preferences &gt; Security &amp; Privacy &gt; Privacy. Then select Microphone in the list. If the Skype for Business web app or your
 browser shows up there, click the check box to enable it. I guess it is not checked by default.</p>
<p>I tried everything else (video, sound, clean re-install, IT help) but the only thing that worked was checking the video checkbox in Security &amp; Privacy. While you are there, also check that the sound checkbox for Skype for Business is selected.</p>
<p>

            Hello hmf1860, <br />
<br />
First, r<span>un System File checker to see if you have any corrupted system files.</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>Go to Start Screen.
<br />
Type: CMD<br />
The Apps page will come up. <br />
Right click CMD.exe<br />
Click “Run as Administrator” on the bottom pane.<br />
If you get the User Account Control prompt. Click Yes to continue.<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: </p>
<p><b>sfc /scannow</b><br />
<br />
This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.<br />
<br />
Restart your system.</p>
</span>
<p>If still get an error, register the .dll file.
</p>
<p>Go to Start Screen.
<br />
Type: CMD<br />
The Apps page will come up. <br />
Right click CMD.exe<br />
Click “Run as Administrator” on the bottom pane.<br />
If you get the User Account Control prompt. Click Yes to continue.<br />
The syntax of the regsvr32 command is as follows: regsvr32 “path and FileName.dll”.</p>
<p>At the Command Prompt, type:
</p>
<ul>
<li>To register a file called myfile.dll that was located in the c:\windows\system32 directory, you would type in regsvr32 “c:\windows\system32\myfile.dll”.
</li><li>Either click OK or hit Enter to submit the command to Windows.
</li></ul>
<p>You will get the command completed successfully or an error message.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know if this helps. <br />
<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire Collection saved data not loading</h2>
                    <p>I have two computers that I play on. Both computers load my profile, and show my statistics as being the same, same number of deals, scores, cumulative scores. However, on one computer, if I open Klondike, my cumulative score is much lower than the other
 computer. It won't update to the current score, even though it shows in the stats for Klondike that my score is much higher. If I play a single deal of Klondike on that computer, it will save my score, and my cumulative score on the other computer will drop
 back down to the new score. What gives?</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Minimize all windows _desktop_ shortcut</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I remember there was a way to create DESKTOP shortcut to minimize all windows, but I can't find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I know about Win+M, I don't want that</p>
<p>Yes, I know about keyboard shortcuts in general, I don't need that.</p>
<p>Yes, I know I can click in the corner of the taskbar. That's not what I'm asking.</p>
<p>(writing because all threads I saw recommend those like mantra)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I want a DESKTOP shortcut. As in, an icon on the desktop. Or that you can put on a custom taskbar, or something. That minimizes all open windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 doesn&#39;t boot to desktop properly. Cannot access any personal data. HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard" style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
It all started when i opened my HP Pavilion laptop to retrieve data off of my hard drive using a SATA/IDE reader (i lost the power cable to my laptop during that time). When i used the reader on another PC, i had a hard time getting access to the files on there
 (couldn't get past permission to access the folder with my name), so i decided to reinstall the drive back in my laptop. After finally finding the cable, i booted it up and everything worked 100% until i was prompted to repair the hard drive. The system automatically
 rebooted after accepting the prompt and Windows Startup failed to repair the drive and presented me with: C:\windows\system32\logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt When i returned to Windows 10, i was presented with a broken desktop setup. I cannot access Start or File
 Explorer and my desktop wallpaper is black (all desktop icons appear normally though).</p>

</p><p>Are you still able to get to the Control Panel? If so, I suggest that you perform a System Restore. This will take your PC back to an earlier point in time. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps after the restore point was made.
 Please follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Control</strong> <strong>Panel</strong> &gt; Select&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Open System Restore</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Finish</strong>.</li></ol>

            No. As i said earlier, i cannot access Start (except Files Explorer in Safe Mode). And i know how to get to Advanced Options through Restart+Shift. The problem is i don't have a restore point and i really don't know what to do here next. I already went
 ahead and put my PC in Safe Mode to backup my personal data in the event that i lose anything. Where should i go from here? I don't want to make the problem worse. This laptop is almost 6 years old and i don't plan on using it as a paperweight. :P

    <title>Cannot get sound to play with USB Speakers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ptarling  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot get sound to play with USB Speakers</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a set of Logitech Z-10 USB Speakers (which according to Logitech's website are supported by Windows 8 with no additional drivers needed). The speakers are recognised by Windows, and are set as the default playback device.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>No matter what I do, no sound will come out through them. When opening the volume panel from the Desktop system tray and attempting to adjust the volume, the pop-up volume control freezes and then promptly crashes with "Volume mixer is not responding".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Attempting to play a test sound from the regular Sound part of the Desktop control panel results in "Failed to play test tone"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is 64-bit Windows 8 Pro, done as a fresh installation. Everything was fine under Windows 7.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions at all?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Paul.</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your response. Please let me go through it bit by bit:<br />
<br />
1) Unfortunately my computer does not have any built in speakers, so I am unable to verify this.<br />
<br />
2) Yes, all other USB Devices (Keyboard, Mouse, Printer, and USB Drives) work correctly.<br />
<br />
I had found the link you provided last night. Unfortunately none of the tips here helped. As the speakers are USB, they do not interface with the sound-card in the computer. The troubleshooter was unable to find any problems, and there are no driver updates
 available.<br />
<br />
Unplugging the speakers and plugging them back in has made little to no difference.<br />
<br />
As the computer was empty, after posting this last night, I re-formatted the computer and installed Windows 8 again without the speakers plugged in. After installation, I performed all necessary Windows Updates, then plugged the speakers back in.<br />
<br />
The system recognised them, and sound started playing!! Before moments later a message popping up saying "The last connected USB Device did not install successfully" and the speakers becoming disabled again. This message is obviously incorrect as the speakers
 worked for all of a minute.<br />
<br />
Any help you can provide is very gratefully received<br />
<br />
Paul.<br />
<br />

            After trying all sorts of PC diagnostics, driver updates, etc. -- I found the simple solution of going to Properties &gt; Enhancements and turning on the Bass Boost made the speakers work. &nbsp;Strange.

<h2>            Reactivating Windows 10 after a hardware change</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my CPU, Motherboard and RAM and now my windows isn't activated anymore. I got my copy of Windows by upgrading it from Windows 7 Ultimate. I've been using it since the release of Windows 10 on the same hardware.

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this: 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends) 
<br />Contact Microsoft at <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>  through chat support. They would take control of your PC and activate(might need a proof of purchase) 
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

<p>Hi! I have just changed the motherboard in my PC for a 64 bit one, which apparently counts as a different kind of device. I am running Win 10 Pro 1709, which came without a product key because I upgraded to pro online. I can't see the device on my MS account,
 even in its previous guise, despite saving the digital license to my account about a week ago. I tried the activation troubleshooter but it couldn't solve it, but referred me to a person. I phoned a person but they couldn't help without a product key. How
 do I activate windows? How do I change to the 64 bit version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Dave</p>

<p>If Windows 10 Pro upgrade was OEM then you need to buy a new licence key for the new hardware device.

            It wasn't OEM, it was online from Microsoft. My only proof of purchase is the "other devices" list in my MS account. Can I upgrade to 64 bit without paying again?

<p>A licence is for either 32bit or 64bit. I'm not sure a licence purchase from MS is retail. If the licence was activated against a previous motherboard then it may mean a new licence is required.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Suddenly Cannot receive calls from contacts - outgoing works fine</h2>
                    <p>Hi.&nbsp; I have been missing calls from contacts.&nbsp; They receive a call cancelled message or it just never connects.</p>
<p>I do not receive an audio notification of the missed call, but later it shows up in the tray popup.&nbsp; I am using a Windows XP Dell machine that has&nbsp; worked without issue for years.</p>
<p>I have tried all the troubleshooting located on the site and several others to turn off calls from anyone, and then turn it back on.&nbsp; I have uninstalled the program and reinstalled it.&nbsp; I removed the virus protection software.&nbsp; I have even restored my machine
 to a time prior to this issue.</p>
<p>Can you help?</p>

            I had have the same problem. I followed your steps up to renaming the folder and is not allowing me to rename it to Skype_Old even though I have signed out and quit Skype? It says it is being used by another person or program but I have closed all programs
 and it is not listed on the task manager too. Do you have any suggestions please.

            If you want folder XXX to be a subfolder of folder YYY, just drag it to YYY and let it do. If you want a folder to not be a subfolder, drag it to Local Folders and let it go.

<h2>            CD&#47;DVD drive not working.  magicJack listed as being the CD&#47;DVD drive.</h2>
                    Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I seem to be having some trouble with my CD/DVD drive.&nbsp; It won't read any discs I put in.&nbsp; I checked My Computer &amp; noticed that a program I have on my computer called magicJack is listed as the CD/DVD drive (J:).&nbsp; If I unplug magicJack from the USB port,
 both the CD/DVD drive &amp; the (K:) drive which has magicJack disappears.&nbsp; I tried everything I looked up on Microsoft Support, including reinstalling the drive, editing the registry, and running the Fix It application.&nbsp; I even tried right clicking on the drive
 &amp; clicking on Eject which DOES get rid of magicJack but it still won't read discs.&nbsp; The only other thing I can think of trying is uninstalling &amp; reinstalling magicJack, but I wanted to get some other suggestions first.&nbsp; So I'd really appreciate any help.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks,<br />

<br />You can add or edit information in your Skype profile such as your location, email, or phone number to make it easier for friends to find you. If you prefer not to be included in the public search directory or in People You May Know suggestions, then you can opt out. Opting out will make you completely unsearchable to anyone. Learn more. Opting out is only available in Skype on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Skype for Windows 10 (version 14).

<h3> don ve  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I use an already used password again&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 (Home) crashed and after I had it restarted I had to change my password. I did not want to change it, but that was what Windows wanted me to do.</p>
<p>So I changed it, in order to get my Windows session back. But when I later tried to change my password again to one I used in the past I was told that I could not. Since when is a system telling me what I want, can or can not.
</p>
<p>I feel like I'm at my company and someone from IT (not me) declares what policy is laid upon me. This is my home system...</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I solve this. I want to change my password into what I want and if this is a password I have used before then that is my choice and I do not want Windows tell me I can not do this. Big frustration. So please help me?</p>

            Hi Don,<br />
<br />
<br />
I understand that you want to use the same password you've already used on Windows.<br />
<br />
However, Microsoft is keeping Windows devices and accounts secured and far from the idea of being hacked, that is why users are requested to change their password regularly.<br />
<br />
I really understand the frustration but for me, I should say that it is for the users' security and data protection.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have further queries.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

<p>Hi Michelle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the answer. I do change my passwords on a regular base; so I do understand your answer. I just would like to stay in control myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a suggestion on the frequency though. Now it is 0 or 72 days. Why not have the user choose from a range 0 - 120?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Store issues.</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Windows Store" on my laptop ceased functioning a while ago. I was poking around trying to fix it.
<br />
<br />
It flashes open, and then closes, but remains in the task bar. If I click on the task bar icon, it flashes open and green again, but doesn't stay. The Windows Store appears to work on the other (non-admin) account, but none of&nbsp; the apps work (they have those
 black-on-white 'X's). <br />
<br />
I ran&nbsp;"wsreset.exe" and I&nbsp;got:<br />
"windows cannot find 'ms-windows-store:purge caches', make sure you typed the name correctly and then try again".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran both the Microsoft Accounts trouble shooter, and the Windows Store Apps trouble shooter (microsoftaccountdiagnostic.diagcab, AppsDiagnostic.diagcab, apps.diagcab).
<br />
<br />
From the Windows Store Apps trouble shooter, I received these errors:<br />
1) windows cannot find 'ms-windows-store:purgecaches'<br />
2) Windows Store configuration may be damaged.<br />
<br />
I ran "AppsDiagnostic.diagcab", and got:</p>
<p>"Windows Store cache might be damaged</p>
<p>Windows Store configuration might be damaged"</p>

"Add-AppxPackage : Deployment failed with HRESULT: 0x80073CF6, Package could not be registered."</p>
<p>This is what&nbsp;it looks like:<br />
http://i1234.photobucket.com/albums/ff408/ShadeNyx/Untitled.png<br />
</p>
<p>I ran "sfc /scannow", and got:</p>
<p>"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.log. For example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. Note that logging is currently not supported in offline servicing scenarios."</p>
<p><br />
I ran "&nbsp;dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth" from an elevated command prompt, &nbsp;and it said that it fixed some things, but the Windows Store still has the same problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the instructions found here:</p>
<p>http://immux.blogspot.co.nz/2014/03/solved-blend-hresul</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;My registry doesn't look like that. I don't have "\repository\Packages" under "CurrentVersion\AppModel".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to loose my installed programs (they are more important than the apps), so I am hoping to avoid refreshing or resetting.
<br />
<br />
Any ideas about what I should try next?<br />
<br />
Why won't MS allow us just to re-install the Windows Store?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.</p>

<h3> jim.garvey.it  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tablet can&#39;t update to Windows 10 1709 due to storage</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Tablet and without installing any apps, simply attaching to wireless and running Windows Updates, I&nbsp;can't update to Windows 10 1709 due to 16Gb internal storage. I deleted basically everything that came default except camera, app connector,
 and Store. I even removed the Bluetooth driver and uninstalled the keyboard; so I was forced to use "ease of access" onscreen keyboard to login. 5.05Gb free now; update stopped at 75%.&nbsp; I then removed the previous version of Windows files and&nbsp;cleared what
 I could from Temp. 3Gb showing free and update won't restart claiming it still needs more space.</p>
<p>I purchased a 1Tb micro sd card and created a folder on C:&nbsp; then mapped to that folder. No luck.</p>
<p>I then purchased a 16Gb sd card, formatted as NTFS and attempted to extend C: to it (thinking it would recognize as a secondary). No luck.</p>
<p>How can I update my tablet to Windows 10 1709 or even 1803 (probably 1804 now) ?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PLEASE HELP!</strong></p>

            Hi Jim, you will see a lot of 'fixes' using other storage to download a large update like 1709 or 1803. The problem is, you still need the space on your internal storage to install that update
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of Windows 10 - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next few updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD or less is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything ! 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            MS let builders create 16 and 32GB devices because that sold Windows (and Office) licenses.  It's all about money!
<br />
<br />I have to assume that with a 16GB device you have a 32bit CPU.  Check:
<br />
<br />Use &lt;WIN&gt;&lt;X&gt; to display menu
<br />Select "System"
<br />Look through the displayed information.
<br />
<br />I agree with Dave M, the unwanted, but most likely solution for your problem is a clean install.  The problem I see is that even a 32Bit device Windows 10 install "officially" requires 16GB.  I have to guess that your maker had a custom Windows install.  Or your device started as Win 7 or 8?  You should also try contacting support at your device makers web site to see what they say.

<h2>            burning away the backlog</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;Id like to start by saying - Gawd I hate these forums which are so incredibly broken, its almost sad...Not only are they broke, but for some odd reason the Canada General forum has become the new - Why was I suspended forum (WTF)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Lets get back to talking about games... When we last left our old forums, I had a thread about what you were playing in your backlog...Summer is great for going outside, but I still appreciate the rainy days where I can get to some gaming...Most recently
 I finished Alan Wake. I thought it was a very good game, the story started to lose me at the end, but it was still overly enjoyable...I will say 1 thing about this game, if you own a 5.1 headset - use it...Its almost like a totally different game..Well the
 game is the same, but you hear some really freaky stuff...The reason why this game ended up on my backlog is because I tried it when it first came out , with my newly purchased fancy smancy headset, and it freaked me out so bad, that I didnt get through Episode
 1... Then recenly I started over, without the headset, and it was much more managable..</p>
<p>&nbsp;Wait...Didnt I recommend the headset early ?? Okay nix that...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Next up , I plan on finally getting into Darksiders...So who else is digging through their backlog ?</p>

<p>Just started MOH today. For some reason, whenever I haven't played a FPS in awhile, getting back into one always gives me a headache for a couple of hours &gt;_&gt;. So I stopped after like 30 mins lol. Also trying to finish Demon's Souls (fairly easy once you
 get the hang of it, except I've been helping so many people beat their bosses lol, so I've been side tracked). &nbsp;Also gotta continue White Knight Chronicles, replay FF13 on the PS3, start Red Dead Redemption, finish the last disc for Lost Odyssey, and finally
 fnish off infamous. </p>
<p>I just don't know if I'll ever finish these games since when GOW3 comes out, I'm not touching any other game until AC:R and MW3/BF3 (just cause I'll be playing with friends late at night xD).</p>

<p>i just got a new xbox 360 slim after getting rid of my elite for a ps3 then i got really tired of ps3 and now i got a xbox 360 slim and keeping it, i also got kinect for it, kinect is alot better than ps3 move, i had move before and i could not do much with
 it when you gotta use one or two controllers to move around as i was thinking of getting UFC person trainer but i had my ps3 at the time and couldn't see doing most of the exercises with a controller in your hands like pushups, but now i have a 360 and i bought
 UFC person trainer and all i can say is its really awesome, my heart rate went up so high just from using the heavy bag activity where you &nbsp;are punching,kicking or kneeing in front of the sensor and your hitting a virtual heavy punching bag and you can also
 flip tires for cardio as well but you gotta do the squat before you flip the tire, its a really good game and it keeps alined with your body really well, i got a good workout from it just for 4 minutes then i was tired and got off because i had just woke up
 too, you also have another option for workout with MMA personal trainers on the game like pushups, jumpingjacks, situps and other stuff and also a option to include weights into your program, now to other games , i got halo reach when i bought the xbox and
 its pretty cool but it gets old sometimes, i've been raised with halo and i loved it for years but it just seems annoying to shoot someone multiple times and gotta keep doing it til he dies, i like games where you kill the person right there and then, so its
 still a good game, halo is awesome, i've also preordered halo 4 and anniversery, i've bought Cod black ops, i find it fun, its not the most popular game out there but its a simple shooter where you dont have special health benefits where you have sheilds for
 a health bar except perks, its you shoot the person and kill him before he kills you, i've also preordered mw3 and also battlefield 3, cant wait for both, they seem epic to me, i've also got more games but i've written enough that doesn't make sense in my
 typing, but thats my backlog as far as i can think of =)</p>

<p>I never really had a backlog but I finally got a few games on the cheap ($10) that I really wanted to play last year but didn't want to pay $60 for. Finally got around to playing Enslaved and thought it was great, the graphics alone was worth the $10 I paid
 for it, too bad a sequel won't get made considering it didn't sell all too well. Also picked up Medal of Honor for $10, thought the campaign was pretty good, I liked fighting in the mountains and was a bit of a departure from CODs usual environment settings.
 AC:B was another one I picked up, at this point I'm just tired of this entire franchise but I'll probably pick-up the next one once it drops to $10-$20 just to see how the series ends. Still looking to pick-up Castlevania: LOS once it drops to $10 as well.

<p>I have already contacted Dell and was told that my only option was to reinstall Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I have done so far:</p>
<p>1. Reset the BIOS</p>
<p>2. Formatted Drive C (NTFS)</p>
<p>3. Created a Windows 10 disk from .iso file downloaded from Microsoft</p>
<p>4. Ran the Windows 10 install disk</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation fails with the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows cannot be installed to this disk.<span>&nbsp; </span>The selected disk has an MBR partition table.<span>&nbsp;
</span>On EFI systems,<span>&nbsp; </span>Windows can only be installed to GPT disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I correct this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>The error message is saying that your BIOS is UEFI but your disk's partition system is not GPT. In order to verify this claim:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open any CLI (cmd or PowerShell)</li><li><span>Right click on the start button and select Command Prompt (Admin).</span></li><li>Type "diskpart" (without the quotes)&nbsp;and hit Enter.</li><li>Wait for it to load (the command line will begin with DISKPART&gt;)</li><li>Type "list disk" (without the quotes) and hit Enter.</li><li>GPT disks will have an asterisk in the far right column.</li></ol>
<p>If your disk is indeed GPT, there's a problem with the installer. Otherwise, change BIOS to legacy mode to install on an MBR disk.</p>

<h2>            Mouse lag - Surface Pro 4 i5 128gb &#47; Windows 10 &#47; MS Sculpt Comfort Mouse</h2>
                    <p>I have the above set up, however the mouse lags terribly and is basically unusable, as it stutters across the screen. Scrolling using the jog dial works fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A different Bluetooth mouse (logitech) with a usb dongle - works perfectly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked all drivers are up to date on my system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloaded the MS mouse and keyboard centre - no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changed Bluetooth power management setting to stop the device going to sleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can find a solution.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you have the surface setup to an external video source such as a tv, and are using a usb wireless device, then the surface will need to be upright using the kickstand in order for the signal to properly reach the device. Without doing this, you may experience
 a jumpy mouse, a keyboard which does not respond, and seemingly random user input from your wireless device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bluetooth will operate on a different band and have different packet sizes than usb wireless, so that is why there is an observable difference. The transmission size is also smaller and more frequent allowing for interference to be less noticeable.</p>

<p>You need to perform a "Custom/Clean" install as there is no direct method to upgrade from a 32-Bit to 64-Bit operating system. That mean you must backup any important data files before you start (Copy and past method to external media).</p>
<p>You may also take a look at using Windows Easy Transfer (WET) as a means of restoring your personal files and settings.</p>

                    HP Pavilion a1710n with Vista crashed. Hard drive mechanical. Lost all information and unable to recover the D partition. No disk backup was made. Question. I can install and partition new hard drive. Can I purchase an upgrade version of Windows 7 and
 install it since I have the Vista product key from the computer label?

<h2>            Cortana is not available for me. Help&#33;</h2>
                    I just updated my Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 via windows update. When I want to turn on Cortana, it says it's not available in my region I've chosen, even though my region is United States, my speech is English(US),&nbsp;&nbsp;and I have re-downloaded the English
 (US) language pack. Can anybody help me? I've used the Cortana in the Windows 10 Tech Preview and it works beautifully, and I want to use Cortana too in my laptop.
