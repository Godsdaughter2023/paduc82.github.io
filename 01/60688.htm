<h2>            Microphone Recording  - Playback of recording sped up &#40;Chipmunk voice&#41;</h2>
                    Detailed story: Everything worked fine yesterday morning (Skype, Ventrilo).&nbsp; Last night when I got on and attempted to use either application, my voice was sped up and sounds like a "chipmunk".&nbsp; Was weird, so I rebooted.&nbsp; No resolve.&nbsp; Checked all of my
 settings including sampling rates (both 44100 for recording and playback devices).&nbsp; The settings are correct, as I have always had it setup.&nbsp; I used Windows Sound Recorder to verity, and it does in-fact sound like a chipmunk.&nbsp; Audacity gives the same.&nbsp; I have
 proven that the issue is system wide and not specific to a single application.<br />
<br />
The next step I took was to uninstall my sound card drivers, and reinstall - no resolve.&nbsp; Uninstalled and installed a prior drivers - no resolve.&nbsp; Uninstalled and went back to onboard sound - no resolve, same issue.&nbsp; Reinstalled my sound card with the drivers
 which I know were functioning not even 12 hours prior to the issue.&nbsp; During the initial uninstall of the card, I did fully remove it from the PCI slot and then replaced it.<br />
<br />
I then figured it was time for a system restore, and chose a point on Saturday (before the last time I used the microphone and it worked).&nbsp; No resolve - same issue.&nbsp; During the time period in which everything was working and then not, nothing was installed
 or changed.<br />
<br />
I have no idea what else to check.&nbsp; While testing in Audacity, I verified that the sampling rate was correctly set to the ones set in Windows, it was.&nbsp; Same with Ventrilo, etc.&nbsp; I have checked 2 different headsets on 2 different computers - they work fine on
 the other system.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have run out of troubleshooting ideas...<br />
<br />
I am literally baffled and have no idea where to go from here.&nbsp; Any input would be amazing.<br />

            I booted into Safe Mode w/ Networking and was unable to test it due to the OS not enabling sound services.&nbsp; It attempted to resolve the issue, but could not.&nbsp; Screen cap below:<br />
http://i.imgur.com/CvJFo.jpg<br />
<br />
After doing a clean boot with only Windows services and selective start-up, having the same issue.<br />
<br />
I have been researching what exactly causes the voice to sound like a "chipmunk" and sped up.&nbsp; It seems the cause is due to different sample rates (Recording compared to Playback).&nbsp; Either the recording feature is correct and the playback portion of the sound
 card is playing it back at a higher sample rate - OR - the recording feature is wrong and recording at a lower sample rate that it should and the playback portion is correct.<br />
<br />
Either way, I have checked and double checked my sample rate settings, and they are all set correctly (2 channel, 16 bit, 44100 Hz - CD Quality).&nbsp; This is what is set for both the Recording Device and the Playback Device.<br />
<br />
Today, I went in and again for the 4th time, completely uninstalled my PCI sound card and replaced it with the latest drivers.&nbsp; No resolution.&nbsp; I also want to mention that this is also happening with my onboard sound while the PCI card is out.<br />
<br />
I cannot find any way it could be hardware related...&nbsp; No idea that, as I am completely lost at this point.<br />

            Here is what worked for me, and it was simple. I tried everthing here and none of it worked. I have windows 10 and a logitech pro9000 webcam. I right clicked on the volume control and clicked on recording devices. &nbsp;I click on my microphone (webcam) and
 selected properties, then advanced. I reduced the quality from DVD quality to FM quality and voila. Hope it helps.

Microsoft's Response: Microsoft is committed to helping prevent software piracy, which often results in end users being the victims of software counterfeiters. Counterfeiters abuse product keys to create fake software packages and distribute these to the public.
 These packages are not licensed, do not have Microsoft support, and can also include dangerous malware and spyware.
<br />
<br />
Recently there have been a few keys purchased from auction sites showing up here as non genuine, they appear to be connected to this HROnline code HrOnline: 0xC004C4A2. If you purchased a key from EBAY please realize that the seller may have sold that key to
 multiple people resulting in that key becoming blacklisted. These keys were never meant for resale, they were meant for software development or evaluation depending on the program they were obtained through. If you purchased one of these keys and it has become
 non-genuine with the above code you may need purchase a new license for windows 7. Attempt to validate by going to www.microsoft.com/geniune and follow the links provided to repair windows.<br />
<br />
Added note. You only have a limited amount of time (45 days I believe) to file a claim with the auction sites. Stay away from these keys, if you purchased a key that has turned non-genuine and are within the 45 days of purchase file a claim. There are legitimate
 software vendors on auction sites but if it sounds to good to be true then don't buy it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;It seems you are running a license intended for a particular channel. Yes, you might have a perfectly looking hologram disk, but this doesn't mean the license is legitimate since its easy these days to make hologram disks. Persons who work at the factory can
 secretly create hologram disks they resell on the black market or purchase press machines to do the job.<br />

<br />
EDIT: Additional information<br />
<br />
Things to watch out for.<br />
<br />
Lately there have been several reports of instances of blocked MSDN keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media and reciepts, if you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the store you purchased
 it from and report it to www.microsoft.com/piracy&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you have purchased a key, with or without DVD's or packaging from EBAY or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN key because your key has been blocked you can check a few things yourself, if you received your key with the physical product
 go to www.microsoft.com/howtotell and verify your product however some counterfeit software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.<br />
<br />
To check your PID press the win key and pause at the same time, or open system properties through the control panel, scroll down to activation section and look at the PID It will look something like this 12345-067-1234567-54321, the portion you are interested
 in is the three digit section, if it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have an MSDN key.<br />
<br />
065, 066, 067, 068 for Ultimate, 220, <span style="font-weight: bold">221</span> area for Pro and the 230, 231, 221, 232 area for premium, there are probably others but they should be close to those posted<br />
<br />
About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys <br />
They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose
 is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside
 of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses
 it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.<br />
<br />
In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere along
 the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.<br />

Validate Now:<br />
You can confirm that your software is genuine now. It’s quick and easy.<br />

            Hi Celeste, is this an error you have just experienced - if so see 1 below. If you simply just want to adjust the size of items on your screen - see 2 below
<br />
<br />1.
<br />If so, your Display Driver will need rolling back . . . Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system
<br />
<br />If the rollback option is greyed out:
<br />
<br />Right click on your display adapter, click 'Uninstall device' 
<br />Choose 'Delete the driver software for this device' then click 'Uninstall'
<br />Restart the computer (myst be a restart, not a shut down) 
<br />Windows will then download the correct driver
<br />
<br />
<br />2. Right click your desktop, choose Display settings and set a scaling factor in Scale and Layout

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. 
<br />
<br />Yes, there is a problem with the latest Windows Updates. 
<br />
<br />Right Click Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - double-click the adapter - Driver's tab - use Roll back driver. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work or is unavailable do the below.
<br />
<br />Updating to the latest video driver or possibly reverting back to an older version usually corrects the issue. 
<br />
<br />Download the latest and any other older driver you wish to try from the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and also check the actual video device maker (such as Intel, Nvidia or AMD/ATI). Do not install yet. 
<br />
<br />Make a Restore Point : 
<br />
<br />Start - type in --&gt; Restore ......... find at top and click on - then use Create 
<br />
<br />Use this method to remove the present video drivers.

<h3> darkko136  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Windows folders&#59; everytime I open a new folder it pops up in a new window.</h2>
                    
<p>I have seen this question before here in the forums, but no one seem to know the answer.<br />
Even tho in my 'folder options' i have selected "Open each folder in the same window" this does not happen.<br />
My problems started after I had uninstalled some sort of a tweaking program to windows 7, I cant remember the name of that program.<br />
Is there any solution to this problem, without reinstalling Windows 7? Maybe some sort of a reset button to folder options? :P</p>
<p>Thankfull for every answer, and sorry for my english, I'am swedish.</p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>You may also perform a system restore to an earlier point when the issue was not present –</span></strong><span><span>The
 System Restore tool uses restore points to return system files and settings to an earlier point in time. You can use it to restore the operating system to a point in time in which you did not experience the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Note: When you use System restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed
 are removed.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>To do this, there must be a System Restore point at which the logon was successful. Follow the steps mentioned below to perform

<br />
=========================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.<br />
<br />
</strong><strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set VIEW to<br />
Hide Microsoft drivers - update those&nbsp;with&nbsp;Dump in their names.&nbsp;(Also update the BIOS
<br />
and chipset drivers.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</font></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are <br />
the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab -
<br />
write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything <br />
as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT <br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback)<br />
and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get <br />
their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System <br />
Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot -
<br />
check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR <br />
SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

</p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using <br />
the methods above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker <br />
and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations<br />
in Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install <br />
drivers which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new <br />
driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if
<br />
you wish.<br />

            <p>thanks for the info. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've already updated all of the drivers I found on the Dell support download page and individual component pages.&nbsp; Flashed&nbsp;the Bios&nbsp;to the latest version too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll look at the autorun and process monitoring software next.</p>

            Please read the top link in my previous reply.<br />
<br />
Run DriverView as I indicated just as it says and update the drivers from the actual device<br />
maker's sites.<br />
<br />
Also be sure to check with Dell Support, their on-line documentation, diagnostics, and ask<br />
in their forums about any known issues.<br />

            <p>since you are on sp3, assuming, windows will complain if you try to use a sp2 cd.</p>

<p>open event viewer and find out which files wpf wants to replace and list them here.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 shutting off randomly when battery around 40&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got my surface pro 3 some time around 2015/2016 and have used it ever since. However, I started encountering problems with it around the end of May this year (perhaps after a Microsoft update?). Every time the battery hovers around 35-40%, it shuts off
 randomly without warning. When I turn it back on, the battery shows it's at 0%. What's wrong with my computer and what should I do?</p>

<p>Hi Shaaaaarles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend that you run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit. It can verify if you have the recommended drivers and firmware and check for other software issues on your Surface Pro 3. To download the tool, go to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this page</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check for further issues with the battery or power settings, please run the Power Troubleshooter as well. You can open it by going to
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; Security </strong>&gt; <strong>Troubleshoot
</strong>&gt; <strong>Power </strong>&gt; <strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know what comes up so I can help you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Ruz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your directions. When I ran the Software Diagnostic Toolkit, it said that there was nothing wrong with my computer. When I ran the troubleshooter, it said that the only two issues were that the "time before display goes to sleep is too long" and
 "time before computer goes to sleep is too long" (which it said it fixed). I don't think these two issues relate to my problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for why my computer shuts off randomly, do you think there's something wrong with my battery? Should I get it replaced and how would I do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
        </p>

<p>Also, if I don't get it fixed, how much longer will the battery last/ how long can I still use my computer. One month? Half a year?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know.</p>

<p>Thank you for providing an update, Sharleen. When your device shuts down, try to connect it to the power supply before switching it on. As the device boots up, check for warnings like an icon of a thermometer or a battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also important that we check the Reliability Monitor to look for what program or service could be causing the issue. Go to
<strong>Start </strong>then type <strong>view reliability history</strong>. Open the program and check for any errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from the battery and performance of the device, random shutdown could also be caused by unwanted programs. Using Windows Defender, please update definitions and perform a scan. You may refer to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/918355/how-to-troubleshoot-definition-update-issues-for-windows-defender" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this page</a></strong> for more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to find errors which direct us to the reason why the device shuts down, then you may need to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset the device using a recovery image</a></strong>. Doing this will reinstall the drivers and firmware that suits your device best, and remove all
 existing issues on your current operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The suggestions may be laborious but they shall help us resolve the issue you are facing. If you need more help, please update the post.</p>

            If you are using a laptop, swipe your finger from the left side of the touch pad. Then a strip of icons will come up on the left hand side of the screen.&nbsp;
<div>Choose Devices and printer options will come up.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Choose the one you want and it will give you print options screen.&nbsp;</div>
<div>If your printer will even work with Windows 8 that is.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I am new at this, and just leared it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>OR, you can press ctrl + P and the same print options will come up.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Windows 8 is not so "charm"ing.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Netflix Triggers Slow Motion Sound</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so this isn't a huge problem.... yet. But I don't want it to turn into one. It started before I upgraded to Windows 10 (from Windows 8.1, if that matters), which makes me even more apprehensive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes, only sometimes, when I have Netflix playing, the sound will turn grainy and slow way down. It sounds like those really sudden scares in a horror film, only extended forever. It's really freaky. It also slows down the video. That happens immediately,
 but the sound slows down by degrees and gets worse and worse and more and more garbled and it's honestly terrifying. I watch Netflix a lot at night so I often wake up to it and I'm so not okay with that. The sound problem extends to other apps and other things
 when this happens. Itunes will do it, youtube videos, and even the volume bar, like the little ping sound it makes to adjust the volume. Once it has gotten like that it never stops unless I restart my computer completely, and sometimes it happens 2 or 3 times
 within 24 hours. I've updated my drivers to the best of my (somewhat limited) computer abilities, and I restart my computer every day. Both of these practices seem to have improved it and it happens less often but it still happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I'm really afraid of is that someday restarting won't fix my problem. Like yeah it's annoying and I'd like it to stop, but really what I don't want is for it to get WORSE. (And it's just really freaky to wake up to Malcolm in the Middle on grating,
 horror movie slow motion sound, eee.)</p>
<p>Does this happen to anyone else? I've read it might be the sound card, but I don't know enough about computers to know if that's something I can easily and inexpensively fix. I'm sort of hoping there is some simple update or something that I'm not doing,
 or even a virus I can get rid of.</p>

    <title>Why does my laptop keep on having really long black screens and keep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r0607  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my laptop keep on having really long black screens and keep on freezing randomly&#63;</h2>
                    Hi this is my first post. Just this morning I headed to my desk and turned on my laptop (Samsung NP270E4E silver) to check some emails and what so. So I pressed the power button, the Samsung logo came up and the black screen appeared. Well, the black screen
 isn't really something uncommon to me because it appears just before the first Windows 8 screen (the one with the time, internet bar and photo etc) for a really short amount of time, let's say a maximum of 10 seconds. It went like that for awhile and I forced
 shutdown my laptop when it came to the point of reaching around 15 minutes. &nbsp;So I turned it on again, and the same thing happened except my later attempts had the cursor visible. I tried this "solution"&nbsp;that you press f2 once the samsung screen pops up once
 you turn it on, press f9 then f10 etc. After trying that I actually made it to the first windows screen. It would go as it would for half a minute or so but it would freeze at these instances: When I try to click the screen to get to the log in screen, When
 I'm currently logging in (when the screen says "welcome" and has the juggling balls", or when I miraculously get to the dashboard and click desktop. I figured that if I wait for awhile it will unfreeze at one point... but time was running as long as half an
 hour up to two hours. Out of frustration I force shutdown my laptop whenever it freezes. Oh and something to add: It wont be always assured that I can make it to the first windows 8 screen whenever I turn on my lappy. It's either that or I'm left with a black
 screen with my cursor. The furthest I can reach with my lappy was to the desktop but once I started opening files it starts freezing and I force shutdown it. &nbsp;Just a little background of my lappy: It's around almost a year old now and it fell a couple of times
 but it isn't that severe. Let's say not more than 5 inch falling distances and it hit only the bottom part of the laptop. The keyboard has been mishandled by a toddler (used some toys to hit the keyboard part but not very heavy ones) and at times when I'm
 late for an appointment I do force shutdown it. There also has been an instance that it ran out of battery and turned off. I haven't updated to windows 8.1 and if you're curious about what updates I have done on it, to be honest I really don't know. I think
 it's just those updates once you shutdown your laptop and it says "Please don't turn off" and has a % thing. I'm really worried about this since I haven't backed up some important files and I'm afraid if it would disappear... I truly appreciate any help any
 of you could give me, and I hope I explained this with enough details... sorry for my long post and bad english and thank you in advance for anyone out there who could help!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are getting a black screen on Windows 8.1, it could be due to an outdated or incompatible display adapter driver. Updating to the latest display driver should resolve this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> If you are not able to boot to the desktop, I would suggest you to hard shutdown the computer by pressing the power button. Try removing all the external devices connected to the computer and then try booting the computer and check
 if it works. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue persists, you can try running an Automatic Repair from the Windows installation DVD/USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Boot from the Windows 8 DVD/USB disk.<br />
2. Once selecting your language, time and keyboard settings, click Next to load the next window, then click on the Repair your computer link on the bottom left corner of the window.<br />
3. You should then be presented with a Choose an Option screen, with Troubleshoot as an option to select.<br />
4. In the Troubleshoot screen, select Advanced options.<br />
5. Select Automatic Repair from the Advanced options screen and then select the target operating system to repair, which would be Windows 8 in this case.</p>
<p>6. You can also try performing system restore and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If method 1 doesn’t help. To resolve this issue, you will need to boot into Safe Mode, and update the video card driver.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Boot the PC while holding the Shift key </li><li>Once the Recovery screen is displayed, click or tap on the See advanced repair options button.
</li><li>Next, click or tap on the Troubleshoot button. </li><li>In the troubleshoot menu, click or tap on Advanced options, </li><li>Then select Windows Startup Settings. </li><li>You will need be prompt to restart the PC.<span>&nbsp; </span>You will see a boot option screen where you can select Safe Mode with Networking.
</li><li>While in Safe Mode with Networking, you need to download and install the latest video card drivers from HP.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> There is no Windows 8 graphic card drivers from Samsung website. You can try installing Windows 7 drivers in compatibility mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Get your apps and devices working in Windows 8.1</strong></p>

            Hi. Thank you for the help I really appreciate it but just a little update: after countless times of rebooting my lappy I gave up and gave it a rest for two days. Then, it finally got to make me enter the desktop. I got to get some files to my external
 hard drive and I assumed it was working fine amd I reinstalled my programs. it was going well until there had been freezing problems whenever I would press the wifi icon or the volume icon on the lower right portion of the screen. It would freeze and either
 go back to normal or shutdown. I had to turn off and on airplane mode a few times to get the internet going but it mostly results to hanging and i'd wait it out and it would usually come back to normal. But this time it shut down and now it only gets me to
 the samsung screen with the juggling balls. After awhile it fades to a black screen and then to the windows teal screen that says "preparing to configure windows, please do not shut down" and i left it to stay overnight. I figured that somet

<p>It sounds suspicious to me.&nbsp; How did you get the reuest to do the load?&nbsp; Was it by e-mail or how?&nbsp; Did the e-mail or other message include the link to the download site for the software?&nbsp; If you used that, I would not consider the situation safe.&nbsp; Go to
 the NVIDIA site (NOT using the e-mail or other link but directly from Internet Explorer) and check for new firmware, software, or drivers applicable to your video card and version of Vista.&nbsp; If you find some, feel free to download and install it (it is safe
 it if comes from the manufacturer's web site).&nbsp; You might want to do this before your reboot in case whatever you downloaded and started installing has already adversely affected your device driver or firmware.</p>
<p>In the meantime I would deny the permission and do my best to delete whatever it is that you've already downloaded based on that message.</p>
<p>Then I would run a THOROUGH malware scan. <span>
Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and
</span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></a><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a>
<span>(with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time).
<span>&nbsp;</span>You may also want to try the free Avira at: </span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></a><span> and Avast at:
</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></a><span>.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>
You may also want to try the free OneCare at </span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a><span> and let it run all the options (except
 the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In fact, it might be safest to just do a System Restore to a point BEFORE you did the first dowlaod.&nbsp;
<span>
Here's the procedure: </span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates. </span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I&nbsp; hope this helps.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></span></span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file you are trying to play was ripped (copied) from an audio CD/DVD. To play the file on this computer, you must download a license (a process known as "license migration).<br />
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><br />
You may refer to the suggestion provided by Barb Bowman's from the following thread.<br />

    <title>.TMP file reappearing after delete - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> redheadrosie  say:</h3>
<h2>            .TMP file reappearing after delete</h2>
                    <p>This is a problem I have been having for a while now.</p>
<p>My C: hard drive keeps filling up. The only downloaded program I use is Google Chrome and I listen to all my music from my 1TB external hard drive because I have a lot of music and the laptop I'm using is only 32GB. I only use this to browse the internet
 and for school work (which I save on my school USB). I literally save nothing onto this laptop. I should also mention that I've only had this laptop for a week and a bit so it's not a case of a build up of files that needed to be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the most part, after all the system information and I deleted all the extra &nbsp;apps that I don't use I have about between 9-11GB of memory left, this is depending on how long I've been on chrome without deleting my cache and cookies etc. At first I was
 able to fix the solution with deleting temporary files through settings and it had worked for a while up until today I clicked delete temporary file and nothing happens I'd go back and &nbsp;refresh the stats and click on delete temporary files and nothing happens
 I have rebooted constantly as well, I also constantly use the clean up tool (about 4 times a day, because even though I clear temporary files they build up again but not as quickly as they had today and I'd only have a build up of about 700mb)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I noticed that within half an hour 4GB had gone from my hard drive and all I did was watch a YouTube video. I have tried every trick in the book to deal with the constant build up on my hard drive even CCleaner, trust me every form of cleaner there
 is for this type of thing I have used, then I downloaded WinDirStat to see where the file was. The file is a .TMP (BITBC7E.TMP) in the downloads folder of the SystemDistribution folder, it is the only thing in this folder. I deleted it and the space in my
 hard drive returned to the same amount it had been when I started up the computer. two minutes later the file reappeared and when I go to delete it it tells me the file is open in Application Information, I reboot and then it will let me delete the file but
 it reappears again and the same thing happens I can't delete the file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything and at this point I'm just exhausted. Please help me.</p>

    <title>Stop Adding the Bloatware I Take Off&#33;&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mseurat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stop Adding the Bloatware I Take Off&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 has lots of great features, but there are some that I just don't want, don't need,&nbsp;and don't use - for example: Bing Maps, Bing Finance, Messaging, Paid Wi-Fi &amp; Cellular, Movies &amp; TV, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Windows PowerShell to remove them (EX.:&nbsp; "Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.Messaging | Remove-AppxPackage"), but with each big version update (1511 and now 1607) not only do the ones I remove get put back in, new ones are added!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want them!&nbsp; I don't NEED them, and I WON'T USE them!&nbsp; I have removed them for a reason - they take up space and clutter my "All Apps" area,&nbsp; I run lean and efficient on my computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I take these bloatware off my machine - STOP ADDING THEM BACK IN!&nbsp; As part of the process, you might ASK people if they want these apps.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that there are various skills of tech savviness across the users and not all are as tech savvy as I am while there are plenty who are far more tech savvy than I.&nbsp; So here is a suggestion:&nbsp; Commonly, those who have Windows 10 Standard (or Home,
 or whatever it is called that is not Pro or Enterprise), tend to be less tech savvy or just don't get into the nitty-gritty of managing the minute elements of Windows (and typically cannot manage some due to a lack of features that are only available in Pro
 and Enterprise).&nbsp; Automatically assume those with Windows 10 standard want your bloatware apps, would find them useful, or at least just don't care so most likely won't mess with them.&nbsp; HOWEVER... those of us with Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise should be given
 the option to add or not add those features at the time of installation!!!&nbsp; Heck, even allowing them to be removed through "Control Panel - Programs &amp; Features - Turn Windows Features On or Off" would be more helpful and more intuitive, user friendly, and
 direct than having to use Windows PowerShell and the AppxPackage commands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please consider this and make the change with the next version update!!</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the Feedback Hub for a more direct way to let the developers know how you feel about this subject. I really doubt that this behavior will be changed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of the nature of the Feature Upgrades (November Upgrade, Anniversary Upgrade, etc) a full Upgrade installation is required, and if any of the standard apps have been removed, they will be replaced.</p>
<p>

<p>You can customize the Start menu anyway you want.&nbsp; Nothing has to go there on the right except what you want, where you put it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/197836/8-ways-to-customize-the-windows-10-start-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Customize
 the Windows 10 Start Menu</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The only modern apps that can't be Uninstalled from the All Apps menu are ones upon which other features depend.&nbsp; For example if you force uninstall Edge it will mess with Updates,&nbsp; Mail will bolix Calendar.&nbsp; But if you just ignore those and set other Defaults
 in Settings&gt;Apps you can pretty well ignore them now that Edge has settled down in V.1703 from stealing .pdf defaults.&nbsp; However this does need to have some adjustment in a feature Update.&nbsp; Most of my v.1703 Upgrades however have not changed things much, even
 ones done using the more stable Upgrade method from <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Ronnie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I side with MSeurat, why would Microsoft force all these "apps" to re-install after ANY update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still upset when MS put a firewall in Windows XP (and all the new OS's and Servers?) that cannot be uninstalled. Running a firewall on an OS is so old school, like super old school.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things MS needs to work on:</p>
<p>#1 - Customer satisfaction. MS does not care about it's consumers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 - Make ALL updates "optional." Make it possible to stop Windows from updating</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 - When "apps" are removed by Powershell, they need to stay "removed."</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 - Make EVERY "app", "feature", and anything else MS force installs into Windows 10 Permanently removable. I am talking about ANYTHING. If a consumer wants a stripped down Windows 10, then let it be possible. 75% of the consumers want a PC that can browse
 the Internet, do word processing (Excel too), and print stuff, and play a few games. That's it! They don't want a hot spot, a firewall, Wi-Fi calling, MS phone, 3D Builder, etc. All these things load and take RAM and have no purpose. Luckily MS doesn't sell
 cars, they would load it up with stuff like: blue lit arm rest buttons, internal vehicle weather map, double fog lights, crypto locked cigarette lighters, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If MS made Windows 10 available in a stripped down version where the CONSUMER can build it to their CUSTOM liking&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;would actually be something I could recommend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Certified before you</p>

<p>1. Microsoft has billions of customers, you can't please all of them</p>
<p>2. Can't. The battle against Malware continues.</p>
<p>3. Powershell isn't the end all of methods to removing apps. Your phone has built in apps, so does Windows.</p>
<p>4. Can't. Too many features are inner connected. Most consumers (see #1 above) don't want to have to think about coming up with tools to do a particular job. They are grateful that the tools are already included.</p>
<p>Not going to be a stripped down version. Not enough techies (see #1 above) to justify the expense of creating it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You of course are welcome to leave your comments in the Feedback app so that someone from Microsoft will see it. They aren't here.</p>

            One person's bloatware is another person's cool feature. Windows wasn't created for you alone. If you have no use for an app, do what I do: ignore it. Those apps aren't doing a bit of harm to my computer by just being there.

<p>MS bloatware is a problem! </p>
<p>not only does it take up space but it opens up the pc's to more vulnerabilities. When you take the MS exams for installing server core they specifically highlight removing unneeded software to save space and help harden the computer against attacks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allways....Allways remove software you will never use, that is unless you don't care about your personal data getting corrupted or stolen.</p>

            <p>Hello charlieyoung,</p>

<p>
</p><p>As to you r question 'who should never use it?' the simple answer is anyone who doesn't know what they are doing. As with any command line language you have to have experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally never use it, but then again I rarely use the command prompt either. Well not unless I need to for troubleshooting a problem.</p>
