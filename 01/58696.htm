<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>in order to be able to purchase (a free) Xbox 360 content you will require a valid payment option on your account that matches the region on your account. The payment option won't be charged but it is required to be present to acquire Xbox 360 content on
 any device other then a 360 console. So it's best to try and add a valid payment option on your account a then try purchasing the (free) 360 content again.</p>
<p>If it still fails then it's best to contact Xbox Support via Phone or Support Chat at
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/contact-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results</p>

<p>Olá rafazinArantes,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sempre resgatei os jogos da gold normalmente tanto pelo console quanto pelo site, porém, se tratando dos jogos xbox 360, o sistema sempre exigiu que sua conta tenha um cartão de crédito válido para resgatar esses jogos, mesmo sendo gratuitos pelo gold.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Porém, foi relatado pela microsoft uma <a href="https://support.xbox.com/pt-br/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
instabilidade na rede da xbox live</a>. Esta instabilidade afeta o resgate de códigos, downloads de jogos, e novas aquisições. Tendo em vista isso, espere até que a rede se estabilize e tente novamente.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Espero ter ajudado.</p>
<p>---------------------</p>
<p><strong>[Mod Translation -&nbsp;<span>Hello, rafazinArantes,</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span>I've always redeemed gold games, both on the console and on the site, but when it comes to xbox 360 games, the system has always required that your account have a valid credit card to redeem these games, even if they are free for gold.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span>However, it was reported by microsoft an instability in the network of xbox live.</span></strong><span>
</span><strong><span>This instability affects the redemption of codes, game downloads, and new acquisitions.</span></strong><span>
</span><strong><span>In view of this, wait until the network stabilizes and try again.</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong><span>Hope this helps.]</span></strong></p>

    <title>System-Wide Audio Lag on One S - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> radi0aktive toy  say:</h3>
<h2>            System-Wide Audio Lag on One S</h2>
                    <p>System-Wide Audio Lag on One S</p>
<p><br /></p><p>First of all, some background. I have two main TV's, a Vizio M43-C1 which is a 4K LCD; and an LG 50PZ550, which is a 1080p plasma. Both TV's are also connected to LG soundbars via optical cable. Every device I connect to them has perfectly synced audio and video, including cable boxes, Rokus, other gaming consoles, Blu-ray players, etc. The only device giving me problems is my new Xbox One S.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With the One S, all the time, the audio is noticeably behind the video. Doesn't matter how or what I do to the settings or how I output, it's behind. It's horrendously, nearly a half second behind with the Blu-ray app specifically, but always behind everywhere else. I've tried outputting uncompressed stereo via both HDMI and optical, as well as the headphone jack on the controller itself, and they all are behind. When I change the output settings to bitstream, the sound is then a full second behind, so that's not an option. My TV's both have a lip sync slider, but they only delay when the audio comes, so since it's already behind this only makes things worse. I've even changed video settings and resolutions around and this makes no difference. There is zero video lag, as my button presses are perfectly in sync with what's happening on screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't know what else to do, as this is seriously hindering my enjoyment of the system. I must stress once again that this is not an issue with any other device on either of my TV's, it's JUST the Xbox One S. Please advise. Thanks.</p>

We really try to not have that happen.</p><p><br /></p><p>If the sound is coming out of the TV instead of the sound bar, does a delay happen? I&nbsp;know it's happening with the controller, too, but I'm wondering if the console is confused by the optical output from the TV&nbsp;itself&nbsp;for some reason. Are you using the HDMI&nbsp;cable that came with the console, too? Using a different one could be affecting the transfer. If you aren't, please let me know the model/brand of HDMI&nbsp;cable you are using so I can look into its information. Thanks! :)</p>

</p><p>1. Blu-ray app version is&nbsp;Microsoft.BlurayPlayer_2.0.16.6_x64_8wekyb3d8bbwe<br />
</p>
<p>2. Every&nbsp;disc is affected, Blu-ray/UHD Blu-ray/DVD. Netflix is on par with the rest of he system, just a smidge late. Blu-ray is far, far worse.</p>
<p>3a. Audio&nbsp;setup is HDMI to the TV. No special settings. Straight shot. The sound bar is optical out from the TV. I tried connecting optical directly to the One S as well and it was identical to HDMI.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3b. Same results with HDMI and optical. Uncompressed. Choosing Bitstream causes an even longer full second delay so&nbsp;I leave it uncompressed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What I don't understand is why the sound is coming late to the headphone jack on the controller as well. Both the One S controller and a regular One controller. It's like the entire system is sending out all audio late. The video seems perfect, as I've stated my button presses are perfectly timed with what's happening on screen in games and the UI. Just the&nbsp;audio is late. This is bizarre to me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks, Radi0!&nbsp;I appreciate the full details there. I&nbsp;realized most of it is in your original post, so I'm sorry for having you do double work. We really try to not have that happen.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the sound is coming out of the TV instead of the sound bar, does a delay happen? I&nbsp;know it's happening with the controller, too, but I'm wondering if the console is confused by the optical output from the TV&nbsp;itself&nbsp;for some reason. Are you using the HDMI&nbsp;cable that came with the console, too? Using a different one could be affecting the transfer. If you aren't, please let me know the model/brand of HDMI&nbsp;cable you are using so I can look into its information. Thanks! :)</p>
<p> 
 </p></blockquote><p /><p><br /></p><p>Let's take optical and the soundbar *completely* out of the equation. This lag occurs even with HDMI only through the TV speakers and optical *completely* disabled in the settings and removed from the console. I have tried multiple HDMI cables as well as multiple televisions. Every single other device I use is FINE on both, including a 4K/60 Roku 4. This isn't a cable issue. You guys are Microsoft, this is ridiculous.</p>

<p>I had this same issue with my Xbox One S and now with the X.&nbsp; DVD's, Blu Rays, UHD all suffer huge audio lag.&nbsp; I gave up as this has been posted for years and MS doesn't appear to want to fix.&nbsp; I have turned people away from using the Xbox One as their UHD
 player because of this.&nbsp; Many wanted to buy it just because they get the game system and UHD player which appears to be a better deal than the PS4 Pro.&nbsp; This is why I went Xbox One S in the first place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now I am finding the problem is not just the Blu Ray player.&nbsp; I recently installed Youtube TV.&nbsp; And guess what, same lip sync issues.&nbsp; Only way I was able to fix it was setting audio to stereo.&nbsp; Bitstream doesn't work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are so many examples of issues with this in forums it shocks me Microsoft continues to advertise this as an entertainment console for everything but it simply doesn't work.</p>

<p>Yeah, same problem here.</p>
<p>I got the XBox One S at the end of October as my main multimedia-rig (not much space for several devices).</p>
<p>This problem just doesn't get fixed. I complained to MS-Support about it and demanded a refund to get something else. I had the device for 3 months already and got rejected...</p>
<p>The support was rather rude as well, when i told them i wanted to get rid of the console. They had the nerve to tell me (roughly translated from german) "I don't understand your bad disposition. This is the best console on the market". Yeah, like hell it
 is! Basicaly i was told to shut up and like it, no matter all the problems (i have some other gripes with this piece of junk like unstable wifi and MS last total blackout).</p>
<p>If i would treat a customer like Microsoft does all the time, i would get instantly fired.</p>

<h2>            Question - Performance, Rate and Improve Your Computer&#39;s Performance</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a HP Home Premium Windows Vista laptop computer (32-bit).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the Performance info in Windows Experience and saw an exclamation sign saying that it had detected "New Hardware."&nbsp; Before refreshing, my base score before was 3.5.&nbsp; After refreshing, my base score now is only 3.4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is:&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it lower?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My other question is: &nbsp;I never saw what the new hardware was.&nbsp; I left the room while it refreshed.&nbsp; How do I find out what new hardware it is?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks very much,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Just to the right of the little blue box with the rating number (3.4 in your case) there is blue text that says
<strong><em>Windows Experience Index</em></strong>.&nbsp; That's what you want to click on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>What is the <span>Windows</span> Experience Index?
<p>The <span>Windows</span> Experience Index measures the capability of your computer's hardware and software configuration and expresses this measurement as a number called a
<span>base score</span>. A higher base score generally means that your computer will perform better and faster than a computer with a lower base score, especially when performing more advanced and resource-intensive tasks.
</p>
<p>Each hardware component receives an individual <span>subscore</span>. Your computer's base score is determined by the lowest subscore. For example, if the lowest subscore of an individual hardware component is 2.6, then the base score is 2.6. The base score
<span>is not</span> an average of the combined subscores. However, the subscores can give you a view of how the components that are most important to you will perform, and can help you decide which components to upgrade.</p>
<p>You can use the base score to buy programs and other software that are matched to your computer's base score. For example, if your computer has a base score of 3.3, then you can buy any software designed for this version of
<span>Windows</span> that requires a computer with a base score of 3 or lower.</p>
<p>The scores currently range from 1.0 to 7.9. The <span>Windows</span> Experience Index is designed to accommodate advances in computer technology. As hardware speed and performance improve, higher score ranges will be enabled. The standards for each level
 of the index generally stay the same. However, in some cases, new tests might be developed that can result in lower scores.</p>
Note
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your computer has a 64-bit central processing unit (CPU) and 4 gigabytes (GB) or less random access memory (RAM), then the Memory (RAM) subscore for your computer will have a maximum of 5.9.</p>
</li></ul>
<div>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcontent.windows.microsoft.com%2fBetterWhenConnectedHelpWS%2fGetContent.aspx%3fassetID%3de43a6616-17e0-489f-82b6-354376e49d00%26amp%3bdocumentSet%3den-US%26amp%3bProd%3dWIN700%26amp%3bMarket%3dUS" /><span>Performance Information and Tools</span></p>
&nbsp;
<div><span>
<div>
<p>The base score represents the minimum performance of your system, based on the capabilities of different parts of your computer, including random access memory (RAM), central processing unit (CPU), hard disk, general graphics performance on the desktop,
 and 3‑D graphics capability.</p>
<p>Here are general descriptions of the experience you can expect from a computer that receives the following base scores:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A computer with a base score of 2.0 usually has sufficient performance to do general computing tasks, such as run business programs and search the Internet. However, a computer with this base score is generally not powerful enough to run
<span>Aero</span>, or the advanced multimedia experiences that are available with
<span>Windows 7</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A computer with a base score of 3.0 can run <span>Aero</span> and many features of
<span>Windows 7</span> at a basic level. Some of the <span>Windows 7</span> advanced features might not have all of their functionality available. For example, a computer with a base score of 3.0 can display the
<span>Windows 7</span> theme at a resolution of 1280 × 1024, but might struggle to run the theme on multiple monitors. Or, it can play digital TV content but might struggle to play high-definition television (HDTV) content.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A computer with a base score of 4.0 or 5.0 can run new features of <span>Windows 7</span>, and it can support running multiple programs at the same time.</p>
</li><li>
<p>A computer with a base score of 6.0 or 7.0 has a faster hard disk, and can support high-end, graphics-intensive experiences, such as multiplayer and 3‑D gaming and recording and playback of HDTV content.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If a particular program or <span>Windows 7</span> experience requires a higher score than your base score, you can upgrade your hardware to meet the necessary base score. If you install new hardware and want to see if your score has changed, click
<span>Re-run the assessment</span>. <span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcontent.windows.microsoft.com%2fBetterWhenConnectedHelpWS%2fGetContent.aspx%3fassetID%3d18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b%26amp%3bdocumentSet%3den-US%26amp%3bProd%3dWIN700%26amp%3bMarket%3dUS" /> If you're prompted for an administrator
 password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span> To view details about the hardware on your computer, click
<span>View and print details</span>.</p>
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>
<div>
<p>The subscores are the result of tests run on the RAM, CPU, hard disk, general desktop graphics, and 3‑D gaming graphics hardware components of your computer. If your base score isn't sufficient for a program or
<span>Windows 7</span> experience, you can use the subscores to figure out which components you need to upgrade.</p>
<p>The base score is a good indicator of how your computer will perform generally. The subscores can help you understand your computer's level of performance for specific experiences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Office productivity.</span> If you use your computer almost exclusively for office productivity experiences, such as word processing, spreadsheets, e‑mail, and web browsing, then high subscores in the CPU and memory categories are important. Subscores
 of 2.0 or higher are usually sufficient in the desktop graphics and 3‑D graphics categories.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Gaming and graphic-intensive programs.</span> If you use your computer for games or programs that are graphic-intensive, such as digital video editing programs or realistic first-person games, then high subscores in the RAM, desktop graphics, 3‑D gaming
 graphics, and CPU categories are important. A subscore of 3.0 or higher is usually sufficient in the hard disk category.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Media center experience.</span> If you use your computer as a media center for advanced multimedia experiences such as recording HDTV programming, then high subscores in the CPU, hard disk, and desktop graphics categories are important. Subscores of
 3.0 or higher are usually sufficient in the memory and 3‑D graphics categories.</p>
</li></ul>
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>
<div>
<p>The following conditions might prevent <span>Windows</span> from updating the <span>
Windows</span> Experience Index:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Running on battery power.</span>‌ <span>Windows</span> automatically tries to conserve power when running on a battery alone. So if your computer is running on battery power, a performance assessment won't reflect its true capabilities. Plug your computer
 in, and then re-run the assessment.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Not enough free disk space.</span> The <span>Windows</span> Experience Index assessment tool creates a test file on your hard disk. If there's not enough free disk space to create the test file, the assessment can't be completed. You can use the Disk
 Cleanup tool to free up disk space. For more information, see Delete files using Disk Cleanup.
</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>The assessment is already running.</span> If the <span>Windows</span> Experience Index assessment tool is already running, your scores can't be updated.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>The display driver is older.</span> If your computer is using an older version of the display driver, your scores might not be updated. For more information, see Update drivers: recommended links
</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>No multimedia support.</span> If your computer doesn't have multimedia support, your scores can't be updated.</p>
</li></ul>
</span></div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
This is my generic black screen troubleshooter and I left the 1st parts in just in case you get to a point<br />
where those are useful so give them a try anyway.<br />
<br />
Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel - Device
<br />
Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver - then Right Click<br />
on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
Another method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode) is to
<br />
CTRL + ALT + DEL and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe .<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.<br />
<br />
<span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a</span><br />
<br />
Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss basis.<br />
That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just adds to the<br />
difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect. You can try a
<br />
google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these cover a wide<br />
field of efforts.<br />
<br />
Here is a video of one fix.<br />

Here is another fix<br />

<br />
<br />
Do you have a Vista Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the disks your system<br />
maker will sell them cheap. Or try from Safe Mode if you can get there.<br />

<br />
If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.<br />
<br />
You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data)&nbsp;or a repair installation (hopefully<br />
saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or three.<br />
<br />
You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own Product Key.<br />
<br />
In-Place Upgrade<br />
<span>http://vistasupport.mvps.org/repair_a_vista_installation_using_the_upgrade_option_of_the_vista_dvd.htm</span><br />
<br />
<br />
If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have to
<br />
reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions. You will<br />
need to know your Product Code.<br />

<br />
Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Vista boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - <strong>
do not type parenthesis<br />
or BOLD</strong>)<br />
<br />
c:<br />
<br />

<br />
cd c:\Windows\System32\winevt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(there is a space between cd and C: )<br />
</strong><br />

<br />
REBOOT to Windows<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and Happy Holidays!<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The mouse could well have a problem, check with its maker's support.<br />
<br />
Do other USB devices perform properly? Does the mouse work in other systems?<br />

<p><strong>UFC 154 LIVE STREAM</strong></p>
<p>On the eve of what should be the biggest fight of the year for the UFC, numerous people are wondering aloud why there doesn’t seem to be that much buzz around the long-awaited return of Georges St-Pierre.<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)"><strong><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://liveonpc.tv/ufc/play.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)">UFC 154 LIVE STREAM </span></a>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</span></strong></span></p>
<p>While there are a number of reasons why this card isn’t generating the kind of audible buzz you’d expect from a fight of this magnitude, one of the reasons many are
 pointing to is that Condit just isn’t a big enough name. Fans aren’t necessarily familiar with him. He’s not a guy they look at and think, “Oh yeah, him! He’s awesome!” even though, you know, he is awesome.<br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)"><strong><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://liveonpc.tv/ufc/play.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)">UFC 154 LIVE STREAM </span></a>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br />
How did we arrive at this point? How is it that Carlos Condit could potentially leave Montreal as the undisputed welterweight champion and yet he’s a relative unknown outside of the hardcore set?<br />
<br />
First and foremost, as much as standing opposite GSP brings an automatic increase in attention, this fight is different than your standard title defense. This is St-Pierre’s return fight, after a catastrophic injury and extend time away, in his hometown, with
 the Anderson Silva super-fight potentially hanging in the balance.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)"><strong><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://liveonpc.tv/ufc/play.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)">UFC 154 LIVE STREAM </span></a>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</span></strong></span>Condit could have a bright green Mohawk and be channeling Chael Sonnen this week, and he’s still going to be a very distant second to St-Pierre in the attention department,
 and that’s provided the Silva talk dies down a little and nothing else of greater interest happens in the 24/7/365 world of MMA.<br />
<br />
Secondly, Condit isn’t the type of guy who is going to go out and court attention either.<br />
<br />
He doesn’t deliver extended soliloquies targeted at high profile opponents after his wins or stir up controversy (and a following) on social media. In interviews, he’s reserved, measured, and always looks a little uncomfortable. When it comes to fighting, he
 steps in the cage, does his job, and heads home. There are no celebratory back-flips or controversial call-outs, and in today’s marketplace, that unfortunately means a smaller share of the spotlight and far less coverage.<br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)"><strong><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://liveonpc.tv/ufc/play.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)">UFC 154 LIVE STREAM </span></a>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br />
As much as I understand the decision to wait for St-Pierre to return and have this opportunity, winning the interim title in February was the high water mark of his UFC career to date (by far), and the controversy that surrounded the victory – justified or
 not – could have carried Condit’s star to greater heights. Instead, he stepped out of the spotlight and onto the sidelines, and his rise to the top of the division was swallowed up by a rash of injuries, suspensions, event cancellations, and myriad other new
 items over the summer. It was the right decision – and it’s not like he offered any other opportunities either – but it certainly didn’t help increase his profile any.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)"><strong><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://liveonpc.tv/ufc/play.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)">UFC 154 LIVE STREAM </span></a>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</span></strong></span>Because Condit is rarely the sexy story, we’re rarely in a rush to put his name in the headlines. It’s a vicious circle really. He’s not a big enough star so we don’t
 write about him as much and because we don’t write about him as much, he’s not a bigger star.<br />
<br />
The UFC 154 live stream online fights arrive Saturday night, for fans to watch free of charge online. With St-Pierre vs. Condit the main event many are waiting to order, the preliminary fights will get mixed martial arts fans ready for that main fight card
 on Pay-Per-View. Luckily for fans, they'll get about eight total fights to watch free of charge thanks to internet feed and the FX television channel.<br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)"><strong><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://liveonpc.tv/ufc/play.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)">UFC 154 LIVE STREAM </span></a>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br />
The UFC 154 live streaming fights begin at 6:20PM EST on Facebook, through the UFC's official page. Fans who have clicked "Like" get to return at that time and watch four free fights streaming through their video feed. These include Ivan Menjivar vs. Azamat
 Gshimov, Antonio Carvalho vs. Rodrigo Damm, and Steven Siler vs. Darren Elkins. All of those fights are advertised as free of charge for fans on UFC's Facebook page.<br />
<br />
At 8PM EST, there's four more free preliminary fights featured on FX via cable or satellite TV. Among the featured fights on television are Mark Bocek vs. Rafael Dos Anjos, Sam Stout vs. John Makdessi and Patrick Cote vs. Alessio Sakara. This round of prelims
 should get fans warmed up for what will unfold when the top stars battle in the Pay-Per-View itself.<br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)"><strong><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://liveonpc.tv/ufc/play.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)">UFC 154 LIVE STREAM </span></a>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><br />
The main show begins at 10PM EST, and while there are always UFC live stream feeds advertised online, don't buy into the promises of a free event. Some of the sites claiming the event can be watched for free contain surveys that need to be filled out, offers
 that have to be purchased, or may even contain harmful links. In order to see the Pay-Per-View, fans are better off splitting the cost with some friends, or heading out to a local bar or restaurant to see the show.<br />
<br />
It could be an entertaining night too, as GSP aka "Rush" looks to get back into the octagon again. He'll have a fierce battle on his hands with Carlos Condit, but many of his loyal fans are looking forward to St-Pierre picking up a return victory Saturday night.
 ESPN.com also reports that Georges St-Pierre, with a victory over Condit tonight, will receive plenty of questions about whether or not his next opponent will be Anderson Silva.<br />
<br />
Condit has talked about the fact that many people may be overlooking him in tonight's fight. Even though he's the underdog in Montreal, with Silva planning to attend and watch the fight, Condit is ready to go, telling ESPN.com:<br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)"><strong><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://liveonpc.tv/ufc/play.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)">UFC 154 LIVE STREAM </span></a>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</span></strong></span></p>
<p>"It's fine, man. I'm used to being overlooked. You know, when I fought Nick Diaz [at UFC 143], they were talking about the Georges St-Pierre-Nick Diaz fight next. No
 big deal for me. I'm focused on Georges St-Pierre."<br />
<br />
It seems like the standard answer many athletes give when talking about opponents who are the favorites. However, could Condit be more focused than GSP is tonight? If Silva is there to watch as things unfold, will "Rush" be looking ahead to a potential showdown,
 and possibly falter?<br />
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)"><strong><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; <a href="http://liveonpc.tv/ufc/play.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)">UFC 154 LIVE STREAM </span></a>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</span></strong></span></p>
<p>It all starts at 6:20 PM EST with the free live streaming fights on Facebook, followed by more free fights on FX, and the Pay-Per-View itself at 10PM EST. Will you be
 watching, and if so, which fight are you looking forward to the most?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have deleted nearly all of my downloads from File Explorer. &nbsp;I keep a few because I need them to run the process. &nbsp;I also delete downloads in Chrome Browser... Edge doesn't store downloads.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Rule of Thumb:&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>If you can re-download the program or apps from a site, then there is no need to keep the download after installation. &nbsp;You should keep downloads, if they are not available again, for possible re-installation. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            No sound record play&#47; sound on startup. Volume icon beside the Icon and properties has a X mark and after right clicking on the icon states no device is installed</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Sound record play / no sound even on startup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Toshiba L505-ES5034. I have no sound at all even on startup. In device manager under sound the listed device Intel(R) audio says that it is working properly. The speaker icon located in the bottom right hand has an X beside it. When I right click
 on the icon and go to properties it states that no device is installed. under all the tabs it says the same thing. I have unistalled the device from Device Manager and rebooted the device is installed and device manager states that the device is working properly.
 Yet I still have the X beside the Icon (bottom right hand)&nbsp;and properties (after right clicking on the icon) states no device is installed. I have down loaded updated drivers and installed&nbsp;them from Toshiba to no avail. What do I do next? That is the last
 time I let my girlfriend use my laptop. Also I went to services.msc and checked Windows audio and audio end point builder and they both show as being&nbsp;started.</p>

This is not meant to solve your problem. Just my personal opinion.....</p>
<p>Unless you have real need for Bings Desktop, why not uninstall it via Programs and Features ?</p>
<p>I did. I even remove Bing Search engine as default, and I use Google as default. Now my Internet explorer is a lot neater and cleaner at the top.</p>

<h3> dimitaryosifov  say:</h3>
<h2>            System thread exception not handled windows 8.1 Lenovo b50-45</h2>
                    <p>The software update causing the BSOD is&nbsp;kb3088195.<br />
</p>
<p>Solution: You need to uninstall the "Lenovo USB blocker" application from the laptop in order to be able to install this security update.<br />
<br />
1. Do not refresh your system, it doesn't help.<br />
2. After attempting to install this update the system will BSOD and reboot multiple times until it reaches the Recovery Menu.<br />
Use it to start Windows in Safe Mode, option 4.<br />
Windows will reboot and revert all update changes giving you access to your desktop, where you will need to uninstall the above mentioned app.<br />
<br />
If this doesn't work for you, use the "WhoCrashed" app to analyze your crash logs and uninstall the driver that's causing you issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure which side is responsible for this and why in 2015 we still deal with BSODs, but it's extremely disappointing!<br />
This laptop was bought as a gift for a relative who lives alone at the other end of the country.</p>
<p>Wasted 1 day of my life trying to troubleshoot the issue, I can't imagine doing this over the phone with an elderly person!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows detects that it rebooted multiple times, it also detects it was unable to install the update successfully and reverts the changes, why do I need a Recovery menu and why Windows doesn't do all this on its own is beyond me.<br />

            <p>I had this exact problem troubleshooting a friends's Lenovo B50 Touch laptop. It took me a long time to isolate the problem to KB3088195. However, finding your post enabled me to quickly circumvent the problem by uninstalling the USB blocker application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a <a href="https://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Lenovo-B-and-G-Series-Notebooks/Lenovo-B50-Series-Blue-Screen-after-this-patch-Tuesday/td-p/2190075" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
thread in Lenovo's community forums</a> detailing what appears to be the same issue so I replied with a link back to this post as one would expect many Lenovo users will be experiencing this issue. Hopefully Lenovo will notice and fix the underlying issue with
 the USB blocker application soon. But in the meantime, your circumvention should save a lot of aggravation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your post!</p>

            <p>If your system installed a lot of updates (150+) in one go, the system may need to "Undo changes" multiple times and reboot multiple times. You will have to wait for windows to finish the process.<br />
<br />
You don't need to be in Safe Mode to uninstall the USB Blocker app.</p>
<p>The Safe Mode step is only needed when you don't have access to your desktop and can't uninstall the app, it triggers Windows to Undo the update.<br />

            Thanks, I'll have to wait then. There were indeed a lot of updates (+- 50 I think...). I DON'T have acces to Windows. I'm already a victim of the 'USB Blocker' Glitch. If that is in fact what's causing my problem...

            <p>Thank you very much for providing useful information.</p>
<p>After I got this problem, I refreshed my system and installed all the recommended updates, and the BSOD occurred again.</p>
<p>So, I refreshed it again and now I am installing some of older updates little by little.</p>
<p>And I found this site! I wanted to do as you recommend but I somehow couldn't uninstall the Lenovo USB blocker. I followed "Control Panel" "Programs" "Programs and Features", selected the "Lenovo USB blocker " and then clicked "Uninstall". But the installshiled
 wizard didn't complete the process. Could you tell me how to uninstall the Lenovo USB blocker in this case?</p>

            When you uninstall the USB locker it may ask you to enter your password. if you don't it seeks to finish but reports that it did not completely uninstall.

            <p><span>To tristram_ &amp; MS-Guy,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you both for replying.</span></p>
<p><span>My PC is Lenovo B50-30 (Japan-only model, I guess), so it might work differently.</span></p>
<p><span>I just avoided the update KB3088195 and now my pc is working fine.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you very much for your help. Now I’m happy my PC has come back to life.</span></p>
<p><span>By the way, not installing KB3088195 will cause any problems in the future, do you think?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I don’t know if you are still interested, but I will just let you know about my case here.</span></p>
<p><span>Every time I try to uninstall the USB blocker, first I get a message (in Japanese) like “USB blocker is protecting the system. Do you really uninstall this?”, and after I clicked “yes”, I get a message saying “The wizard was interrupted
 before it was completely installed. The system has not been modified. To install this program later, please run the installation again.” Every time the same.</span></p>
<p><span>I noticed the pc camera wasn’t working when I was setting up skype. So I deleted the Lenovo EasyCamera from the device list and added it again. Then this USB blocker window appeared requesting the password for windows. Now the camera is
 working. So I guess the USB blocker plays some role in B50-30 and it cannot be deleted.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi bripage,</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get any specific error messages?</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this happen with all the floppy disks or just this one?</span></p>
<p><span>Things you want to check for:</span></p>
<p><span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Make sure the floppy disk is properly inserted in the drive.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the disk is inserted properly and you are still unable to write data to it, the disk may be full or write-protected.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You can either use a floppy disk that is not write-protected or disable the write-protect feature by moving the write-protect tab
 on the bottom of the disk to the close position.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Check the floppy drive on another computer.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Check with different floppy disks on your computer.<br />
<br />
<br />

 i have gone into the mixer settings and changed the name of the device but in the bluetooth settings window it still reads iahb64. ive plugged the headphones into the computer both to use as wired headphone and to charge yet the control window to "decide what
 i want to do with this device" in order to rename it did not show up. ive gone to the drivers to rename the device and its not an option. i am out of ideas and need some help because as it stands now this is not an effective sy

<h2>            Logitech Z305 speakers not working since Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    I have Logitech z305 speakers which are not working since I upgraded to Windows 10 on my Toshiba Satellite C50D. The drivers are all up to date so I was wondering if there's anything else I can try before reverting back to Windows 8, as I would rather
 have the speakers than the operating system?

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to run “Hardware and Devices” troubleshooter to diagnose the exact issue.<br />

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to uninstall the Sound Video and Game Controllers driver and reinstall the latest Sound<strong>
</strong>Video and Game Controllers driver in compatibility mode and check, if it works.
</span></span></p>

    <title>Using the Surface touchscreen as a mouse on extended display monitor. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r&#233;migodin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using the Surface touchscreen as a mouse on extended display monitor.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would like to know if there is a way to use the touchscreen on the Microsoft Surface Pro 2 as a mouse on a dual monitor extended desktop setup.</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with a Wacom Cintiq will know that such a toggle between screens can be achieved with a short-cut button, I would very much like to use my Surface Pro 2 as a professional drawing and storyboarding tool, but being able to switch easily between
 screens is essential to my workflow as I can put my tools, scripts, image references, on one screen and use the full other screen as a drawing surface.</p>
<p>Ideally I would be able to configure this toggle on the eraser button on the pen, but a keyboard shortcut will do.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Rémi </p>

            Hello Mahesh,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your fast reply, I will definitely try Mouse without Borders when I get a chance, and hunt for third party tools (I understand that in your position you cannot direct me to any of these tools).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let me seize this opportunity to say how thrilled I am with the direction Windows is taking, I've been using Windows 8.1 for two weeks and I can only applaud the direction this OS is taking. There are many loud skeptics out there, and it reminds me of
 my teenage years when Windows 95 came out facing the powerful Windows 3.11. I believe Windows 8.1 is a similarly bold move and a giant leap towards the future of personal computing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That being said, this mouse problem is one of those little quirks that are quite baffling to me, being able to assign a keyboard shortcut, or a gesture, to switch between screens seems like such an evident tool, especially in this era of wireless screens
 and internet television, and I don't believe I've been spoiled by "professional" screen tablets that carry this feature when I decide to shell out funds for the "professional" version of Microsoft tools.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Again, thank you so much for your reply and good luck in the future,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Rémi</div>

<h2>            Problem allowing program through firewall in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Problem allowing program through firewall</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have an issue allowing a program (Serviio)&nbsp;through the Windows 10 Firewall.&nbsp;When Windows 10 is fully booted and I confirm I cannot connect to&nbsp;the program&nbsp;running on my computer, I&nbsp;am able to get&nbsp;things working&nbsp;by adding an exception for the program
 under the "Allow an app or feature through Windows Firewall". All communication is fine until the computer is rebooted. Once I restart Windows 10 I can no longer communicate with the program until I add the same rule again. It is like Windows 10 ignores the
 rule and blocks connections until the rule is added again. I do not have any other firewall or virus software running on my PC. Any thoughts?</p>

            I have not had to create rules for any other program to get through the firewall. I used Serviio in Windows 8 for streaming music on my network from my PC to a Blu-Ray player &amp; TV. I guess what frustrates me the most is that streaming a music library using
 nothing more than Windows is extremely slow and finicky. What do I need to do to speed up connecting directly to the PC with Windows Media Streaming? I have a brand new TPLINK AC wireless router that has been amazing when streaming music and home video using
 Serviio in Windows 8.1. Since I have had issues with Windows 10 &amp; Serviio, I tried going back and messing with the Windows media streaming but encounter the same slow response. I do not have an option to brose my library by letters and viewing "All Artists"
 is what makes things move extremely slow.

            I ended up finding that Windows 10 and Serviio were not causing the issue. For some reason all the Sony Blu-Ray players using DLNA that I was using needed to have a factory reset done. Once the reset was done, wireless info was entered, and server Serviio
 was discovered, all was good. I can't figure out why the reset needed to be done on the Blu-Ray players. Serviio worked before the Windows 10 upgrade and nothing changed (computer name, ip address, network info, etc). Oh well, it is all fixed now.

            <p>Jim Hi...</p>
<p>Not wishing to refute Navneet's advice in any way, but there are known issues with this update which I understand MS is investigating...it relates to Internet Explorer and if you open IE click the 'Help' button and look at 'about IE' you may find you do
 have the latest version. (KB30338314) Also if you click on the KB&nbsp;link (below) you will see an explanation about your error code (under the sub-heading 'more information'). Hope this eases your concerns a little! - Regards - R.

<p>So here I am again after days of frustration!&nbsp; I have been thru ALL the fixes except the registry modification process which I refuse to try because of several reasons but mainly because I do not know how to back-up the registry!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In the MS15-032 article of 4/1/15 It states "---click IE on the help menu-------.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In doing so I get a popup that reads:&nbsp;&nbsp; "About Internet Explorer"</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 11</p>

<p>Install new version automatically IS checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only option for this popup is to close the window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel that my computer is at risk because of the inability to install the update AND it continues to be present EVBERDAY when I go to Windows Update.&nbsp; Any further thoughts????????</p>

            <p>Your 'About Internet Explorer' details read exactly the same as mine, -&nbsp;KB3038314 having installed correctly in my case, so it suggests that you are up to date (and therefore as safe as&nbsp;can be expected) but&nbsp;a glitch is making Windows&nbsp;Update believe otherwise
 (as was explained in the article I referenced). Hopefully a patch to resolve this issue may appear in the May 12th release.&nbsp;Over to MS! - R</p>
