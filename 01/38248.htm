            The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

<h2>            windows 10 keeps on growing</h2>
                    <p>I did a clean install 7 days ago and all my applications, it was 30gb, this morning it came in at 50, and by the evening it was 52. I have cleaned as much as I can but still it is 50. Very little has been downloaded and what does usually goes to other drives,
 so what is going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my laptop which is only used for browsing had a install in August, again 30gb. No work is done on there, it's just browsing and that is weighing in at 55!. Turned protection off but still 48.5?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On both machines right clicking on all folders only adds up to 30-34gb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas anyone....if this keeps going I shall have a full drive soon.</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the Bit defender with a full scan of all the drives in the machine and nothing found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can run it with clean boot. However, I have been on line for an hour this morning and simply uploaded some files from another to an agency site, and keywordered some pictures. In that time the drive has increased by 1 entire GB in size and is now 54gb.
 18 hours ago it was only 52. I have run a clean up in bitdefender and also checked and cleared&nbsp;temp folders etc but only cleared about 400mb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening on the laptop and this computer.&nbsp; No work is being done on the laptop other then simple browsing,...it's not even used for anything unless I go aboard and then it is used as a massive card to store pictures, so there isn't even many apps
 on there, Word, excel, Photoshop and Lightroom. So with no work being done on it and no uploads or downloads, I cannot understand why that is getting bigger each time it is used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it likely that a clean boot will help seeing as the problem is happening on both unrelated computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere on the web someone had a similer problem and it was offline files sync, but when I go to sync centre, it shows the link for offline files,...it is not greyed out, but clicking and right clicking achieves nothing, no menu no new window.&nbsp; So I assume
 that is not the cause. Either way on both machine I cannot stop it getting larger, and cannot find the files that are being created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you still want me to try a clean boot?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Malcolm</p>

            <p>12 hours later. Now harddrive is 57.5 GB. That is after a disk clean which included 1.5 GB of temp files generated in just 50 minutes of use. In that time have used mail and then viewed pictures on the agency web site, these are thumbnails so I don't see
 those temp files were them really. Either way 1.5 GB of temp files is a lot. They have gone but hard drive is up at 57.5 GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Laptop is increasing in size as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running out of space...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just used TreeSize and it shows windows folder at 20 gb and system volumn information at 21.3GB That's maybe where is it at as everything else is as it should be. Anyone know what this folder does and how do I control it's size?</p>

<p>I had a problem with Windows 10 growing on my Surface 3. The system and reserved usage started in the low-20s GB after I had loaded everything a year ago when I bought it. It then went in big steps, a few months apart, to about 29GB, 36GB, and 42GB, with
 no obvious updates or reasons. The S3 is SSD and I got the biggest at 128GB but this gets eroded quickly with over 20GB of expansion of no apparent gain. I was planning to rebuild the PC and start again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Garmin Basecamp and Garmin Express. Today, after getting annoyed with trying to program my satnav I decided to uninstall both and reinstall. I happened to check storage usage to see what effect it had on the Apps usage, but was surprised to see that
 system and reserved usage had dropped by more than half to 20.3GB. I found a site (http://www.poi-factory.com/node/46165) which explains that updated maps are retained on the PC even after the satnav is updated, and it tells you how to clean up the Garmin
 files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's very poor of Garmin not to provide a prominent indicator of the impact of updated maps on storage, or to ask you if you want to delete maps on the PC after you have updated your satnav.

    <title>The mouse wheel from my Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop suddenly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> craftymaelyss  say:</h3>
<h2>            The mouse wheel from my Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop suddenly stopped working today</h2>
                    <p>Less than 2 years ago, I bought the Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop, which is one of these:<br />
https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/keyboards/sculpt-ergonomic-desktop/l5v-00001</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up to this day, it has worked brilliantly but now I have an issue with the mouse wheel, where if I scroll up or down, it simply doesn't work.</p>
<p>I checked the light/sensor to see if there was any dirty blocking or clogging it up but there was none.<br />
<br />
I tried turning it off and on again, with no effect.</p>
<p>I tried looking up to see if the driver needed an update, which it says it doesn't.<br />
The only way I can get the scroll to work is by pushing the wheel down like a button and sometimes after doing that, the mouse wheel works for a short while before stopping again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also checked the batteries, which isn't an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use this mouse because I have arthritis and struggle with normal mice and keyboards after an extended period of time, and I'm certain this is within warranty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody help me on this?</p>
<p />

            There are three actions which you can undertake. You can try them one by one and check after each.
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />For 1803 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>

<h2>            Star Wars&#58; Empire At War&#47; Forces of Corruption Gold windows 8.1 fix</h2>
                    This is a fix for the Star wars EAW and FOC. I had an issue where I would load the launcher and click play and then the program itself would not load. here is how I fixed it.( disclaimer I tried a lot of things and I am not 100% sure how much is needed
 but will review what I did.) First I copied the binkw32.dll and mss32.dll files into the windows systems directory from the EAW directory ( Programfilesx86/lucasarts/starwarsempireatwar). ( I am not 100% sure if you need to do this put I did to make sure)
 then I downloaded the official 1.05 ram patch from the Lucas art website (<a href="http://www.lucasarts.com/support/update/EAW1_5.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.lucasarts.com/support/update/EAW1_5.html</a>) and installed that.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now here comes the part that actually fixed it(... I think...)... I downloaded 2 unofficial patches&nbsp;</div>
<div>first I did FOC from here :&nbsp;<a href="http://www.moddb.com/games/star-wars-empire-at-war-forces-of-corruption/downloads/windows-vista-and-windows-7-fix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.moddb.com/games/star-wars-empire-at-war-forces-of-corruption/downloads/windows-vista-and-windows-7-fix</a>&nbsp;</div>
<div>(follow instructions given in the description)&nbsp;</div>
<div>And then EAW from here :&nbsp;<a href="http://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_sw_empire_at_war.shtml#Empire at War v1.05 [ENGLISH] Fixed EXE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gamecopyworld.com/games/pc_sw_empire_at_war.shtml#Empire at War v1.05 [ENGLISH] Fixed EXE</a></div>
<div>(look for empire at war v1.05 (English fixed) and follow instructions)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And bam it should work... at least it did for me.....&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;thought I would share my stupid amount of work to make this game work on 8.1.</div>
<div>Happy Gaming</div>
<div>SHK</div>
                </div>

            <p>Ok so my problem is pretty much the same. My star wars FOC works just fine on the original CD version but when I download the 1.1 patch it wont start. Nothing happens when I launche it. Ive downloaded every patch and fix I can get my hands on but it doesnt
 work. Im also playing the Republic at war mod for FOC and it has of course the same problem. &nbsp;</p>

            Strongly recommend you don't use the gamecopyworld link- it links to a site overflowing with malicious popups and malware and just generally seems veeeery sketchy. I'll try and find an alternate fix for vanilla EAW.

<p>
</p><p>Also,I overwrite my game saves in the same file location.everytime.</p>
<p>I saved my game data in a new save slot this time.</p>
<p>Then I loaded up tonight and sent a probe to ilum and then sent fleet and nothing was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>now,after that space battle at coruscant,i have the same problem with unit selectinon let highlighting or letting me tell them where to go.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>This mod has known bugs and I discovers that unit selection and dragging units from planet surface to another planet halfway across the map causes bugs...same thing when in a space map or a ground map..you cannot select units and tell them what to do they
 just sit there.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>and a few other bugs that are known with his mod,so I found out to get a copy of the defreezer utility software developed by microsoft and it fixes game saves,etc...problem solved...</p>

    <title>Recovery Partition Completey Empty -- Should I be worried&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recovery Partition Completey Empty -- Should I be worried&#63;</h2>
                    I had a horrible crash about a month ago. I couldn't get windows to start, let alone get into my computer to reset it to factory default settings. After about a week of banging my head on the wall and trying to trouble shoot (even calling support, being
 told it was probably impossible to fix), I found the 5 recovery discs I had made and after some time I got it back up and running. BUT, my C drive is less than half of what it's supposed to be, even after clearing everything I possibly I can, I was going to
 try to do a factory default refresh again, but don't want to go through the hell I did before, especially being that when I view my drives, it shows the Recovery drive as being empty. Should I be concerned or go for the reset? Thank you so much for your time!<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1b0b3619-2470-4055-8a4a-4d6e2b9df40e" />

            <p>Hello Ashleigh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing us the opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the screen shot which you have provided seems that the recovery drive which you have created on your computer is empty. It means there is no data/information saved on this drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that you are planning to perform Refresh again on your computer. Could you please tell me the reason behind performing refresh.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that you have already &nbsp;recovery disk available with you then you no need to worry about the recovery drive if it is empty. In fact if you want then you can treat it as another 23.3 GB free space of your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you will perform Refresh on your computer then you might need to do the same task again if you want to get back all of your data and application.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><span>Check this article and refer the warning section, you can copy the warning section as the disclaimer when you provide Refresh or Reset in Windows 8 or Windows 8.1</span></p>

            <p>Thank you very much for your response. I'd like to do a Factory Refresh because I'm hoping it can restore the room I had on my C drive, which was 250 GB and as you can see from the screen shot, it's at 79.9 GB. I'm unable to move the files from my external
 drive that I want to because of the smaller drive space. I keep having to delete things. If you have any ideas on how I can fix that, it would be great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a really silly question, but is there any way to get the restore files embedded back into the Recovery drive? I've heard of people trying this a few ways and make a bigger problem than they originally had. But, I like to know I have everything in
 the computer than I need, i.e., the recovery files drive set up as it came when the computer came out of the box, Windows 8 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further help you can provide would be greatly appreciate and thanks again for taking the time to respond.</p>

            <p>Hello Ashleigh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the answer of your question there is no way to get the restore files embedded back into the Recovery drive. However, if you want to give a try you can but it is on your own risk.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing a factory refresh your computer will back to same state as it was for the first time you have purchased it. All of your application/programs will be removed but the application/programs which came preinstalled will be there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are fine with that then only perform factory refresh. Do get back to us with the latest update of your issue.</p>

            What I want to know is why, or where, rather, the disc space on my C drive went after I did a Factory Default Reset. I've done it before, more than once and never had any problem with that at all.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There might be possibility that some spaces from C Drive might have become unallocated space, which can be seen through Windows Disk management Tool and added back to C drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to open Disk Management on your computer and post a screenshot of the page. This will help us in understanding the root cause of the issue and provide appropriate solutions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To open Disk Management:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows Key + R </strong>to open run box.</li><li>In the run box type <strong>diskmgmt.msc </strong>to open <strong>Disk Management window</strong>.</li><li>Now for understanding the issue in a better way please provide us the screen shot of the same window.</li></ol>

    <title>Recent update bricked my PC. System profile not found - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derekknoble  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recent update bricked my PC. System profile not found</h2>
                    <p>I updated my computer at the prompt of Microsoft Windows updates. It went through a long process of updating and finally came to a screen asking where to install Windows from.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected the existing location as I was not installed Windows again. It opened up to the loading screen to my desktop and acted like it was finishing an update. Then brought me to my a desktop devoid of any applications and an error stating that the user
 profile could not be found. I can close the error but nothing is functional. I can see a trash can but cannot empty it. I can see the task bar but clicking search and Windows does not open anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a computer that I use for work and it needs to be fixed asap. I have talked to Support twice and no one is capable of assisting me, it seems.</p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />Once you are able to boot into safe mode, check the integrity of the system
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build

            Few things you can try Derek if you can actually get into Windows...
<br />
<br /> 1. Use whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update. Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />
<br />2. You might also have to create a bootable installation media to fix it here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Turning off fastboot in your BIOS is also known to help. 
<br />
<br />Here is a list of known buttons to press for different motherboard manufacturers <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />3. Try  a startup repair instead of the options in 1. if those options did not work. 
<br />
<br />4. A clean install might also fix this issue but this is last ditch effort. Try everything else first.

<h2>            Some apps missing from All apps on Windows 10 Start Menu</h2>
                    <p>I copied three shortcuts into the folder&nbsp;C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\GracefulExit: Lock.bat, Sleep.bat, and Switch User.bat. &nbsp;Only one of these, "Lock", is listed under Start Menu -&gt; All apps -&gt; GracefulExit folder for two of the
 three user accounts on this machine; the third account shows all three, and they can be pinned. &nbsp;There are fewer than 512 apps in the Start Menu (if that's still a limitation.) &nbsp;I've tried:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have lost a few desktop icons. If I use Windows Explorer to view the desktop they are present in the list. They just do not appear on the desktop. If I try to drag them to the desktop I am blocked because they already exist.</p>
<p>How do I get them back?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Frank C</p>
</blockquote>
First try the most simple method :<br />
Right click on the open space of the desktop &gt; click View &gt;&nbsp; click Show desktop icons.<br />
<br />
If that is not the answer, try the following suggestions .....<br />
<br />
1. Do a system restore.<strong> Pick the date when all your desktop icons were present and working as your restore point.<br />
<br />
</strong><span><span>Start button &gt; search box, type&nbsp;<strong>system restore</strong> &gt;press Enter key &gt; uac prompt &gt; click Choose a different restore point &gt; Next &gt; select the date as your restore point, click it &gt; Next &gt; Finish<br />
Sit back and wait. The machine will re-start when it is done.<br />
<br />
2. Rebuild your icons cache: <br />

    <title>Login Screen Revert Timeout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jelloland  say:</h3>
<h2>            Login Screen Revert Timeout</h2>
                    <p>Is there any way to increase the login password screen timeout before it reverts back? Apparently many young kids that use our lab computers are having issues typing a simple password and what happens is that they start typing in their password, press one
 or two keys, spend 30 seconds trying to find the next key, and then the login screen snaps back to the lock screen before they can finish the whole password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not appear to be a power setting and indeed, the display itself is not going into a power state. It's just the login screen's behavior. If you start to type a password and then stop for 30 seconds, it will throw you back to the logon screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried looking through the 1607 GPO templates but nothing jumped out at me. Any ideas if this is even possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I guess I should mention that this is occurring on Windows 10 Education x64 (1511 and 1607).</p>

still having problems i did the reset of the store but still couldn't buy anything from the store. also read both things that you sent me the link too. i am starting to think this problem might to linked to a problem i have with my xbox rewards account. each
 month they tell that they got a error when trying to deposit my points into my account. they say to check that all my info. is right &nbsp;in my profile and it is. it's been this way ever since the went to the new way of giving you cash now not points for you game
 play. do you think the two problems have anything to do with each other

                    I'm having Windows 7 RC OS installed on my PC. Sometimeback I ran Windows 7 Manager (One Click Cleaner) on my other partition, where Windows 7 Ultimate is installed, to clean all the&nbsp;junk files. However, after removing these junk files my McAfee Virus
 Scan Plus stopped working and simultaneously&nbsp;all my troubleshooting/diagnostic wizards also became disabled/non-responsive (reporting error messages&nbsp;as mentioned above). Somehow after visiting McAfee site, I could later on make&nbsp;my McAfee Anti Virus functional

<p><span>Hi
<span>ALOK CHANDRA SINGH, </span></span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft answers forums!</span></p>
<p><span>Error code 0x80131700 is usually relevant to the old version of .NET Framework installed on your system. By default,&nbsp;the
 built-in version of Microsoft .NET Framework&nbsp;is 3.5.1. You can&nbsp;reinstall Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1.</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the steps mentioned by Dale Qiao ,see the link below<br />
</span><span><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itprogeneral/thread/2e8d4b54-b7d7-47bc-83cf-d9db907b037b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itprogeneral/thread/2e8d4b54-b7d7-47bc-83cf-d9db907b037b</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persist,
</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Boot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To use a Safe Boot option, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple
 operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears. </span></p>
<p><span>b. Select an option when the Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.
</span></p>
<p><span>c. When the Boot menu appears again, and the words "Safe Mode" appear at the bottom, select the installation that you want to
 start, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are able to work without any issue in safe mode then you can infer that some third party software is causing the issue</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span>
</span><span>The system file checker (SFC) utility allows administrators to perform a scan of all protected resources to verify that they are the correct version. If SFC should find
 any incorrect versions in any of these protected resources, SFC will replace them with the correct versions.</span></p>
<p><span>You can always run a SFC scan on the windows vista computer. To run a SFC scan follow the steps below:
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on start and in the start search bar type cmd, right click on the command prompt icon in the programs
 area and then click on run as administrator. </span></p>
<p><span>b. at the command prompt type
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and then press enter. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Run an online scan for any threat and try to fix them (in the normal mode)<br />
</span></strong><strong><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-Us/center/cleanup.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-Us/center/cleanup.htm</span></a>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>See the link below:</span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistasecurity/thread/ba80504b-61f1-4d71-960f-b561798b7b42" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistasecurity/thread/ba80504b-61f1-4d71-960f-b561798b7b42</a>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>You may want to install Windows 7 RTM (released to manufacturing) version as many bugs and compatibility issue has
 been fixed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            When I click to open Skype the circle just keeps going around.</h2>
                    <p>I have Skype for Desktop 8.15.0.4 installed and when I try to launch it the circle just keeps going around.&nbsp; &nbsp;It never gets past the screen below.&nbsp; I have uninstalled and reinstalled and I have tried to rename the Skype folder in AppData.&nbsp; Any help would
 be appreciated.&nbsp; This was working fine on Monday and no changes have been made since expect a reboot after patch Tuesday.</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are aware of the issue wherein users are unable to sign in to Skype due to connection issues or incorrect credentials. We are actively working on fixing it. As a workaround, please try using a different internet connection or a different account for the
 meantime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, please do not hesitate to reply to this post. <br />
Thank you!<br />

    <title>Problems with Skype for Business on Mac - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with Skype for Business on Mac</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Skype for Business + MS Teams on a Macbook Air (2015) Mojave. I'm experiencing two issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Skype slows down my computer and causes it to crash</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) The audio rarely works - nobody can hear me. All the settings are correct. This seems to be a conflict with Teams as if I shut down Teams and restart Skype it does work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My preference would be to stop using Skype altogether but unfortunately I need it to contact some colleagues. Can anyone suggest any convenient resolutions to the above?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even better, if there is a way of calling someone on Skype from another system (e.g. teams) that would be amazing. I have it on my phone, but sometimes I need to share screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Sarah</p>

<p><span>Hello Sarah,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First of all, to make sure you can use the full function and a better user experience, please double check if both your Skype for Business and Teams version are the newest. To update Skype for Business, you
 can open any other Office applications (such as Outlook) and click <strong>Help</strong> &gt;
<strong>Check for Updates</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Meanwhile, to rule out the effect of other applications on your Mac, please try to start Mac in safe mode see if it can help:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Start or restart your Mac, then immediately press and hold the Shift key. The Apple logo appears on your display.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Release the Shift key when you see the login window. If your startup disk is encrypted with FileVault, you might be asked to log in twice: once to unlock the startup disk, and again to log in to the Finder.</span></p>
<p><span>3. To leave safe mode, restart your Mac without pressing any keys during startup.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the problem persists, I need to collect more information from you for further checking:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Please provide us a screenshot of your Skype for Business version and Teams version.</span></p>
<p><span>2. May I know what version information of your Mac?</span></p>
<p><span>3. To identify if it related to your account, if it is convenience, please configure your account to another normally working device to check the results.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Besides, for your concern, since you can use Teams and Skype for Business at the same time, it seems your coexistence mode between Skype for business and Teams is
<strong>Islands</strong>. In this mode, SFB and Teams are two different separate applications, generally, the messages from Teams client is only
</span><span>send to Teams,</span> <span>
vice versa.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For more information about coexistence mode, you can refer to:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/setting-your-coexistence-and-upgrade-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Setting your coexistence and upgrade settings</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Sylvie</span></p>
