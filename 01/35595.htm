<h2>            XP Mode installed but won&#39;t start</h2>
                    
<p>I've tried several times to download and use XP Mode on a new Dell XPS 8100 with Windows 7 Professional. Validation was successful, and if I try again I get "Windows XP Mode_en_us.exe already exists" and in the next step "Update for Windows (KB958559) is
 already installed on this computer." When I click on OK, it goes back to telling me to use the Start button for XP Mode. That gives me a popup window "The setup file must be downloaded and installed for this feature to work."</p>
<p>So I'm stuck in a circular loop with no obvious way out.&nbsp; I don't see an appropriate answer in the questions and answers already given.</p>
<p>Can someone please help? Thank you!</p>

<h2>            32 Bit games not running</h2>
                    <div style="text-align: center">So fairly recently I thought of downloading a old game I used to play all the time on my moms windows XP computer The game is called magic inlay and it played perfectly on XP I downloaded it off the same exact site and everything
 so I'm sure it's not the game. The game is 32-bit I've tried running it in compatibility mode on windows XP service pack 2 &amp; 3 also as admin but it just takes me to a loading screen that flashes white I've tried waiting for a really long time for it since
 it plays the menu music but it seems to never work. Does someone have any suggestions or a app that can run it? Any advice is helpful!&nbsp;</div>

            Hi  Regentpuppies49 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Its possible the game is just too old to run on Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Your best option is setup a dual boot configuration with an older version of Windows, such as Windows 7 32 bit and install it there. This is if your hardware can still run Windows 7. Most modern computers especially those with Skylake and Kabylake processors or AMD Ryzen don't support Windows 7. 
<br />
<br />Another option is to use a 32 bit version of an earlier version of Windows 10, such as version 1507.
<br />
<br />You can download it from the following link:
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1507 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1507 - build 10240
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />If yours does, then here is how you do it:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-dual-boot-windows-7-or-windows-8-with/9ac7acc1-2152-4907-a9de-bd507273a57d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

<p>The problem would have nothing to do with the game being 32bit. The vase majority of games are 32bit. Even new ones.</p>
<p>The only games that require 32bit Windows are the very old games that use a 16bit installer, as 16bit installers are not compatible</p>
<p>with 64bit Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- This looks like it is probably a Flash based\Browser game. Is your Adobe Flash Player up to date ?</p>

<p>I just had another look, and GameHouse reckon the game is not compatible with Win 8\10.</p>
<p>A couple of other sites reckon Win8\10 are compatible so I also downloaded a trial copy from one of them,
</p>
<p>installed it and get the same 'loading' message, flashing and white screen as you are experiencing.</p>
<p>- Personally, I wouldn't go through the trouble of running a virtual XP machine, and it's not guaranteed to run the game anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already uninstalled the game, but...</p>
<p>- You could try&nbsp; Compatibility with <em>Win95\98</em> as this is said to force the game to run on a single core, which can help old games</p>
<p>now and then, but this game was released in '04 and I've never had to do this with a game from '04.</p>

The problem was that I am not set as 18 in this account so serveral features like designs were closed for me. I tried everything to set my age to 18 or older but even with a family created with a over 18 account I could not change the important settings... So I was forced to make myself a gaming ID for my x-box app with an age of over 18 and I play with this one now.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>My question so is now whether I can play for example the new hot wheels Add On with the gaming ID even when I bought it on my store ID...</p><p><br /></p><p>Hope you can help me :)</p><p><br /></p><p>Regards</p><p>Max</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Hello @CaySean1106</p><p><br /></p><p>Regarding the account problem I need to say that I also tried that once and it did not work for me... I tried again and for some reason it now works :) I have access to all designs and the auctions! Thanks a lot! But because I did not play on this ID for so long I don't have all the unique Forzathon cars like the Sesto Elemento... Do you know&nbsp;any way to get the cars on my other gamertag or game? Or is it even possible?</p><p><br /></p><p>However I tried the step you told me regarding the offline-problem but my system and my apps are both the newest version available...</p><p><br /></p><p>Best regards</p><p>Max</p>

<p>Hiya!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from the Xbox Forums Team here to assist with the issue, it looks like you purchased stranded deep and you're unable to access the games content due to the development getting delayed. What I recommend doing is
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/digital-goods-subscriptions-refund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Requesting a refund </a>for the game or possibly contacting <a href="http://support.xbox.com/Contact-Us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
customer support </a>for further assistance. I hope this information was helpful in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Gaming!</p>

</p><p>I found the information located on <a href="https://twitter.com/BeamTeamGames" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Twitter</a> today if you have any questions regarding the development of the game or progress I suggest reaching out to the game developers. In that twitter link it shows the announcement of the game being pulled of the marketplace as well as for any future
 updates they will keep the public updated on release dates.</p>

<h2>            Text and graphics size in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've been dealing with this for days and don't have much patience left.&nbsp; The size of everything in Windows 10 is so small I can barely see anything!&nbsp; I've tried EVERYTHING.&nbsp; Even stood on my head, turned around once and tried everything again.&nbsp; Have chatted
 with Microsoft twice and still I get this incredible shrinking text and an incredible headache!!&nbsp; Actually, sick to my stomach from having to try to view things on here!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It feels like this thing just has a mind of its own.&nbsp; OR, it's haunted!&nbsp; It is in any event driving me crazy!&nbsp; Yep, short trip!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or advice would be very much appreciated!</p>

    <title>windows xp IPRIP was unable to create a socket - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gerryhacker  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows xp IPRIP was unable to create a socket</h2>
                    OS-windows xp pro sp3 &amp; Norton Internet Security (using it for 1 yr.).&nbsp; Shut the computer down at night, everything was fine.&nbsp; Booted this morning and could not access internet, it doesn't renew its IP, I seem to have lost administration privileges, will
 not restore to earlier date, will not allow connection to a remote computer and I want my Mommy.&nbsp; I have run Malwarebytes pro, with the most current updates.&nbsp; I have chased info all over the net on my lap top, and tried a few of the seemingly more intelligent
 fixes.&nbsp; The only change was dowloading and installing Malwarebytes Pro yesterday.<br />
Any constructive advise would be very much appreciated.<br />

            Hi BenStoltzfus, 
<br />
<br />Have you created an additional administrator account on the computer? 
<br />
<br />You will need to sign into this new administrator account, and then you should be able to see your Microsoft account in the list of users within settings &gt; accounts 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,

<h2>            How old is my surface pro 4&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to determine how old my surface pro 4 is.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already looked at both the 'original install date' and the BIOS date in the system information.&nbsp; Both are incorrect.&nbsp; The Original Install date list May 2018 and the BIOS list August 2018.&nbsp; However, I've owned my surface pro 4 for at least 3 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other recommendations?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a 2nd question, I did not intentionally reinstall windows 10 pro in May 2018.&nbsp; Was there a major update or something at that time?</p>

<p>So is there any way to tell how old a Surface Pro 4 is? The answer by the moderator is not sufficient. And how can 4 people say a private message to the questioner solved the issue? That seems bogus to me.</p>
<p>I can't believe what a rigamaroll we have to go through to get pretty basic info.</p>

<p>It just goes to prove that the Surface Pro 4 is such a POS that they will not even give an answer in Public.&nbsp; This is what happens when a mediocre software company, tries to make hardware, and run said mediocre software, on what is now a less than mediocre
 Machine.</p>

<h2>            Windows activation message keeps popping up in multitude&#33;</h2>
                    Hello all, I got my windows 10 from using the windows 10 tech preview since launch. Currently I keep getting messages that say my license will expire soon, and the only option it gives me is to put in a product key. Is there a way to fix this issue? or
 would I have to go buy it and re-enter a product key? Thanks in advance!

Right click Start, click Command Prompt(Admin)<br />
enter slmgr /xpr&nbsp; Then hit the Enter key<br />
It will tell you when it expires.

            The Windows 10 Technical Preview in itself was not a qualifying product for the final release. Your eligibility for the free upgrade had to originate from an installed, activated Windows 7 or Windows 8 license.
<br />
<br />If you don't have any such licenses, then you will indeed need to purchase a new full license.

                    <p>Once I press home and go to the mixer broadcasting I press," Broadcast your game", it says something went wrong broadcasting&nbsp;your game later then shortly after if I don't press anything it will bring me to the information to start the broadcast. Once I press," Start&nbsp;broadcast", I then says," something went wrong. Try again later.", and there is no error code so I can't go to search up a way to fix it. At first I tried waiting but this has been happening since the first day I've tried broadcasting. How can I fix this?</p><p><br /></p>

<h3> afpierce489  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop hangs up at Classpnp.sys file.</h2>
                    So I installed Windows 7 the other night on my laptop.&nbsp; I did the driver updates and installed Norton.&nbsp; I also installed Office 2007.&nbsp; Then I shut it down for the night.&nbsp; The next day I turned it back on to install a few more things.&nbsp; A friend recommended
 that I install Ad-Aware, so I did, and ran it.&nbsp; I've used it on a few of my machines before with no problems.&nbsp; I installed a couple more programs (SANDRA &amp; CPU-ID) then I shut it down for the night.&nbsp; It stalled on shutdown.&nbsp; I didn't think anything about it
 and after about 20 minutes I did the power-off.&nbsp; I started it up the next day and it now hangs at the starting windows screen.&nbsp; I've tried the following with all the same results:<br />
<br />
- System repair - hangs at the repair screen<br />
- Start normally - hangs at the starting windows screen<br />
- Start in safe mode - hangs at the classpnp.sys file<br />
- Start in safe mode with command prompt - hangs at the classpnp.sys file<br />
- start in safe mode with networking - hangs at the classpnp.sys file<br />
<br />
I've even tried to put in the windows 7 disc back in to do a re-install and it hangs at the starting windows screen.<br />
<br />
It seems like no matter what I try I get the hang up at the windows starting screen.<br />
<br />
Someone help, please!!!

            So the other night I tried a few more things with all the same results.&nbsp; Here's what I tried:<br />
<br />
- I bought a second gig of ram, so I tried swopping out one stick, then the other - same results.<br />
- I bought a hard drive enclosure, removed the hard drive, formatted it with another computer, made sure I could save things to it, re-installed hard drive, booted from CD - same results.<br />
- I bought a brand new hard drive, installed it, booted from CD - same results.<br />
- Put old hard drive back in with both sticks of ram - same results.<br />
<br />
After reviewing a few things, I found that when Windows gets to the "Starting Windows" screen, it's checking your hardware to make sure that things are OK.&nbsp; Well, my hard drive, RAM, CD Drive, and Video Card are OK (I get all the right video stuff), so there's
 only a couple of things left, and one is the motherboard.&nbsp; So, I believe that there is a hardware issue that is not allowing Win7 to completely load.

<h2>            AirServer randomly stopped working. Not discoverable anymore</h2>
                    <p>I'm onto my second router from Shaw here in Canada and for a week AirServer (paid version) was working flawlessly. Then my xbox&nbsp;completely crashed in the middle of a FIFA game while playing music from Spotify via my phone through AirServer. I haven't touched any settings in the router nor have I changed anything on the xbox&nbsp;but my devices can no longer discover the XboxSystem-OS on AirServer after I restarted my xbox.</p><p>Xbox One is connected via ethernet and my portable devices are on wifi. This is the second time this has happened&nbsp; and I'm starting to lose patience with the stability of this app...or perhaps I'm just dumb and I need to change or do something on the router (&nbsp;Cisco DPC3848V DOCSIS 3.0 Gateway ) Any help would be most appreciated. The app is brilliant and I love being able to play Spotify on my&nbsp;xbox&nbsp;now, and after spending the $18 for the app, and having these consistent issues, I'm starting to lose faith :(<br /><br /></p><p>Please help!

<h2>            Windows Media Player - Why can&#39;t I see the titles of tracks on  the CD I&#39;ve burned&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have spent an inordinate amount of time using a USB turntable and Audacity to finally digitise an old&nbsp;well loved&nbsp;vinyl LP containing 12 tracks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have named all of the tracks and entered all of the information/metadata regarding the artist, dates genre, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even managed to get it into Windows Media Player with a lot of patience and effort.&nbsp; For some reason WMP prefers WMA files.&nbsp; I don't know if that was the problem but before when I was ripping the burned CD&nbsp;which had CD audio files they would appear
 in the Library under either Artist or Album Title.&nbsp; It wasn't until I changed the rip format to WMA I got any progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Comments on that are welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main problem is that now I am able to burn CDs from WMP but the track data doesn't seem to go with the burn.&nbsp; Why is that?&nbsp; Is there any way around this?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi - please can you clarify... do you mean that no data is seen when you put the disc back into the computer, or when you play it on another machine? If it is the latter then you will probably need a different program - AFAIK this is not something WMP can
 do.</p>
<p>Also. is the vinyl LP something that is not readily available on databases? Thanks, R.</p>

            <p>I first exported the information from Audacity to&nbsp;individual&nbsp;WAV files for each track.&nbsp; Then I burned them to CD as music files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then ripped the CD back to WMP as WMA files so that they would appear in my library.&nbsp; For some reason when moving them into My Music folder as the exported WAV files from Audacity, they didn't show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I exported the WAV files from Audacity, I dutifully filled in all of the metadata as best I knew it.&nbsp; When I ripped the burned CD to WMP, because the album was unrecognised, I again filled out all of the track information and artists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I burned another CD not even the tracks were named.&nbsp; It was just track01,02,03 and so on up to 12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does AFAIK mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The vinyl album is not on any database I can find.&nbsp; I was lucky actually to be able to buy this off eBay.&nbsp; It is quite rare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have many vinyl albums, I have replaced most of them with CDs, but there are still several that were never released to that format.&nbsp; I have looked around for digital downloads but came up with nothing there either.</p>

            <p>AFAIK = As far as I know (frequently used in the forum!)</p>
<p>Thanks for the extra detail...</p>
<p>Metadata on wav. files is tricky. Even using the 'Audacity' tagging only a certain amount of it will stick. My best guess is that in the early days of computing when memory was limited wav. files were only intended to be used for very short files (like beeps
 and 'dings' etc.) so they weren't designed to take metadata. </p>
<p><em>" When I ripped the burned CD to WMP, because the album was unrecognised, I again filled out all of the track information and artists."</em></p>
<p>It's better when ripping an 'unknown' CD to enter as much info as possible <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
before</span> ripping it. Then at least that particular disc should be recognized in future. (The album art has to be added after ripping).
</p>
<p>Do you have access to iTunes for Windows? Their database is a lot more likely to find less mainstream details.</p>
<p>I have digitized lots of&nbsp;vinyl/cassette material&nbsp;using Audacity (for the last few years) and before that 'Music Cleaning Studio' and I have tended to leave metadata until I have converted from wav to another format (usually mp3) - another useful aspect of
 iTunes is that it has an in-built converter (for mp3 but not wma) which circumvents having to burn it to disc and re-rip.</p>
<p>Another free option you may find useful is Google Music - have you tried that? Cheers, Ric.</p>

            <p>The vinyl album is a rare one.&nbsp; The artist(s) are Tommy Burton and The Sporting House Club.&nbsp; The album is called "Ragtime".&nbsp; As you would surmise by the title that is exactly what it is - Ragtime Jazz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it may be the only album that he ever cut.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tommy Burton had a great following in the 70's and early 80's.&nbsp; He did a little bit of TV featuring on a daily lunchtime magazine show in the Midlands called "Pebble Mill At One", but his main following was in Wolverhampton and the surrounding area.&nbsp; He
 held court at the pub which he owned for a while which was called "The Lord Raglan".&nbsp; This pub was just off the Wolverhampton ring road.&nbsp; Even to this day I will never understand why they built that ring road around the inside of the town!&nbsp; The town has since
 gained city status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As lads we followed him everywhere.&nbsp; We were still in our early 20's when other kids of the same age were into Northern Soul, Tamla Mowtown, Philadelphia, Punk&nbsp;and Rock.&nbsp; The thing is&nbsp;Tommy doubled up as a great blue comedian too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The album was produced by some recording studio in London I believe called Windmill.&nbsp; I've searched everywhere for a reference but never found one.&nbsp; I challenge you to do it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you come up with anything, let me know.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I remember 'Pebble Mill' - and had family connections to Dudley back in the '80s so I gained some familiarity with the Wolverhampton Ring Rd as a result!&nbsp;Glad that you were able to find what is obviously a rarity... Windmill Studios may have been a short-lived
 enterprise or subsequently renamed, but I'll continue to delve. I did find this link for Tommy Burton but you probably already know this...</p>

<p>I mentioned 'Google Music' - the reason being once you have set up an account, you can upload music like this to it for free - complete with titles and artwork. It can then be re-downloaded (with all its&nbsp; attached info) in mp3 format at least twice (unlimited
 times with the Google app) so it's free back-up and an additional way of making the data stick</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://play.google.com/store</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; - you'll find relevant info at the link. - R.</p>

            <p>That first link is great!&nbsp; I'll pass that on to my mate - he'll love it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes the The Lord Raglan.&nbsp; Me and my mate Tommy Lennon have spent some drunken Sunday afternoons in there I can tell you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tommy Burton always used to introduce himself as&nbsp;Thos William Burton Esq and my **** Quartet!</p>
<p>
</p><p>He'd have&nbsp;at least four pints of bitter in handled glasses lined up on the piano he played and when he got down to one he'd come out with a comment to the effect "Dry old do this is!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's probably what did him in the end, that and the smoking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always remember him coming out with one comment, "It must have been a good night, we left the Tenor Sax behind!".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The glory days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>His mate Reg Kierle, another character, is still alive I believe and in his 80's.&nbsp; That's my next project, "Live At The Robin Hood".&nbsp; Its a about an hour or so of bawdy jokes and stories - absolutely brilliant!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had a quick look at the second link and put a search in for "Tommy Burton".&nbsp; It seemed to insist on stuff by Richard Burton and Dylan Thomas for some reason, but I'll keep it in mind.&nbsp; I am subscribed to Google Play as it happens although my payment details
 are out of date at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The free downloads you mentioned, I can't see any of those.&nbsp; There seems to at least some charge for stuff even if its around £0.99.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Good stuff...</p>
<p>No - re Google, you don't pay anything... you open a free google music account and upload your own music to it...</p>
<p>It's in effect online storage (up to 50,000 songs!) You can then re-download it free too. Where possible it will match uploaded tracks to its own database but when it cannot it actually uploads your tracks. I've got all my original/rare stuff backed up there
 -&nbsp;and it's a really good player too.</p>

            <p>Yes, the gadget thingy that's like the controls on a CD player or tape deck is above the article about Tommy Burton.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually got a message asking me if I wanted to allow it and that is what highlighted it to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He starts off with one of his old numbers and then makes a joke about Castlemaine XXXX!</p>

    <title>How can I repair my Windows 7 Ultimate Language Packages - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I repair my Windows 7 Ultimate Language Packages</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I already have anquestion in another discussion, but noone is able to give me help (lpksetup due to upgrade to Windows 8.x).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I try to receive help to fix my Windows 7 inside the language packages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have German as the default language. </p>
<p>At the very first steps of the young Win7 I tried a little bit with the portuguese Lang (Portugal), but I desmissed the tests.</p>
<p>Now, years later I´m not able to upgrade my Windows to 8, because the setup tells me to install the language pack without let me know what the setup really wants.</p>
<p>I deinstalled everything, except german. But in my Language selection I have still in the screenlanguages the drop down option for Portuguese.</p>
<p>In Windows Update the Portuguese(Portugal) is not shown any more. So I suppose I have a broken package/Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I have to fix my langpackages first.</p>
<p>So who can help me to do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance because I´m so frustrated testing for lots of month. I have bought my Windows 8 over a year ago and can´t still use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Fernando</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>Results verified by WinDBG, DumpCHK, and BlueScreenView.<br />
</strong><br />
The last 10 Bug_Checks were 0A (2), 50, 7F, BE, D1, 7E (2), 8E (2).<br />
<br />
One 0A was CAUSE ntkrnlpa.exe which is a Windows component which means something else drove<br />
it into Fault. The other 0A was CAUSE HARDWARE.<br />
<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
One D1 and 50 were CAUSE fsdfw.sys which is the F-Secure Internet Shield and should be updated or<br />
uninstalled. Check with F-Secure Support and their forums (if any) for known issues.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
The 7F was CAUSE HARDWARE though firewalls (the F-Secure above) are also usual causes.<br />
<br />
-------------------------<br />
<br />
The 7E and BE CAUSE was dxgmms1.sys so check this link and be sure to check with Nvidia Support,<br />
their drivers, and their forums for known issues. The Nvidia drivers are very current however that does<br />
not mean then are not involved in these issues.<br />
<br />
dxgmms1.sys crash – Blue Screen Of Death&nbsp; &lt;-- check this <br />
<a href="http://nzgeek.org/blog/dxgmms1-sys-crash-blue-screen-of-death/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://nzgeek.org/blog/dxgmms1-sys-crash-blue-screen-of-death/</a><br />
<br />
--------------------------<br />
<br />
One D1 was CAUSE CnxTgN.sys 5/12/2003 which is a Conexant&nbsp;driver&nbsp;-&nbsp;note its&nbsp;date which is&nbsp;very old<br />
in computer terms - another&nbsp;Conexant driver &nbsp;SetupSys.sys 1/9/2001 is even older. Drivers this old can<br />
be very unstable in Windows 7.</p>
<p>---------------------------<br />
<br />
One 8E was CAUSE MEMORY and the other was undetermined and had a pointer to MEMORY.<br />
<br />
===================================================================<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers (check System Maker or Motherboard Maker for custom<br />
systems), and the major device drivers both on-board and those separate devices (check the major<br />
device makers' sites). Particularly Conexant drivers, Nvidia and the dxgmms1 link above.<br />
<br />
Methods to manually check for drivers is posted in the previous reply.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Check with F-Secure Support and their forums (if any) you may need to uninstall it and run the F-Secure<br />
Removal Tool and/or check their site for special removal instructions.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Thoroughly check the MEMORY using the methods posted in the previous reply.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Use methods suggested in the previous troubleshooter and those below.</p>

-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security products are<br />
just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to corrupt or go out of bounds.<br />
The video driver or something affecting it would be very suspect.<br />
<br />
Be sure the drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset drivers are all updated by manually checking<br />
at the System maker and device makers's sites.<br />
<br />
Below&nbsp;I will post a generic bluescreen troubleshooter and in the next message how to update<br />
drivers and BIOS as well as do memory checks.<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 0A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000000A</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>This bug check is issued if paged memory (or invalid memory) is accessed when the IRQL is too high.</p>
<p>The error that generates this bug check usually occurs after the installation of a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS.</p>
<p>If you encounter bug check 0xA while upgrading to a later version of Windows, this error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If a kernel debugger is available, obtain a stack trace.</p>
<p><strong>To resolve an error caused by a faulty device driver, system service, or BIOS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart your computer. </li><li>Press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices.</li><li>Select the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option from the Windows&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</li></ol>
<p><strong>To resolve an error caused by an incompatible device driver, system service, virus scanner, or backup tool</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for error messages that might identify the device or driver that caused the error.</li><li>Try disabling memory caching of the BIOS. </li><li>Run the hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer, especially the memory scanner. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</li><li>Make sure the latest Service Pack is installed. </li><li>If your system has small computer system interface (SCSI) adapters, contact the adapter manufacturer to obtain updated Windows drivers. Try disabling sync negotiation in the SCSI BIOS, checking the cabling and the SCSI IDs of each device, and confirming
 proper termination. </li><li>For integrated device electronics (IDE) devices, define the onboard IDE port as Primary only. Also, check each IDE device for the proper master/subordinate/stand-alone setting. Try removing all IDE devices except for hard disks.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;If the message appears during an installation of Windows, make sure that the computer and all installed peripherals are listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.<br />
<br />
<strong>Comments</strong></p>
<p>Before upgrading to a new version of Windows, remove all third-party device drivers and system services, and disable any virus scanners. Contact the software manufacturers to obtain updates of these third-party tools.<br />

<br />
<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before these started? (Check<br />
Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there about the time this started)<br />
Main likely culprits are Video driver, other major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security<br />
products could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />
<br />
Use the troubleshooter below and refer to the next message for drivers and memory when you get to<br />
those sections and then return back to the troubleshooter as needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong><br />
<br />
The BCCode&nbsp;50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed<br />
hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM).</p>
<p>Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.</p>
<p>Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p><em>Resolving a faulty hardware problem:</em> If hardware has been added to the system recently, remove it to see<br />
if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty component. You should run<br />
hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's<br />
manual for your computer.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a faulty system service problem:</em> Disable the service and confirm that this resolves the error. If so,<br />
contact the manufacturer of the system service about a possible update. If the error occurs during system<br />
startup, restart your computer, and press F8 at the character-mode menu that displays the operating system<br />
choices. At the resulting Windows <strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, choose the<strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong><br />
option. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</p>
<p><em>Resolving an antivirus software problem:</em> Disable the program and confirm that this resolves the error. If it<br />
does, contact the manufacturer of the program about a possible update.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a corrupted NTFS volume problem:</em> Run <strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong> to detect and repair disk errors. You must<br />
restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition. If the hard disk is SCSI, check for<br />
problems between the SCSI controller and the disk.</p>
<p>Finally, check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the<br />
device or driver that is causing the error. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS might also resolve it.<br />

<p>Have you added hardware or updated drivers recently? Check Control Panel - Windows<br />
Updates to see if any drivers have been updated there just before this started happening.</p>
<p>For 7f - this could be a hardware issue such as poorly seated cards or memory, though there are<br />
other causes. Weak powersupply could also lead to this. Use the troubleshooters above and below<br />
and when you get to the&nbsp; drivers and memory sections refer to my next message below and then<br />
return to the troubleshooters if needed</p>
<p>If a PC remove ALL power. Open case, remove and reseat ALL cards, memory chips, and ALL<br />
cables (do not just try to snug) on both ends if they can be reached and on the device ends if not<br />
(removing the cables and reseating them helps to eliminate minor corrosion).</p>

<br />
<strong>BCCode: 7F&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000007F&nbsp; which is the same as 0x1000007F</strong></p>
<p>The UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP bug check has a value of 0x0000007F. This bug check indicates that the Intel CPU generated a trap and the kernel failed to catch this trap.</p>
<p>This trap could be a <em>bound trap </em>(a trap the kernel is not permitted to catch) or a<em>double fault</em>(a fault that occurred while processing an earlier fault, which always results in a system failure).</p>
<p><strong>Parameters</strong></p>
<p>The first parameter that appears on the blue screen specifies the trap number.</p>
<p>The most common trap codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>0x00000000, or Divide by Zero Error, indicates that a DIV instruction is executed and the divisor is zero. Memory corruption, other hardware problems, or software failures can cause this error.</li><li>0x00000004, or Overflow, occurs when the processor executes a call to an interrupt handler when the overflow (OF) flag is set.</li><li>0x00000005, or Bounds Check Fault, indicates that the processor, while executing a BOUND instruction, finds that the operand exceeds the specified limits. A BOUND instruction ensures that a signed array index is within a certain range.</li><li>0x00000006, or Invalid Opcode, indicates that the processor tries to execute an invalid instruction. This error typically occurs when the instruction pointer has become corrupted and is pointing to the wrong location. The most common cause of this error
 is hardware memory corruption. </li><li>0x00000008, or Double Fault, indicates that an exception occurs during a call to the handler for a prior exception. Typically, the two exceptions are handled serially. However, there are several exceptions that cannot be handled serially, and in this situation
 the processor signals a double fault. There are two common causes of a double fault</li></ul>
<strong><br />
CAUSE </strong>
<p>Bug check 0x7F typically occurs after you install a faulty or mismatched hardware (especially memory) or if installed hardware fails.</p>
<p>A double fault can occur when the kernel stack overflows. This overflow occurs if multiple drivers are attached to the same stack. For example, if two file system filter drivers are attached to the same stack and then the file system recurses back in, the
 stack overflows.<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p><em>Troubleshooting: </em>If you recently added hardware to the computer, remove it to see if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty component. Run hardware diagnostics that the system manufacturer supplies to determine
 which hardware component failed.</p>
<p>The memory scanner is especially important. Faulty or mismatched memory can cause this bug check. For more informaiton about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer. Check that all adapter cards in the computer are properly seated. Use
 an ink eraser or an electrical contact treatment, available at electronics supply stores, to ensure adapter card contacts are clean.</p>
<p>If the error appears on a newly installed system, check the availability of updates for the BIOS, the SCSI controller, or network cards. These kind of updates are typically available on the Web site or BBS of the hardware manufacturer.</p>
<p>Confirm that all hard disk drives, hard disk controllers, and SCSI adapters are listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.</p>
<p>If the error occurred after the installation of a new or updated device driver, you should remove or replace the driver. If, under this circumstance, the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS, you might
 be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you have to start the computer by using the Recovery Console in order to access the file.</p>
<p>Also restart your computer, and then press F8 at the character-based menu that displays the operating system choices. At the<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, select the<strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option. This option is most effective
 when you add only one driver or service at a time.</p>
<p>Overclocking (setting the CPU to run at speeds above the rated specification) can cause this error. If you have overclocked the computer that is experiencing the error, return the CPU to the default clock speed setting.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing the error. You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS to try to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>If you encountered this error while upgrading to a new version of the Windows operating system, the error might be caused by a device driver, a system service, a virus scanner, or a backup tool that is incompatible with the new version. If possible, remove
 all third-party device drivers and system services and disable any virus scanners before you upgrade. Contact the software manufacturer to obtain updates of these tools. Also make sure that you have installed the latest Windows Service Pack.</p>
<p>Finally, if all the above steps do not resolve the error, take the system motherboard to a repair facility for diagnostic testing. A crack, a scratched trace, or a defective component on the motherboard can also cause this error.<br />

--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Think Video drivers mainly though it can be others. See the driver section in my generic bluescreen<br />
troubleshooting methods below. BIOS, low level chipset drivers and antivirus/antispyway/security<br />
programs can also cause this. Check the troubleshooter and when you get to the driver and memory testing sections refer to the generic methods in next message and then return to the troubleshooter<br />
if needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high.</p>
<p>This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.</p>
<p>If the first parameter has the same value as the fourth parameter, and the third parameter indicates an execute operation, this bug check was likely caused by a driver that was trying to execute code when the code itself was paged out. Possible causes for
 the page fault include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The function was marked as pageable and was running at an elevated IRQL (which includes obtaining a lock).</li><li>The function call was made to a function in another driver, and that driver was unloaded.</li><li>The function was called by using a function pointer that was an invalid pointer.</li></ul>

BCCode: 7E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000007E&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>This error is usually a driver&nbsp;issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though it<br />
could be others.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software issues<br />
can also cause the error. When you get to the driver section of the troubleshooter use my generic<br />
methods in the next message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed. <br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel - Windows<br />
Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-<br />
spyware/security programs.<br />
<br />
When you get to the driver and memory sections of the troubleshooter refer to the pevious&nbsp;message<br />
to update drivers and test memory and then refer back to the troubleshooter if needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 7E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0x0000007E&nbsp; which is also 0x1000007E</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To<br />
interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT indicates an unaligned data reference was encountered.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT indicates a breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the <em>Ntstatus.h </em>file that is located in the<em>inc</em> directory of<br />
the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
<p><strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enough disk space. </li><li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the</li><li>manufacturer for driver updates. </li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p><em>If you plan to debug this problem</em>, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2<br />
(the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system<br />
was started with the <strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly,<br />
make sure that a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the <strong>
/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame supplies additional information.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware that is installed is listed in the</li><li>Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List. </li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be</li><li>responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts,</li><li>and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error. </li></ul>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable<br />
or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup<br />
sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe<br />
Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process<br />
in Safe Mode, you must start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote<br />
control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the computer<br />
by using the Recovery Console and then deleting the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the<br />
device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.</p>
<p>You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS might to try to resolve the error. You should also<br />
run hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies.<br />
For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or<br />
after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system<br />
BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows installation that are associated with lack of disk<br />
space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary<br />
files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and<em>.chk</em>files that<br />
contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more<br />
free space for the installation. You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version.<br />

<p>===========================================================<br />
<br />
Two primary causes of these blue screen are&nbsp;video drivers and BIOS - Check with System Maker's<br />
Site for Display Adapter (Video) and BIOS and then Device Maker's site for latest Video. It can be<br />
other drivers so check while there. Turn OFF auto-driver installation as those are older and if<br />
Windows Updates suggests a driver just HIDE it. Antivirus is another possibility.<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 8E&nbsp; 0x0000008E is same as 0x1000008E<br />
<br />
Cause</strong></p>
<p>The KERNEL_MODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT indicates that an unaligned data reference was encountered.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT indicates that a breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates that a memory access violation occurred.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques:</p>
<p>Make sure you have enough disk space.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates.</li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p>If you plan to debug this problem, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2 (the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware installed is listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.</li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.</li></ul>
<p>If the bug check message lists a driver by name , disable or remove that driver. Also, disable or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file
 system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you have to start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the system by using the Recovery Console and then deleting
 the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x1E. You can disable memory caching of the BIOS to try to resolve the error. You should also run
 hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies. For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows

                    I see one can download the Classic Skype version (7.59.37) from the download page. That version however only runs on OS X 10.10 or higher. Where can I get such version for OS X 10.9 Mavericks?

<p>Hi&nbsp;Marites P,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version you pointed me to is the same I mentioned in the OP - it does not support OS X 10.9. Where can I get&nbsp;<strong>Classic Skype version</strong> that
<strong>does support OS X 10.9</strong>?</p>
<p>

<p>Back to square 1 - once you download Classic version&nbsp;<span>(7.59.37), you discover that it was not compiled to run on 10.9 and requires 10.10+. In fact, all versions after 7.37 do not run on 10.9 and 7.37 does not allow to

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For troubleshooting steps, completely uninstall and reinstall the Skype application. Also, did you get any error message when trying to access the 7.59 Skype version?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
