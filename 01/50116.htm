<h2>            surface book touch screen fails until reboot</h2>
                    <div>Frequently I open my surface book, and touch screen is not working. I reboot, and then it works, but this happens multiple times per week. I am doing automatic windows updates.&nbsp; What in the world is going on? I paid like $2500 for this top of the line
 device from Microsoft, and so frequently the touch screen does not work. All support @ MS does is check for updates and reboot. Is anyone else having this problem or do I have a defective device?&nbsp; Any ideas how to fix my surface book?</div>

<h2>            Activating windows</h2>
                    Hello, my problem is that I have windows 10 pro installed but I never bought that edition of windows in the first place. I have a windows 10 home product key which does not work for the pro version. How do I change from the pro version that I have now
 to the home edition. I do not have a bootable usb drive or disk so is there any other method. Thank you for taking the time to respond to this.

            Hi Dylan, the only way to go from the Pro version of Windows 10 to the Home version is to clean install Windows 10, there is no other route . . .
<br />
<br />Your will need to backup your data and when the installation completes, you will need to re-install your 3rd party applications
<br />
<br />You will need a blank 8GB flash drive . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

            Hi Dylan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is a workaround here reported to be working to downgrade Pro to Home version:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/downgrade-from-windows-10-pro-to-home/345f5464-cb7a-44b3-8856-237cbec072c8">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then follow the  illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Scorpiansaver does not uninstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grizzlybear_dj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scorpiansaver does not uninstall</h2>
                    <p>I would like to warn and make other aware of ad on that once installed on your computer nothing seems to uninstall it and it keeps coming up when you are on your browers even though have pop blocker working.&nbsp; It is called Scorpiansaver.&nbsp; I am not sure how
 I got it on my computer I know I downloaded a program that I thought was save from CNET.&nbsp; Usually anything I have ever downloaded from there has been save but not this time.&nbsp; I somehow got this scorpiansaver software downloaded.&nbsp; Did know I was installing
 it and now I can not get rid of it.&nbsp; I do an uninstall with control panel.&nbsp; It comes back.&nbsp; I try uninstall with CCleaner and it comes back.&nbsp; I try uninstall with Advaced System Care and it comes back.&nbsp; I also went through the program files and user files
 and made sure any thing with scropiansaver was removed if there and yet after I think it is gone the next when I am on the internet going to some of my favorite sites pop ups start happening.&nbsp; I get off internet go to control panel uninstall and listed there
 again is scorpionsaver.&nbsp; Nothing seems to be able to remove this software.&nbsp; I did some bing searches about removing it and any advise I found told me to do what I describe as doing and yet the software keeps coming back.&nbsp; I got some advise about going regedit
 in windows but I found nothing there with scorpiansaver and I am not real familiar with doing anything in regedit.&nbsp; Any way if anyone can help me get rid of this horrible software,&nbsp; maybe its a virus, maleware or whatever it is I would be grateful.&nbsp; Everyone
 out there beware of any thing you come across that says scorpiansaver.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>GrizzlyBear_DJ</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had Norton 360 running on the computer when this happened.&nbsp; So I have good virus maleware protection or so I thought.</p>

            <p>Hi,&nbsp; Thanks for information and help.&nbsp; I believe I have finally gotten rid of the software.&nbsp; The Malware program you recommended found a file that my other stuff did not find.&nbsp; After I removed that and the others it found.&nbsp; I typed in scropiansaver in windows

You are welcome.</p>

<p>Unfortunately no one Security Program finds all the "baddies"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even Malwarebytes does not find everything on every occasion. If that had not worked I would have suggested a couple of other free Programs to use for your problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway Malwarebytes appears to have done the trick and you are running again with no problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            I'm pretty sure it's an add-on that is attached to Adobe's Flash Player. If you go to ADPEAK'S homepage, you will see Adobe's logo in the top right side of "ADPEAK's logo. I myself have had it installed 2x. Adpeak gave me instructions on how to unintall
 it when I contacted them. But it was uploaded again, I'm assuming it happened when Adobe Flash Player updated it's software.
<br />
However I cannot say I'm positive it's Adobe, it may be the flash player is needed to show the pop-up's in any case. ADPEAK will give you instructions to uninstall it. I asked ADPEAK which program it is attached to, although I'm not sure they will give me that
 information. If not, I do intend to report it.<br />

            <p>I had Norton and it didn't delete it. What you have to do is&nbsp; type in &nbsp;regedit in run dialog box,
</p>
<p>Then go to menu and click on find.&nbsp; Type in adpeak this will find adpeak so&nbsp;you delete it. Then type in scopionsaver next and then delete it . This worked for me.</p>

            Digital images are defined by pixel count and aspect ratio...<br />
inches don't really mean much except when you are using <br />
a printing template or cropping.....then the dialog may show <br />
4x6, 5x7, 8x10, etc. but not in Paint.<br />

<br />
I have been working with a Microsoft Windows Update Professional by email for the past 3 weeks trying out numerous suggestions.&nbsp; The latest one finally did the trick (from the email):<br />
<br />
I understand that the Media Feature Pack for Windows 7 N and Windows 7 KN (KB968211) has been downloaded manually but it still cannot be installed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
It also occurs if the Windows backup feature stopped working. This issue is most likely caused by the NVIDIA RAID driver stopping the feature. At this time, let’s try the following steps to troubleshoot this issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Open an Administrator command prompt by clicking on the "Start" Button -&gt; "All Programs" -&gt; "Accessories" -&gt; Right click on "Command Prompt" and selecting "Run as Administrator" and clicking "Allow" for the elevation prompt<br />
2. In the command prompt, type the command below:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
fsutil resource setautoreset true C:\<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Prompt should return that with "The operation completed successfully" <br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. Close/Exit Command Prompt window; <br />
4. Reboot the machine<br />
5. After reboot, Open Windows Update, reinstall it again.<br />
<br />
<br />
This solved my problem,&nbsp;hopefully it solves yours.&nbsp; For completeness' sake, here are the other suggestions I tried to no success.<br />
<br />
Here are the instructions from the first email (this did not work for me):<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue may be caused by one of the following factors:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. The installation is affected by some third-party security software.<br />
2. The downloaded installation file is corrupted.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
In order to narrow down the cause of our issue, let's refer to the following steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
NOTE: Some third party programs can affect the Windows Update service. If you are running any third party applications such as Spyblocker, Internet or web accelerators (programs designed to boost the speed of the Internet connection), security or anti-virus
 programs (Norton, McAfee, etc.), I recommend we temporarily disable or shut them down and then try accessing Windows Update later. Please be sure to enable them again when the update process has been completed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Step 1: Rename the Windows Update Softwaredistribution folder<br />
================================================<br />
This issue may occur if the Windows Update Software distribution folder has been corrupted. We can refer to the following steps to rename this folder. Please note that the folder will be re-created the next time we visit the Windows Update site.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Close all the open windows. <br />
2. Click "Start", click "All programs", and click "Accessories". <br />
3. Right-click "Command Prompt", and click "Run as administrator".<br />
4. In the "Administrator: Command Prompt" window, type in "net stop WuAuServ" (without the quotes) and press Enter.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note: Please look at the cmd window and make sure it says that it was successfully stopped before we try to rename the folder. However, if it fails, please let me know before performing any further steps and include any error messages you may have received
 when it failed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5. Click "Start", in the "Start Search" box, type in "%windir%" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
6. In the opened folder, look for the folder named "SoftwareDistribution".<br />
7. Right-click on the folder, select "Rename" and type "SDold" (without the quotes) to rename this folder.<br />
8. Still in "Administrator: Command Prompt" window, type the command "net start WuAuServ" (without the quotes) in the opened window to restart the Windows Updates service.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note: Please look at the cmd window and make sure it says that it was successfully started. However, if it fails, please let me know before performing any further steps and include any error messages you may have received when it failed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the steps do not work, let's refer to the following steps to manually download and install the update.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Step 2: Download and install the update manually<br />
=====================================<br />
1. Please download the update from<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=31017ed3-166a-4c75-b90c-a6cef9b414c4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=31017ed3-166a-4c75-b90c-a6cef9b414c4</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please note its location. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Please double-click the downloaded file to install the update.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here are the instructions from the second email (this also did not work for me):<br />
<br />
<br />
Step 1: Clean Boot<br />
=========<br />
This method will help us determine if this issue is caused by a loading program or service. Please perform the following steps:
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click the Start Button, type "msconfig" in the search bar and press Enter. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note: Please click the Continue if the "User Account Control" window pops up.<br />
2. Click the "Services" tab, check the "Hide All Microsoft Services" box and click "Disable All" (if it is not gray).
<br />
3. Click the "Startup" tab, click "Disable All" and click "OK". <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Then, restart the computer. When the "System Configuration Utility" window appears, please check the "Don't show this message or launch the System"<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4. Test if we can update the system in Clean Boot.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note 1: Temporarily disabling the Startup Group only prevents the startup programs from loading at startup. This shouldn't affect the system or other programs. We may still manually run these programs later.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note 2: We can check on Normal Startup in the General tab to roll back to Normal Mode after we get this issue resolved.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If it is not helpful, please let us move on to the following steps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Step 2: Run the System Update Readiness Tool<br />
====================================<br />
1. Please download the System Update Readiness Tool from the link below according to the System Type:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
System Update Readiness Tool for Windows 7 Release Candidate (KB947821) [May 2009]
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=eee94693-9aa6-4278-ace6-f2f9b7732bf1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=eee94693-9aa6-4278-ace6-f2f9b7732bf1</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
System Update Readiness Tool for Windows 7 Release Candidate for x64-based Systems (KB947821) [May 2009]
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=3302a865-b32e-42cb-b198-238a9939823a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;FamilyID=3302a865-b32e-42cb-b198-238a9939823a</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Double click downloaded file to run the System Update Readiness Tool.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Step 3: Use the System File Checker (SFC) to scan system files <br />
=====================================================<br />
The System File Checker tool enable an administrator to scan all protected files to verify their versions. To do so, follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click "Start", type "CMD" (without quotation marks) in the "Start Search" box. Right click on the "CMD.exe" file, choose "Run as Administrator".<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Copy and paste "SFC /Scannow" (without quotation marks) in the black window and press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note: There is a SPACE between "SFC" and "/Scannow", this command will take several minutes to complete and may require access to the Windows installation source files. If you are prompted to insert the CD, click "Continue" each time it prompts.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Then, please let us re-run Windows Update to check the result. If the issue still cannot be resolved, please help capture a Screenshot for our further research.<br />
<br />
<br />
TLDR?<br />
<br />
This solved my problem:<br />
<br />
1. Open an Administrator command prompt by clicking on the "Start" Button -&gt; "All Programs" -&gt; "Accessories" -&gt; Right click on "Command Prompt" and selecting "Run as Administrator" and clicking "Allow" for the elevation prompt<br />
2. In the command prompt, type the command below:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
fsutil resource setautoreset true C:\<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Prompt should return that with "The operation completed successfully" <br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. Close/Exit Command Prompt window; <br />
4. Reboot the machine<br />
5. After reboot, Open Windows Update, reinstall it again.<br />

    <title>No options to select users in Remote Access - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> snickersnake  say:</h3>
<h2>            No options to select users in Remote Access</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 7 pc and a Windows 8.1 pc and they are both on my home wifi network.&nbsp; I want to access the 7 pc from the 8.1.&nbsp; When I tried it the opposite way, all I did was click on the 8.1 pc through explorer...a login box popped up and I logged on to
 the Windows 8.1 pc with no trouble.&nbsp; But that's not direction I want to go.&nbsp; I tried putting them both in a workgroup but that didn't do it.&nbsp; What it tells me is that the other computer isn't accessible and I might not have permission.&nbsp; But I've set up permissions
 on the other pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I thought I would try Remote Desktop.&nbsp; I've set everything up according to instructions.&nbsp; However, one thing I do not have that is mentioned in all of the instructions, is a section that allows me to choose users that are allowed to access the 7 pc.&nbsp;&nbsp;In&nbsp;System
 Properties, on the Remote tab,&nbsp;I have the checkmark to allow remote connections but I don't have the bottom section (Remote desktop) with the three radio buttons and the button called Select Users.&nbsp; It looks like it's just missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess my first question is, why am I not able to connect to the 7 pc?&nbsp; Again, all of the settings are set up to share and allow connections.&nbsp; If I could connect to the 7 PC the same way I can connect to the 8.1 pc (using the log in pop up box), that
 would be the best.&nbsp; But Remote Access would be fine, too.&nbsp; There has to be something in the way but I can't find it.&nbsp;

            <p>The Remote Desktop function is only available on Windows Professional edition.&nbsp; You probably have Windows 7 Home Premium edition.&nbsp; Home editions don't have remote desktop abilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could pay $100 dollars to upgrade to the Pro version, but I would just recommend using a free alternative like the TeamViewer program.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>First check if the game is compatible with Windows7,
</span><span>Bad Company 2</span><span> is not listed in Windows7 compatibility list, here is the link to check compatibility:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;Make sure that you have a latest software for attact 3 Joystick, refer this link:<br />

</span>
<p><span><span><br />
Also try following these steps and check:&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Control Panel, open
<strong>Game Controllers</strong>. To do this, use one of the following methods: </span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<strong>Start</strong><span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span>, type
<strong>joy.cpl</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press ENTER.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click your game controller, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the
<strong><span>Test</span></strong> tab, test the game controller to verify functionality.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;Here is the link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/831361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/831361</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would also suggest you to calibrate the joy stick and check if it works, here are the steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Make sure your joystick is correctly plugged into the computer and turned on (if wireless).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Open the Control Panel.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Double click the Game Controllers link.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Find and single click your joystick in the list of controllers. If your joystick is not listed, make sure it is correctly attached and working.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>With your joystick highlighted, click the Properties button under the list of controllers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>From the new pop-up window, click the Calibrate button under the Settings tab.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Follow all the directions of the wizard that appears and click Finish when done.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can also test all the buttons and axes your joystick offers under the Test tab.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Make sure all buttons and sliders work before relying on them in an application.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If it does not work after calibration, you can check running the game in compatibility mode, here are the steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Programs, click Run programs made for previous versions of Windows.
<br />
Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the troubleshooter, browse to the program's setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something similar. The troubleshooter is not designed to work on programs
 that have an .msi file name extension. <br />

<h3> brettpeake  say:</h3>
<h2>            NO AUDIO WHATSOEVER ON LAPTOP AFTER WINDOWS 10 INSTALLED&#33;</h2>
                    <p><span><span>My laptop has no sound after installing windows 10 on my laptop, since&nbsp;i upgraded from windows 8.1. My soundcard uses 'digital audio (hdmi)'. And stated that the audio
 device is 'not plugged in' under the playback option. But there is no option for plugging in!!! Clicking the volume control in the bottom right of the screen brings up the 'detecting problems screen, but finds 'no problems', despite there being a major one!!!
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Updating drivers from the device manager has no effect as&nbsp;it ironically&nbsp;&nbsp;states the i 'have the best drivers possible!'</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This a cruel blow to new windows 10 users, as so many users seem to be suffering the same issue ... There is no way back for me as i cannot downgrade to windows 8! Microsoft
 seriously need to examine this issue!</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<span><span>How do i fix this infuriating problem?</span></span>

</p><p>This is a typical problem when upgrading an Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your first move is to contact the manufacturer of the Sound Device that is installed on the system and ask about updated, Windows 10 compatible&nbsp;drivers.</p>

            The speakers icon (SRS AUDIO ESSENTIALS) is ticked, properties states this device is working properly. Driver update states 'i have the best driver possible'. However, there is no volume slider ... just the volume control with a big red 'X' through it!
 I cannot perform any tests, and there is no record device. The trouble-shooter states that 'the audio device is disabled, despite my speakers being enabled with a green tick in the playback properties.

i cannot find the enhancement option, the volume slider on the 'levels' option is also blank. There appears to be files missing for my soundcard!

<p>
</p><p>My 3 year old HP Envy notebook began having smart adapter problems right after the "device migrated" event.
</p>
<p>I get a nag screen with the msg "your smart adapter isn't powerful enough" </p>
<p>I replaced the adapter, still have the problem. </p>
<p>I can shut down the computer, unplug the adapter, remove the battery &amp; discharge any residual by holding the power button down for 30 seconds, then reassemble &amp; it begins to charge again.</p>
<p>The computer won't power on with only the charger (battery removed)</p>
<p>I tried to set a restore point to before 12/11/2017 though win10 won't allow this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried uninstalling, then reistalling ACPI, problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any suggestions?</p>

            The enforcement team would have access to everything they do on Live so they don't accept any other proof other than just reporting them. That's part of the reasons suspensions/bans are not generally issued immediately. It can take time to investigate
 them.

            Same issue here, Win 10, Defender would get to the end of the Definition update then give the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">no. 0x800704e8 error claiming it could not connect. How ever after closing the error dialog I find that
 Defender still has updated after checking with the Definitions portal. The troubleshooter could not find a problem so this is less of a security worry and more of a annoyance.</span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Edit: Also closing dialog box the progress bar goes down to half way under 'installing' Program still shows updated definitions as stated before. That and this issue has only really started after recent windows update.

    <title>How do I get my display back&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kingeverett  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I get my display back&#63;</h2>
                    I plugged another monitor into the back of my desktop, it had an extra VGA port so I figured I could run dual monitors. Well the second monitor didn't display anything and I switched my display to the second one. Now my desktop won't show anything so I
 can't switch the display back. My desktop is an all-in-one so I can't switch things around. I've restarted and it displayed the Windows Error screen asking if I wanted to boot into safe mode, but once I boot normally it just displays nothing. How can I get
 it to switch back?

            Thanks, but after some searching I found that if I booted into safe mode and did a restore point from before I changed the display settings that the problem was fixed. Thanks for you help though.

<p>My Opinion? Can't thrust them, after getting hit with a Suspension I started to look into it, Via the code of conduct but before I post that (I'm sure we should know it by now)<br />

</li><li>ix. Don’t engage in activity that violates the privacy of others.<br />
<br />
</li><li>x. Don’t help others break these rules.<br />

<p>Also as a side note &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an account for a business entity </li></ul>
<p>Get rid of the spam bots trying to get users to follow links to get free 48 hours Codes<br />
<br />
But that was Conduct on Xbox live... HM.... lets try content.<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Content&nbsp;<strong>involving illegality</strong>. For example:
<ul>

</li></ul>
</li><li>Content that could&nbsp;<strong>harm or harass a person, including yourself, or an animal</strong>. For example:
<ul>
<li>Profane words or phrases </li><li>Suicide-related content </li><li>Negative speech (including hate speech or threats of harm) directed at people who belong to a group, including groups based on race, ethnicity, nationality, language, gender, age, disability, veteran status, religion, or sexual orientation/expression

</li><li>Content that is&nbsp;<strong>unauthorized</strong>. For example:
<ul>
<li>Images and other content you don’t have permission to use </li><li>Illegitimately obtained videos </li></ul>
</li><li>Content that&nbsp;<strong>promotes, or sounds or looks</strong>&nbsp;like words, phrases, puns, images or imagery that refer to any prohibited content<br />
<br />
well noting there... So.. why did I do wrong in my profile really? </li></ul>
<p><br />
<br />
hm... oh wait look back at the code of Conduct for the over all Microsoft number i.v
<span>Don’t publicly display or use the Services to share *inappropriate* Content or material&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<span>Don’t publicly display or use the Services to share *inappropriate* Content or material&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Inappropriate... Wait but they said I was banned because and I quote&nbsp;&nbsp;" This account was issued a suspension due to offensive content in the profile. Xbox Live is designed to be fun and safe for everyone, and when people choose harmful or offensive content
 for their profile it disrupts the Xbox Live experience for other&nbsp;gamers&nbsp;Even if the content wasn't intended to offend others, we must take into account how other players are likely to perceive it. "<br />
<br />
Sooo... did i get Suspended for someone feeling offended? Well that hard to say for two reasons.<br />
<br />
Reason 1: Offensive and&nbsp;Inappropriate aren't the same by Definition<br />
<br />
Offensive :&nbsp;</p>
<p>: causing someone to feel hurt, angry, or upset : rude or insulting</p>
<p>: very unpleasant</p>
<p><span>sports</span>&nbsp;: of or relating to the way that players try to score against an opponent in a game or contest<br />
<br />
Inappropriate<br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;not right or suited for some purpose or situation : not appropriate or suitable</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;not right or suited for some purpose or situation : not appropriate or suitable</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Reason number two : After beating a user in a online game, No more &nbsp;30mins later I was&nbsp;Suspended<br />
<br />
And again when I asked for the reason why (before filling out a Case review) I was told I can't find out why because it's Privet &nbsp;with the enforcement team<br />
even so I was hit with the&nbsp;Suspended and there for logically apart of the privet event,<br />
<br />
So with that I came to the agreement that I was&nbsp;Suspended because Someone reported my profile after losing to me, on the fake grounds of me being&nbsp;Inappropriate, and because my profile looked&nbsp;Inappropriate, It IS&nbsp;Inappropriate<br />
<br />
Even so my profile was a joke / Satire on employment quotas, something Illegal and what some people are trying to force others to do.<br />
<br />
But seeing how I can play online and how everything is handled, I can no longer Trust how it happened because<br />
My side was never asked for,<br />
I was banned fast with no check in (knocking me off line via Signing into my name at the Enforcement area), &nbsp;after winning a match 30mins before hand,
<br />
it took the enforcement team the whole ban time and a few extra hours to come back and tell me that they are going to up hold the action.<br />
The action was illogical anyway when you look at the COC on both Microsoft as a whole and xbox live.<br />
<br />
I will still report people who brake the rules, but I well not expect much.</p>

<p>Dont get me wrong I have reported people on live for using bad words to say the least and never got a message about actions taken against them but in my 12+ years on live I got 1 responce and that was for links sent thru emails. No cheaters, modders, hackers,
 bad language and even threatened has been banned. Yey I got a ps4 and the 1st time someone broke the TOS from sony they sent 1 saying they received the complaint and 30 min later another message telling me thank you. MS needs to get off their butts and work
 because sony is really making this company look stupid.</p>
