<h2>            Windows 10 errors&#33;  Web pages freezing up.</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Windows 10 and my webpages keep freezing up.&nbsp; I will get&nbsp;a popup that asks if I want to Kill or Wait.&nbsp; If I choose wait, nothing happens, it stays frozen.&nbsp; I have also gotten error code 45 on yahoo and the fix says to contact someone
 at yahoo.&nbsp; Which I cannot find a way to contact them successfully.&nbsp; I don't think it is yahoo having the problem since it happens on other webpages.&nbsp; I am frustrated that I can't get things done.&nbsp; Is there a solution or upgrade to my problem?&nbsp; Thanks,</p>

            <p>unfortunately, the restore doesn't let me do it before today 12/16, I believe the speaker stops working on sunday dec 14</p>
<p>since speaker is a hardware, is it possible the hardware is corrupted? I remember hearing bad noise from the speaker before it stops working</p>

<h2>            New Sculpt keyboard is dropping characters when I type</h2>
                    <p>I picked up a new scuplt keyboard and it's great, except it drops a very large number of keystrokes.&nbsp; In typing the previous sentence, I had to revise almost every word.&nbsp; I did not have this issue for the first few days I was using it either... seems to
 have cropped up.&nbsp; I'm only 3 ft away from my laptop and there is nothing between the keyboard and laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't see any specific drivers for it...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anything I can do ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Personally I think wireless keyboards and mice are more trouble than they're worth, but that's just my personal opinion.&nbsp; I'd venture to guess that you might have a faulty keyboard unless it's been dropped, subjected to high temperatures, or had something
 spilled on it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;I once had a friend complaining about wierd characters appearing on the screen.&nbsp; When I picked the keyboard up, orange juice spilled out of it!&nbsp; YMMV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

<p>Hey joni1013</p>
<p>If your experiencing a problem please make your own thread addressing the issue.</p>
<p>And WesteK One</p>
<p>If your console cannot run the latest OS version and the offline system diagnostic tool does not work you may need repairs on the console if it does not respond to the OSUDT/1/2/3 I'd contact the phone support for further details on the issue at 1 (800)-4MY-XBOX
 or 1 (800) 469-9269</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t install Bing Desktop</h2>
                    <p>My PC updated to the latest Build 10565 of Windows 10. But something went wrong with the Bing Desktop program.</p>
<p>It said to me that there were some files corrupted and the program was unninstalled. It told me to reinstall again. But now, when I try to install from the .exe file, it says that I already have installed Bing Desktop and it has the latest version. But it's
 impossible! There isn't any installation or data file in my computer! Why??</p>

I was pushed to click family as it's a child account then pushed back around when I tried to find&nbsp;access to the case review option? Round and round without ever finding the elusive case refer option.&nbsp;I asked my son what he'd done and he said that an adult had basically verbally abused him as he'd asked him to stop throwing him off a cliff and let him carry on with his fellow team mates.&nbsp;The adult had then reported him to get rid of him as he wasn't as good at the game as the adult.&nbsp;</p><p>I can understand it may be frustrating if you are in a game with players of differing abilities but using the reporting system to flex your muscles is more childish than some of your opponents are in age.

            <p>he doesn't really have a choice than to serve the suspension and he's barred the particular player from his games so he won't have to play in the same game as him again. It's just a shame that there's not an interim stage to an enforcement as it seems you don't have a say before it is imposed. Surely there should be a chance to sort it out before they slap a communication ban on someone? </p>

<h2>            Cloud saves with one month free trial</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have got an offer from MS to get a free one month trial with recurring charge.</p>
<p>If I sign up to this will I be able to use the free cloud based storage to upload my 360 game saves?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read that you can't do this with a 14 day free trial but this is a recurring monthly sign up so I assume it would work (because it would have to work after the free month ran out?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or could you only use the cloud based storage after one month?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to use it now but won't sign up for this if I can't use the cloud storage facility straight away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help</p>

<p>The 14 day trial cards you get in some console or game boxes are a "Gold light" membership so to speak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That 14 day trial will only grant you the ability to play online multiplayer or participate in parties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You do NOT get any other benefits like "Deals with Gold" (reduced prices for game deals), "Games with Gold" (free games each month with your Gold membership) or Cloudstorage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the full month trial WILL give you access to these features.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do have the trial already, simply try to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/live/games-with-gold" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
go to the Games with Gold page</a>, and try to get a game. If you see the game price reduced to 0,00 with your Gold Trial membership, the Cloud save will work.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Manual Upgrade &#38; Installation</h2>
                    <div>
<p>There have&nbsp;been a number of problems reported&nbsp;in regards to upgrading to&nbsp;Windows 10 via automatic methods such as the&nbsp;Media Creation Tool.&nbsp;For those who would like to save themselves the trouble, you can quickly upgrade to Windows 10 by following the instructions
 outlined here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do this, just follow the instructions exactly as they're outlined.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download the Windows 10 ISO file&nbsp;that matches your&nbsp;version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The official links to these ISO files (directly from Microsoft)&nbsp;are provided below for all versions of Windows 10—except for the single language version.&nbsp;These ISO files are valid for both Home &amp; Pro versions of Windows. You will only need to be specific
 when selecting the proper 32bit or 64bit version that&nbsp;is currently&nbsp;running on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Create an installation media using the Windows 10 ISO file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like to create an installation disc with the Windows 10 ISO (downloaded from the Microsoft website)—simply right clicking the ISO file with your blank DVD in the drive—then&nbsp;select the "Burn" option in the menu there. This should open up the
 Windows ISO&nbsp;Creator—built into Windows as far back as Windows 7. Use this tool to properly create an installation disc for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like to create a USB installation drive, then you will want to download the official Windows USB/DVD Download tool. This tool was originally provided by Microsoft back when&nbsp;purchasing Windows online&nbsp;and downloading the ISO files&nbsp;was first&nbsp;introduced—and&nbsp;that
 is where the name comes from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This tool will not actually be downloading anything for you—it's simply for&nbsp;use of creating an installation media using the ISO files you've already downloaded for yourself. This tool is available for download&nbsp;in the link below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/windows-usb-dvd-download-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows USB/DVD Download Tool</a></p>
</div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> There have been a number of people reporting problems when attempting to upgrade their systems to Windows 10 by running "setup.exe" from their USB installation drive. It's been said that this cannot be done for conventional systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is USB method is only for&nbsp;those who either have one of those tablet devices—or&nbsp;for people&nbsp;who have a full retail version of their product key, which will enable them to boot from the Windows 10 installation drive and clean install Windows 10 without
 any activation troubles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this reason, unless you have&nbsp;one of these&nbsp;tablet devices&nbsp;(which should be programmed to treat the USB drive&nbsp;with the priority of a&nbsp;disc drive)—or unless you have&nbsp;your full retail product key in-hand—do not attempt to upgrade your system to Windows 10
 using the USB installation media. Use the DVD method following the instructions outlined here.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Begin the installation process using your Windows 10 installation media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the installation media in File Explorer, there in the opening contents you should see "setup.exe". Run that program to begin the process of upgrading your system to Windows 10 while retaining your activated status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You do not want to attempt to&nbsp;boot from&nbsp;your installation media&nbsp;in order to upgrade to&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;10, because&nbsp;this will begin the process of a clean install and you will lose your activated status of Windows&nbsp;unless you have the full activation key in-hand—and
 that activation key is from a full-retail version of Windows. Upgrade using the method above to prevent any complications like this from arising.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Windows 10 ISO</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/techbench" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/techbench</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Above is the link to the official page of the Windows ISO files. If you would like to download a specific language of the Windows 10 ISO not provided in this guide, then you may do so by visiting the link above. If you would like to obtain a Single Language
 version (which is also not provided here)—then you may also do so the same way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people have been reporting issues&nbsp;with the Windows ISO file links not displaying on the ISO page—and only a download for the Media Creation Tool being displayed there instead.&nbsp;For this reason, I've provided the&nbsp;direct links to official Windows 10 ISO
 files&nbsp;below.&nbsp;These links are for the English versions of Windows 10 ISO&nbsp;(except for&nbsp;KN—which is exclusive to Korea).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since they are not a single language version of Windows, you should be able to change the native language of Windows 10 after it's installed. Windows and the installer will simply be displayed in English until you change it. From there, you will
 have to download a copy of your native language ISO and create an installation media for yourself if you'd like one in your native language. Mobile has proven to be the best way to go about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From here on out you should be able to follow through with the manual upgrade or installation without any problem. If for some reason your copy of the Windows ISO gives you some static, try simply downloading a second copy of the ISO file. I had to do this
 myself—because the first copy of&nbsp;my Windows 10&nbsp;ISO had a problem.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Advanced Troubleshooting</strong></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>If for some reason your installation of Windows 10 locks up on you and will not proceed (or you're facing a black screen problem)—this could have something to do with an inherent corruption in your previous version of Windows.&nbsp;In order to&nbsp;properly fix this
 issue, what I am going to recommend&nbsp;is running a number of advanced options&nbsp;to totally&nbsp;shake&nbsp;your system down and&nbsp;enable you a perfectly clean&nbsp;transition to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step&nbsp;1:</strong> Flash&nbsp;your BIOS</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're using a laptop, then this option is not&nbsp;going to be so easily available to you. If you are very technologically inclined, and have experience with disassembling and reassembling your laptop—you may do so. For everyone else running&nbsp;a laptop, please
 skip this step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To flash your BIOS, just&nbsp;unplug the power cord from your computer—open your case—and remove the battery from the motherboard.&nbsp;Leave this battery&nbsp;removed for a few minutes and make&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;press the power button on your machine while everything is disconnected
 in order&nbsp;to expel any electricity stored&nbsp;in the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a few minutes, put the battery back in, plug the machine back in and start it. At start up, your system may prompt you with a flickering beep—either way—spam the
<strong>[DEL]</strong> during this&nbsp;time&nbsp;to enter the&nbsp;BIOS configuration menu at start up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Navigate the menu and adjust the time and date—and also&nbsp;make sure that the <strong>
[Boot Menu]</strong> option is enabled. You'll need this option enabled&nbsp;in order to boot from your Windows&nbsp;installation&nbsp;media to install/re-install the operating system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once that's all done—save your settings—and exit the BIOS&nbsp;proceeding to boot from the installation disc of your original version of Windows.</p>
</div>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>For those who don't know how to do this, simply make sure the installation disc is in the drive—and press the Boot Menu key at the BIOS flash screen. This key might be specific for your machine, and you'll have to pay close attention to the bottom of the
 screen where it should be displayed. For most machines, the Boot Menu is F11.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong>&nbsp;Clean your hard drive using Command Prompt from boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've booted from your Windows installation media. There in the opening menu, you should see the&nbsp;"Repair your computer..." option somewhere in the opening contents. Select that option and navigate the recovery menu&nbsp;until you find the&nbsp;find the Command
 Prompt option. Select that option, and&nbsp;when the CMD window pops up, enter the following commands in sequence.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>diskpart</p>
<p>
</p><p>list volume</p>
<p>
</p><p>select volume #<span>&nbsp; — [enter the number listed as your hard drive]</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>clean </p>
<p>
</p><p>This will totally wipe your hard drive clean, including your boot records, and&nbsp;clear out any sneaky corruptions that might be&nbsp;haunting&nbsp;your hard drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Re-install your original version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Close the Command Prompt&nbsp;window<span>—</span>reboot your computer<span>—</span>and proceed to boot from your Windows installation disc once again&nbsp;to begin a&nbsp;fresh install your original version of Windows. Once you have it installed—activate it (via phone
 for example)—and then proceed to the next step.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Update your bios and chipset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check your motherboard or computer manufacturer's website for any bios or chipset updates that might&nbsp;be&nbsp;available for your machine. Download those updates in advanced&nbsp;on a clean drive (or via mobile preferably)—and then run those updates after you clean
 install your previous OS, but before you upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instructions on how to upgrade the BIOS should be included in the download. If it's not, this method involves running the
<strong>.bin</strong> file as an&nbsp;Administrator—and once&nbsp;the cmd window&nbsp;finishes crunching numbers, physically reboot your computer and spam the
<strong>[DEL]</strong> key to enter the BIOS again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Navigate the&nbsp;BIOS menu and select "Load default settings". It should prompt you with a message, "Do you want to load optimized default settings?" Select yes—and then&nbsp;proceed to save your settings and exit.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point,&nbsp;you should be able to jump straight into Windows 10 by using the method provided above without having to run any updates. Just make sure to use an installation disc (not a USB) and run "setup.exe" from the File Explorer to upgrade to Windows
 10 while retaining your activated status.</p>

</p><p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Keep in mind that this is the method you will have to use in order to fresh install your OS and upgrade to Windows 10 in the event that something goes wrong later on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're running a system who's product key is embedded in the bios, or who's product key is not from a full-retail version of Windows, you will have to reinstall your previous version—activate it—and only then will you&nbsp;be able to upgrade to Windows 10
 while&nbsp;retaining your activated status (using the method above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will also want to keep your computer physically disconnected from the internet&nbsp;during this recovery/upgrade process—as well as have your IP address forcibly changed by your Internet Service&nbsp;Provider—or&nbsp;change&nbsp;it&nbsp;manually yourself.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>For some, changing the IP address manually&nbsp;can be as simple as unplugging your modem and then plugging it back in. Yet&nbsp;for others, this technique&nbsp;might involve going into&nbsp;your router's settings and changing the MAC Address Clone (you can just enter in anything
 in there so long as it's different)—as well as changing the Subnet Mask and starting IP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some Internet Service Providers assign their IP addresses based on MAC Address and Subnet Mask, so you will need to change them before your ISP issues you a new IP address.</p>
<p>

</div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Advanced Recovery Options</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're successfully upgraded to Windows 10, before you've placed any of your private files onto your system (including programs), you should make a System Image backup for your system—as well as a System Recovery Disc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not certain how Microsoft is going to cut off the free upgrade service they're offing for Windows 10. For this reason, you'll want to create a System Image of your perfectly clean Windows 10, which can act as an advanced form of clean installation if
 something goes wrong later on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just make sure that&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;is activated before you make this System Image—even if that means temporarily connecting your computer to the internet in order to activate it. So long as you've changed your IP address,&nbsp;it should be perfectly safe&nbsp;for you
 to&nbsp;connect to the internet this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you've created a perfectly clean System Image, you can go ahead&nbsp;and load all your files, settings, and programs onto Windows—and then make another System Image that you can make a series of updates to over time to act as your secondary backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Image will&nbsp;only retain files that were on the system when the image was created, so back up and new files that precious to you before performing a System Image recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Image can be found in Windows 10 by following the instructions below. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Right-click the Start Menu → </strong><strong>Control Panel →&nbsp;</strong><strong>Backup and Restore (Windows 7)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you&nbsp;create your System Image on a hard drive, make sure to keep that hard drive disconnected from your system outside of the backup and recovery process—in&nbsp;order&nbsp;to prevent your System Image backup from being corrupted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always perform a System Image recovery by booting from your System Recovery Disc—and you may also want to consider flashing the bios&nbsp;each time—to shake your system down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a final note, if you&nbsp;ever clean the hard&nbsp;drive from Command Prompt, you're going to have to fresh install Windows 10 before you can use your System Image recover, since the clean function erases the boot records. However, once it's re-installed, you should
 be able to run your&nbsp;System Image recovery to restore your computer to its previous activated state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the method I recommend using&nbsp;(including changing your&nbsp;IP&nbsp;address again)&nbsp;if you should ever revert back to your fresh install Windows 10 System Image backup—in order to shake your system down and remove any sneaky corruptions that might be haunting
 the hard drive.</p>

<p>I have Windows 8.1 Home and Windows Update keeps trying to load Windows 10 Pro. It downloads Pro but gets stuck on Preparing to Download, then I get error messages and message to download some update on my old OS, but when I check for 'update', there are
 none ( and no failed installations !). I correct the 'errors' etc, as per advice on MS site, but subsequent downloads fail - at least 25-30 times now. I've tried using ISO file - it loads but when I run it I get message 'Something Happened' !&nbsp; I'm not a computer
 expert, and have never had an easy time with MS OS changes. Does anyone think that it is the wrong version of Windows 10 (Pro), that is causing my problems ?</p>

            <p>Understood. You know the links to those ISO files are provided above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow this path,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Control Panel → System</p>
<p>
</p><p>There it should display what version of Windows you're running. If you have plain Windows 8.1 Pro 64bit. Then you will want to download the Windows&nbsp;10 64bit ISO file. It is valid for both Home &amp; Pro versions of Windows 10 64bit.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you're from Europe or Korea—you don't have to bother with the N or KN version because they are specific to those regions as I've explained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just download the normal Windows 10 ISO file&nbsp;from the links above that matched the 32bit or 64bit version of&nbsp;your current copy of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there, follow the instructions carefully for properly creating an installation disc using this ISO file—and then properly upgrading your system to Windows 10 so that you don't potentially lose your activated status.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Don't bother with the automatic update. Download the ISO file from the ISO link provided above. Select the proper 32bit or 64bit version of Windows you're running (you can check this in Control Panel → System).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have the ISO file, burn it to a DVD using the method explained in the original post—then open the contents in your File Explorer and run "setup.exe" to begin the update process to Windows 10 while retaining your activated status.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As for Windows ISO file download links not being displayed on the download page, I can testify that this is true. This may not be the case in every country or region of the world. But here is what that page looks like for me, and I live in Sweden.</p>

<h2>            Win XP SP3 SHA-256 Fix found, but can&#39;t download it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My company has a problem, the machines that we make work under Win XP SP3, and to work need to interact with our website. Since a couple of days ago, the SSL Certificate has been renewed and now works under SHA-256 (or that's what the company told us), and
 our systems just can't decrypt SHA256.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching for ways to fix this, I found this link:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/968730/windows-server-2003-and-windows-xp-clients-cannot-obtain-certificates</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like there is a fix for the problem, as there is this info on the page, but the Fix can't be downloaded anywhere.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I contacted microsoft via their support chart and I have been told that Windows XP is obsolete and they do not offer support for it anymore. Wich I understand. But the Fix seems to exist, I just can't download it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help?</p>

<h2>            &#34;The application was unable to start correctly &#40;0xc0000005&#41;&#34; error with userinit.exe</h2>
                    <p>Hello, never asked a question here but thought I should as I've been Googling for the past 7 hours looking for a fix because this is a pain in the rear-end and I haven't found anything that has helped yet.</p>
<p>Now to the problem. When I boot up my laptop, it goes smoothly, then when I login to my user account it shows a completely black screen with the cursor and then momentarily this message pops up:</p>
<p>The application was unable to start correctly (0xc0000005). Click OK to continue.</p>
<p>Leaving me no choice, I click OK. Then I use task manager to use the "New Task" option and then type in explorer.exe and it launches fine, like nothing happened. Trying to launch userinit.exe doesn't help and gives me the error.</p>
<p>I recently&nbsp;accidently used a registry editor (it's built-in to IOBit's Advanced System Care program) and carelessly didn't uncheck the "registry cleaner". I've already tried using their registry restore and it made no changes even though it said
 that it had "restored" the registry to what it was beforehand. I've already sent them an email and there hasn't been a reply in 3 days (checked spam, too).</p>
<p>The only way I can think of possibly getting it back to normal is by seeing a pic of somebody else's regedit window to see if it's all correct on my side, but if there is another then I'm open for it. Oh, and I've also tried that thing... err...
 sfc /scannow in safe-mode and no changes either.</p>
<p>This might not even be explorer.exe, but some other corrupt program that is making it do this on login. Any helpful words of wisdom? :/</p>

            Hello,
<div><br />
Were there any changes( hardware or software) made to the computer prior to the issue?
<div><br />
Place the computer in clean boot and check if the issue persists.</div>
<div><br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start&nbsp; Windows Vista&nbsp; by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Follow&nbsp; step 7 to reset the computer to start as usual after the clean boot process.
<div><br />

<h3> marcela scott  say:</h3>
<h2>            I don&#39;t have a microsoft account and can&#39;t log in with my pin</h2>
                    <p>I deleted my microsoft account (with hotmail) because it did not work for me. It was the account linked to log into my computer, but because I set up the PIN, I did not have any problems until now. It seems that some new update reset my pin to work anymore.
 I can't access my computer. What can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before replying please understand:</p>
<p>- I can not log into my computer to change the settings</p>
<p>- My account has been deleted so I can't request for a new password</p>
<p>- I NEED to get pass the log in screen so I can have access to my computer&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been very frustrating that Microsoft support is not helping, and that I can't find any answers for my specific problem.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Uninstall IntelliPoint 5.2 under 64 bit Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jp nicol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Uninstall IntelliPoint 5.2 under 64 bit Windows 7</h2>
                    I have managed to have IntelliPoint 5.2 in Windows 7. Long story, involving 3rd party system transfer software and bad choice on my part.<br />
<br />
I need to uninstall it to install the correct version, but uninstall is not an option in the control panel/uninstall pane. The only option is "change" and when I select it, I get the message "setup cannot continue because this software version is not supported
 on 64 bit operating systems" Well, duh, that's why I want to uninstall it.<br />
<br />
Actually I also have IntelliType Pro 5.2. I assume the same problem resolution would apply.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to us with your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that Windows 10 does not have Guest Account. In this case I think you are using a Standard account and so you are not able to make changes. You need to have an Administrator account to make all these changes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>During Windows 10 set up which account did you use to sign in into your system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now follow the below steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong></p>
<p>1. Right click on the <strong>Start Menu </strong>and select <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>2. On the command line type:
<strong>net user administrator /activate:yes </strong>and hit <strong>Enter </strong>
on your keyboard.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>This will enable your build in Administrator account. Restart your computer and login with the administrator account. Once you are in the Build in administrator
 account you can create new administrator user account.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>You can refer to the link below for more information on how to create new Microsoft user account:</span></span></p>

<p>Hi <strong>Mellymoo</strong>,</p>
<p>1. What type of file are you burning?<br />
2. Is there any other 3rd party burning software installed on the computer?</p>
<p>If "<strong>Yes</strong>", uninstall and then use Windows DVD maker and check if that makes any difference.</p>

            Is the hard disk an internal one to the computer or does it connect externally via USB?   If external via USB, yes you can plug/unplug while the computer is turned on.  However, before unplugging you should see the Safely Remove Hardware icon in the task manager, and stop the external hard drive prior to unplugging.

            Hi Vijay1700,
<br />
<br />I'm an independent Microsoft advisor. I will suggest that you use additional HDD as you would a USB drive. How safe it is to remove the drive will depend if the system is trying to transfer data or read data from it while you unplug it. Because of this my suggestion is not to treat hard drives as hot swap. There is also the factor that when you move a disk while its on it can damage it. My suggestion is to turn of the device when connecting internal hard drives.
<br />
<br />Kind regards.       
        </p>

            Hi Vijay, if the internal Hard drive is SATA and not the one Windows has booted from, then yes you can unplug the hard drive without any data loss as long as no application is writing to a file at that time.
<br />
<br />SATA is Hot Pluggable/Swappable like USB

<h2>            message &#34;You&#39;ll need to provide administrator permission to rename this folder&#34;</h2>
                    I run Windows 7 Pro 32-bit and am the sole user on the system.<br />
There are three user profiles:<br />
SYSTEM<br />
myname(myname-PC\myname)&nbsp; and<br />
Administrators(myname-PC\Administrators)<br />
<br />
I am having a problem with folder management. Within a folder I have created I have tried a couple of management operations<br />
e.g. tried to rename a sub-folder. I keep getting the message "You'll need to provide administrator permission to rename this folder"<br />
I looked at 'Properties' and 'Security' tab; both the user-ids above have 'Full Control'.<br />
Advanced &gt; Owner indicates only the myname(myname-PC\myname) profile as an option to Change Owner to:<br />
<br />
How can I regain full control of all the files and folders on my system?<br />

            <p>You can&nbsp;assign full permissions for any folder you want but Windows 7 expects you to be working within C:\users\YourUserName so the test you were running should work there.</p>
<p>Windows 7 permissions are radically different from XP.&nbsp; Whilst you could search this forum for advice on taking over full permissions for any folder, doing so would bypass aspects of Windows 7 User Account Control and hence bypass some of its protection
 against malware.</p>
<p><em>If you would like a quick way of getting to your user area, copy a Windows explorer shortcut to your desktop and alter its Target field to</em></p>
<p><em>C:\Windows\explorer.exe /n,/e,/root,C:\Users\YourUserName\Documents</em></p>
<p><em>or just</em></p>
<p><em>C:\Windows\explorer.exe /n,/e,/root,C:\Users\YourUserName</em></p>
<p><em>then give the shortcut a suitable name so you remember what it's for.</em></p>

<h3> richard davidbronson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default Windows Sounds</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone tell me why Window has default sounds allocated for errors / issues? For example, a program I was trying to run had a problem and failed to execute and a sound chimed. Why do I need a sound to warn me of a problem? Since I am looking at the screen
 undoubtedly I am aware of the issue. Surely it would make more sense for the operating system to be a 'blank slate' and allow anyone who wanted to hear notification noises to request them. I don't think they should be defaulted.</p>

<li>Access <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Choose <strong>Sound</strong>.</li><li>On the Sound windows, click the <strong>Sounds </strong>tab.</li><li>Under <strong>Program Events</strong>, look for <strong>Default Beep</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Default Beep</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Sounds</strong> drop-down menu, and then choose <strong>(None)</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
