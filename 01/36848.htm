<h2>            Windows 10 Chinese bopomofo input stuck in English.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Chinese bopomofo input is stuck in English. I can't switch to Chinese input by clicking on the input icon or pressing "shift" button, and nothing happens when I click on the language switch icon on the virtual keyboard either. It only happens for the
 bopomofo input method but not the rest of the methods under traditional Chinese. However, I do need the bopomofo input to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried removing and reinstalling both the input method, and the entire language, and tried setting Chinese as display language, and tried windows updates but nothing helps. I have also tried using troubleshoot but it stated no issues found for keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Hi Kyle_T99,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing a couple of troubleshooting steps to no avail, I suggest that you&nbsp;<span>create a new user profile and check if the issue occurs using the new user account. This will eliminate the probability of having a corrupted
 user profile which could be the cause of the issue.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a new user profile with administrator privileges or if you have a spare admin account, you can log in to that account and create a new user account. Once you have verified that the issue was due to a corrupted user
 profile, you can transfer your data from the old user account to the newly created one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses.&nbsp;<span>If you need further assistance with transferring your data from the old account, just let me know.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Best regards.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Endless Boot-Up Loop on Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> compaqpm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Endless Boot-Up Loop on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Ok so I wanted to start from scratch with my PC (Windows 10) so I decided to factory reset and clean the hard drive. Everything was good until I got to around 50-60% it then said there was a error so I was given options but I chose to return to Windows
 10 as normal and maybe try later but anyway it was restarting I didn't think nothing of it I thought it was normal until it lit up the Asus logo as twice and my Keyboard and mouse flashed off and on and kept repeating this process until I shut it off after
 the 7th loop I don't know what to do I cant access the computer at all its really frustrating (Im using a spare laptop at the moment) I went and searched my problem on Google but to no success all I received were ideas to get Windows 10 on a USB but I have
 zero clue on how to do that so I am stuck.&nbsp;The forum said that I had to get a clean install of windows which to me makes&nbsp;no sense because I already have Windows. It also said the reboot loop was a known Windows 10 problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please I really need help on this problem?</p>

<p><b><span><font><font color="#000000">Method 1</font></font></span></b></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000">Boot the computer in safe mode and check whether the issue persists, if the issue does not persist then perform clean boot and check whether the
 issue resolves. </font></font></span></p>
<p><b><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></b></p>
<p><b><span><font><font color="#000000">Step 1</font></font></span></b></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000">Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to
 start Windows are installed. Please click on the mentioned link below.</font></font></span></p>

 startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</font></font></span></p>

    <title>Cloud save data from One to 360 w&#47;out Gold - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seangelish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cloud save data from One to 360 w&#47;out Gold</h2>
                    So, I want to get some more use out of my 360, so I opted to download some games on there, most of which are BC on One. However, when I checked save data in the Cloud, it showed that I could only move or delete it, not copy it. So, if I move, say, my Banjo
 Kazooie save data from the cloud to the 360(because Clanker's Cavern, nuff said), will the Xbox One save data remain untouched, or will I lose that upon transferring it to the 360? I tried asking support on Twitter and got no response, tried contacting via
 live chat and it appears that the same 4 people were "in line" for hours now, and the subreddit doesn't seem to have any answers, either. And no, I don't have Gold Membership, as I cannot afford it at the moment.

 Microsoft with the status........... They dont exactly move like the credit card companies.</p>

            Hi Roddy
<br />
<br />The Night Light issue is a known bug in the 1903 Feature update to Windows 10
<br />
<br />Lots of users have reported this and Microsoft are working to resolve this bug.
<br />
<br />For now, there is nothing you or any of us can do, there is no fix, until Microsoft push out a patch for this bug in 1903
        </p>

<p>Hello Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope Microsoft will fix these kind of bugs as soon as possible.&nbsp; I am using Acer Swift laptop, and my Acer Quick Access
<em><strong>Blue Light Shield</strong></em> does not work probably after I have installed Microsoft Window 10 version 1903.&nbsp; I thought Microsoft is working closely with their business partner like Acer.&nbsp; I hope this problem will solve as soon as possible.&nbsp;
 One thing I have to be clear that the Microsoft Night Light work properly after I have edited the Registry of my Windows.&nbsp; The following is the edited Registry that I have made.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 </span><br />
<span>[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\CloudStore\Store\Cache\DefaultAccount\$$windows.data.bluelightreduction.bluelightreductionstate]

</span><br />
<span>d0,0a,02,c6,14,b8,8e,9d,d0,b4,c0,ae,e9,01,00 </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have typed it on the notepad and saved it as reg file.&nbsp; I double click it and it works fine on the Microsoft Night Light feature, but the Acer Blue Light Shield still does not work.&nbsp; I wonder will Microsoft will make a patch later for the
 Acer Blue Light Shield to work properly.&nbsp; In Windows 10 version 1809, Acer Blue Light Shield works perfectly.&nbsp; Just version 1903 caused problem for Acer Quick Access Blue Light Shield feature.&nbsp; I hope it will be fix in the near future.</span></p>

 have no problem with version 1809.&nbsp; How long I have to wait till Microsoft will fix the night light bugs for version 1903 Windows 10.&nbsp; I will wait patiently, and I hope it will fix as soon as possible.&nbsp; Overall I like Microsoft, and I worked there before.

<h2>            Help Me Please&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have an Asus Vivotab Note 8 M80TA that I got yesterday (23/9/15) and it comes pre-installed with Windows 8.1 full (not rt). I have been installing updates since about 6:30pm last night&nbsp;and have installed approx. just under 200 updates. I have been
 trying to get the GWX application working. I have tried using the notepad command option but no matter how many&nbsp;I installed the GWX app just doesn't come up. I have even tried opening through the system32 folder, but doesn't work. But that's not my problem.
 My problem is that I accidentally restarted my tablet while the command prompt was running on the windows 10 command. Now my tablet, whenever I turn it on it comes up with a red box saying&nbsp;"Secure Boot Violation Invalid Signature Detected. Check Secure Boot
 Policy in Setup". There is an option for "ok" but when I try to press it it does nothing.&nbsp;I am freaking out right now as I only got it yesterday, and I really love this tablet and need it for school! Please Help Me!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Secure Boot" protects the integrity of the operating system and prevents unauthorized firmware, operating systems or UEFI drivers from interfering with the boot process. "Secure Boot" must first be disabled before installing new hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Try connecting an external keyboard and then try disabling secure boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not help, then use method 2.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Try starting your computer in <strong>"Disable driver signature enforcement"</strong> mode and check the issue.</p>
<p>Refer this article:</p>
<p><strong>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</strong><br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.

            <p>Hi Mayank,</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer. I just fixed my tablet just before you answered. I used the disable secure boot option and it worked like a charm. Just a question, will this option in any way affect my tablet in the future as I am installing windows 10 later today.</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

    <title>Buyers remorse, any suggestions for getting the most out of the Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Buyers remorse, any suggestions for getting the most out of the Xbox One for our situation&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>First some background. The last console I owned was the original Xbox which I purchased while in the army stationed in South Korea back in 2001 (I'm 35 now). I loved it! It gave me something else to do than manage to get in trouble over-indulging in off-post
 activities. I'm a computer tech guy and I love gaming. The Xbox was perfect for my situation at that time. I eventually moved away from consoles and went back to just PC gaming as I would already purchase a fairly powerful PC every few years anyways, so it
 made sense financially for me. I play a wide range of games from several Blizzard games (taking an indefinite break from WoW though), to FPS games, adventure games, RPG, strategy, etc.</p>
<p>My girlfriend also likes to play games of many types, though only a few FPS games appeal to her (such as Halo). She recently moved from another state, and brought a PS3 and WII with her for her apartment. One of the things she'd mentioned wanting for Christmas
 was an Xbox One. She really didn't think I was going to get her one, but I surprised her with it! We were both pretty excited about it at first, but quickly started to grow colder over it, just weeks after getting it. Now, I am not claiming any fault other
 than our own for not fully understand what we were getting into.</p>
<p>We both like playing Diablo 3. Was the second game we purchased after Fallout 4. Low and behold, your battle.net characters are separate from your Xbox live characters. That sucks. It's fun playing it on the xbox since you can use a controller there, and
 that particular game actually feels better with a controller to us. Otherwise though it's annoying that when I'm at my own place, I switch back to my PC characters. Sucks having nothing shared.</p>
<p>We both played The Elder Scrolls Online for a while on the PC, and wanted to get back into it and thought it would be fun to be able to play in the living room. On a whim she purchased it, assuming an MMO would have all platforms sharing it since otherwise
 it would be 3 small fractured communities rather than, well, a "massive" one. Of course we were burned again, and it's pointless to play it since we can't play with each other unless we drop money on another Xbox One which is out of the question.</p>
<p>Both of us had good memories of playing the Halo games before we even knew each other, so I bought Halo 5 because it would give us something to play together. I think by now you all know where this is going...</p>
<p>Halo 5 does have co-op like the other Halo games. The description for it even says so on the digital store. Too bad we didn't catch the lack of the word "splitscreen". So now we've purchased yet another game that we can't play together. Both of us are pretty
 upset to be stuck with a system that we can't really enjoy together. We LOVE playing games together. Now we both wish we'd have purchased something like an Alienware Alpha for the living room (or just had me build a small gaming rig).</p>

<p>NOW that that's been said, what do you all suggest (short of purchasing another Xbox One), for us to get the most out of this system so that we can actually play together. Are there any AAA games that have split screen co-op modes? Are there any games that
 aren't cut off from their PC online experience?</p>

<p>TBh to get the most out of an xbox one between two people you want another console, plus they are much cheaper now, if you buy games digitally you can game share so only buy the game once, only buy live once, there are many benefits.</p>
<p>Developers seem scare to use shared games between platforms, which I think is silly but hey ho.</p>
<p>If you really are into so many games types I would suggest staying on PC TBH.</p>
<p>Split screen is really a thing of the past very few games offer it now, think about it though how complicated is a game now and they have to do everything twice, eek.</p>

<p>I can sympathise with the lack of shared data for characters and progress across platforms, but that isn't uncommon and you'll find the same issue on the X1's rival platform the PS4. Consoles are pretty much closed systems so, it's rare to be able to share
<p>For upcoming titles across Windows 10 and Xbox One, like Fable Legends, data will be transferred. It'll become a common feature that will warrant the expectations you had when expecting it now with the X1 to PC and back again, on third-party titles.</p>
<p>For splitscreen, I think Halo is the only next-gen franchise to get slammed for not including the feature.</p>
<p>The Xbox One is pretty much blowing steam out of its gigantic vents when straining to deliver the visuals and effects found in games like Halo 5, personally I think it's wholly unrealistic to expect the console to do what consoles of old were doing with
 basic games like Goldeneye, Halo 1 et al. Only today, running a visually stunning, effects-heavy experience from two perspectives on the same screen.</p>
<p>Might happen down the line, but I doubt it. {=]</p>
<p>I believe the Preview Game, Ark: Survival Evolved has, or is getting a splitscreen mode. You may want to look into that. I hear good things - but I'm not throwing money at Preview Games. They tend not to go anywhere if the Steam library is any indication.

<p>You may want to search over at <a href="http://www.co-optimus.com/games.php?type=couch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Co-Optimus</a> for games tailored to your needs mate. It lists virtually every game, on all current platforms, with couch co-op and splitscreen to local lan and online multiplayer. Has a good search feature too. {&gt;_0}</p>

<p>If you enjoy shooters then Black Ops 3 has a splitscreen mode.</p>
<p>Halo gets the grief I think Argontheos because that's a big part of why it became so popular. Couldn't 343i have just turned down some of the flashy visuals when running in splitscreen?</p>

<p>"Diablo III" is the best local co-op option on the ONE and you've already got it.</p>
<p>"Divinity II: Original Sin" is another great local co-op. &nbsp;It's like "Diablo" but it's a massive RPG and is rated very highly by gaming critics.</p>
<p>The Lego games are pretty good and manage the split screen fairly well. &nbsp;Pick your favourite cinema franchise and you're set.</p>
<p>The games above allow you to share the space on the screen together like "Diablo III". &nbsp;However "Divinity" and "Lego" will split the screen if you get too far apart. &nbsp;Shared screen is better than split screen so I would say these are your best options to
 begin with.</p>
<p>If you're happy with a permanently split screen then there's the "COD" franchises that support it online and off. &nbsp;Also you've got "Borderlands II".</p>
<p>"Minecraft" is good fun and if you both enjoy fighting games check out "Dead Or Alive" and "Blazbue: Chronophantasma Extend" (it's a Japanese thing) for 2 great fighters where you both get as much screen space as the other.</p>
<p>Hope some of that is helpful.</p>

<p>Yep, I worked last night and was unable to post, but before heading to work we realized that indeed Diablo III has local co-op. That will pretty much tide us over for our couch gaming for a while. We will of course play the heck out of Halo 5 and Fallout
 4.</p>
<p>Great posts all of you! I really appreciate it. I hope nothing I said ever came off as being anti-console, because that couldn't be farther from what I intended to convey. The system is great for plopping down after work and relaxing on the couch and playing
 a game. Both of us have enjoyed playing it, but we just had few disappointments that made us second guess getting it. Once we figured out how to do co-op on D3 (honestly it almost seemed hidden how you go about doing it), we will have something we can both
 enjoy. Great tips on the other games out there as well. We really appreciate it.</p>
<p>I realize split screen gaming is kind of fading away. My first thought is that it's more of a way to entice more sales, but although that may play a part, there probably is more to it than that. Kind of crazy that it would only be due to performance reasons
 though considering how much my old overclocked core i7 920 PC with a single nvidia GTX760 can handle. My girlfriend commented right away that GTA V doesn't look as good on the Xbox One. But anyways, that doesn't really matter to me. I'm not meaning to start
 a pc vs console war, as I think those are silly. Both have their place and both have their strengths. The console wasn't purchased for superior graphics quality. It was purchased just as a way to quickly play games comfortably on a couch...games that are optimized
 around a controller, etc. Also we like having the media apps and such so we could get rid of a couple other devices.</p>
<p>Sorry I'm a bit wordy! Thanks again everyone for the tips. If anyone else has any game suggestions I'd love to hear about them!</p>

<p>Oh yeah, you talked about HALO Co-op.</p>
<p>HALO 5 is a SINGLE player game. &nbsp;You can only play co-op online.</p>
<p>But... The Master Chief Collection allows you to play all the previous HALO titles in Co-op.</p>
<p>The online Multiplayer was a mess when it launched but the local Co-op worked fine.</p>
<p>I think "Warriors Orochi 3 Ultimate" features split screen co-op. &nbsp;I'll double check when I'm home.</p>

<p>@Jena ~ Well, not really. =) Halo 5 is pretty much firing on all cylinders at this time in the console's life, in terms of using the system's resources to deliver the best experience both visually and in the 'feel' of the gunplay. That's not to say it won't
 be topped in future with successive advances in chip technology and new techniques and leaps in game engines and design and whatnot.</p>
<p>For a start the game's campaign is geared toward cinematic set-pieces, visual effects, complex AI, and high frame-rate with a progressive resolution system that adjusts [scales] the resolution at key moments so as not to impact your frame-rate during play.</p>
<p>So, it's not like you can twist a dial down and deliver a middling to decent experience in both halves of a split-screen. The cuts being made to the experience found in the online co-op and singleplayer experience, to get split-screen, would be pretty noticeable.
 You'd probs just have a 'meh' experience in both halves of the screen. lol {XD</p>
<p>It'd make for some mutual, probably bond-strengthening complaints as you share a couch and play the mediocre version of Halo 5. Heh ha.</p>
<p>They'd sorta have to build the co-op campaign from the ground up, and sacrifice a bunch of cool shhhhh- izzle. Or just simply deliver the feature of split-screen co-op that would exist for the sake of existing, and that would get the same kind of groans
 and online moaning as CoD Blops III's not-so-great split-screen campaign experience [when it's not on a gigantic TV.]</p>
<p>Forgetting the technical aspects of it all. Split-screen just isn't as popular as it used to be. I think all metrics show that even games like Mortal Kombat that are perfect couch combat games, are played mostly online. The vast majority of gamers have excellent
 internet speeds, and Microsoft/Xbox especially has probably the most robust servers in gaming.</p>
<p>Gamers might fire up Mortal Kombat and give their best friend a good kicking while sneering from across the couch, occasionally, but they're generally handing some squeaking foreigner thousands of miles away, his or her butt. {=D</p>

<p>I tried split screen back on the Original XBOX and 360 and I always found myself too focused on the wrong side of the screen so I completely abandoned the idea of playing couch co-op. &nbsp;HaHa &nbsp;</p>
<p>Just wasn't for me but I do realize some like playing that way.</p>

            If you want calls to be picked up separately, it would be best to assign a Skype Number to each account. When combined under a singular account, there is no segregation and features such as call forwarding work at the account level, not at the Skype Number
 level. Additionally if account sharing is detected (multiple users/endpoints), it would probably be deemed a breach of the Terms of Use, which may suspend the account(s) and services. Skype may not be the best solution for what you are trying to accomplish.

<p>Perfect actually. &nbsp;I finish work at 5 on weekdays so anytime between 5 and 9pm eastern is best for me. &nbsp;My strongest position on the ice is as a center, however, I can play defense or goaltender from time to time to switch things up. &nbsp;Preferably LD if possible.
 &nbsp;I was actually about to make a post about trying to gather up a mature group of gamers and get together a team, but this pretty much sums it up already. &nbsp;If you're still looking let me know. &nbsp;Or in that case, if anyone reading this is looking for a center
 then message me over Xbox Live.</p>

<p>I recently became a club hopper because the club that I used to play with consistently stopped playing a lot so if you don't mind a club hopper I would be willing to jump into games whenever.&nbsp;I'm on the East Coast and can play any position (besides goalie).
 I mainly play D for my club though because they all suck on D but I'm mainly a play maker on offense or a shut down d man, whatever is needed. I won the elite playoffs 4 times with 3 different clubs.&nbsp;I stopped keeping track of my stats at about 200 games played
 and im at around 900 games now and I have no idea how many goals/assists.</p>

<h2>            F.E.A.R. franchise forums&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>How come there is no forum for any of these games? F.3.a.r actually comes out in 2 months since it delayed to improve its game so it wasn't some rushed games filled with bugs and exploits like some games that have forums
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-1.gif" /> But yeah you guys should put a forum up for the f.e.a.r franchise since it had a nice community.</p>

<p>Got a better look at the ad, it says if you buy the new mortal kombat AND fear 3 you get the gift card. &nbsp;Not quite as awesome as I posted earlier. &nbsp;Still I suppose you could sell the extras and still get the game for basically nothing.</p>

<p>Ok I need help, I have been having trouble with my MTV app and VH1 app not playing, Im logged in, I have it through my DIrecttv account and everything. When I want to watch any type of video on either app I keep getting the message
<strong>"Error---- Sorry, this video is currently not available"&nbsp;</strong>. No matter how new or old the video is, that message comes up on every single video. I have been on the phone with xbox and they walked me through troubleshooting with no success. I
 need help because this is frustrating. Ive tried to watch through wifi, then through wired. I tried to uninstall and reinstall, Ive even tried a hard reset of the system back to factory settings. Nothing has worked. Any type of help would be great !&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Non Paged Memory Error causing crashes. Please Help.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have a customer with a Windows XP SP3 pc used as a file server and SQL server. The issue is a NON Paged Memory resource issue. After the pc has been running for a few hours it will get alot of errors on screen about writting to various log files failing
 and the pc will lock up causing the SQL serving application to freeze and freezing the client pc application.</p>
<p>Event logs show Event ID 50 Delayed Write Fail with no specific address mentioned. The event log appears to corrupt often also.</p>
<p>Now I have been chasing this error for a while so I have tried alot of steps which I will try to note down for you but recently have created and HIR clone of the PC, therefore I now have a similar setup here in my workshop for testing.</p>
<p>Currently in the workshop the error is still present.</p>
<p>New PSU, New Ram and HDD's tested.</p>
<p>All Microsoft updates applied.</p>
<p>Perform Virus checks, Now OK.</p>
<p>Check CPU clocking, was incorrect, Now OK.</p>
<p>I setup perfmon and tried to log pool memory for each process and use PAL to anaylse the logs but the function PAL perform doesn't seem to address the individual processes.</p>
<p>Can someone please point me in the correct direct and I will follow up with log files, hijacks etc that are required.</p>
<p>I have tried alot of steps already but may be missing something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankyou very much</p>

<h2>            Banned from a bot&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A bot was talking to me on Xbox, and being the person I am, I said some words to it to be funny, but I think I got banned from it. How does this make sense? It was not an actual person so i do not see the problem. As well as that, I was banned for 15 days, which seems excessive to me. Why the big number?</p>
