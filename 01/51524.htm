<h2>            Bluetooth Mouse</h2>
                    My surface pro 4 does not "see" my Bluetooth mouse when I use the Add Device feature.&nbsp; I've tried two different mice and neither show up when the pro 4 is looking for Bluetooth mice to connect to.&nbsp; Bluetooth itself is working OK as I can pair it with a
 sound bar and play music through the bar.

            Hi Wayne!
<br />
<br />It can definitely be frustrating to experience Bluetooth issues. I will do my best to assist you.
<br />
<br />The first step I would take would be to run the bluetooth troubleshooter. 
<br />
<br />1. Right click your windows start button on the task bar
<br />2. Click "Settings"
<br />3. Click "Update and Security"
<br />4. Click "Troubleshoot"
<br />5. Under "Find and fix other problems" click "Bluetooth"
<br />6. Click "Run the troubleshooter"
<br />
<br />If the above steps do not resolve your issue, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Right click your windows start button on the task bar
<br />2. Click "Device Manager"
<br />3. Click the "Bluetooth" arrow
<br />4. Right click on the Marvell adapter and click "Disable device", then right click again and click "Enable device"
<br />5. Right click the Marvell adapter once more and choose "Update driver" and choose the option to search automatically for updated driver software
<br />6. Restart your device
<br />
<br />Let me know if the above steps work or do not work for you, I hope this helps!
<br />
<br />Michael

            Hi Wayne,
<br />
<br />I'm sorry those steps did not prove to resolve your issue. 
<br />
<br />Another suggestion I have would be to follow the second steps I gave you above, but instead of enabling and re-enabling the driver, simply uninstalling it. After you shut down and boot up your PC again, the drivers will be re-installed.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, my last suggestion would be to do the following:
<br />
<br />1. Go to "Bluetooth &amp; other devices" settings
<br />2. Scroll down and click on "More Bluetooth options"
<br />3. Under the discovery pane, click the checkbox "Allow Bluetooth devices to find this PC"
<br />4. Click apply then ok
<br />
<br />Hopefully this helps, if not I hope another expert will chime in with further suggestions.
<br />
<br />Michael

            Thanks Michael.&nbsp; In doing all of the above, a bluetooth "radio" problem was fixed by the troubleshooter, but my pc is still not "seeing" the mice when I run the Add a device process.&nbsp; If anyone has any other ideas, please let me know.

<h3> gordontate  say:</h3>
<h2>            We can&#39;t create the recovery drive.</h2>
                    <p>The above issue arises in Windows 10 where the message continues 'A problem occurred while creating the recovery drive'.</p>
<p>I have tried to create a recovery drive a few times now without any success. I had a look in event logs which, as far as I can gather, report "Microsoft-Windows-CAP12" I.D. 513.&nbsp; There is no further information that I could find.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some have reported that the problem can be got around by unchecking the option to create the system image. This, to me, would make it a pointless exercise.&nbsp; Have MS come up with an answer that I have overlooked or is it&nbsp; 'work in progress'?

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your concern regarding the issue that you are facing.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to follow the steps below and check if it helps </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Perform System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue.<br />
Follow the steps:<br />
<br />
a. Press “Windows Key + Q” to open Charms Bar.<br />
<br />
b. Type <strong>“<em>cmd</em>”</strong> without quotes in the search box.<br />
<br />
c. On the left pane, right click on the “<strong><em>cmd</em></strong>” option and select “Run as Administrator”.<br />
<br />
d. Type <strong>‘<em>sfc /scannow’</em></strong> without quotes and hit enter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would also suggest you to run the System update readiness command. It detects incorrect manifests, cabinets or registry data, it may replace the incorrect data with corrected version available. Follow the steps.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong><span>Windows key + X</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click <strong><span>command prompt (Run as administrator)</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press
<strong><span>Enter</span></strong> key after each command:</span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.75in"><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</span></strong></p>

</p><p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran both Scannow and Scanhealth.&nbsp; Neither reported any corruption. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been suggested that I make a Windows 10 Installation USB as it contains a recovery facility. This may well be the easiest way around the problem.</p>

<h2>            Error 0x801901f4 using Outlook on my PC</h2>
                    I'm using Windows 10 and have been using office outlook to access my Hotmail account (and two other email accounts) for the past two years. Today I got a message that I needed to provide my password to access the Hotmail account,&nbsp; but when I go to enter
 the password there is a message 'something went wrong 0x801901f4'. I'm connected to the Hotmail account via exchange and have updated all the software today. Is there any easy fix for this?

<h2>            MSVCP100.dll or mfc100.dll is missing error</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new computer running Windows 10&nbsp;and am trying to&nbsp;run a program called SuperTABLES. When I try to run it, it says 'The program can't start because mfc100.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried re-installing, and I received an error saying the same thing except (I think) it said it was MSCVP100.dll that was missing (I can' remember exactly if it said this but I think it did).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have tried to run the program again it says the same error as the first time I tried to run it (mfc100.dll)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have not experienced this problem with any other app/program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I resolve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Hi,
<p><br />
The issue you are experiencing may have been caused by corrupted system files or due to an issue with the program itself.<br />
<br />
To help resolve your concern, we suggest that you can run the System File Checker or DISM tool. The
<strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> is a utility in Windows that scans for corrupted Windows system files. If it finds a problem, it will try to replace the problematic system files from a cached version that’s on your PC. If SFC can’t replace the files,
 the <strong>Deployment Image Service and Management Tool (DISM)</strong> can check the corrupted files then download and replace the files through Windows Update.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>X</strong> on your keyboard.</li><li>Choose <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Copy or type each command followed by hitting <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<em><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></em></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You can also perform a clean boot. A <strong>clean boot</strong> will help eliminates software conflicts that occur when you install a program, update, or when you run a program in Windows 10. For instructions, you may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
Note: After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" in the provided link to return your computer to normal startup mode.<br />
<br />
Should you need further assistance, feel free to get back to us.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update error 80246008 ... I also keep losing my network though wifi still works</h2>
                    <p>I'll try and explain my long day and perhaps someone can help me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm using Windows 8.1 and except for the last two Windows Updates, I'm up to date.<br />
<br />
I saw two Windows Updates today - my WU setting is for me to install Updates, (I'm afraid to open WU since the last time, just trying to open it caused problems), one WU was KB3035583 and the other was an update for Adobe Flash (or a security update for Flash)
 .&nbsp; I received that error message, 80246008, when the updates failed.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
At or around that same time, I lost my network connection.&nbsp; I still had internet connection via my wifi router, but the desktop could not get online.&nbsp; I will assume these items are related.&nbsp;&nbsp; I called my IP provider and after jumping through a few hoops, we
 both came to the conclusion that the problem is the desktop.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I also called Dell and did a System Restore, (I had forgotten about that option since it's been so very long since I've had any real problems) and did not get any further.<br />
<br />
I spent some time in Network settings and managed to get the Network back.&nbsp; (I also lost it yet again and managed to get it back.)<br />
<br />
I tried to follow the instructions associated with this error;&nbsp; I get to the Control Panel \ Services \ Background Intelligent Transfer Service and the Service status is
<em>Stopped</em>.&nbsp; The <em>Startup Type</em> is <em>Automatic (Delayed Start</em>).&nbsp; I click on
<em>Start</em> and then receive the following message: <em>Windows could not start Background Intelligent Transfer Service on Local Computer. For more information, review the System Event Log.&nbsp; If this is a non_Microsoft service, contact the service vendor,
 and refer to service-specific error code-2147024894.</em><br />
<br />
In Event Viewer \ Windows Logs \ System, I see Source \ Errors named <em>DistributedCOM, Service Control Manager, Bits-Client</em>.<br />
<br />
I am at a loss on how to proceed.&nbsp; I've hidden the KB3035583 update and recently tried to open Windows Update to also hide the Flash update (or a security update for Flash), that's when WU did nothing for about 20 minutes and I rebooted the computer and then
 had to play around with Network settings to get the desktop back online.<br />
<br />
Suggestions?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; .... thanks in advance, Dave Horne<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm adding more information to this initial message since no one has responded.<br />
<br />
This is now day 2 in my saga with Windows Update.&nbsp; I opened WU and now saw there were 18 updates to install.&nbsp; Instead of installing all 18, I chose the updates just for MS Office 2013 thinking I'd have no problems.&nbsp; The update seemed to start fine but stopped
 after about a third of the green bar was filled.&nbsp; Under that green progress bar,
<em>Downloading 8 updates (0 KB total, 0 percent complete)<br />
<br />
</em>I should also add that the Windows Update window cannot be dragged anywhere, it is stuck in place.&nbsp; It can't be closed, can't be minimized, and can't be dragged.<br />
<br />
I really would appreciate any help with this.&nbsp; Thanks, Dave Horne - The Netherlands<em><br />
<br />
</em>One more item, I ran the <em>Windows Update Troubleshooter </em>and was shown the following information -
<em>Problems installing recent updates -Not fixed; Repair Windows Update - Completed<br />
<br />
</em>Everything else <em>Fixed </em>or <em>Completed</em><em> ... or Issue not present</em> for the rest of the items.<em><br />
<br />
</em>More information ... just opening Windows Update and making a change from Automatic download and install to letting me decide, freezes the Windows Update window.&nbsp; It would seem that anything I click on in Windows Update freezes the program.<br />
<br />
Help, please.<em><br />
</em></p>

</em>Edit ... T</span></span>his added 21 July ... This time I tried to install 25 Windows Updates (after running the BITSDiagnostic.diagcab which told me it found problems and corrected them .. still keeping KB3035583 hidden), and wound up with the same errors
 I had before.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't have to reconfigure my Network and I could move and close down the Windows Update window (which I had problems with earlier).

So, I'm still receiving error message but now Windows Updates is at least acting more civilized.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will be on vacation starting Thursday but am willing to try anything anyone might send my way between now and then.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you use 3rd party antivirus application on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows corruption errors may prevent Windows updates and service packs from installing. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged. The DISM or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the DISM tool and check if that helps you.</p>

            Ganesh,<br />
<p>
</p><p><em>Do you use 3rd party antivirus application on your computer.&nbsp; </em>Yes, I use McAfee LiveSafe.&nbsp; I have not had problems with this 18 (or so) month old Dell computer with Windows Updates in the past ... and I'll try WU again with McAfee LiveSafe turned
 off after I let DISM run its course.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll report back after I do that with the results.<br />
<br />
At the moment I'm running that DISM utility that you provided a link to.&nbsp; It seems to be stuck at 40 percent though I'll let it run for a few more hours.&nbsp; If after several more hours it's still at 40 percent, I'll close down that Administrator Command Prompt.&nbsp;
 (Also, when I opened the opened the Command Prompt, I was at <em>c:\Windows\system32&gt;</em>&nbsp;&nbsp; ... and that's where I entered ...
<em>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /RestoreHealth </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll assume that is the correct path to start from.)<br />
<br />
I also have to make a general comment, the language at that link you provided, while I'm sure easy for you techs to read and understand, for me, even though I see the words, is not that easy to follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
At any rate, if I don't respond back within a few hours, I'll respond when I return from vacation.<br />
<br />
I appreciate the help everyone is giving me.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

            An update ... that DISM utility stuck at 40 percent.&nbsp; After several hours I simply shut it down and restarted the desktop.<br />
<br />
Upon that restart, I had no internet connection for the desktop though I still had access (with my phone and tablet) through the wifi modem.&nbsp; I couldn't manage to fix the network settings for the desktop so I tried a System Restore which worked this time; it
 hasn't always worked though.<br />
<br />
I stopped McAfee LiveSafe's service and attempted to perform a Windows Update.&nbsp; After I clicked on starting Windows Update, the window for WU was essentially empty, it was a white box, and I couldn't move it or shut it down.&nbsp; I restarted the computer and while
 things are not back to normal, I at least have an internet connection for my desktop.<br />
<br />
I'll try a Windows Update when I return from vacation, but I'm not looking forward to it.&nbsp; I don't know what the cause of my problems are, but I've lost my internet connection three times now.<br />
<br />
... later<br />
<br />
One more edit ... this may or may not have any bearing on my problem, but I learned after posting the above message that I had McAfee Security Scan Plus on my desktop as well as McAfee LiveSafe.&nbsp; That McAfee Security Scan Plus is a freebie that somehow was
 installed.&nbsp; I don't remember installing it and it's possible when I stopped the service of McAfee LiveSafe that the active McAfee Security Scan Plus caused my latest issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know, I'm just passing this on.<br />

            <p>Ganesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been a while since I posted&nbsp; ... and I tentatively decided to stay with Windows 8.1 and not do any more Windows Updates.<br />
<br />
I saw the following here at Windows Community ...</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>This is what wound up working for me http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/581470/background-intelligent-transfer-service-cannot-start/?p=3749444.</em></p>
<p><em>(Post #6 Phelby McGee)</em></p>
<p><em>{<span style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">Windows could not start the Background Intelligent Transfer service on the local computer. For more information review the system event log. If this is a non-Microsoft service contact the service

<p style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)"><em>If you receive this error message, follow these steps:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Click&nbsp;Start, click&nbsp;Run, type&nbsp;regedit, and then click&nbsp;OK.</em></li><li><em>Locate the following registry subkey: </em>

</li><li><em>If the registry subkey exists, go to step 4. If the registry subkey does not exist, create the registry subkey. To do this, follow these steps:

</em></li></ol>
<p>... and I tried that information.&nbsp; I managed to Start BITS without any error messages and thought that I had possibly solved this problem.<br />
<br />
I restarted my computer and was not able to have the computer get online.&nbsp; I spent about an hour in
<em>Open Network and Sharing Center</em>&nbsp; and _finally_ got back online.&nbsp; I actually was planning on sending this computer back to Dell to have them put it back it its original state, but since I managed to get back online, I decided against it.<br />
<br />
To be honest, at this point, I just want to know if this problem is with Windows (and that's OK with me), or if the problem is at my end ... either a virus or a conflict with software or drivers on this Dell Inspiron One 2350 (with Windows 8.1 installed).<br />
<br />
I should also add that I tried a System Restore to a known good restore to solve this internet connectivity issue and that did not work.&nbsp; That really bothered me that a System Restore didn't get me back online.<br />
<br />
I welcome any information but would rather just know, is this _me_ or is there an issue with my particular Dell model and Windows Update.<br />
<br />
I should also add this, at the location in the Registry where I created the folder/subkey ... FilesNotToBackup there was already a folder/subkey ... FilesNotToSnapshot&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Request for e-mail address and gamertag to be deleted yet to be fulfilled.</h2>
                    
<p>Basically I've been told that I need to bring this up here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around two and a half months ago I rang support to request an old dead gamertag&nbsp;(its literally never been used or played anything)&nbsp; I'd made by accident&nbsp; 4-5&nbsp;years ago and the associated e-mail address to be deleted. I was able to prove over the phone and
 using the form I was provided to prove the account was mine. I was then told that it should take&nbsp;around 2-4 weeks to remove the data and delete them.</p>
<p>Since then I've had to manually request the deletion of the e-mail address myself as the request hadn't actually gone through.&nbsp;Also despite the fact that xbox support via e-mail keep telling me the deletion for the gamertag has gone through, it still exists
 and I was even able to download it to my xbox and sign into it and when I pointed this out to them, the replies stopped.</p>
<p>I'm just hoping I can bring this to someone's attention so I know what exactly is actually going on and where I stand. Since the I'm no longer getting replies from the support service and had to find out how to delete the e-mail address myself, I&nbsp;am&nbsp;completely
 in the dark as to what is happening to the gamertag,</p>

<p>So this post is a bit confusing. If you just don't want the gamertag on that email address, you can create a new live ID, then move that gamertag over to that address. I would make sure that you keep your information correct on the new live id, as you may
 want to access it at a later time. </p>
<p>That will free up your email address. If you want to delete the email address you can delete all the other information on it, then delete the live id.

<p>you cant delete an xbox account you just deleted the private data</p>
<p>it still exists</p>
<p>in the world of cloud you cannot delete an account</p>
<p>if you want to reuse the gamertag you must free it</p>
<p>either by changing the email</p>
<p>or doing a gamertag change and then it gors into limbo</p>
<p>and no freeinga gamertag isnt an on demand service. for expiry</p>
<p>if you are trying to remove parental settings thats not the way to do it</p>
<p>you cant remove the association to an online account</p>
<p>you must create an new profile and join xbox live and if you have done the freeing of the gamertag you change the name and hope it left limbo</p>
<p>it is unknown how long after a gamertag change before an gamertag csn be reused again</p>

<p>I think you both missed the point. I'm trying to have the gamertag deleted. It was created in error 4-5 years ago and doesn't need to exist.</p>
<p>I put in a request for it to be deleted and was told it should take 2-4 weeks for it to be deleted.</p>
<p>That was two &amp; half months ago and it still exists now.</p>

<p>There is not a way you can delete the gamertag. You can move but cannot delete. Xbox phone support would be your option for deleting the gamertag from the account without doing anything else. Sorry if they're not as responsive as you'd like. If you still
 have the case number, you should be able to call them 1-800-4MY-XBOX and request that they re-open the service request if it's already been closed.

<p>like we stated many times you cannot delete the gamertag</p>
<p>if you want the name free you must do a gamertag change</p>
<p>having your private data deleted only deletes your details</p>
<p>there is No Way to delete a gamertag </p>
<p>you can free it using the two methods I and hydro mentioned</p>
<p>your gamesaves will only be associatrd with thr previous account</p>
<p>and cannot be freed</p>
<p>you exist on the net not.just your console</p>
<p>what hydro mentioned doesnt delete the account its the same method the first poster mentioned you unasspciate your email with the gamertag</p>
<p>you are only erasing the name and payment methods as per privacy laws</p>

<p>what you are attempting is something completely different amd actually doesnt affect you</p>

<p>I can't change my Gamertag (GT).Most of the time if you are seeing a message saying the GT you want is unavailable, it’s true. One thing to remember is that spaces and capitalization don’t make your GT unique. For example, “Major Nelson”, “MajorNelson”,
 and “MaJoRnElSoN” are all the same GT.&nbsp;GTs are also tied to services like Zune or Games for Windows LIVE. If a GT doesn't exist on Xbox, it might be in use on one of those services. If you try sending the GT you want a friend request and it says it’s not a
 valid GT that just means it isn’t used on Xbox LIVE, but it could be used for Zune or GFWL.I heard old GTs are being re-added. When will "This GT" be available?There is no schedule or estimated dates for when certain GTs will become available again. GTs are
 not an on-demand service. They will be available when they are available.&nbsp;</p>

<p>if you want your gamertag now you will have to wait for the for when they shut it 360 live down</p>
<p>however remeber the 36is expected to have an major update soon so that wont happen anytime soon</p>

<p>Your missing the point, you especially ngocphi. I never once said I wanted to change my own gamertag or use that other one. You clearly took it upon yourself to assume thats what I wanted which it is not.</p>
<p>I also did not mention changing the e-mail address, I said I had requested the deletion of it, as in closing the e-mail address down permanently.</p>

<p>i dont think you are understanding how the NET WORKS</p>
<p>you cannot delete your account period</p>
<p>there is NO ifs or buts about it</p>
<p>you cannot delete an account</p>
<p>if you read the offical post like i pointed out its NOT AN ONDEMAND service</p>
<p>if you do not care about the gamertag its is so easy</p>
<p>press DELETE and forget about it</p>
<p>you still exist on the net</p>
<p>what the support did for you is something different</p>
<p>it is deletion of your PRIVATE DATA as per privacy laws</p>
<p>but your matchmaking and gamesaves aren;t considered that</p>
<p>your name address and creditcard info and phone number is private data</p>
<p>not the account itself</p>
<p>they did comply with your request you just not understanding what they actually did</p>
<p>if you dont want your gamertag to exist its simple change the name</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you want to close the email itself you can</p>
<p>however if it is a HOTMAIL or live account then no you need to change it to another LIVE account then you can close the old one</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>we are offering you the solutions you just aren't listening to them</p>
<p>if it is a live account its simple</p>
<p>create a dummy account then unassociate the old account and attach the new account</p>

<p>if it is a live account your private data including the creditcard info is deleted just goto login.live.com and close the account as there is no subscription or billing info attached</p>

<p>I looked at my gamertag, did not see an option for country. But really, why should I have to jump through hoops to renew? Even trivial ones? Nothing is more irritating than when I try and give a company money and they don't allow it. At this point I think
 I will let my gold membership expire. I have decided I don't need it. Great job microsoft</p>

            <p>The reason you must do this is because your credit card and account information must match your physical location. &nbsp;You cannot add a payment option if the info doesn't match. &nbsp;Nor will membership/currency cards work on your account if they were purchased from a different country than it was set up for.</p>

<p>Problem Solved! I had the same problem trying to pay, but it just came up with States not Provinces. &nbsp;I tried different avenues in paying going through my Xbox One console, Xbox 360 console, laptop. &nbsp;I even looked at the HTML coding that they had and it
 always defaulted to the States. &nbsp;I called 4 times to support and they were completely baffled and only told me to buy a Pre-Paid card and do it that way. Which I wasn't happy about it. &nbsp; Solution was found after I tried this, go to your computer and try using
 different web browsers. &nbsp;Chrome always defaulted to the States, but when I used Internet Explorer it worked!!! Try different web browsers, that is the key.</p>

<h2>            Why can I not choose English &#40;U.K.&#41; as my speech language&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've just installed Windows 10, and I noticed something. I wanted to try out Cortana as soon as I upgraded, but I couldn't find it. I did a quick search for it, and found an options menu. It said that I couldn't access Cortana because my speech language
 was not the same as the region I live in. Then, I went to the settings, and the only option in the list was U.S. How can I choose U.K. as my speech language?</p>

            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had exactly the same problem, this is definitely a bug in Windows but it can be solved and I've managed to get Cortana to work with a bit of faffing around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps are:</p>
<p>1. Change all Location, Speech, Date and Time, Language and Keyboard Settings to English (US)/United States</p>
<p>2. Restart Windows</p>
<p>3. Enable Cortana</p>
<p>4. Change all Location, Speech, Date and Time, Language and Keyboard Settings to English (UK)/United Kingdom</p>
<p>5. Restart Windows</p>
<p>6. Cortana will work perfectly in UK English</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that you'll be able to start Cortana as soon as you switch to the settings to the US however she only works properly once you restart, so it's really important to restart and it should only take a few settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This whole process takes around four minutes but it does work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Credit where it's due I tried this following another persons recommendation on the thread below.</p>
<span>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-win_cortana/cortana-isnt-supported-in-the-regionlanguage-youve/b82ce76a-4f83-4ba4-b1fe-5a8d93c4f90b</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps everyone but if you needs any more assistance and screenshots of the steps let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you all have fun with Cortana and find that she's worth the messing around</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Calendar__</h2>
                    
<p>There is a calendar in Vista, a good thing. I understand about windows live but..... lets see as I see it I have to open sign on to the net just to check my calendar, and have multiple windows open to the net if I want to have my calendar available. Some
 how I don't see this as a good thing. It would be much easier if you added a calendar to Win 7 or better yet copied Apple and created one that would automatically update my phone and computer at the same time. The current setup with Live forces me to use the
 Net and when the net is down..... no calendar. Any suggestions would be welcome?!!!!</p>

<p>Hi legmkr</p>
<p>If the Windows Live Calendar does not meet your needs, there are tons of free calendar and time management programs available that you can use. Just use your favorite search engine and look for "Free calendars for Windows 7".</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p><span><span>Thank You for using Windows 7</span></span></p>

<h2>            Dazzle DVC100 audio not working</h2>
                    <p>I know a lot of questions are like this but I have a real problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently plugged in a Dazzle DVC100 into Windows Movie Maker. I'm recording a Wii U with it, and it records the video just fine. But there are two problems- It won't detect the game audio, so I have to put it through a speaker right next to it. It says
 my other audio device is "line in- not working". Also, the TV blacks out while the software shows the TV. Any way to fix this?</p>

            Okay, I downloaded windows 10. But now Movie Maker can't even RECORD with the dazzle. If I try it says, "Sorry, Movie maker cannot record from the selected device." I checked driver support and it appears. I checked to see if it had updated software and
 it did. What is happening? It worked fine the first few days I had it and it suddenly stopped.

    <title>Unable to download pictures from camera&#58; error message - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> green gage  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to download pictures from camera&#58; error message - &#34;Unable to connect to the device due to the following error&#58; The parameter is incorrect&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Downloading photographs from my camera or phone have stopped working. They worked fine up to a few days ago. When I select to Import Pictures using Windows I get a dialogue box with the message "Unable to connect to the device due to the following error:
 The parameter is incorrect", followed by one with the message "You have entered an invalid command".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a messge about the host process not running on one occasion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried a few things to fix this:</p>
<p>1. Ran the system file checker tool by typing sfc/scannow at a cmd prompt;</p>
<p>2. Rolling back recent changes using the backup tool - I believe the only changes will have been updates to virus scanner definition files.</p>
<p>3. Booting from an operating system installation CD and selecting Startup Repair</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything else I can try?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks very much for replying Nithyananda,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer your questions: </p>
<p><span><span><em>1.<span> </span></em></span></span><span><em>Have you made any changes to your computer?
</em>No</span></p>
<p><span><span><em>2.<span> </span></em></span></span><span><em>What is the make and the model of the camera?
</em>A Canon EOS and a Nokia phone both give the same error message</span></p>
<p><span><span><em>3.<span> </span></em></span></span><span><em>Which application are you using to import the photos?
</em>Import Pictures using Windows</span></p>
<p><span><span><em>4.<span> </span></em></span></span><span><em>Connect the camera to different USB port and check.
</em>Yes - tried that but I get the same error</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I tried Mr Fixit - it suggests that the 6TO4 adapter has a driver problem, but fails to fix it - not sure why or whether this is significant,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I'll try your other suggestions and let you know the outcome.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks again.</span></p>

            Had the same problem. Turns out it was a problem in a USB hub. A complete shutdown of the PC and phone did not help.
<div>The problem was solved only after I physically disconnected the USB hub for several seconds and reconnected it.</div>

                    <p>Hi. I own a windows 7 64-bit computer. My computer was acting weirdly, so I checked my computer for infections and viruses with AVG free anti-virus. It picked up something called
<strong>inline hook win32k.sys&nbsp;</strong>and it couldn't remove it from my computer. This is surprising as AVG always removes and secures the threat automatically in the scan. For this virus, it wasn't able to do that. I need help removing this threat from my
 computer as it is a really dangerous one. Here is a link to read about the virus:&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Please help me remove this virus ASAP as I use my computer for work and don't want any information on it damaged or stolen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me get rid of this virus. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            windows xp freezes on shut down screen  - laptop and pc</h2>
                    About a week ago my laptop and home pc (both windows xp) both started to freeze on the shut down screen when shutting down, meaning the shut down process did not finish, so a manual shut down is required. I remember about a year ago this happened to both
 devices at the same time. I found the solution online and i think it had something to do with; run - misconfig and a ticking/unticking of a box. I cannot remember exactly and cannot find the solution i found previously, although I do remember it was a very
 easy fix and required no great investigation as the problem occurred at the same time on 2 seperate, non-connected devices. Any ideas of the fix?

            <p>Hi Drunner, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Do you get any error message when you shut down? </p>
<p>2. Have you installed any new hardware or software prior to the issue? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For start-up or shut-down issues we can identify the cause by placing the computer in clean boot state. It looks like there could be some third party program conflicts.
<span><font color="#000000">If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.

<h2>            Twelve updates from 10&#47;9&#47;13 have status pending as stuck status, no new updates available since</h2>
                    Power was interrupted during the shutdown phase on the restart cycle after downloading these updates. Power was restored, don't recall the exact steps, but the computer was again in the shutdown phase, saying it was preparing the updates. After some hours,
 it was apparent the computer was frozen. The "wheel" cursor for the mouse pointer was no longer spinning. The computer was shutdown by cutting the power, again, then had to be started in "safe mode". After that it started all right. Checking "Update History"
 showed all these updates as having not the status of "Successful" or "Failed", but as being "Pending". No way could be found to kick-start these updates to finish the process and move to "Successful" or "Failed". Even worse, though my other computer has since
 received a few new updates after this date, on this computer no updates are found "Available" after checking for updates. Updates are essentially shut off for this computer. I have tried Hotfix for Windows (kb8947821) but no

There were no recent changes to the computer prior to this happenstance.</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
If you click on any of these seventeen items in the Update History, they list the status as "Pending" (meaning, I think, they are waiting the reboot to finalize the installation, and, yes, the computer has been restarted many times since) and list a line, "Error
 details: Code 80242014"</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
I've tried on my own, the "Fixit" tool and have done the "Hotfix for Windows (KB947821)" manually, but these seemingly made no difference. I did these, if I recall correctly, as a result of running the Windows Update Troubleshooter and subsequent running of
 this Troubleshooter come up &nbsp;with nothing else. I can't try installing the updates again, as they are not failed, just pending, and I can't find a way to cancel that status or to get it to proceed.</div>

<p>Yes you can proceed further and try those methods, lets see if that works for you.</p>
<p>Also try to perform a <strong>Reset of Internet Explorer</strong>&nbsp;as well because that would remove the cookies and other download history which might have corruptions this reset would remove the corruptions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The October 2013 Microsoft kernel Updates has generated so many issues on modern hardware that I would hide the lot pending a&nbsp;corrected (or withdrawn?) release&nbsp;from Microsoft Cowboy Inc..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If subsequently the ".NET" updates hang, that is probably another common but unrelated issue with the October 2013 Microsoft Updates. There is much posted online about fixing the .NET Updates Problem. I have no definitive fix for this problem, but do check
 whether you have at least 5 Gb of disc space before embarking on these gargantuan updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forcing these duff updates kernel could be foolish and brick your computer. Beware of any advice which involves fixing Windows Update. It is unlikely that you want the "fixes" on MS13-081 at all.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no longer any legal Vista downloads.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can&nbsp;borrow and use a&nbsp;Microsoft Vista DVD (Retail or OEM System Builders License)&nbsp;, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop
 case&nbsp;determines which Edition is installed. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The COA sticker is either on the underside of the Laptop or in the Battery Compartment.</p>
<p>With a Desktop it is either on the side, rear or top of the Computer Case.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.stack.imgur.com%2fgsPE6.gif" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>

<p>Thanks Bill for your help. Yes I have my product key, how can I tell if my computer is 32 or 64 bit? I guess now I need to find someone local who can loan me a Microsoft Vista DVD.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>You can look up your model at the computer manufacturer's website and see what&nbsp;Vista version it was released to the public with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go&nbsp;to your Computer Manufacturer's website&nbsp;&gt; look for the Drivers and Downloads Section &gt; put in your&nbsp;Computer Model Number &gt; look for your Operating System

    <title>After Running DEFRAG in VISTA lost 37 gig of Hard Drive Space - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> icono410  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Running DEFRAG in VISTA lost 37 gig of Hard Drive Space</h2>
                    I did run Disk Cleanup after my hard drive space loss including delete all except&nbsp;latest restore points option and I did not reclaim ANY of my lost 37 gig of Hard Drive disk space.&nbsp; What is Windows Vista DEFRAG doing!!???&nbsp; Did it de-compress some old compressed
 files??&nbsp; Also, when executing Defrag from the 'System Tools' folder there is no option for you to see an analisys 'REPORT'&nbsp;of the hard drive before or after the actual DEFRAG runs.&nbsp; Aditionally, for a 320gb hard drive with NO other applications running (3gb
 of memory on an AMD Turion TL-60 2.00GHz HP Laptop) it took over 24 hours for the Defrag to complete.&nbsp; HELP!!&nbsp; I want my disk space back!!!

            Hello Halima,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That was an excellent and informative answer...&nbsp; If you read my two other posts regarding this issue I explained that I am very aware of the technical aspects of DEFRAG as&nbsp; System Support for IMB Mainframe environments I satrted utilizing IBM DEFAG back
 in the early eighties.&nbsp; My main concern was what happened to my DISK space.&nbsp; Your answer explained what actually did happen.&nbsp; A little fuller background: This was a New DISK that I had just put into service&nbsp; (utilized CMS DATA TRANSFER to copy entire volume
 including OS) upgrading from 160GB to 320GB.&nbsp; It had been working flawlessly for two weeks.&nbsp; I decided that I wanted a spare copy of my&nbsp;New Hard Drive and wanted the volume 'clean &amp; un-fragmented' before I copied it into a NEW Spare 320GB volume.&nbsp; It was when
 I Defraged this two&nbsp;week utilized volume that I had my 'issue.'&nbsp; I was able to recover my space by&nbsp;manually deleting some system system work files and running 'DISK CLEAN' with remove all but latest System Restore file.&nbsp; Thanks for your time in ansewring my
 question.&nbsp;&nbsp;
