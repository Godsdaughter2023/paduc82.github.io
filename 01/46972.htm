<h2>            Windows Live Mail has stopped working&#58; Error 0X800CCC90</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Windows Live mail for years. &nbsp;Overnight it stopped working, giving server error message that it can't send or receive emails. (0X800CCC90). Outgoing Mail SMTP Port 465; Incoming Port 993. &nbsp;All standard and has worked for years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>O/S: Windows 10. &nbsp;Live Mail 2012 Build 16.4.352XXXX</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reviewed several supposed "fixes". &nbsp;And supposed fixes are all over the map.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone having same issue with same setup as mine and found a solution?</p>
<p>

</p><p>2. &nbsp;When I access the two links you provide, I get a pop-up message that these pages apply to previous versions of Windows. &nbsp;I have WIN 10. &nbsp;Will these instructions apply to WIN 10 (my O/S)? &nbsp;I'd had hate to lose everything because the instructions do not

</blockquote>
<p>That's because error 0x800CCC90 covers dozens of different error conditions; all it means is that the response from the POP3 server was wrong (formally,
<em>POP3_RESPONSE_ERROR</em>). And no-one can tell what your setup is because you only quoted part of the error message.
</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>server error message that it can't send or receive emails. (0X800CCC90).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not the server that can't send or (in this case) receive emails, but rather Windows Live Mail - because of a server error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please remove any unsent messages from the outbox (below the account folders in the folder pane), then compose a new test message with a unique subject and send it to yourself. Post&nbsp;any new error message in your reply. You can click on an error message to
 select it, then use right-click to copy it and paste it into the text entry box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There can be no troubleshooting without seeing the entire error message. There is no reason to remove the account (which will permanently delete all the account folders and their contents) to solve a problem which is just as likely to be at the server end.</p>

<p>I find it difficult to believe that&nbsp;<em>Overnight it stopped working </em>with those settings, because you shouldn't be able to connect to an IMAP server on port 993 using the POP3 protocol. The only explanation I can think of is that the Gmail servers have
 tightened up and are refusing to accept POP3 commands over that port, the standard one for secure IMAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because you can't change the type of account once it's been set up, I can only suggest that you set up a new account with the correct settings:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
&nbsp;
<li>Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select <em>Properties</em>. On the
<em>General</em> tab, deselect <em>I</em><em>nclude this account when receiving mail or synchronizing</em>.<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Press Ctrl-Shift-T to start the <span style="font-style: italic">Add your email accounts</span> wizard, then follow the prompts to set up the account again. You only need to enter your email address, password and display name for outgoing messages - the
 program will do the rest. IMAP is the default configuration for Gmail accounts in Windows Live Mail.<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Allow the program time to download folders and messages from the server and get them indexed. When it's quite finished (we may be talking of an hour or two if there are a lot of messages), check whether there are any messages in the old account's folders
 that you need to keep that aren't in the equivalent folders under the new account. If there are any,&nbsp;drag them to the appropriate folder under the new account.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>When you're quite sure there's nothing left in the old account's folders that you care about, right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select
<em>Remove account</em>. This will permanently delete the account folders and their contents and remove the account from the folder pane.<br />
&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Let us know how you get on.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I started the steps you suggested. &nbsp;When I attempted to set up the account again, I entered my email,address, p/w, name, this window popped up:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79d9b2eb-6c3c-4ef7-8d60-ed4521d324ed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/79d9b2eb-6c3c-4ef7-8d60-ed4521d324ed" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, it would not do an automatic configuration. I tried to put in what I thought was the "correct" IMAP configuration but no luck (tried several combinations). &nbsp;What should the configuration be? &nbsp;I will have to do it manually.</p>

<p>Automatic configuration uses the domain of the email address to determine which settings to apply. If the address is @gmail.com or @googlemail.com, the IMAP settings for Gmail will be used. For most other common&nbsp;domains apart from Microsoft ones, POP3 settings
 will be used. If the program doesn't recognize the domain, it will normally apply the standard POP3/SMTP settings, so I'm not sure why you're seeing the
<em>Configure server settings </em>dialogue in the wizard unless you selected <em>
Manually configure server settings </em>on the first page of the wizard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the domain not @gmail.com or @googlemail.com? If it isn't, you'll have to apply the settings manually like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c5851d1-ed63-4eca-a3d0-5659ff6128ef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c5851d1-ed63-4eca-a3d0-5659ff6128ef" /></a><br />
<br />
The <em>Log-on username </em>should be the full email address if it's not @gmail or @googlemail.</p>

</p><p>You are correct. The domain is not gmail.com; it is @wesmax.net - which was created in Google and is basically hosted by Google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manually inserted the configuration you suggested and got this popup:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce2f6198-1552-41ea-9c8f-7af569346b66" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce2f6198-1552-41ea-9c8f-7af569346b66" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know I used the correct login name and password. &nbsp;I use it to open the @wesmax.net account on my browser and it opens my Wesmax mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I first sign into my Google Wesmax account, I always get the message below. &nbsp;Google wants me to convert to a Gmail domain name. &nbsp;(It's been this way since I set Wesmax account up years ago.) &nbsp;You will see at the bottom of the web page something
 like "Just sign me in as Wesmax" (paraphrased). &nbsp;That's what I do and it all works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps Google has changed something so I can no longer use Live Mail with my user name and p/w, but it does work as normal using a browser, etc. &nbsp;I just don;t know why I can't successfully sign-into Live Mail??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

<p>This is nothing to do with Windows Live Mail. It's Google that are insisting that you use an email address for access to Gmail (and other personal stuff) that's different from the one you use to access whatever Google Apps Wesmax has subscribed to (what
 they call the <em>organizational</em> stuff). If you want to access this account from any mail client, you'll have to do what Google says.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Actually, I don't think it's that straight forward. &nbsp;I've been experimenting with other email clients, and I have been able to get them to work using the @wesmax domain. &nbsp;Why I can no longer use Live Mail using @wesmax configuration is a puzzle. &nbsp;I certainly
 prefer Live Mail and would like to keep using it!</p>

            <p>Thanks. But, that doesn't help me with third-party software or with reassignments of the standards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone know of any software that will list the hotkeys that have been assigned?</p>

<h2>            Turning the Atari 2600&#47;Intellivision&#47;Original Xbox games&#47;Xbox Indie Games online</h2>
                    
<p>I noticed why Atari 2600 games are not online. &nbsp; Xbox says a good ping is 200 ms or less. &nbsp;200ms is also 5 frames / second. &nbsp; Most video games a have controller read rates of 60 frames per second. &nbsp; Therefore if you're going to send and recieve joystick
 data i real time, a 60 fps games needs ping time of 16 ms.</p>
<p>The way most games get around tihis is by anticipating opponent's moves a few frames ahead, but for that to work, the algorithms must work well. &nbsp;A well programmed game will minimize the "jump cuts" or in shooter terms, lining up to snipe &nbsp;and by the time
 you pull the trigger, he instantly pops a few feet away. &nbsp;A jump cut is when the computer guesses wrong and shows what actually happened, and loks shocking nex to what the CPU thought it ws showing before.</p>
<p>However the Atari games are harder to anticipate. &nbsp;Some of those Atari gmes are reflexive in nature, and imaging playing Warlords on the 2600 where a skilled hand can dial fro any current position to any desired position between maximum left and maximum
 right in a frame and you need to react i a tenth of a second.. &nbsp;(whether a frame for the 2600 is a 20th of a second or a 60th I'm not sure) but not being as simple as 5 bits/cycle, one for notrh, south, east west and fire, there's the analog dial. There are
 many positions that can change as quicklly as a frame, and there's no algorithm to predict where the paddle will be next. &nbsp;It depends on reflexes.</p>
<p>One solution to this is to write algorithms to each and every 2600 game. &nbsp;But there's 2 problems. One is it takes a lot of work to networkize a game. &nbsp; The other is that the rights of the game are in limbo and/or revoked. (Imagine Nintnedo allowing the 2600
 5200, or 7800 version of Mario Bros. on the 360. &nbsp;They are Atari made 2600 games but there's no way Nintendo will allow to unless Nintendo gets 100% of the revenue. &nbsp;And they'd still not allow it due to canonical or quality reasons.)</p>
<p>I've got a solution which will address those problems. &nbsp;IF you can beat the 16 ms heartbeat, then my theory would be ANY game that is naturally a 2-or-more-player, on the same screen game, where each player controls a player through one joyport, and turn
 it into an online game. &nbsp;One thing &nbsp;you have to do is keep a "joystick stream" of each player and transmit to each player. &nbsp;The other things that need to be transmitted are random number data (make sure everyone knows you picked up a fire and not a skull in
 Bomberman) and sync data.(to slow down the faster player in the event of a network brownout.).</p>
<p>How do you beat the network ping times? &nbsp;Current the network is decentralized, rerouting network data in bizzare fashions. &nbsp;If dta travels at the speed of light (300,000km/s) and it'sa trip betwe Cleveland and Chicago, (600 k between them) it should be 2
 ms one way, 4 ms 2 ways but when I ping Chicago from Cleveland, I get ping times of anywhere from 150-200 ms o n a good day.. &nbsp;A programming friend told me if you ping each indivdidual point you will see network goig southeat before it goes west, then it overshots
 Chicago, then goes north, then overshoots and hones in. &nbsp;The network path is not the straighest path betwee you and your opponent.</p>
<p>I found that a Sprint Technology, known as Sprint and/or Nextel Direct connect travels straight from your phone to your contact's phone, from tower to tower, going the quickest way possible. &nbsp; It does not get routed through the phone network. &nbsp;If it were,
 there wouldn't be reception times of 1 ms for every 300 km., like they claim.</p>
<p>So the solution is to convert the Nextel Direct Conect network into a data network. &nbsp;It is curently a voice netrwrok so at worst it would be 33k. But I'll show 33k is eough for 4 Xbox controllers.</p>
<p>Analog sticks are 8 bits / axis x 4 axes give you 32 bits. &nbsp;A, B,. X, and Y, are 4 it buttons so that ads 16 bits, LT and RT are 8 bit triggers, so add another 16 bits. (32+16+16=56 bits) add LB, RB, Digital N, S, E W, Start, Back, and Guide, whic ads 9
 bits, and you have 65 bits/cycle. &nbsp;Multplied by 60 cntroller cycles per second brings you 3900 bits / second / controller. &nbsp;A 4 controller game gicves you 15.6 k. &nbsp; As a 33kb/s conection a 4 player game would bfit with room for 18 k/s worth of random daa and
 frame data. &nbsp; How much is 18 kbs 1 bit has 2 possibilities, 10 bits have about 1000, so 18000 bits has about 1000 raised to the 1800th power worth of possibilities computed i one second.or put another way 18000 b/s is 300 bits per frams, it would be around
 the order of 1000 to the 30th power or almost &nbsp;1 googol possibilities PER FRAME.,1000^=30=10^90 which is 10 zeroes shy of a googol (If the government spent this many zeroes on anything, we''d see a trillion dollar gumball. paid for with our trillion dollar
 copper coin. in the "penny" vending machine,)</p>
<p>There are 2 or 3 downsides. &nbsp;First everyone who wants to play an Atari game online has to have a Nextel Direct Data Connect card. &nbsp;Verizon Push to talk customers can only call each other and not Nextel,(at least not through the walkie talkie) &nbsp;so there has
 to be a standard to be followed, or yu severely limit customers. &nbsp; Second there is a distance limit to how far you can connect, a safe estimate is 1600 km (asuming data travels 2/3 light speed and you need 8 ms one way to comunicate to beat the 16 ms punch)
 &nbsp;Third is you're limitd to 33k so the voice cannot be transmited through the NDC, it has to be communicated through regular internet. &nbsp;And you may need to pair a regular internet signal with a NDC to page your oponents and search for them.</p>
<p>But there are 2 upsides. &nbsp;One is laborwise, if you can get the system to work, then every game for that system will work. &nbsp;You just might have to test different controllers, like joystick, paddle, light gun, Dreamcast Maracas, etc. &nbsp;The seocnd is that EVERY
 GAME, no matter how great or obscure, can be played, assuming you have a legitamate 2600 cartridge, and a modern machine that can deal with network issue. I call the device that plays Original Atari 2600 cartridges on an Xbox 360 to be played over the internet,
 the Xbox 2600 (Whihc I hought would have been a good name for he next Xbxo system, if Sony can steal Magnavox Odyssey's "2" and Nintendo can steal Commodore's "64", why can't Xbox steal Atari's "2600"? &nbsp;Numbers aren't copyrighted. &nbsp;If that were the case the
 number 666 should be banned, because the devil laid claim to it.) &nbsp;Cousin Systems are the Xbox 5200, the Xbox 7800, the XboxVision (plays intellivision games), and he Xbox 0, (reads original Xbox disks and has the chipset built in for 100% compatibility without
 emulating.the Original Xbox) &nbsp;Plus I don't think Sega plays favorites, so if Xbox has this possibility of reading Genesis (including Seg CD, 32X, and 32XCD), Master System, Saturn and Dreamcast games, ROM Readers for those systems can be added too. &nbsp;Of course
 if you don't have the original ROM, you can buy a download of it if it's not in rights limbo.</p>
<p>So you can play anything fro Combat to M.A.D. on an Xbxo 2600 porvided you and someone owns a copy of it within 1600 km. &nbsp;And if you don't know what M.A.D. is, my point exactly. &nbsp;It;'s the most obscure 2-player game in my collection of 2600 games, and I
 doubt the company still exists.. &nbsp;But the point is Xbox doesn't have to scour the rights cesspol to make it work. &nbsp;Remember the &nbsp;Genesis Game Genie? &nbsp;That was authorized by Sega and it altered third party and Sega ROMs at a code monkey's level, but not permanently.
 And third parties who protested it could do nothing about it. &nbsp;Since Xbox would be altering the System to networkize it, and not the ROMs, the third parties would have nothing to say about t, provided you have a legitimate copy. &nbsp;All you need is Atari's and
 Blue Sky Rangers' permission.</p>
<p>But the people who made the games need a revenue source, even if their ROMs are floating around in thrift stores that they see not even a penny from now in reasale. &nbsp;What you could do is have an advertisement that plays. &nbsp;30 seocnds for apropriate bandwidth.
 &nbsp;I've got 3G hooked up to my Xbox and it's not worth waiting 10 minutes to watch a 30 second hi-def commercial when a 30 second Standard Def or Audio comercial would work fine. &nbsp;So it should sense your speed to give an appropriate commercial. &nbsp;Wathc one commercial,
 the you ca play as many games of that title you want form that opponent. &nbsp;So riends can stay for hours and watch one comercial, but if you want to challenge multiple oppoents or play multiple games, prepare for a new commercial every time you power on the
 Xbox 2600.</p>
<p>This brings up a third advantage of this system. Since the network works for every game, you don't have t open up separate servers for each individual title ad make a judgement call based o how popular each title is. &nbsp;You get all for the price of 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're an Xbox Indie developer, and want to take me up o this offer. &nbsp;Friend me: TripletTopper321. I've got Atari and Sega saying they'll authorize a prototype if oe is made. &nbsp;Nintendo said they'll look at any working prototype. &nbsp;I'm writing here to get
 Microsoft's response, and I'll have to check with Sony. &nbsp; Meanwhile other retrog systems rights owners can contact me. &nbsp;TripleTopper321</p>

    <title>Bluetooth headphones connected not as sound device - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth headphones connected not as sound device</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have got a pair of Panasonic RPHTX80B bluetooth headphones that I use with my Windows 10 laptop. All latest drivers and updates are installed.</p>
<p>Now each time I turn them on, they are connected automatically. They appear in Bluetooth &amp; other devices as "Connected", but there is no sound, and I don't see the headphones in my sound devices.</p>
<p>What I need to do each time is go to "Bluetooth &amp; other devices", click "Disconnect" and "Connect" again. Now the headphones appear as "Connected voice, music", and everything works fine. Until the next time I turn them off.</p>
<p>It is not really that bad because at the bottom line the headphones are working, but it is just annoying to do this procedure each time I want to use the headphones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to make these headphones connect as a sound device straight away?</p>

<h2>            Update to Windows 10 Version Ruined Achievements</h2>
                    <p>As anyone who played this game prior to the Windows 10 update knows, the update from the Windows 8 version to the Windows 10 version has caused duplication of the game under Xbox Live profiles. &nbsp;The Windows 8 version had 3 achievements, and the Windows 10 update has 40 achievements. &nbsp;Since I did not get all the achievements on the Windows 8 version before the game auto-updated on start-up, I now have "Microsoft Mahjong: 2/3 &nbsp; &nbsp; 15/25G" stuck on my Xbox profile and&nbsp;a completely separate "Microsoft Mahjong" with 40 new achievements. &nbsp;I do not want the game listed twice. &nbsp;Either allow me to unlock the last achievement from the Windows 8 version&nbsp;or remove it from my profile, I do not want the game listed twice.</p>

    <title>Surface Book movement causes devices to disconnect and reconnect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterl_942  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book movement causes devices to disconnect and reconnect</h2>
                    <p>I find that when I move my SB slightly, there is a notification sound indicating that devices are disconnecting, then reconnecting. I am running a DisplayLink certified HooToo USB 3.0 docking station to which I've connected two monitors. There are a variety
 of USB connections attached to the router.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've opened the "Connected devices" window in Settings to observe the behavior - and indeed, when there is motion on my SB, the "Connected devices" menu shows things disappearing and reappearing. It feels like this weirdly has something that is motion sensitive
 on my SB - if I move it, things disconnect/reconnect. I've tried switched connections to the ports themselves to see if it was a hardware issue - same behavior. I disconnected the Hootoo router *completely* and leaving only my wireless mouse connected, and
 same thing - devices connected and reconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I removed even the wireless mouse - so there were NO USB connections. I shook SB to see if there was anything connected/disconnected, and we were OK. So I'm resolving this problem as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Motion causes USB ports to connect/disconnect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody else having these issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>The circuitry is all up in the "Clipboard" and the ports all in the base, so the link between the clipboard and the base might be faulty, too.</p>

            <p>I've noticed this issue has started occurring only in the last two weeks on my Surface Book (about 1 month old). Especially when I start the computer, or when I reopen the lid or jostle it, the screen very briefly flashes black and the disconnect/reconnect
 sound plays up to four or five times, although the magnetic lock does not click and the tablet itself doesn't actually detach at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, I have only recently begun having issues with the graphics card. I've been running Fallout 4 on low settings and found (not every time) that moving the screen on the hinge or even jostling the computer can cause it to either go to black screen
 and then recover with the "NVIDIA has stopped working and recovered" bug people have been getting on these forums, or less recently going to an orange screen (used to be the blue screen) with a :( and a kernel error. (Will update when I find the error code
 again.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if anyone else is getting this or it's specifically my hardware issue? I'm going to reinstall the graphics drivers and give the pins a careful clean but would like to know of any other experiences or fixes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I have experienced the same issues!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I fist noticed that when I was running a full screen app, I moved the screen a little and the computer froze. Blue screen, saying " IRQL" something.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The support guys told me (as always...) to uninstall and re install the drivers.&nbsp;<br />
Then I got this "has stopped working and recovered", sometimes with the nvidia, sometimes with the intel HD, both graphics cards.<br />
<br />
And yes, sometimes I noticed that the device connection sound when moving the device, and I thought that maybe the docking system of the screen is failing and that is causing all the problems.<br />
<br />
so now I don't know if its software configuration or hardware problem, or windows 10 or WHAT. But the drivers stop working way too often.<br />
It's really stressful, the surface book is giving me more headaches than any of the computers I've owned.<br />
<br />

            <p>I relayed my concern to CS and they simply shipped me a new SB. The new SB is performing wonderfully - so there appears to have been a hardware issue with the original batch, or at least so I suspect.</p>

            Hi, IBlazecat,
<br />
<br />Go to Cortana Search &gt; Type Control Panel
<br />Click on System
<br />Type System Sounds in Search Bar
<br />Click on Change System Sounds
<br />
<br />Why? I believe it is because Windows 10 is still in the improv state with each new build. Use Feedback Hub to request Windows 10 sounds.

            Hi, I hope you're doing good today.
<br />
<br />To disable it or change it please follow this.
<br />
<br />Go to the Windows 10 Control Panel.
<br />
<br />Search for “power options“.
<br />
<br />Click on the search result titled Power Options.
<br />
<br />Click on Choose what the power button does or Choose what the power buttons do.
<br />
<br />Uncheck the checkbox beside the Turn on fast start-up (recommended) option to disable it. 
<br />
<br />Click on Save changes.
<br />
<br />Restart your computer.
<br />
<br />Once you're computer boots again.
<br />
<br />Right-click on the Sound icon (represented by a Speaker) in the Notification Area at the bottom-right corner of your computer screen.
<br />
<br />Click on Sounds in the resulting context menu.
<br />
<br />Make sure the checkbox beside the Play Windows Start-up sound is checked, 
<br />meaning that the option is enabled.
<br />
<br />Select the one that you need and that's it.
<br />
<br />Regards.

                    Somewhere in the process of updating, my old Skype ID seems to have been lost, along with my contacts, a few dollars of credit and my Skype In phone number. Now everything seems to be under an MS identity. Is there an easy fix for recovering everything
 that's gone missing? If not, how on earth can I get my Skype In phone number back??

            If your contacts are missing, you are likely signed into the wrong ID. 
<br />
<br />Just isolate the problem, could you try signing into Skype Web just to make sure its the account thats affected or not?
<br />
<br />Skype for web
<br /><a href="https://web.skype.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/en</a>
<br />
<br />If Skype web is not affected, Sign out of Skype app, then sign in again, but this time use your email address and password associated with your Skype ID.
<br />
<br />If this does not work...
<br />
<br />I recommend you contact chat support and choose Technical problem so an agent can help diagnose whats the problem with your account:
<br />
<br />Go to the following link to get assisted live support:

<p>Thanks Andre. I see now both accounts and was able to transfer the contacts from the old "Skype ID" account, to the new "MS" account, though I now have to ask 500+ contacts to "accept invitations" from the new account - which is embarrassingly unprofessional.
 Grrrrr...<br />
<br />
That leaves the problem of transferring the Skype In phone number to the new MS account: for that, I will follow your good advice and try the chat with the link you provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for your help.</p>

<h2>            There is less space available on my drive than there should be. What could be causing it&#63;</h2>
                    Sorry about the weird wording of the question, but the drive windows is on seems to have more space occupied than there should be. The displayed disk size is 237gb, with 180gb free, right now. I turned on the ability to view hidden files and highlighted
 all of the items in C:\ before clicking properties, and when the size loaded it said it was 39gb. The paging file is 2944mb, and system recovery uses 4.4gb. What's using that ~10gb extra that should be there?

            Hi INKAHAKUMAI,
<br />
<br />Windows Explorer is currently buggy since the last update, it is not reporting folder sizes or free space on drives correctly . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility called Treesize. Using that tool, you will instantly see where this space is being used
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have worked out where this space is being used, please let me know so I can advise on what is safe to remove . . .

            Problem 1: Lack of free space.<br />
<br />
Press Windows key + R<br />
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
Delete any log files found in that folder.<br />
<br />
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage<br />
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now<br />
<br />
Wait while it scans for temporary files.<br />
<br />
Check any location with large amounts of space.<br />
<br />
Click Remove files.<br />
<br />
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:<br />
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/<br />
<br />
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space.
<br />
<br />
Options for freeing up space:<br />
<br />
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often
 visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.<br />
<br />
<br />
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough
 disk space available.<br />
<br />
Lets start.<br />
<br />
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:<br />
<br />
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe<br />
<br />
Then hit Enter<br />
<br />
<br />
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup<br />
<br />
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.<br />
<br />
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.<br />
<br />
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder
 can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.<br />
<br />
<br />
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files.
 Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.<br />
<br />
Location/Type &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Description &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Safe to Delete<br />
<br />
Downloaded Program Files &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;YES<br />
<br />
Temporary Internet Files &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and
 need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Keep It<br />
<br />
Offline Webpages &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized
 settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Keep It<br />
<br />
Recycle Bin &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before
 you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;YES<br />
<br />
Temporary files &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp
 directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance
 if you don’t want to redownload it every time. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;YES<br />
<br />
Thumbnails &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting
 it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;YES<br />
<br />
Debug Dump Files &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files
 to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Keep It<br />
<br />
System error memory dump files &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that
 occur in Windows. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Keep It<br />
<br />
&nbsp;The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library
 or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.<br />
<br />
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version
 of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will
 be cleaned out.<br />
<br />
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your
 files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check
 through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.<br />
<br />
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.<br />
<br />
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.<br />
<br />
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB
 drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of&nbsp; disk space to keep System Restore Points.<br />
<br />
Configuring System Protection settings<br />
<br />
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab,
 you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated.
<br />
<br />
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You
 also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an
 image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file.
<br />
<br />
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk<br />
<br />
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.&nbsp; Because of my Internet
 limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.<br />
<br />
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.&nbsp; Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition
 a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.<br />
<br />
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using
 the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.<br />

<p>Hi Kloppenburgjes,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Did you install or update any program on your computer?<br />

    <title>Screen Sharing Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mdwulff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Sharing Issue</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to have a Skype call this morning with a client, and I was unable to share my screen.&nbsp; I was connected with the client on a video call, but when I clicked the "..." button on the Call Bar, the "Share Screen" and "Share Screen and Sounds" options
 did not appear.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested with a coworker later in the day, and everything worked as expected for that call.&nbsp; When I clicked the "..." button on that call, the sharing options WERE visible, and worked as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully useful specs:</p>
<p>- I was calling from the United States, and the client was international (Egypt).&nbsp; My coworker is also in the US.</p>
<p>- My coworker and myself are both using Skype 12.1803.279.0 on a Windows 10 desktop.&nbsp; The client was using Skype for Business (version and OS unknown).</p>
<p>- My coworker and myself are both using free accounts with $0 credit.&nbsp; The client's account status is unknown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something about either my or my client's setups that would prevent us from being able to screenshare?&nbsp; If so, what do I need to do to fix it? Our call was rescheduled for later this week, so a fix that could be implemented before then is preferred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi Mdwulff,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting the queries you in encounter in our forum.According to my test and research, Skype users are not able to share screen when in call with Skype for Business users. As the feature is not feasible now, I suggest vote the feature via the following
 link :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299913-generally-available/suggestions/12335259-enable-screen-sharing-to-consumer-skype-users" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299913-generally-available/suggestions/12335259-enable-screen-sharing-to-consumer-skype-users</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many new features are added based on the feedback from customers like you. In the same time, to share the screen with the Skype for Business users, I suggest you can use
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/introducing-skype-for-business-e705627e-8e94-4bae-ac8b-4ccea5a9c4c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype for Business</a> instead. Thanks for your time and understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Coldwell</p>

            Open the Windows Store icon on your taskbar
<br />Click the ellipsis in the top right corner of the screen (...)
<br />Click My Library
<br />Scroll through the list then click the download button next to the apps you had installed. 
<br />
<br />also, you can use the following to reinstall apps that might be broken:
<br />Repair or Reset the missing apps:
<br />
<br />    Open Settings, and select Apps.
<br />    On the Apps &amp; features tab, find the name of the missing app. Click the app and select Advanced options (if available).
<br />    If a Repair option is available, click Repair. If this option is not available, or if Repair does not resolve the issue, you may also try the Reset option, though you might lose any app data that was saved.
<br />    Once the repair or reset is completed, the app should again appear in the app list and can be pinned to the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall and reinstall the missing apps:
<br />
<br />    Open Settings, and select Apps.
<br />    On the Apps &amp; features tab, find the name of the missing app. Click the app and select Uninstall.
<br />    Open Store and then reinstall the missing app. Once installed, the app should appear in the app list, and can be pinned to the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />3. Re-register the missing apps using PowerShell – If you have a lot missing apps, advanced users can instead attempt to restore all of them at once using the following PowerShell commands. Note, however, that if Steps 1 and 2 were already attempted and did not restore your missing apps, this PowerShell solution will also likely not succeed.
<br />
<br />    In Cortana, type PowerShell. In the search results, right-click Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
<br />    In the Powershell window type the following commands. These steps may take a few minutes to complete.
<br />
<br />        reg delete “HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\TileDataModel\Migration\TileStore” /va /f
<br />
<br />        get-appxpackage -packageType bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + "\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml")}
<br />
<br />        $bundlefamilies = (get-appxpackage -packagetype Bundle).packagefamilyname
<br />
<br />        get-appxpackage -packagetype main |? {-not ($bundlefamilies -contains $_.packagefamilyname)} |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + "\appxmanifest.xml")}
<br />
<br />    Once the PowerShell commands are completed, the apps should appear in the app list, and can be pinned to the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If doesn't help, let us know and we can explore more options.

            In addition since you have had problems with your underlying install, upon which everything depends in Windows 10 on it's quality, 
<br />I would go over this Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has no reported issues from hundreds of thousands of users:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Windows 10 Refresh which reinstalls Windows while leaving out the factory bloatware that throttles Windows and causes endless issues, and lets you save your files.  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

            <p><span>Hi JackieMills,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and giving us an opportunity to help you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your description, I understand you are unable to print documents due to compatibility issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Could you answer few questions to understand the issue well:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Were you able to print using any other Operating System?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of your printer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the error message that you get when you try to print?
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can go to Windows 8 compatibility center and check if the printer is compatible with Windows 8. Here is the link for your reference.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/Home?Language=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/Home?Language=en-US</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to install the printer drivers in Windows 7 compatibility mode and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to install in Compatibility mode:</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>Right click the driver installation file and select Properties then tap or click the Compatibility tab.</span><span><br />
</span><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>Place a check in the Run this program in compatibility mode box.
</span><span><br />
</span><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>Tap or click the drop down box and select a previous operating system, then tap or click OK.</span></p>

            Hi Kennedy, 
<br />
<br />First thing I would try, do you have another SD card to try? This would tell us definitively if it’s the card, or the surface having the issue. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!

            I guess I should also ask if it worked fine before today, or is this your first attempt to use it? We’ll try to figure this out!

<p>So the SD card itself is good as it reads fine in my other computer. I haven't tested the adapter elsewhere as I don't have another full size SD card port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the first time I've tried using this port on this computer.</p>

            Ok, this is for a surface book, but the steps should apply here as well:
<br />
<br />Make sure your card is inserted properly, 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager and look for non recognized device in Other devices.
<br />
<br />Right click and use option "Update Driver Software..."
<br />
<br />Go to Browse my computer
<br />
<br />Go to Let me pick from a list
<br />
<br />From the list, click on SD host adapters
<br />
<br />Choose the last one: USB Mass Storage Device. Please do not choose any Related USB Card Reader devices.

            Thanks for the help so far, but it may actually be an issue with the SD card. When I bought it I put it in my dash cam and formatted it. I removed it once to look at the quality of the video on my desktop and it was fine. Now it is ~6 months later and
 now that I'm home, my desktop actually can't read the card either now. I'm guessing the dash cam may have corrupted the file system somehow.

            If 2 machines can’t read it, you’re right, it’s probably the card. I would get another card to verify your results, and wouldn’t poke and prod the surface too much before you test the new card. I think you’re on the right path!

            You lose everytrhing when you do a Recovery&nbsp;put your Computer back to Factory settings.<br />
The Hard Drive, with most recovery processes, is wiped clean.<br />

Some Manufacturers may give to an option to save files before Recovery commences.<br />
Contact and ask them.<br />

You can try making a Bootable Repair disk from the info supplied below.<br />

Use the info below to try to save your Data,&nbsp;if you have to do a Recovery.<br />
<br />

<br />
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Restore Point:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As is the case with most computer/laptops these days, they do not come with the proper Vista Disk to do Repairs with.<br />
<br />
As yours falls into the above category: Download the ISO file at the supplied link, and make a Bootable Repair Disk from it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you have changed that, insert that Bootable Disk you have made in the Drive, and reboot.</span></p>

<p><span>Above info shows what the process looks like, and a how-to, as it loads to the Repair Options.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista,
 and just serves as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft
 to make this available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it</span><span><span>.</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Vista Burning software from the above link.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After installing above ISO burning software, right-click on Knoppix ISO file &gt; Copy Image to CD.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Knoppix does not install on your PC; just uses your PC's resources, RAM, Graphics, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Change the Boot Order in YOUR computer/laptop to make the CD/DVD Drive 1 in the Boot Order.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Plug in a Flash Drive/Memory Stick, BOOT with the Live CD, and you should be able to read your Hard Drive.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>When the desktop loads, you will see at least two hard drive icons on the desktop (one for your hard drive and one for the USB drive).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the hard drive icons to open them up and figure out which drive is which.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Right-click the USB drive icon and choose "Actions &gt; Change read/write mode" so you can write to the drive (it's read-only by default for security reasons).</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Now find the files you want to back up and drag and drop them to the USB drive. When you are finished, shut down the system and remove the USB drive.
<br />

            Hi Ollie, <br />
<br />
If I am in your position, I will usually do the following: <br />
<br />
First, I will restore my Windows OS and set the restoration to the time before I installed the malwarebytes. If the speed of your laptop returns to normal then it was the malwarebytes that cause the slow down of your laptop. However, if the your laptop still
 running slow; then,<br />
<br />
Second, I will try to restore the entire Windows to its factory default settings. But, make sure that you back up first all your important files to the partition drive if you have it in your laptop; and still the problem persists
<br />
<br />
Third, I think the hard-drive is not working properly. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

            If you're using McAfee firewall, disable the Windows firewall. Two firewalls running on the same machine will cause system instability.<br />
<br />
See this article for instructions on how to turn off the firewall: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
Similarly, if you have McAfee antivirus installed, disable Windows Defender for the same reason.
<br />
<br />
To turn off Windows Defender, right click the Start button and go to Control Panel.
<br />
<br />
Next, change "Category" view to "Small icons" and then click Windows Defender.<br />
<br />
Next, click the Settings button and remove the checkmark from "Real Time Protection".<br />
<br />
Reboot and your system should function normally afterwards.<br />

<p>Support for Windows XP already ended:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14223/windows-xp-end-of-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14223/windows-xp-end-of-support</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It means Microsoft won't provide any support for Windows XP and relevant products and other software vendors also stop supporting Windows XP.</p>
<p>It is better to upgrade to supported version of Windows like Windows 10 and use replacement.</p>

            Check that you have enough bandwidth to share your screen, and close all applications that may be using your bandwidth or slowing your computer down. For example, music streaming applications such as Spotify, or file-sharing applications such as iTunes.
