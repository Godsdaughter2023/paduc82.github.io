    <title>Windows 10 Taskbar and Start menu Frozen - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Taskbar and Start menu Frozen</h2>
                    <p>So I've read through threads about using the task manager to correct; that did not help.</p>
<p>I've tried the "Powershell" method; that did not help.</p>
<p>I've tried restarting; that also, i am sure you can guess, did not help.</p>
<p>Window start menu and taskbar frozen. &nbsp;When I minimize windows with a delayed pop up (like a survey) they never pop back up.</p>
<p>Any additional assistance would be Fab! Thanks.</p>

            This could be due to running everything on a single Administrator account, this usually happens from upgrading from 7 or 8. &nbsp; Create a new account, one that is not an administrator, and see if it still freezes.

<h2>            Can&#39;t change back to english. It went to spanish on its own. How do I switch it back&#63;</h2>
                    Windows 7 ultimate, I installed it yesterday. I downloaded the spanish language pack, but i did not change my language to spanish. I turned on my computer today and it is all in spanish and it will not switch back to english. According to the quick bar
 thing on the left by the clock, it says it is in EN,&nbsp;Ingles (Estados Unidos). That should mean that i am in english, though everything is in spanish. the only other option i have is espanol. I would very much like to get my computer back in english soon, this
 is rather annoying that i can't switch it back.

<h2>            How to put Windows 7 on Encore 2&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to dualboot Windows 7 with Toshiba OEM Windows 8.1 with Bing on my Encore 2 Tablet. I go into Command Prompt from Advanced Startup Options and launch Setup.exe directly from the extracted ISO image, and it says it needs the driver for "Intel
 SD Host"., which translates to my SSD driver located on Intel SD Host. I cannot find the driver for Windows 7 on Toshiba's site (will look more), and I cannot use the Windows 8 driver as it says it cannot find it. Help please :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel Atom Z (something) @ 1.33 GHz-1.83 GHz</p>
<p>1 GB RAM</p>
<p>32 GB SSD by Toshiba on Intel SD Host (Only do browsing, not much space taken up by apps)</p>
<p>Windows 8.1 OEM (32 bit OS 64 bit processor)</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be safe, I created another partition and applied the install.wim image to it, but that wasnt a good option, since it hangs at the Toshiba logo after selecting Windows 7 (used EasyBCD), but I did it that way so i could format the partition and install
 Windows 7 clean once I get the driver. Thanks!</p>

<div>This can be a sign of a malware attack - or simply a problem with no space on the drive.</div>
<div>How much space is there on all drives that System Restore is monitoring? - make sure that SR is only monitoring the drive with Windows installed on it (usually the C: drive).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What happens if you create a Restore point manually? Can you see that point, and the point created earlier?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What happens if you then reboot? - are both Restore points still visible, or is a new one there?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When was the last time you ran a Full System Scan using your Anti-Virus with updated definitions?</div>
<div>Have you tried other anti-malware products? - Use Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.malwarebytes.org</a>) - download, install, update, and run it. If it finds anything significant, then follow up with a full system scan
 while in Safe Mode - in each Account on the PC.</div>

    <title>Lost all priveledges&#47;admin rights after Windows 8.1 update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Lost all priveledges&#47;admin rights after Windows 8.1 update</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi, shortly after installing WIndows 8.1, I lost all priveledges and all admin rights. Long story short, ANYTHING that requires "admin" cannot be accessed. I cannot use command prompt as administrator, I cannot run any .exe files (no windows repair utilities
 will even open) and Windows is saying my product key no longer works.&nbsp;<strong>*****I am able to run command prompt as admin via startup mode; this might be useful.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>SO, I spent 200 dollars and bought a NEW product key (assuming the seller gave me counterfeit windows) and even the NEW product key does not work (I will be contacting Microsoft for a refund, as I just blew 200 dollars)!!! I then tried installing updates
 (new security updates) and WIndows gave me an error saying "There was a problem installing updates" in lovely red colored text. Joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep in mind before giving me advice, I literally cannot run any new .exe files that are downloaded and I cannot do anything that requires admin or has the admin shield symbol next to it. When I try opening admin stuff, the explorer window freezes
 for 5-10 minutes before giving me an error saying access is denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried adding an account to create new permissions. This also does not work. When I click "add an account" from PC settings, the button gets pressed, and absolutely nothing happens. It doesn't respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under "accounts" if I click "sign in options" the entire PC settings window freezes and I have to go back to the desktop to unfreeze it. I also can't figure out how to get to safe mode as there is no "general" tab under PC settings and there is no "advanced"
 tab under PC settings.</p>

            <p>try holding shift as you click OK on the UAC prompt that asks you for admin password. &nbsp;it seems to work ok this way for me. &nbsp;(i'm logged in as User, UAC prompts for Admin account password, type it in, hold shift, click OK). &nbsp;This lets me install from the
 User account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing to note, I had Win 8.1 standard, and didn't try this shift-OK method. &nbsp;I was still having problems installing under User. I then upgraded to Pro. Without the shift-OK, I still had issues installing under User. &nbsp;Using shift-OK works now for me.</p>

<h2>            Security alert Windows Media Player</h2>
                    I downloaded a number of files, containing tutorials for INKScape.&nbsp; The first couple worked fine, but I then began to get the following security warning: "current security settings do not allow this action"&nbsp; I am running Norton 360.&nbsp; As far as I know there
 has been no changes to the settings.&nbsp; This warning comes on Windows Media Player.&nbsp; It may have something to do with the fact the files are from an external computer.

If it so happens HP does not provide the driver, the only recourse is to find who actually manufactures the camera for them and *maybe* get the driver from them.</p>

<h2>            Skate 3 </h2>
                    <p>Hi there, I recently bought a $10 gift card so I was able to buy skate 3 on the Xbox one store&nbsp;as it is discounted at $7 but there is no buy option, only “see price” where the buy button would be. Anyone know why this is?</p>

<h2>            System Sounds Not Working</h2>
                    All of the audio on my computer works fine except the system sounds (example: Typing a character that is not accepted in a given field does not cause the&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;Background&nbsp;sound.) The strange part is that using the volume mixer or the Sounds section of
 the control panel&nbsp;to test it works fine.

            <p>Thank you for the reply. Here are the answers to your questions.</p>
<p>1. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">What is the make and model of the computer?:</span>&nbsp;Alienware Aurora (exact model number uncertain) (It was purchased in 2,010.)</p>
<p>2. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Are you able to hear the sound while using headphones?:</span>&nbsp;I have not tested that.</p>
<p>3. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Did you make any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?:</span>&nbsp;I had a hard drive failure, although I don't remember the timeframe. I am guessing that it was at least a month ago now
 though.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;<span>D</span><span>ue to incorrect settings</span><span>.: This might be the reason for your question about headphones above.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;</span><span>D</span><span>ue to corrupted audio drivers</span><span>.: This is possible, although I would think that corrupted audio drivers would cause no sound to be heard, but I could be incorrect with that guess. Only the system sounds are
 not heard and they do work within Control Panel and the volume mixer.</span></p>
<p><span>6a-6g. As my computer is currently busy running a macro, I will test these steps later.</span></p>

            Daniel, then you'll need to eventually do the Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />The consolation is that no one who's followed those steps has ever come back to report another problem as long as they stick with the tools and methods given.
<br />
<br />It is also one of life's great learning experiences that will permanently make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to keep it that way.  
<br />
<br />I'll be here to help as much as you need.  Just read over the steps when you get a chance and ask back any questions.

            Hi Daniel.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you all possible steps to troubleshoot installation failure which work in about 90% of cases.  If not we'll go from there:
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI:   <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />Create the latest new Windows 10 Installation Media by installing Media Creation Tool and following the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            How did you create the bootable media?   Use only the Media Creation Tool, and uncheck Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version for the target PC.  
<br />
<br />Then test the Media boots correctly on another PC to confirm it's good. 
<br />
<br />If so then enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to reset to defaults:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>

<br />
<br />If you cannot boot into BIOS/UEFI setup, then remove the CMOS battery to reset BIOS:<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/tp/clearcmos.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/fixtheproblem/tp/...</a>
<br />
<br />Then it is a matter of timing to press the Boot Menu key for your PC or motherboard maker as the PC powers up to trigger the media, follow the rest of the steps I gave above for troubleshooting install, then the tutorial for Clean Install.

Revo Uninstaller is a much faster and more powerful alternative to "Windows Add or Remove Programs" applet!<br />
<br />
With its advanced and fast algorithm, Revo Uninstaller analyzes an application's data before uninstall and scans after you uninstall an application. After the program's regular uninstaller runs, you can remove additional unnecessary files, folders and registry

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade related questions</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi, Windows 10 are approaching and I've some unanswered questions related to the upgrade. Some of them are mentioned and speculated online but without official response.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 Home Premium SP1, FPP license</li><li>Truecrypt encrypted all drives<br />
</li></ul>
<p>and my Questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>If I upgrade to <strong>Windows 10, will it be FPP</strong> (ie. stays with me forever)?</li><li><strong>What happens to existing Win7 FPP license</strong> - will it stay active (ie. I so can dualboot on same machine or downgrade back to Win7 if I don't like Win10)?</li><li><strong>Can I upgrade to Pro versions</strong> (Windows Anytime Upgrade never offered me upgrade)? For how much (both of them - I see upgrading Win7 as better, since it will carry to Win10)?</li><li>Can I <strong>upgrade </strong>to Windows 10 <strong>without decrypting harddrives</strong> (I like truecrypt since it is only encryption software with public audit)?</li><li>Will you brick my computer and other connected devices - by <strong>banning my Live account</strong> - because OneDrive will
<strong>automatically backup</strong> my Desktop, where I'do have among other files
<strong>acts </strong>(my own work) and you just hate naked woman ("<strong>Code of Conduct</strong>")? Or is it issue only when such photos are shared with world (and even there should be warning first; if you connect OS to Live account, the damage is way
 more expensive)?</li></ol>
<p>More detail to few topics that might arise:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>bitkeeper</strong> -
<ul>
<li>isn't available in home versions (<em>so if I cannot upgrade my license, I'm out of luck</em>)<br />
</li><li>doesn't have public audit</li><li>became less secure in Win10 "for performance reasons"<br />
(<em>like if I we didn't had gigahertzes of multicores; which wasn't an issue in older
</em><em>systems and hardware only gets faster</em>)</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>downgrade</strong>
<ul>
<li>not only as I get older I don't like big&nbsp; changes (<em>almost abandoned Firefox because of them</em>)</li><li>but also software is getting "dumbed down" loosing powerful features which were reason why I choose that software.</li><li>therefore I would to keep that option open</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>ban because of automatic backup</strong> - exactly this actually happened to Czech journalist Milos Cermak and I consider it serious risk against using those cloud thinks.</li></ul>
<p><span>Thanks for answers that'll hopefully help me decide wherever upgrade or stay with my Windows 7.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I've got</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 Home Premium SP1, FPP license</li><li>Truecrypt encrypted all drives - <strong>you should stop using this because even the developers of it said its no longer safe to use.</strong><br />
</li></ul>
<p>and my Questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>If I upgrade to Windows 10, will it be FPP (ie. stays with me forever)?<br />
</li></ol>
<p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM licenses </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the end user license agreement:</em></p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>17. TRANSFER TO ANOTHER COMPUTER. a. Software Other than Windows Anytime Upgrade. You may transfer the software and install it on another computer for your use. That computer becomes the licensed computer. You may not do so to share this license between
 computers. </p>
</span></span></span>
<ol>
<li>What happens to existing Win7 FPP license - will it stay active (ie. I so can dualboot on same machine or downgrade back to Win7 if I don't like Win10)?<br />
<strong>You can't dual boot with the license, because it was used as the base qualifying license for the free upgrade. After upgrading, you can no longer use it or dual boot with it.
<br />
</strong></li><li>Can I upgrade to Pro versions (Windows Anytime Upgrade never offered me upgrade)? For how much (both of them - I see upgrading Win7 as better, since it will carry to Win10)?<br />
<strong>Anytime Upgrade is no longer available. If you need Windows 10 Pro, you will need to purchase the Pro Pack for Windows 10 for $99 after upgrading to Windows 10 Home from Windows 7 Home Premium.
<br />
</strong></li><li>Can I upgrade to Windows 10 without decrypting harddrives (I like truecrypt since it is only encryption software with public audit)?<br />
<strong>Decrypting the hard drives is the first thing you should do before attempting to upgrade or they will not be accessible after upgrading.
<br />
</strong></li><li>Will you brick my computer and other connected devices - by banning my Live account - because OneDrive will automatically backup my Desktop, where I'do have among other files acts (my own work) and you just hate naked woman ("Code of Conduct")? Or is it
 issue only when such photos are shared with world (and even there should be warning first; if you connect OS to Live account, the damage is way more expensive)?<br />

<p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>

In this article, we take a look at backing up your files, specifically, we look at backing up manually. Recent versions of Windows include File History, which was introduced in Windows 8.0 in 2012 but based on my personal experience, it is not as thorough as Windows Easy Transfer which is no longer available or supported.

<p><span>Thank you Andre.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I like to play old games from time to time, which I verified to run under windows 7. Since my license will get invalidated by upgrade, I suppose I should wait until like May 2016 with upgrade.</span></p>
<p><span>Or get cheap OEM for Win10 to try them via dualboot and decide wherever it’s system for me and my software.
</span></p>
<p><span>While I like that FPP remains FPP, invalidating old one makes me sad. I would like to permanently move to Win10 only after I verify they work with all my software and that I understand them (<em>related question
</em><em>7 on bottom of reply</em>).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Open</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3) I probably should clarify this one more…</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Windows 10 carries OneDrive and its automatic backups, which will backup user data</span></li><li><span>OneDrive refers (or some EULAs it refers to refer) to Code of Conduct, which among others doesn’t allow storage of some files – i.e. pictures of naked woman (<em>adult ones, totally ok with Law</em>).<br />
CoC doesn’t make difference between storage (for my only) and sharing (accessible for others).
<span>&nbsp;</span>If such files are found on users OneDrives, they accounts are terminated.</span></li><li><span>Such ban on Live account would mean that Win10 computers is inaccessible (“bricked”) and other WinPhones, Xboxes… connected to same account too.</span></li><li><span>As amateur photographer I indeed do have some such pictures of my models in my Documents. And they would get automatically backed up with rest of my profile without me even knowing.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>So I’m afraid then when I install Win10 my computer will get bricked very soon, since OneDrive will upload forbidden content. I don’t want to delete those photos since it’s my hobby and it’s completely ok with Law and models.</span></p>
<p><span>My question is about statements above <strong>if I interpret them well,</strong> how to prevent them from happening (other than delete the data; I do however have them backed up elsewhere so backup by OneDrive is not necessary).</span></p>
<p><span>Or if <strong>I interpret them wrong</strong> and unshared backups for personal reasons are fine, as long as they comply with law (EU one, if that matters).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4) Your answer states, that all software shall be migrated. Shouldn’t that be also valid for truecrypt system drivers? I don’t mind to decrypt and re-encrypt after installation, but what other drivers could be so damaged by upgrade – raid drivers and
 alike?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>6) “<em>You should stop using this because even the developers of it said its no longer safe to use.”</em></span></p>
<p><span>They said (<em>supposing they weren’t forced to, but that’s something we probably would never know</em>) they won't develop solution further and that it's probably insecure. AFTER that statement, public audit was done over the source codes both from
 programming and cryptography points of views, where Truecrypt came clean.</span></p>
<p><span>This makes <strong>Truecrypt most secure encryption available solution for masses
</strong>(<em>at least I believe so</em>), since no other one achieved that. Truth is it won't be developed further, but that shall not be issue for current systems. Afterwards enough forks of Truecrypt shall be time-proven for decision what's best replacement.</span></p>
<p><span>But one <strong>question remains – is bitkeeper part of Win10 Home edition</strong>? (<em>might matter</em>
<em>for example if none of alternatives proves the best and bitkeeper won’t get hacked because of lowered security in meantime</em>).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>7) As I wrote third sentence in start of my reply I remembered about Insiders program. Can I use this program to learn with Windows 10 on separate disk while keeping my Windows 7 alive?</span></p>
<p><span>Can I also use copy of my Windows 7 installation to upgrade it to Windows 10 Insider (that variant where you can have Windows 10 for free, but you’re kept on “release candidate” version) over them to verify my software without actually sacrificing
 my Windows 7 license?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Again, thank you for your time.</span></p>

<h2>            HELP&#33; explorer.exe keeps crashing. &#91;Windows 10&#93;</h2>
                    About every 10 to 20 seconds explorer.exe causes my disk usage to reach 100% and subsequently crashes and restarts. I haven't been able to access my control panel, the app store, or windows explorer without it crashing and closing whatever it is I'm viewing.
 I've ended explorer.exe using task manager to see if it was something else that was causing the high disk usage but when I did that memory, disk, and CPU usage we're within a normal range.&nbsp;

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are facing performance issues with Windows 10. As per the issue description, it seems that the issue can be caused due to any third party software conflict. Hence, let's try the following methods and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Start computer in safe mode and then perform clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start computer in safe mode</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>a.</span></strong><span> When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong><em>Shift</em></strong> key when clicking the <strong><em>Restart</em></strong> button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>b.</span></strong><span> The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>c.</span></strong><span> Next, hit <strong><em>Advanced</em></strong> options followed by
<strong><em>Windows</em></strong> <strong><em>Startup</em></strong><em> <strong>Settings</strong></em> from the next screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>d.</span></strong><span> Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>F4 for Safe Mode </span></li><li><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking </span></li><li><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt </span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>For more information you may refer to the article mentioned below.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp; </span></strong><span>Perform Clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: <em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Run System Maintenance troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>W</strong>,&nbsp;type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong></p>
<p>Click <strong>System</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Security</strong> and click
<strong>System</strong> <strong>Maintenance</strong></p>
<p>When troubleshooter window appears click <strong>Next</strong> and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to perform SFC scan check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>System File Checker (SFC)</span></strong><span> is a utility in Microsoft Windows that allows users to scan for and restore corruptions in Windows system files. Perform System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;Press the <strong><span>Windows button + X</span></strong> on your keyboard, a mini dialogue box will appear.<br />
2.&nbsp;Choose Command Prompt (Admin). You must run the command prompt in Administrator level.<br />
3.&nbsp;On the command prompt type <strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong> and hit enter.<br />
4.&nbsp;If everything went okay and no errors were found, restart your computer and see if the issue re-occurs.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope the information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance. We will be happy to help.</span></span></p>

            <p>I just upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 today and am experiencing the explorer.exe crash issue about once a minute.
</p>
<p>The issue continued after the clean boot. The troubleshooter did not identify any issues nor did the sfc/scannow.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other posts, i have also seen suggestions to set up a new user account. I did that and still had the problem with that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue also occurs in safe mode.</p>
<p>I have also uninstalled the driver for display adapter Intel(R) HD Graphics 3000 and allowed windows update to provide a driver.
</p>
<p>Checked for updates none pending.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone point me to what to try next? </p>

<p>I tried something else first and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the explorer crashes also would stop control panel,&nbsp; i couldn't uninstall because it took too long to mouse to the app and uninstall.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I noticed START -SETTINGS -SYSTEM-APPS&nbsp; &amp; FEATURES allows an uninstall from a list of apps more quickly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So from there i uninstalled IDT Audio App. And all is well now.</p>

<h2>            Safe removal of hardware on computer running Windows 7 64-bit</h2>
                    On my new computer with windows 7 ultimate 64-bit, I can't deactivate any of my USB pendrives with the safe removal of hardware function. It inviariably says the drive is in use (not true). I have to shut the system down to remove the device -- not at
 all convenient. The same hardware can be&nbsp;deactivated without any problems on my laptop, which runs a 32-bit version of&nbsp;Win 7. How can I resolve this problem?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>You might face this issue usually if an application, file, open document, music or video file or any other application which is in use (running from the USB flash drive)
 when you try to remove it by clicking on the Safely Remove Hardware icon in the notification area.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This
<span>&nbsp;</span>can also be caused if your anti-virus is actively monitoring/scanning the USB drive. Normally, when removing a flash drive from a USB port, Windows should stop all the read-write operations on the drive so that it can be safely removed.
 If not, the flash drive can be damaged or data may be lost or corrupted. However, if Windows determines a file is in use, then it may provide a message which indicates the volume cannot be stopped right now.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So, before ejecting or disconnecting any mass storage device, make sure none of the above activities are performed on the mass storage device before ejecting.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Disconnecting a device</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Most USB devices can be removed and unplugged. When unplugging storage devices, such as USB flash drives, make sure that the computer has finished saving any information
 to the device before removing it. If the device has an activity light, wait for a few seconds after the light has finished flashing before unplugging it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you see the Safely Remove Hardware icon&nbsp;&nbsp;in the notification area on the right side of the taskbar, you can use this as an indication that devices have finished all
 operations in progress and are ready to be removed. Click the icon and you'll see a list of devices. Click the device that you want to remove. Windows will display a notification telling you it's safe to remove the device.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also</span><span> check Task
 manager to stop any processes used by the device.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Then open “Task Manager” ( Use Ctrl+Alt+Del )<br />
&nbsp;<br />
b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the task manager is launched click the Processes tab.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Examine the list of processes, if you find any process belonging to the drive or device, simply end all such processes.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
d)&nbsp;&nbsp; Try removing it now. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>

<h2>            Cant control Dish Network Joey </h2>
                    
<p>Will xbox one control Dish Network Joey receiver. I have tried manual setup on devices, and the Joey model receiver is not&nbsp;found.&nbsp;When I try&nbsp;automatic settings it never sends the proper power command and at the end it just says it knows how to talk to my
 device. After this it still will not change channels or power down. Will it work with Joey or am I just missing something???</p>

<p>So, DISH support will still tell you that the Joey does not have IR, which is false. Here is how you can get your Xbox one to control the Joey. This is the IR method. It should work via HDMI CEC, but for my setup it won't.</p>
<ul>
<li>On your Joey. Menu - Settings - Remote Manger - IR - enable </li><li>The IR receiver on the Joey&nbsp;is on the horizontal bar between the power button and system info button
</li><li>Plug an IR blaster into the IR port on your Xbox One </li><li>Tape the IR extender over the IR receiver on the Joey </li><li>Go into XBOX settings and select the Dish Joey as your receiver </li></ul>
<p>Controls should work!</p>

            <p>Hi RolyValintine,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize for not being able to respond to your query in a timely manner. It is my pleasure to assist you so that you may be able to use Windows Live Mail again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible that your Hotmail Calendar folder in Live Mail was corrupted. I would suggest that you rename your Calendar folder using these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Close Windows Live Mail, and any other Windows Live programs</p>
<p>2. Click <strong>Start</strong> (then Run for Windows XP), paste the following path and press Enter:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>%Localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Calendars</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Rename the folder of the account you use to sign in to Windows Live Mail to sync your calendar (ex. rename *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***).</p>
<p>4. Restart your computer for changes to take effect.</p>
<p>5. Launch Windows Live Mail again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this didn't&nbsp;work, it could be a contacts cache issue where Mail can't pull cache. You may refer to the links provided below for instructions on how to delete contacts cache:</p>
