<h2>            PLEASE bring pack Windows Photo Viewer.</h2>
                    The Photos app has been painfully slow for me no matter what kind of PC i'm using it's still takes 15 seconds to load a simple png or jpg file. Why don't you guys care about the customer and let us use Windows Photo Viewer, which is 100 times faster instead
 ? In the previous builds, Windows Photo Viewer was still there and i can change my default app to view pictures to it, but now it's gone. Nice job on making me wanting to switch to OS X :D.

                    <span>After Windows 10 update to v1709 on 15th November 2017, MSN Weather won't start. Tile on start menu is greyed out. Tried easy things like, wsreset.exe, resetting app, and reinstalling which don't mend. Starting program from the Windows Apps
 folder, results in message 'SharedLibrary.dll not found'. This is on Dell PC upgraded from Windows 8 through 8.1 to Windows 10. Am hoping Microsoft will investigate and be able to send out an update which will fix this! In the meantime has anyone else experienced
 this problem and/or have a fix?</span>

<p>Same problem here. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling from Store, but no luck, It just says "The app won't start. Check the Windows Store for more info about Weather." In Store it says "This app encountered a problem. Please reinstall to repair." And it
 goes on like this after reinstalling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

<p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sort of reassured it's not just my computer - on another thread it was suggested to use a Powershell DOS command to delete and reinstall all the apps. Wasted time trying that on another problem a year or so ago, and as the majority of applications are working
 I am not inclined to go down that road again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have changed permissions so can view the Programs\Windows Apps folder and when I click uninstall from the start menu tile, I am told the application has been removed - but the files are still there, so it would seem Windows 10 is not doing a clean uninstall,
 and possibly leaving behind stuff that is causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When installed again, the program won't launch and the Windows store suggests Reinstall. When Reinstall is clicked the install shows erratic numbers suggesting the install process is stuck in a loop and not working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When at work people could report such things, the IT department would log the problem and assign a problem number, and usually it would get fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see that you can do that with Microsoft products (someone please tell me if I am wrong), hence my post in this Windows forum hoping MS software engineers will at some stage pick this up and come up with a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a non technical customer, what I expect is when you click Uninstall one gets a clean uninstall, and if you run a Windows 10 Troubleshooter it finds the problem. Is that too much to expect!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft technical support are you reading this?</p>
<p>

<p>Yes i have started with the same problem at about the same time. Contacted Microsoft support twice on the second attempt they remotely reinstalled windows 10. Weather app still not responding?</p>

<p>Yes, I just updated a few days ago, February 2018. The app shows the same temp and time 24/7 but the weird thing is, it shows the right hourly forecast temps. Wondering if its a location thing? I have tried every possible solution offered by MS, even reinstalled
 windows. It's not our computers, its MSN. There's something wrong with the app itself. MSN weather was working perfectly before the update.

<h2>            Windows wont allow me to log onto account as hard drive is too full</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span>I have an HP510 laptop. It is a very old model, about 5 or 6 years old. It only has a 50 Gig hard drive and got full really fast. I’ve been using it for the past three years with under 100 Mb of space
 on it and it’s been working fine. I recently put some stuff on it and it then had only 8 Kb of free space on the drive left. I shut the computer down and the next time i started it up and tried to log into my account an error message came up saying there is
 too little space on drive C to start up. Windows then logged me into a temporary account. Unfortunately the temporary account won’t let me access any of my files and also won’t let me access most of the options in control panel. I used disk clean up to free
 up some space and managed to get 3.8 Gigs, I then ticked the “compress drive to save space" box on the properties window of the drive. I now have over 5 gigs of free space on the drive. However, windows keeps logging me back into the temporary account each
 time i try and log in. I’ve shut down my computer and restarted it many times and tried to log in but nothing works. When I try and log in with my usual account it doesn’t even give me any messages or anything, it just logs me straight into the temporary account.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I don’t want to format the drive as i have valuable information on the drive. i also don’t have the operating system<span>&nbsp;</span>disks. If anyone has had this happen to them before or knows
 how to solve this problem please leave a comment here or email me on *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</span></p>

<p>Sorry to hear about your problem. Must be frustrating.</p>
<p>Let us know the make and model of the PC and which version of XP (Home, Pro, or MCE) is running on it along with the Service Pack level. As well as the amount of RAM installed.</p>
<p>Are you able to boot into safe mode?</p>

This is by far the easiest fix.&nbsp;&nbsp; It works great.&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks like a lot of the people with this problem have SSD drives - could it be related?

            <p>Thanks for your suggestion.&nbsp; I tried this but the MiniTool&nbsp; won't let me 'extend' the partition because it says there is not enough space.&nbsp; There are three other 'partitions' between the boot and the C. drive which has&nbsp;well over a TB of free space.&nbsp; The
 tool won't let me move the three out of the way (or maybe I don't know how) so the *:ESP with one 10.01 MB of space left out of 500, and with FAT32 can't extend into the free space on the C; Drive.&nbsp; The other drives between these two are a *:DIAGS, of 40 MB
 size and 36 MB free; &nbsp;a *: (untitled) with 128 B (all used); and a Z: WINRETOOLS of 450 MB and 449 unused in NTFS.&nbsp; All of these partitions were installed by Microsoft.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the partitioning tools won't let me move, merge, or enlarge the *:ESP that is nearly totally full.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why should this be so hard?&nbsp; Do you think if I purchase Windows 10 Pro on&nbsp;discs that it would install properly?&nbsp; Maybe it's just the upgrade that is so complicated?&nbsp;
</p>

            <p>If you got the full version of Partition Wizard it allows you to batch operations. Get into its help system and explore the following operations.
</p>
<p>You will have to first shrink the partition with free space to unallocate&nbsp;space that you ultimately want to add to the Reserved System Partition. Then, before committing that change, you can actually use the UI to slid the now unallocated space around virtually
 on the disk to make it adjacent to the Reserved System Partiiton in the UI. Once it is adjacent (either immediately in front of or behind) the Reserved System Partition you should be able to tell Partition Wizard to extend/enlarge the Reserved System Partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to play around with it a bit to get the right set of operations. The "Undo" feature in the UI is very handy if you do something you want to change before actually committing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have it exactly the way you want it, you can "Apply" all the changes and Partition Wizard will apply all the necessary operations in one batch set, one after the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for buying a Windows 10 Upgrade, you could do that and reformat your drive from scratch but then you lose all you in place data and apps. Even with a backup -- Ugh!!</p>

            The thing about Partition Wizard--like the old Partition Magic--is that you can make things as complex or as simple as you like depending upon what is needed and one's level of expertise. For some person who is totally confused about that notice of "updating"
 the system reserved partition, they have a way to deal with that in a simple, generally successful manner.&nbsp; You chose a different route that worked for you, which is really cool.&nbsp; Now, if we can get Microsoft programmers to change UPDATE to ENLARGE, we'll
 be getting somewhere.

            Larry, I'm using Windows 8.1 and&nbsp; do not need Partition Wizard.&nbsp; I could do it using my control panel, go into administrative tools, and finally computer management.&nbsp; On the left pane, you see disk management and click it.&nbsp; Highlight your operating disk
 (usually C:) which is in your upper middle pane of the computer management window.&nbsp; On the bottom middle, you will see that disk highlighted.&nbsp; Off to the left, for me there is 100 Mb reserved and it's called DATA.&nbsp; In the highlighted disk, right click it and
 you'll find the submenu which includes "Shrink Volume."&nbsp; The only thing left is to find out how much&nbsp;I have to shrink it and add to the DATA partition; 100 Mb plus what in order to run Windows 10???&nbsp;

            I shrank the main partition to make room to expand the system reserve partition as described above.&nbsp; The unallocated space was ample.&nbsp; However, the disk management tool would not expand the system reserve partition.&nbsp; The expand choice was greyed out for
 the system reserver partition. I saw a could of posts that described command line approaches to do the expansion, but Partition Wizard was simpler and perhaps safer.&nbsp;

<p>Hi David, I am having exactly the same issue in being not able to expand *.ESP, even after freeing up unallocated space.
</p>
<p>Like others on this thread I also have an SSD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using MiniTool Partition Wizard Free. When you say "cleaned it correctly", how did you do that? Did that make the difference required? Were you using the paid version of Partition Wizard? I am loath to spend money when Win10 is free.</p>

<p><span><span>If the issue still persists, run the SFC:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>SFC scan would scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Open Command Prompt and select “<strong><span>Run as Administrator</span></strong>”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Type “<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>” without quotes and hit Enter.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue remains, Run
<strong><span>"DISM /Cleanup-Image" </span>
</strong>tool and then try to uninstall.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Open a Command prompt and run as administrator. </span>
</li><li>
<span>In the elevated command prompt, copy and paste the command below that you want to use.

            <p>now, I have got a solution. when I connected my printer to my laptop, it's setup is blocked by the windows. but after so many unsuccessful tries, I got an idea. From HP site, I have downloaded something called - "<span style="color: rgba(55, 55, 55, 1); font-weight: bold">HP
 LaserJet Full Feature Software and Driver" . </span>it's around 200MB. and there we go, it worked. I just followed the steps, and selected my printer model, it's driver get installed. thank god!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>steps:</p>
<p>1. google search hp drivers.</p>
<p>this will open up the driver database of HP site</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. now, it will ask you the product serial, or product number , or model number.</p>
<p>I had serial and model number but it didn't worked. then I entered the product number, it worked. you can find your printer product number behind it, adjacent to the port given for power supply. there would be many stickers on it. one of it says "product
 number"</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. it will automatically detect the operating system. now click on "go to all drivers"</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.from there you can download the complete suite. this suite also includes the videos for how to install your new printer, changing cartridges. from different tabs, we could install printer driver.</p>

    <title>MyAchievements rewards are useless - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MyAchievements rewards are useless</h2>
                    
<p>I think that the rewards for having certain amounts of Gamerscore is rediculous.I mean just look at it:</p>
<p>http://rewards.xbox.com/myachievements/</p>
<p>I can understand why people would want the first one which reads:</p>
<p>CONTENDER UNLOCKED! Here's your Reward:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Special Gift* during your birthday month </li></ul>
<p>The next one says:</p>
<div>
<p>LEGEND UNLOCKED! Here's your Reward:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Special Gift* during your birthday month<br />
<br />
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>2% Rebate on your Xbox LIVE Marketplace purchases EVERY MONTH** </li></ul>
I don`t understand why we would want " 2% Rebate on your Xbox LIVE Marketplace purchases EVERY MONTH**". I think we all know that we don`t buy marketplace content every month.we would probably only do that if it was a game like BF3 on MW3 for Content drops
 or BF Premium, but again they have special offers in themselves.</div>
<p>I wish Microsoft would do alot better than this like convert Gamerscore into MSP, obviously not 100%, but like 10%.For example if i have 50,000 Gamerscore into MSP that would be 5000 Microsoft points. Also, MSP are probably not a physical purchase when they
 are entered onto you account, they are Digital, so it doesent cost the company much to type 4 numerical digits into their computer, right?</p>
<p>I hope Microsoft will coment on this and see what they say.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time</p>
<p>HD</p>

<p>You purchase MSP with actual money, and spend them on the marketplace. If points are given away for free, MS is losing money from whatever you spend those points on.</p>

<p>Lycanine, the program is technically a free add on to your subscription, so don't expect massive discounts unless they release higher tiers, which would be nice, and a good marketing technique to increase gaming time.</p>

<p>to say microsofts own user base is twisting their arm into not letting them add a feature, due to their hacking skills, is absurd. the gamerscore, if i recall correctly, can be accessed inside an XML file, in the memory of a file located on the xbox HDD
 (or in some similar fashion) and if microsoft WANTED to expand into new ideas when it comes to their platform, they could just move this file into memory, on a server, and control access using a signed certificate or checking the authenticity against a hash
 value (for example). </p>
<p>honestly? its money. lostkauz was right about the fact they are NOT going to pay you to play. if you add up everybody's gamerscore, and took just a small fraction; if you took that number, and calculated how many dollars in MSP that is - it would be the
 very reason this never existed and never will.</p>
<p>besides probably having to patch the firmware, anything is easily possible, &nbsp;just not feasible.</p>
<p>even 25 cents from EACH xbla user ends up being a pretty large number for giving out each year.</p>
<p>you know, there are 40+ million xbl users right?</p>

<h2>            System is booting slowly after Windows 10 installation</h2>
                    <p>I just built a pc and tried installing windows 10 and I was not very successful with windows 10, it was running extremely slow so i had Microsoft support take control of my pc and find solution and there was 62 registry issues when i just installed windows
 10?. So i tried cleaning it by the delete all my files solution and it said it could not complete the action. Now when i try to boot windows 10 it turns to a black screen for about 30 sec then my pc restarts. I try'ed multiple times to boot off a flash drive
 with the software freshly installed on it and i get the same thing. My question is if i try to boot off of my flash drive but using windows 8.1 on it will it be harmful to my pc or will it go through the process where i can just install it and where it cleans
 my hard drive completely and then copy's itself to the hard drive? I only have one hard drive by the way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it would be harmful could i just by a new Hard drive and restart the process, I would prefer not to do this and have to spend the money but if its the only option i will. And please ask if any extra information is needed.&nbsp;</p>

            Had similar problem after upgrade to win 10 from 8.1. I have ssd cache drive with H97 chipset m/b, and went from 12 second boot in win 8.1 to &nbsp;over 100 seconds and sluggish system performance. Upgraded drivers with latest Intel RST and Intel chipset drivers
 to remove the Microsoft certified drivers that presumably came with win 10 and now down to 11 seconds. Your situation may be slightly different to mine, but may be worth considering. Yes, activating the fast boot in your bios settings and the fast boot hidden
 setting in power button options (explained everywhere in supposed fix tutorials on this issue), but the only thing that made the big difference was those 2 things above. Try that before doing repairs or clean installs that end up being a lot of work.

</p><p>Your response to that email will not be taken to any team to be worked on as it is an automated response from our system reminding you that you have credits that are about to go inactive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype Name of the account where the Skype Credits are about to expire is listed on the email you received and posted from us. If you're not familiar with the name listed on the email, it's most likely a different account than you're normally using.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it's a "live:xxxx" account, we can confirm that you're using a Microsoft account to access this account. Having said that, I strongly suggest you to log in to
<a href="https://web.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for Web</a> using your Microsoft account, then make a call or send an SMS to prevent your credits from getting inactive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If ever your credits go inactive, do not worry as you still can reactivate it by following the steps on this support article:&nbsp;https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10378/&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have no actual history of your situation but will attempt to provide some guidance that might help.&nbsp; As far as I can tell based off what you received, described. and Jomel_G wrote. you might have at least two or more Skype accounts. Credit is not transferred
 from one account to another unless you actually <a href="https://secure.skype.com/send-credit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
send that credit</a> to that other account (in 5, 10, or 20 AUD increments). As far as I know, account activity is any activity in which credit is consumed or purchased. Placing any call that does not consume credit like a Skype to Skype call or a toll-free
 number, would not constitute actual account activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. One account has a $20 AUD balance that you possibly abandoned by creating a new account.</p>
<p>2. One account that you last used on 6/6/18 (&lt; 180 days) which may not be the same account as the emailed account unless that usage was not credit consumption or a purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Based off the email - One account has a balance of $4.72 AUD that you have not consumed or purchased credit in a while (~&gt; 180 days).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This leads me to believe you need to determine which is which to recover the inactive credit. This appeared to be Jomel_G's point. When logged into any one of the potential accounts with inactive or lost credit, you can try the following with these direct
 links:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; <a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/settings/credit/reactivate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Reactivate credit</a>&nbsp;- If any inactive credit exists, it will reactivate it. If it does not, it will simply state your current balance for the account you are are signed into.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;<a href="https://secure.skype.com/wallet/account/orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Purchase history</a>&nbsp;- You can check all your purchases to ensure that past credit you purchased matches with the account you are signed into. If the specific purchase
 does not exist or line up with the history of your billing source, it was probably made under a different account.</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/usage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Usage history</a> - If credit was consumed on your account, lowering your balance, a record of that usage would be present here.<br />

<p>I have no problem with reading. I encourage you to take some time to re-read what I wrote and am writing now. I will attempt to point out your vagueness and confusion in your continued replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You vaguely stated multiple times that you last used Skype "to call". If it was anything but a credit-consuming<strong> Skype to telephone call</strong>, it would not have counted toward resetting your account 180-day inactivity timer. If it was, then
 it would count assuming this is the exact same account you used. A Skype to telephone call made under a different account, would only reset that account's 180-day inactivity timer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The email excerpt your provided states the Microsoft account: <em>edited by a moderator</em>. If you are using that account and the balance matches your current balance, and credit was consumed in less than 180 days, then you should not have received
 a generated email. If that 7 days has already passed and nothing happened to your credit, I would ignore that email. If your credit balance went from 4.72 to 0, I suggest you reactivate your credit using the direct link I am providing for a second time:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/settings/credit/reactivate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reactivate
 credit</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I have had an original Skype account for over a decade (i.e. no live: prefix). There has been no system change that forced my old account to disappear. If I created any new accounts on accident or purpose, they remain separate accounts with their own
 zero or positive credit balances. I continue to mainly use my original account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. If you left $20 AUD in an old account, it would remain there or deactivate in 180 days. If that is the case, you would need to sign into that old account, use the
<a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/settings/credit/reactivate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Reactivate credit</a><span>&nbsp;</span>link and transfer the credit to your current account, using the method I described in my previous reply. If this is the same account and you purchased new credit after 180+ days of inactivity,
 the <a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/settings/credit/reactivate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Reactivate credit</a><span>&nbsp;link may be able to restore that $20 AUD and append it to your current balance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. I have no idea what address you emailed. I hope it was not a scam site. The email you received is outbound only and&nbsp;does not route to any inbox. You could email it until the end of time and your emails would go nowhere.
 There is no email support for Skype. The only support that is offered&nbsp;is this Community and live chat support that is ticket-based. I am not fully versed on Skype's live chat helpdesk system, but I am aware of how support systems&nbsp;work in general. When working
 with someone over live chat, you might receive&nbsp;a helpdesk generated support-based email request. This might route to that specific&nbsp;agent for only a limited time. Continuing to reply to that email in the future, would be a waste of time. Had you had a prior
 live chat, you would have a support request number issued to you, that you could relay to any new agent you connect with, in the future.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are still confused and require assistance, I urge you to contact Skype Customer Service over live chat. Please be patient with them and do your best to explain the situation, so that they can help you. Please
 do not assume they know anything about your situation or have any prior emails you attempted&nbsp;to send to an address that does not accept incoming emails. You can try to reach them from the bottom of the
<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA1170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">live chat FAQ</a> page, or the image link below.</span></p>

 If that 7 days has already passed and nothing happened to your credit, I would ignore that email. If your credit balance went from 4.72 to 0, I suggest you reactivate your credit using the direct link I am providing for a second time:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/settings/credit/reactivate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reactivate
 credit</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I have had an original Skype account for over a decade (i.e. no live: prefix). There has been no system change that forced my old account to disappear. If I created any new accounts on accident or purpose, they remain separate accounts with their own
 zero or positive credit balances. I continue to mainly use my original account. </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. If you left $20 AUD in an old account, it would remain there or deactivate in 180 days. If that is the case, you would need to sign into that old account, use the
<a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/settings/credit/reactivate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Reactivate credit</a><span>&nbsp;</span>link and transfer the credit to your current account, using the method I described in my previous reply. If this is the same account and you purchased new credit after 180+ days of inactivity,
 the <a href="https://secure.skype.com/portal/settings/credit/reactivate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Reactivate credit</a><span>&nbsp;link may be able to restore that $20 AUD and append it to your current balance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. I have no idea what address you emailed. I hope it was not a scam site. The email you received is outbound only and&nbsp;does not route to any inbox. You could email it until the end of time and your emails would go nowhere.
 There is no email support for Skype. The only support that is offered&nbsp;is this Community and live chat support that is ticket-based. I am not fully versed on Skype's live chat helpdesk system, but I am aware of how support systems&nbsp;work in general. When working
 with someone over live chat, you might receive&nbsp;a helpdesk generated support-based email request. This might route to that specific&nbsp;agent for only a limited time. Continuing to reply to that email in the future, would be a waste of time. Had you had a prior
 live chat, you would have a support request number issued to you, that you could relay to any new agent you connect with, in the future.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are still confused and require assistance, I urge you to contact Skype Customer Service over live chat. Please be patient with them and do your best to explain the situation, so that they can help you. Please
 do not assume they know anything about your situation or have any prior emails you attempted&nbsp;to send to an address that does not accept incoming emails. You can try to reach them from the bottom of the
<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA1170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">live chat FAQ</a> page, or the image link below.</span></p>

<p>First of all Techfreak_ , I do not like your attitude. The way you communicate with your customers is absolutely disgusting and your behavior is unethical! I hope these messages are being monitored so that your company's managers can see how you deal with
 customers' problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of your "VAGUE" responses, I actually had to hire an IT person to deal with this. He spent about 3 hours going back and forth and found out that I have 2 accounts, one on my computer and and on my phone, and they both share the same email address
 and the same phone number !!!<strong>&nbsp;For as long as I have had Skype, I have only had ONE account.</strong>&nbsp;How come all of a sudden your system is showing me that I have two different accounts?! I am assuming that this happened when Microsoft bought over
 Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Account #1 on the computer (the IT man said that this must be the account that you are sending me emails about reactivation, that can not even reply to the email)</p>
<p>Username: <em>edited by a moderator</em></p>
<p>Email: <em>edited by a moderator</em></p>
<p>Phone number: +*<em>edited by a moderator</em></p>
<p>Credit Balance: AUD4.72 (purchased AUD5.00 on 22/01/2018)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Account #2 on the phone (the one I have always been using)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Username: <em>edited by a moderator</em></p>
<p>Email: <em>edited by a moderator</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Phone number: +<em>edited by a moderator</em></p>
<p>Credit Balance: AUD4.58 (purchased AUD5.00 on 06/06/2018)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The IT man followed your instructions and found it extremely difficult to navigate around your website. Your website is not user friendly at all!!! It is hard for us to communicate with you because we cannot email you directly, by replying to emails that
 you send. I am very disappointed.......The IT man has re-activated Account #1.&nbsp;<strong>So now I am asking you to merge these accounts and I want Account #2 to be the primary one, with a total credit of AUD9.30. + read further below.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never had 2 accounts for Skype only ever had 1 account !!!</p>
<p>The only way that we can see that happening is from when Microsoft acquired Skype and it ended up being an attachment to my hotmail account.</p>
<p>And when this happened spent over 10 hours following your instructions to transfer over the over $20 AUD credit that was associated with the original Skype account, and again going around in circles through your system to ask you to transfer it over, because
 the instructions that you sent at that time did not work.</p>
<p>So surely you can go through your own circle of systems to see that, and if you are a business of any ethics at all you will also&nbsp;<strong>add that existing credit to the one and only 1 skype account !!!</strong></p>
<p>When this transition happened no one even replied to our inquiries !!!</p>
<p>good to see now that someone is replying, although very rude and ignorant and bullish communication to a customer that pays for your existence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Why can you NOT see that there is 2 accounts both to the same email (<em>edited by a moderator</em>) and the same phone number (+<em>edited by a moderator</em>)???</p>

<p>Hello all,</p>

<strong>in their spare time</strong>, they are no Microsoft employees or agents. They have no record of previous communications you had with Microsoft and neither do many users here, since this is a Community but not a direct support source. Shall you need

 :-)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Two Microsoft accounts can't be merged to each other. You can only integrate a Skype account inside a Microsoft account. But each account is separated from one another and your two accounts can't share credit.</li><li>BUT! You can actually send credit from one account to other, like Teachfreak pointed out in his first message. Please
<a href="https://secure.skype.com/send-credit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click this link to do so</a> and send credit to the account you would like to use.</li><li>You can keep and use two or more accounts if you want.</li><li>If you just want to keep one of those accounts, send credit, send credit <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10220/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
and contacts</a>&nbsp;if you wish&nbsp;to the account you want to keep, and then, <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
delete the other account</a>&nbsp;you don't want to keep anymore.&nbsp;Make sure you are signed in to the account you want to close and that there is nothing left in it you may miss afterwards. Also, please note that when you close that particular account you'll no longer
 be able to sign in to other Microsoft products or services such as Outlook.com, Office Online, OneDrive, Xbox Live, or Windows linked to it.</li></ul>

<h2>            Minecraft Problem..</h2>
                    <p>So, I play on minecraft servers a lot, and, recently, it quit letting me join friends world, or any servers. It will lead forever and say "You need to authenticate to xbox live." Or "Unable to connect to world"..I've tried a lot of things, I've reset my wifi, and my phone, I've deleted it and reinstalled, I've tried it on another device, I've logged out and logged back in, I've also spoken with a virtual agent..Is there any way this could be fixed?</p>

<p>Hi there, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid nobody in the forums will be able to assist regarding enforcement related issues or questions.
</p>
<p>You will have to go to <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://enforcement.xbox.com</a> for any information and possible options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When an account is banned all on that account is lost and not eligible for a refund. Sorry</p>

<p>for some reason my whole post didnt display. Here's the thing. I have been able to connect untill just the other day. I use my phone and tether it as a modem. &nbsp;Cant really play any multiplayer cause of the slow conection but I can download game content.
 Anyway, I downloaded a movie for my daughter and was gonna play it on the 360. It said a media update is required to play content and I had to log onto Live and play again. Went to do that and my 360 couldnt log on. when I tested the connection it wouldnt
 even find my PC. I went to the troubleshooting on the site and it tried to have me assign an IP address, subnet mask, and gateway. It directed me to go through CMD and find it. I did. The gateway was 0.0.0.0 and when I went back to the 360 to put it in it
 specificly said the the gateway could not be 0.0.0.0. Now Im stuck.</p>

    <title>Regarding the Reliability Monitor&#47;Stability Index - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Regarding the Reliability Monitor&#47;Stability Index</h2>
                    Leaving aside any questions of just how the reliability monitor calculates the performance it measures (you certainly have to question the logic of giving equal weight to a failed web-page load to the crash of a system function, which the stability index
 seems to do), the redesign of the reliability monitor between Vista and Win7 seems to be a big step backward.<br />
<br />
As near as I can tell, there is no way to find out the numeric value of the stability index in Win7. At least in Vista you could see the numbers in addition to the graph.
<br />
<br />
While looking at a graph is nice (although I am disappointed in the new, minimalist, look of the graph) it would be preferable to be able to see the numeric value of the index as well.<br />
<br />
Any chance that the values will be available, or that they can be found in some other area of teh control panel?<br />

Description:<br />
Reliability Analysis calculated system stability of 3.143 for the one-day period starting at ‎2012‎-‎01‎-‎08T00:00:00.000000000Z.</p>
<p><br />
I find these reports extremely difficult to use to get better results. I have been monitoring these scores over a couple of months.
</p>
<p>In the past I just tried to eliminate error reports in the System and Application logs under Windows until I discovered these reports.&nbsp;In an effort to improve the Stabilty scores&nbsp;I started exploring &nbsp;the Applications and Services logs. I manage to find errors
 I previously knew nothing about and had some success in eliminating some but not all. However, the result is that I now have a lower score than when I started.</p>
<p>What puzzles me is that you can see incremental increases in the score day by day for a week or so and then the score dives for no obvious reason and you start again. My system performs reasonably well and I only have a few unresolved errors but once again
 I am back to a low score. This morning 3.143. On the 29 December it peaked at 9.227.</p>
<p>The only real persistent error is a Print Spooler error associated error for which I suspect there is not currently a solution. I cannot believe this error is having such a major impact on overall system stabilty.
</p>
<p>I started to explore the Reliability Monitor this morning but it is not easy to set up to to troubleshoot real issues. Any advice on where to start would be very welcome.</p>
