<h2>            Netflix crashes computer</h2>
                    Whenever I watch Netflix for a few minuets, my computer crashes are restarts.&nbsp; The screen turns blue, it makes a very loud noise, and it says there is a problem and has a :( face.&nbsp; This happens every time I watch Netflix.&nbsp; I don't know why it has been
 doing this.&nbsp; It started happening more frequently last month and now it restarts almost twice a day.

<h2>            Windows 10 pro upgrade problem from Lenovo Y530 win7pro 64bit laptop</h2>
                    <p>I have tried many suggestions given out here and have not succeeded yet with my&nbsp;Lenovo Y530 win7pro 64bit laptop. &nbsp;It came originally with Windows Vista but I bought Win 7 Pro and have installed to use it already many many years with no problem until I tried
 to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried almost more than a dozen times even to upgrade 8.1 as well before trying to windows 10, with similar errors. It quits when it reboots with the following errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2015-08-10 11:11:14, Error &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MOUPG &nbsp;CInstallUI::GetDefaultLanguage(1538): Result = 0x80070002[gle=0x00000002]<br />
2015-08-10 11:11:15, Error &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; MOUPG &nbsp;CSystemHelper::CheckConnectedStandby(642): Result = 0x80070057<br />
</p>
<p>At first I used to get the following error<br />
0xC1900101 - 0x20017<br />
The installation failed in SAFE_OS phase with an error during BOOT operation.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greately appreciated.</p>

<p>I found that the Y530 IdeaPad is an End-Of-Life unit. &nbsp;There is nothing that LENOVO has for it. &nbsp;Mine simply shuts off after the "LOADING FILES" screen finishes, when attempting to boot from a WINDOWS 10 Installation Thumb Drive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a routine to wipe everything off the HDD, but that was no help. &nbsp;I think there is a conflict/issue with the BIOS, but there are no updates or anything for it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking about installing LINUX Mint, but I'm more familiar with the commands/syntax available in the Command Prompt routine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or idea you might have would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>I have tried many suggestions given out here and have not succeeded yet with my&nbsp;Lenovo Y530 win7pro 64bit laptop. &nbsp;It came originally with Windows Vista but I bought Win 7 Pro and have installed to use it already many many years with no problem until I tried
 to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried almost more than a dozen times even to upgrade 8.1 as well before trying to windows 10, with similar errors. It quits when it reboots with the following errors.</p>

<p>I worked on this for over a month and since LENOVO will not provide updated drivers for the Y530, you are wasting your time!</p>

Either scrap the box, or install a version of LINUX.&nbsp; That is the only solution.</p>

            Not the ONLY solution.&nbsp; Go back to the one that works ... Windows 7.&nbsp; I'm actually trying to find a new Win7Pro to install on my Vista box.&nbsp; It's a great machine but Vista is stone.cold.dead as far as MS is concerned.&nbsp; 7 remains viable for another 2-3
 years.<br />

<h2>            File Explorer won&#39;t let me delete files in Windows 10</h2>
                    I couldn't find my situation is other posts. I copied a bunch of files from an SD drive to my hard drive and a flash drive. I tried to delete the files and clicked on "show recycle confirmation". Then the Delete "X" grayed out and I couldn't delete the
 files. I have restarted my computer. I reset everything to default clicking on the program in the control panel. I was deleting files fine and dandy until I clicked on the recycle confirmation. I didn't mean to, I was tired and has a lazy hand. Everything
 I was deleting prior to that wasn't going to the recycling bin, it was going to cyber-nirvana.

I've contacted Microsoft chat support 3 times, I filled out 5 surveys, I've followed the support guide twice, and I've even uninstalled the game. nothing has worked. I figured i'd post one last time to find a solution before I call Microsoft support and yell
 for about 3 hours</div>

<p>Its one of those bugs dude, where it will eventually end up fixing itself, but can take a long time to do so. I've heard of it taking months to unlock, so that is not all that strange. It just seems to be that game where it seems to take forever to tick
 over</p>
<p>You've honestly tried everything we have to offer though, and I think support will probably tell you the same thing :( What "The Dude" posted, is the solution that Xbox Staff have provided in the Halo MCC achievement bug thread, so make sure you've done
 all that thoroughly, as that has the best chance of fixing the issue for you.</p>

<p>Hey there Killsafe! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are running into these issues.&nbsp;I would recommend attempting to perform a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Soft Factory reset (Reset and keep games and apps</a>.) Unfortunately at the moment there is an
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Active Service Alert</a> that is affecting Xbox Live Core Services which could give you a hard time when trying to Add the account back on the set up.
</p>
<p>So again, I would recommend going through those steps once the Service Alert has been resolved this way we don't have any issues when setting up the console again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps! </p>

    <title>Does anyone else have this problem with 30 fps games ... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> w0lfenstein666  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does anyone else have this problem with 30 fps games ...</h2>
                    
<p>Since I've upgraded to a big screen 600hz plasma I've noticed that 60 fps games (Rage, All the Call Of Dutys) look absolutely great, but every single game&nbsp;that runs at 30&nbsp;frames per second looks atrocious. What I mean by this is that if you play a game like
 Skyrim (30fps)&nbsp;and stand still everything around you looks sharp and crystal clear, but if you pan the camera around it gets a juddery double image effect to the point that you can't read the letters on a sign.</p>
<p>This is a new problem to me as I've been gaming on a CRT Sony Wega for years and everything looked fine. After doing some research online I've since discovered that&nbsp;this juddery effect is&nbsp;a problem related to a 30 frames per second output going into a 60hz
 display device. This makes sense to me because if I hook my PC up to my current tv and play Fallout 3 at 60 FPS everything looks fine but if I cap the graphics at 30 FPS it turns all juddery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The part that really bothers me is when other people claim not to have the same problem and don't know what I'm talking about. This was kind of explained to me in that older tv's with various refresh rates other than 60hz do a better job at masking the
 motion juddering just due to the timing of their refresh rates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I've also encountered people who know what I'm talking about and say it's a major drag because 90% of their games are 30 fps and become almost unplayable, but they just learn to live with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I know it's not a faulty tv I have or a problem related to the specific model. I've spent hours in the stores with my 360 testing out EVERY 60+ inch tv on the market. Samsung, Panasonic, LG. They all had this awful motion juddering when playing 30 fps games.
 At one store I had three sales people walking around with me testing every unit and they could all see the problem and agreed it looked terrible. One Panasonic model had a "Motion Smoothing" feature that completely eliminated the screen juddering but when
 it was activated it also created an extreme level of response lag making aiming just ridiculous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Does anyone else know what I'm talking about? I do have really sharp vision and my eyes are extra sensitive to things like frame rate and fidelity, I also know I was gaming on a CRT for many years and plasma can't really match it in some ways. But Damn,
 it's disappointing that even new games like Dead Space 3 or Dishonored are just unpayable for me now on my 360.</p>

<p>Yeah it's really noticeable to me on any HD 60hz+ display I use. Really a trade off between fidelity and frame rate. It's best to lock it at 30 frames per second if you know you're going to be doing below 60 often. Just the games running on older hardware
 that is the 360. Call of Duty is basically a supped up quake 3 engine, and Rage was amazing because Carmack set a goal for it to run at 60 fps on the consoles which took a ton of effort other developers don't have time implement. Just be glad that hopefully
 this year you can buy a console that actually runs games at 1080 at 60 fps. One last game Star Wars The Force Unleashed 2 had &nbsp;this amazingly complicated frame doubling system to make it seen like the game was running at 60 fps. Should look up the technical
 paper. Amazing tech but a pretty awful game.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If the game is fun I eventually tune out the limits of the hardware and just enjoy the game.</p>

<p>Sounds to me like you already have your mind made up. You know it's not your system and you know it's not your tv. Clearly the problem lies in the video game being 30 FPS as you don't have these problems with 60 FPS games. I'm not sure what your question
 is. Your post sounded more like a rant than a question. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The answer is yes. Everyone has that problem with 30 FPS games because that's the nature of the beast. Or they just dont notice it or care about it like you do. The new systems have already said that all games will run on a minimum of 60 FPS so your sensitive
 eyes should be good next gen. </p>

<p>[quote user="W0LFENSTEIN666"]Since I've upgraded to a big screen 600hz plasma I've noticed that 60 fps games (Rage, All the Call Of Dutys) look absolutely great, but every single game&nbsp;that runs at 30&nbsp;frames per second looks atrocious. What I mean by this
 is that if you play a game like Skyrim (30fps)&nbsp;and stand still everything around you looks sharp and crystal clear, but if you pan the camera around it gets a juddery double image effect to the point that you can't read the letters on a sign.[/quote]You have
 motion compensation enabled. Set your TV to whatever Game mode it has and disable any smoothing or flow or whatever the TV has enabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had the exact same thing happen on my 55" LED LCD TV. Turned on Game mode and the problem disappeared.[quote]After doing some research online I've since discovered that&nbsp;this juddery effect is&nbsp;a problem related to a 30 frames per second output going into
 a 60hz display device.[/quote]it's not.[quote]This makes sense to me because if I hook my PC up to my current tv and play Fallout 3 at 60 FPS everything looks fine but if I cap the graphics at 30 FPS it turns all juddery.[/quote]It's more likely the PC input
 on the TV has no motion compensation enabled by default.</p>

<p>Its not motion compensation he has, but the subfield drive of 600hz makes it so 10 cell pulses per frame are possible in a 60 fps game such as call of duty which equates to an even 10*60=600 and games look smooth as it was intended on the panel. Since 30*10
 is what other games would mostly be, this only equates to 300hz which is below main refresh rates on plasma's (480hz and 600hz).</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Again, its NOT motion compensation, but think of it as a bigger field for frames to be fed into. This is why apart from CRT, Plasma has the next to best motion performance of any current Digital display. There's nothing you can do to disable this because
 this is the technology Plasma displays are built on (probably why its so costly too).</p>

<p>The explanation is simpler still.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Traditional CRT screens flickered. As the picture was drawn on screen, it quickly started fading out again before the next picture was drawn. The persistence of vision in the eye negated some of the flicker, but it was still enough that the eye was purged
 of each picture pretty fast. As a result, 60 fps games appeared super smooth and 30 fps games appeared fairly smooth.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>LCDs, as well as plasmas with higher drive rates as MDA mentioned, lack this flicker. This means each picture stays on the retina for longer and causes them to stack up. When there is little to no motion blur as in many games, the pictures don't flow together
 very well and you see the individual frames overlapping, and motion appears juddery.</p>

<p>Subfield drive refers to the pulses required to keep the pixels in the panel lit. There is absolutely no synchronization between the subfield drive of a plasma panel and the framerate of a game.[quote]Again, its NOT motion compensation,[/quote]It is. It's
 the TV attempting to&nbsp;interpolate frames&nbsp;that aren't there using predictive algorithms that don't work&nbsp;for gaming. This causes frames that the 360 never generated to&nbsp;be displayed by the TV. It thinks one type of frame will be sent next, interpolates a few to
 fit between, then gets slammed back to reality when the next real frame is sent from the 360. It looks like a flipbook that someone flips forward for 10 pages, then skips back five pages and flips forward from again.[quote user="Zacabeb"]The explanation is
 simpler still.[/quote]What you just described is "tearing", or the effect one observes when a portion of the next frame in queue overwrites a portion of the framebuffer at the same time the 360 is&nbsp;transmitting the framebuffer to the display device. The double

<p>-</p>
<p>I understand the whole meaning of it as a "trick" for displaying faster motion, but it has synchronization between the game's framerate and the panel because if it doesn't fit into the "trick". 60hz*10 pulses for Call of Duty games with the motion compensation
 ON would equate to the illusion of 600hz. Take a 30fps/hz game * 10 pulses =300hz and it doesn't fit the whole field of 600hz and you get "judder" as what the OP stated that was wrong with other games VS call of duty.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>So i guess if you're using it (and yes you should disable it if possible, like you mentioned) then playing a 60fps game would make a big difference from a 30 fps one. (but of course, you will take the time to refute my answer so now i wait.)</p>

<p>[quote user="HAY HAY Its MDA"]I understand the whole meaning of it as a "trick" for displaying faster motion, but it has synchronization between the game's framerate and the panel[/quote]A game's frame rate is how often the game can create a new framebuffer.
 This varies quite a bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The frame rate that&nbsp;the 360's HANA&nbsp;sends images to a display device is a fixed value determined by either negotiation with the display device or by manual configuration. If the 360 and the display negotiate and decide on 1080p60, then the 360 sends a frame
 every 1/60th of a second to the display device. This is a fixed interval. It does not vary.[quote]Take a 30fps/hz game * 10 pulses =300hz[/quote]If the game has a hard frame rate cap of 30 FPS, the 360 does not send just 30 frames per second to the TV. It
 still sends 60 frames per second, the TV just gets the same framebuffer from the 360 twice in succession. It's like filling a 60 page flipbook with duplicates of every image in succession. Page 1 has image A. Page 2 has image A. Page 3 has image B. Page 4
 has image B.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The subfield drive of a plasma display (and they're now up to 2500hz or 3000hz on the latest Panasonic plasmas) is only there to keep the display lit. While the TV can do fancy tricks with it (interpolation), the 360 has no knowledge of any of that. All
 the 360's display hardware does is send a frame at a regular interval.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is judder, it's the TV causing it.</p>

<p>Well i know, its not 30 hz (it still shows 1080@60p when playing any game) and i meant it by 30 fps in a 60 hz window is going to be smoother than 30 fps in a 30hz window since its 30hz is not native refresh rate of the screen.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>However, even with 30fps in 60hz (and then multiplied by the plasma rate 10 pulses per frame) you're getting uneven-ness and there will be judder caused by the TV of course. This is what I mean by synchronization because its not that the Xbox 360 communicates
 with the TV on how to send its frames to the TV, but how the Xbox 360 is sending its frames in a fixed interval, that is making the TV judder.</p>

<p>Wow. Thanks for the replies. I'm glad to hear from some experts here.</p>
<p>If it makes a difference, with my current tv I have no Motion Compensation features enabled ... but I think the Samsung 8000 series has it buit in by default. It can't be disabled. I'm aware of game mode and have always had it off.</p>
<p>I've spent many weeks trying to tweak all of the settings and there's nothing that even remotely fixes the amount of juddering I get from 30 fps games and also from blu-ray and dvd playback ... which is 24 fps I think.</p>
<p>There is no button right under my nose that I'm forgetting to toggle.</p>
<p>I hate to rant here and I'm not this picky about anything else, but I'm serious about gaming and I'm really suprised how bad 30 fps games look on a big screen plasma. I also find it hard to believe that everyone else plays on these tv's and has no problem.
 It boggles my mind when someone says " Nope, no problem. No judder here." </p>
<p>The other day I tried to play Bad Company 2's campaign but anytime I panned the camera around it was like a giant earthqauke shaking everything around me. It's really bad and I don't know how anyone could play like that.</p>
<p>It's not just the current tv I'm using.</p>
<p>Since january I've had in my living room 4 big screen tv's.</p>
<p>Samsung 60 E530</p>
<p>Samsung 60 E550</p>
<p>Panasonic 65 ST50</p>
<p>(all returned ... Future Shop hates me)</p>
<p>And now Samsung 64 E8000.</p>
<p>The Panasonic ST50 had a 'Motion Smoothing' feature that when enabled COMPLETELY removed the juddering effect. I could look around in Fallout or Skyrim and everything was just perfect and rock solid.</p>
<p>But it created so much lag that aiming was thrown off completely. If you aimed back and forth really fast, your crosshairs would always be on the opposite side of the sticks. If that makes sense. With the ST50 you could not enable Game Mode and Motion Smoothing
 at the same time. That probably would have been perfect.</p>
<p>Does anyone here game on a plasma set that is other than 60hz or 600hz? Is the motion any better on a lower refresh rate?</p>
<p>Thanks again for the replies and any advice.</p>

=====================================<br />
Apparently you imported a video clip that is not compatible <br />
with Movie Maker...possibly an .mpeg file. Anyway...the<br />
solution is to convert the clip to the .wmv format before<br />
importing it into Movie maker.<br />
<br />
The following freeware can do the conversion:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Format Factory<br />
<a href="http://www.pcfreetime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcfreetime.com/</a><br />
(FWIW...you may want to uncheck<br />
all the boxes on the final screen)<br />
<br />
After downloading and installing Format Factory...<br />
open the program and choose an Output Folder...<br />
(this is where you will find your files after they are<br />
converted)<br />
<br />
Drag/drop your video clips onto the main screen...<br />
<br />
Select 'All to WMV' / OK...<br />
<br />
Click...Start...on the toolbar...<br />
<br />
That should do it...<br />
<br />
Good luck...<br />

<h3> 2-cold  say:</h3>
<h2>            Apps disappeared after System Restore</h2>
                    I was playing games on my PC and my game crashed to the point where I couldn't do anything, not even Ctrl+Alt+Delete, so I decided to switch off the computer using the power button. While starting back up Windows decided to install some updates, which
 failed a few times and after some time my PC finally turned on. At this stage I realised that I couldn't open my start menu and I got a critical error saying that my Start Menu isn't working. I tried a few things to fix it but nothing worked so I decided to
 do a System Restore which restored my system 3 days back. My start menu opened now but all the default Windows apps are gone and only the apps that I installed stayed. For example the Calculator app which I previously had pinned to the start menu is not there.
 When I try to search for it Windows doesn't find it. I can't even find the Store app. After messing about in the settings I managed to open the Store and tried to download the Calculator app only to learn that it's already install

<div>&nbsp;My operating system is Windows 7. When I first brought this computer Windows Calendar 10 reminder worked. It would come on at the time I set it to alert me of my appointment. I reinstalled the program but it still won't come on. I have Microsoft Office
 2007 on my computer. I thought Microsoft Office 2007 was the problem. So, I uninstalled it and it still didn't remind me of my appointments. Is there an update that would reactivate my reminders.</div>

            Windows 7 doesn't include a Calendar. Is this a 3rd party tool?

            Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />(Not applicable to you) 
<br />What you need to do is to grab the key using any Software like Showkey Plus, uninstall that key from older PC and use it on another computer. 
<br />
<br />Download Showkey Plus: 
<br />www.thewindowsclub.com/showkeyplus-product-key-finder
<br />
<br />Uninstall the key
<br /><a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-windows-10-and-change-the-product-key/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-deactivate-wind...</a> 
<br />
<br />Use the key by Showkey Plus on the newer computer. 
<br />(Not applicable to you ends)
<br />Alternatively, there are two more options available other than this: 
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/405170...</a>
<br />
<br />Use the Activation troubleshooter on the new PC signed in with same MS account. 
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. 
<br />Select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

Under Windows 7, users do not have write access to these System folders:<br />
- c:\Windows<br />
- c:\Program Files<br />

The recommended data storage location is the folder %ProgramData% (for general use) or the folder %UserProfile% (for user-specific use).<br />

<h2>            I get an error code 800F0289 while installing Windows 7 Service Pack 1.</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Trying to download and install&nbsp;the update Widows 7 SP1 for Windows 7 based 64-bit system&nbsp;from Microsoft, got, &nbsp;after the install, &nbsp;error code"800F0829".</p>
<p>Tried all kind of fixes.. even the iso download copied to a&nbsp;CD disc...after the disc installed the codes, the disk was ready to install that update....but a message came up telling me : "&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 ".</p>
<p>Now&nbsp;I, on purpose left out the message.....because the message kind of, indirectly gave an idea of what&nbsp;the answer to the&nbsp;problem at hand was.</p>
<p>This laptop I was working on was not mine. A resident here in my Apartment complex asked me to fix it because it was slow and had no anti virus installed....so first I installed my " Favorite Microsoft antivirus " which is free by the way "!!! then&nbsp;cleaned
 up all the junk files, cookies, registry and other things. Then I proceeded to get&nbsp;updates from the Microsoft update site......to my disbelief this person only had no more than 4 or 5 updates installed. Microsoft BOMBARDED me&nbsp; with HUNDREDS of updates to install
 up to the point of this " Windows 7 SP1 update. ". After&nbsp; I guessed what the problem was....I just hidden that update and continued to update until Microsoft had more updates for me to install.</p>
<p>Now I am going to give you&nbsp;a clue : The laptop is an HP and the&nbsp;power charger is an Intel.</p>
<p>Now lets play......can any one out there knows ( Microsoft Employees&nbsp;or&nbsp;in related functions with Microsoft are excluded. )&nbsp;what the problem was, that was bringing up that error code&nbsp;800F0829&nbsp;?.</p>
<p>After 10 replies .....if no one has guessed the problem..... I will give you the answer to what the message that came up was telling me?.... and the correct&nbsp;answer to&nbsp;the actual real problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>If you receive Windows Update error <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
800f0829</span>, it means that your computer is running on battery power. This update cannot be installed while your computer is running on battery power. Connect your computer to an electrical outlet and try to install this update again.</p>

            <p>Mr. Jose you are correct! This was the message that I was receiving......but you are only half way to the correct answers... in my post I also ask&nbsp; " can anyone out there knows what the problem was, that was</p>
<p>bringing up that error code 800F0829 ?. "</p>
<p>In the first place I should not have received this message, &nbsp;telling me the correct answer you just sent me,</p>
<p>the message should have been different (or the error code should have been&nbsp;different than the one I was receiving&nbsp;).</p>
<p>Of course this laptop runs on battery power and the battery charger cord is connected to an electrical</p>
<p>outlet and to the laptop....that little battery icon in the right lower section of the taskbar....shows me that</p>
<p>&nbsp;the battery is charging.</p>
<p>So can you guess what the real problem was ?.... apparently " Microsoft could not !!!. because they were sending me the wrong error code.....and there is an answer to that problem.... and I will&nbsp;reveal the answer</p>
<p>&nbsp;in due time.</p>

<p><br />
I'm going to give you the answer now :</p>
<p>Some updates or programs, before they install themselves. run a check of your computer, and if they</p>
<p>find something(s) not up to par or not compatible, will not install.... and give you a reason why.</p>
<p>In this case error code 800F0829. In is reply " Jose "&nbsp;gave us the correct meaning of " 800F0829 ".</p>
<p>I also forgot in my original post to mention.....&nbsp;while trying to update the bios on this HP laptop, I received the same error code, and other programs before installing themselves, reminded me to make sure that my battery charger is on, connected to the
 electrical outlet during the install or update.</p>
<p>Now all HP laptops sold have their own " HP CHAGERS ".</p>
<p>In the clue I gave I mentioned that the charger was an ' INTEL " charger. This charger was not really</p>
<p>indicating in the lower right corner of the taskbar,&nbsp;what the batteries&nbsp; charging % was, it simply was</p>
<p>showing the % of the remaining power.</p>
<p>The updates I was trying to install, during their pre-install checkup, could not detect that this HP</p>
<p>laptop was actually charging...thus resulting in this error code.</p>
<p>I called the person that I was fixing this laptop for and asked him where did he purchased this laptop?.</p>
<p>He purchased it.... on line....from a person he did not know...( BIG MISTAKE!!!! ), and of course he did not notice that the charger was not and HP charger.</p>
<p>I called a friend of mine who has a small computer shop, here in Atlanta .GA. and gave him the part</p>
<p>number of the charger for this particular HP laptop ( got the part # from HP and online computer</p>
<p>part stores ) and asked him if by any chance....in is backroom piles of computers goodies, he would have this charger. He promised to call me back if he has it. He had it....drove to his store....charge me</p>
<p>$5.00 for it, asked him for a receipt ( to get my money back from this laptop owner ).</p>
<p>Plugged it in...and yes...now it was saying in the task bar " Charging " Updated the Bios and the
</p>
<p>windows 7 SP1....with no problems.</p>

            <p>Pa Bear,</p>
<p>&nbsp;when some one brings me an already infected computer to fix , the first question I ask them is.....</p>
<p>when did you notice that your computer was infected ? ( referring to the date or day when this happen ),</p>
<p>when I get an answer ...I then check if there&nbsp;is any restore points available or backups ....I prefer restore</p>
<p>points than the weekly backup because it to could be already infected. I find a lots of&nbsp;computer owners that do not know about &nbsp;the system restore, and when I look at their restore point (dates )....some of them have 4
</p>
<p>or more months of restore point. I usually choose&nbsp;the restore point that's one to one and a half week older prior&nbsp;to when the owner of the computer noticed that he may have an infected system. I then restore their
</p>
<p>system with no problem.</p>
<p>Now&nbsp;in answer to your question.....yes you can install any anti-virus/spyware programs on an already</p>
<p>infected system....but before you download the program you must first uninstall the present protection</p>
<p>program you are using. Then download the new protection program, install it&nbsp;and, &nbsp;run the updates for that</p>
<p>protection program.. then run the newly installed and updated anti-virus program.</p>
<p>Speaking for myself...I prefer the MSE anti-virus/anti-malware program....it&nbsp;may not have all the fancy</p>
<p>stuff that other Anti-virus application have, but he is super fast at catching viruses, spyware, malware, and</p>
<p>I have used it many...many times to clean up other peoples infected computers. I think it"s the best and it"s free. Now they are other methods for cleaning up infected system...it would take a&nbsp; long time&nbsp;here for me to describe to you all the methods that
 I also use ( if needed )....some computers are easy to disinfect and </p>
<p>some are more difficult to disinfect..( that"s when I use other methods ! ).</p>
<p>Also, I never had a MSE anti-virus application that installed itself improperly.</p>
<p>And thank for the &nbsp;"TechNet Microsoft link " you put up...but I don't need to go there . I manage pretty&nbsp;well on my own in the cleaning of infected computers.</p>
<p>Best Regards.</p>

<h2>            Probl&#38;&#35;232&#59;me NAT modere sur numericable modem netgear cbvg834g</h2>
                    Voila je vous expose mon problème: Avant je disposais dune seule Xbox avec les nat ouvert.(jusque là no problem). Désormais il y a 2 xbox360 sur le réseaux: 1 Xbox branché par ethernet et la 2ieme en wifi. Notre configuration est la suivante: connexion
 30mega numericable. Modem: NetGear cbvg834g. Le problème maintenant c'est que la première Xbox qui se connectera au Xbox live sera en NAT ouvert et la seconde quand à elle aura les Nat modéré. J'aimerais bien avoir les 2 Xbox en nat ouvert si c'est possible.
 Je n'ai pas encore touché aux ports etc... Je tiens à vous dire que j'arrive à rentrer dans l'interface du routeur, mais une fois dedans, je n'y comprends rien pour ouvrir des ports ou je ne sais pas quoi!? Si quelqu'un a des connaissances pour régler mon
 problème, où si cela vient des ports et que quelqu'un connait l'interface du routeur netgear cbvg834g de numericable, je vous en supplie venez moi en aide !! Merci. Contactez moi sur le forum ou sur le live kkShi Xx o

<p>Konichiwa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Il va falloir effectivement déclarer les ports à ouvrir pour les deux consoles, le principe n'est pas trés compliqué il faut :</p>
<ol>
<li>Attribuer une adresse IP fixe à chaque console. </li><li>Déclarer les ports 88 et 3074 pour chaque console (adresse IP). </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ne possédant pas le même routeur que toi, je ne connais pas les menus d'administration mais tu devrais trouver sans problème sur le web le tuto ad' hoc pour configurer les ports sur un NetGear.</p>

<p>J'ai trouvé des choses effectivement sur internet, mais elles ne sont pas précises, j'aurai besoin de la démarche à suivre de manière bien détaillé, ou aller, ou clicher, que faire... En tout cas merci d'avoir répondu, j'espère que quelqu'un qui a le même
 modem que moi, pourra m'aider. Merci</p>
