            Ok. I would remove any installed software and drivers you have installed already and try that download again:
<br />
<br />
<br />You may manually uninstall the printer software from the add/remove wizard.
<br />Press Windows + R and type appwiz.cpl and click on OK.
<br />Uninstall the programs associated with printer.
<br />In addition to that, remove the driver manually.
<br />Press Windows + R and type devmgmt.msc and click on OK.
<br />Expand the categories and look for your printer.
<br />Right click on it and select uninstall
<br />Make sure to keep a check on te box which says, delete drivers.
<br />Restart the PC and check

<h2>            Dell Os Recovery &#38; Restore USB Key won&#39;t install OS &#40;Win 8 64 bit&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Bought a Dell inspiron 15 about a year and a half ago, 6 months in, the hard drive fried, they sent me a new one. Right before the warranty expired, motherboard fried. They sent a repair tech to my house to replace it and he gave me a OS R&amp;R USB Key to reload
 OS, etc. The computer had 8 when I bought it, but the key he gave me had 8.1 on it. I did the install myself and pulled it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple days ago the hard drive I had already replaced fried. I decided to go solid state because mechanical drives weren't handling all the moving around I have to do. I got a 500 G Samsung and installed it and computer recognizes it in BIOS, but when
 I plug in the USB Key I choose the EFI 1 PATH 1 boot option and it goes through the R&amp;R Process Overview and gets to the drive diagnostic step and restarts. Restarts at same point every time and I've let it do that 3 three times and it never gets any farther.
 Any suggestions to get it to install and/or what the problem is?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Laggy matchmaking</h2>
                    Alright so I have been looking around and don't think it's a problem sight the new halo 4 servers. I started playing matchmaking again and am having a huge amount of lag. Like 500ms ping. My Internet speed is average 28 down and 1-1.3 up. Ping is at 51ms.
 It is wireless. I can do wired it'd just be a hassle. I have century link Internet. Annnnnd yeah. I start playing a halo game but its really jumpy. Like I run forward and jump 20 feet to the right. It also happens in borderlands 2 as well. Can I please get
 some help?

<p>Hi, Wired is better than Wireless, So if you haven't already, Make sure you give that a try, it may improve the situation.</p>
<p>Also, are you using a shared connection (as in others using a computer/another console) as I've spoken to friends that have extreme lagg when others are on the network.</p>
<p>Also, As I'm still awaiting my copy of halo, Is there a section where you can check your connection? (Halo reach had it in the pause menu) check that your NAT settings are OPEN. (If you're unsure on how to open you NAT, you can contact your ISP and they
 should be able to advise you on how to do so with your Router)</p>

<p>Your ping and speed doesn't matter at all. &nbsp;Microsoft's servers are entirely culpable for speed problems. &nbsp;It's been obvious to me over the course of the past year I've have Gold.</p>
<p>Halo 4. &nbsp;How is it I can shoot another player directly in the head more than 7 times and he DOESN'T die. &nbsp;Whereas he can shoot my character 2 times and it's dead?</p>
<p>Xbox is a joke. &nbsp;We pay good money for it but it lets us down constantly. &nbsp;I'm looking for a professional grade server system with excellent quality games. &nbsp;Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            I cant play spades on msn games</h2>
                    Its nice to at least know that I'm not the only one.&nbsp; Up to a few days ago, spades was my relaxation.&nbsp; But since the new site has become active, that's not the case.&nbsp; Ive been really patient with Microsoft, but its getting really frustrating now... I cant
 play the only game I do like to play which is Spades. I can get in, I can make an avatar and every now and then I can play a game for a minute or so before I'm disconnected and have to start over again. Ive gone thru all the steps to resolve this problem that
 I can find (which are not nearly enough or detailed enough for "Edge"), Ive sat infront of my computer for hours just to walk away frustrated and upset and still not play my game.&nbsp; I'm wondering why as users we get sent thru all these useless steps when its
 just, as easy, no easier&nbsp;for Microsoft to fix their own mistakes... or are they not able to fix their own mess

            how about just fixing the problem and not deflecting from the issue by posing inane questions to the people posting here...the issue is "DISCONNECTION DURING PLAY" that this person posted at the beginning of January...and here it is almost the end of February
 and I for one am still having this issue...SINCE DECEMBER!!!...you don't need any more information than that...browse other boards and it may enlighten you as to how many of us are experiencing the same issue and are totally frustrated by nothing being done
 about it...since you like to ask questions to gather more information, how about giving us more information by answering us as to whether you and your peers actually get paid for what you do?...meanwhile I'll just continue getting my Spades fix from Yahoo
 Games.

<h3> derekwoolfall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Movie Maker 2.6</h2>
                    <p>Why does Microsoft tout Windows Live Movie Maker??&nbsp; The Vista version was great - and since my Vista box bust I now have Windows7, and am using WMM 2.6, which is similar to V-WMM, but does not accept projects.&nbsp;&nbsp; I agree with Darcy 2 that all clips relating
 to a single subject should be in one collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have yet to ind anyone who likes Windows Live - it is so much less user-friendly, and seems to be missing Timeline.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to import .VOB files from old home movie DVD's (analog) into V-WMM by changing the file extension to .MPG, and it was duck soup.&nbsp;&nbsp; Importing into 2.6 gives me a clip with no picture!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I now import the MPG into WLWM then save it as WMV and
 import to 2.6 - what a hassle -thanks Bill and Company!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to match title fonts to what I used before, but since I have no Vista projects left (my hard drive kaput), I would like to see sample fonts in one easy to see screen - instead of trying every one listed!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I admit I have not searched web for
 this, but trying to find HELP relevant to WMM 2.6 seems to be impossible.</p>

</p><p>I just installed Windows 10 Version 1803 OSBuild 17134.81&nbsp; When did Updates for Windows 10 Home start adding "Build" numbers?&nbsp; What does the OSbuild number refer to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can explain the OSBuild is for. Why it's included in Updates suddenly.&nbsp; Does it mean I have the Windows Insider Program?&nbsp; Why is Microsoft making all of these version changes in less than 6 months?&nbsp; I still feel like whole new version update
 are being made before most people have an opportunity to get familiar with any of the Windows 10 changes before Microsoft forces entirely new versions onto our computers.</p>

            Hi Ruth, the big update last month was full of bugs and Microsoft are pushing out minor updates to resolve those bugs.
<br />
<br />Rest assured, you are not on an insider program, every update to Windows 10 comes with a Build No. since the first version of Windows 10 was released (Build No. 10240.17861)

description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<p>You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own<br />
Product Key. It has to be the same 32 or 64 BIT OEM version of Vista. Also the System<br />
maker will usually sell the disk cheap since you already own Windows. Be sure to do a<br />
good backup or 3 (safety in redundancy).</p>

<h2>            File transfer windows 10 to windows 10 using backup and restore</h2>
                    I have a PC running W7 and plan to buy a new PC in a few days with W10 preinstalled. In order to transfer files &amp; settings (not applications) I am proposing to upgrade the W7 PC to W10, then backup files &amp; settings on the old PC with the intention of restoring
 those files &amp; settings on the new PC. Does this seem a reasonable plan?

            HP wireless printers can either connect over a local wireless network directly to your computer or -- for certain models -- over the Internet ("HP ePrint").<br />
<br />
AFAIK, the Photosmart C309 is not ePrint enabled, although there is one sub-model of the C309 that apparently has a "mobile ePrint app" but not the full ePrint capability.&nbsp; What do you mean by "it can't connect over the web."&nbsp; Please clarify.&nbsp; Does your printer
 have its own email address so that you can you send it a document to be printed via email?<br />
<br />
I suspect that you can't connect to your printer over your own local wireless network.&nbsp; This is a quite common occurrence, especially if while your printer has been powered off you connected additional devices to your wireless network, even temporarily.<br />
<br />
For diagnostic purposes, please do the following:<br />
<br />
You posted your question in a Windows 7 forum, so the following directions assume that you are using Windows 7.<br />
<br />
On the computer<br />
<ul>
<li>Go to Devices and Printers, right click on the icon for your HP printer, and select "Printer properties."</li><li>Click the "Ports" tab</li><li>DO NOT click <b>IN</b> the list.&nbsp; One of the items will be highlighted and have the box on the left checked.&nbsp; If necessary, use the scroll bar on the right and/or click and drag the faint vertical bars in the header row, and report the information in the
 "Port," "Description," and "Printer" columns.</li><li>Click Cancel to exit the properties window and close Devices and Printers</li></ul>
On the printer, print a wireless network test page and report the IP address of the printer<br />
<ol>
<li>
<div>Press the Setup button (<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fh10025.www1.hp.com%2fewfrf-JAVA%2fDoc%2fimages%2f546%2fc01461502.gif" /> ) on the front of the product.</div>
</li><li>
<div>Press the Down Arrow button (<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fh10025.www1.hp.com%2fewfrf-JAVA%2fDoc%2fimages%2f589%2fc00718778.gif" /> ) to highlight

<div>&nbsp;HC Photosmart C309a series and the IP address is 192.168.1.6 &nbsp;I don't think it has its own email address (to my knowledge) I bought the printer used and didn't get any manuals with it. Trouble shoot it, this is what it says:&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9f60b58-4b27-49c0-bbbf-f77d3c92e078" /></div>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I assume that when you write that "the IP address is 192.168.1.6" you're referring to the IP address of the printer, as shown in the "network test report" that you printed using the controls on the front of the printer.<br />
<br />
I wasn't clear.&nbsp; You need to expand the "Ports" column so that you can see the entire entry.&nbsp; Here's what it looks like when you first look at it:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3df370be67-96fc-4530-be1e-2853764b119d" /><br />
<br />
If you place the mouse over the vertical line in the header row between "Port" and "Description" (where the red circle is in the image below), the mouse cursor changes to a double-headed arrow.&nbsp; Press the left mouse button and drag the vertical line to the
 right, which will enlarge the column so you can see the entire address, as shown below:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3dc5640e06-82cb-4480-9bb4-344945101ecf" /><br />
<br />
The IP address configured in the printer (which for you is 192.168.1.6) must be the same as the port IP address that the computer is using to send print jobs.&nbsp; It is very likely than when you drag the column separator to the right, you'll find out the the computer
 is configured to use a port with an IP address of 192.168.1.x where x is <b>NOT</b> 6.<br />
<br />
You can temporarily fix this situation be click the "Configure Port" button, which will get you to the following screen.&nbsp; Enter the IP address from the printer's "network test report" into "Printer Name or IP Address" box and OK your way out.<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3de8c6bb16-a374-48fb-ad0a-d5d0222e1a89" /><br />
<br />
The reason this problem occurs is that in most home networks, each device connected to the network (e.g., your computer, your printer, your smart phone, etc.) is automatically assigned an IP address by your router.&nbsp; If you turn off the printer, the router will
 recognize that the IP address assigned to the printer is not in use and may assign that same address to some other device.&nbsp; Then when you turn the printer back on, the router assigns the printer a new IP address.&nbsp; The problem is that the Windows printing system
 is ignorant of all this, and is still using the originally-assigned IP address.<br />
<br />
The solution to this problem is to configure the printer with a "static" or fixed IP address and then manually configure that address in the "Configure Ports" screen as above.&nbsp; I'm still looking in the User Guide for exact instructions.<br />

<div>Ok, so I changed the Printer Name/ IP Address to the one that matched the network test report. does this have to match the Port name? &nbsp;It would not let me change that. I tried to print a test page after I changed this and still no luck. Do I need to reboot
 anything to get it to take effect? I SO Appreciate all of your help!!&nbsp;</div>

            I hadn't noticed that before, but you're correct:&nbsp; the "Port name" doesn't change to match the new IP address.&nbsp; Nevertheless, changing the IP address so that it matched the one configured in the printer should have worked as soon as you clicked OK.&nbsp; No
 reboot is needed.<br />
<br />
I did notice that in the printer troubleshooter report you posted that the second error shows that the printer is turned off.&nbsp; I don't know how the troubleshooter comes to that conclusion if it can't detect the printer over the network (which is the first error).&nbsp;
 Do you have the printer connected to the computer via USB as well as wireless?<br />
<br />
I'm at a bit of loss here, but you might try the following:<br />
<ol>
<li>Disconnect any USB cable from the printer<br />
</li><li>Using the printer's front panel controls/display (or the "network test page"), ensure that the wireless capability is turned on; make a note of the printer's IP address (presumably, still 192.168.1.6)<br />
</li><li>Go to the Ports tab in Printer properties as before and click on the "Add Port" button</li><li>Select "Standard TCP/IP Port" and click "New Port"&nbsp;</li><li>Read the opening screen of the Add Standard TCP/IP Port Wizard and click Next</li><li>Enter the printer's IP address (192.168.1.6) in the "Printer Name or IP Address" box.&nbsp; The "Port Name" box will automatically be filled with the same name as you type.</li><li>Click Next.&nbsp; <br />
At this point, Windows will attempt to find a device at the IP address you just typed.&nbsp; If all goes well, the printer will be detected and you can finish the Wizard.&nbsp; Once the port has been created, you can select it (on the Ports tab of the Printer properties
 dialog) so that the correct port is associated with the printer.<br />
<br />
If nothing happens within a reasonable time after you click Next, that means that a network connection could not be made to the printer -- for a reason OTHER THAN an incorrect IP address.&nbsp; Assuming that you use your laptop's wireless capability to connect to
 your router and then to the Internet, the most likely problem is that the printer's wireless adapter isn't working.<br />
<br />
Most HP wireless printers have a built-in web server, so one way to test the printer's ability to communicate over the wireless network is to open a web browser on your computer (e.g., Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, etc.) and type in the printer's IP address
 (192.168.1.6).&nbsp; If a web page opens with the printer's information, then the printer is working properly.<br />
<br />
If the browser can't find anything at the printer's IP address, to allow for the unlikely possibility that this printer doesn't have a built-in web server, open a Command Prompt window (Search for cmd.exe and press Enter) and type<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ping 192.168.1.6&nbsp; {press Enter}<br />
The results of the ping operation will indicate whether the printer could be successfully reached over the network or not.<br />
<br />

            Everything looks OK in the images that you provided.&nbsp; It does appear, however, that you are getting low on ink.&nbsp; I don't know enough about these particular HP printers to know if the X over the yellow ink cartridge means that it's completely empty or what
 the ? over the black cartridge means.&nbsp; More importantly, I don't know if the printer will refuse to print at all if the black cartridge orone of the color cartridges is empty.<br />
<br />
What does happen when you try to print?&nbsp; Does the printer head move and does a piece of paper eventually get ejected, just with nothing printed on it?&nbsp; Or does the printer just sit there and not make any noises?<br />
<br />
Did you determine the printer's IP address from the front panel screen or did you print a Network Report?&nbsp; Have you printed a Print Quality Report?&nbsp; If not, see this --&gt;
<a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;objectID=c01624986" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;objectID=c01624986</a>&nbsp; Also see page 78 and following of the manual for your printer here --&gt;
<a href="http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c01856408.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10032.www1.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c01856408.pdf</a><br />
<br />
If the Print Quality report doesn't print, I suspect that it's either because the black cartridge needs to be replaced or the print heads are clogged because the printer hasn't been used for a long time.<br />
<br />
To clean the print heads, see page 92 of the manual.&nbsp; This process depends on various HP software being installed on your computer, and in my experience, that software is not always present.&nbsp; If you're unable to follow the directions at page 92, see the "solution"
 here --&gt; <a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Other-Printing-Questions/HP-6500-Office-jet-E709a-Black-printer-cartridge-HP-920-not/m-p/447545#M28623" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

It would work but requires 2 gigs of ram for itself.&nbsp; If you are running 64 bit that requires a minimum of 2 gigs for itself, so if you only have 4 gigs you might run out.<br />

    <title>Calendar for Windows 10 default account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seanwaters  say:</h3>
<h2>            Calendar for Windows 10 default account</h2>
                    <p>I use Outlook 365, but I often find it convenient to enter appointments through Calendar for Windows 10 (C4W10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set up my own Outlook account to work with C4W10 and I can see appointments that I put in to Outlook on C4W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I put an appointment in using C4W10 I have to select the account that I want it to be saved in. &nbsp;I have the option to select my Outlook account, but C4W10 defaults to 'Microsoft Account' and, if I forget to select the Outlook account, the appointment
 does not show in Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not need the 'Microsoft Account' that C4W10 defaults to so I would like to be able to remove it entirely or at the very least make my Outlook account the default account so that I do not lose appointments if I forget to make the correct selection. &nbsp;As
 a distant third option I would settle, if I had to, for being able to display my 'Microsoft Account' appointments from C4W10 in Outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, in order of importance:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Can I remove the 'Microsoft Account' from C4W10?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 1.a. Is there a way to migrate all appointments entered in the default 'Microsoft Account' to another account, or does it have to be done manually?</p>
<p>2. Can I change the default account on C4W10 to my own Outlook account?</p>
<p>3. Can I display my 'Microsoft Account' from C4W10 in Outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For clarification I log in to my computer using my Outlook account, so that is the default user account for the entire computer, but hat does not appear to be the account that the default C4W10 'Microsoft Account' uses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your patience.&nbsp; I have looked at the link and read:</p>

</p><p>I think I am trying to turn off the default email account (which is presumably being used for default Calendar entries), but when I follow the link, it gives me this:</p>

</p><p>What I need to be able to do is get at the account that was set up when I got Windows 10 and either delete it or switch it off: I do not use it, whatever it is.&nbsp; There seems to be no way to do this.</p>

            Then, all you have to do is to remove all the accounts and then re-add the account that you want to set as default.

<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description I understand that all the desktop icons on your computer has changed to WMP (Windows Media Player).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Sometimes this issue appears when the .LNK files stop working. LNK is Windows Shortcut file which links to a program, file or directory. This type of file creates a link to a program or application, from another location. These
 files are used as placeholders for executable and other files and are usually placed on computer desktop or start menu.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">When you click on the shortcut it is like clicking on the .EXE file itself which the lnk file is pointing to and the associated program should start and run. Some known related errors to .LNK files are that they stop working due
 to the underlying .EXE file-type association in the registry often by some form of anti-malware program improperly changing the registry or else the registry key value become corrupt. In this scenario it could quite be possible that the registry got incorrectly
 modified when you tried playing DVD.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You may try changing the file association from the Control Panel and check if the icons on your computer appear normal and you are able to open the exe files.<br />

            Hi Celena.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There are tips here for managing smaller drives including 32gb drives: 
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the Spring Creators Version 1803 since successfully installing it when released in the next few days will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place.
<br />
<br />Track release of Version 1803 here:  <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />Once the new version is released install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the  Upgrade Assistant  has already been installed by WIndows Update then I'd remove it and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

            Hi Celena, that model has a 32GB eMMC chip on the motherboard as internal storage which is not up-gradable
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of Windows 10 - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything ! 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>Some computer makers, including Dell and HP,&nbsp;put a recovery partition on the hard disk of new computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;By pressing a special key combination when the computer starts, you can use the recovery partition to restore the computer to the way it was when it
 was new.<br />
<br />
Windows 7 has assigned a drive letter to the recovery partition, but nothing in the system will access it, and it doesn't matter that it's almost full.<br />
<br />
I recommend that you remove the drive letter from the recovery partition:<br />
<br />
1. Click the <strong>Start</strong> button.<br />
2. Type <strong>diskmgmt.msc</strong> in the <strong>Search</strong> box and press
<strong>Enter</strong> .<br />
3. In the<em> Disk Management</em> window, right-click the recovery partition.<br />
4. Click <strong>Change Drive Letter and Paths</strong> .<br />
5. Click <strong>Remove</strong> .</p>

            I tried this, but it does not show a sign out feature.&nbsp; I only see Your account, Xbox Membership, Xbox Music Pass, Manage Music Devices, Redeem Code, Manage Payment Options, etc.&nbsp; There is no SIGN OUT feature.&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp; I was trying to sign in with
 my Xbox Live account but the computer assigned me a new one.

            Come on Microsoft!&nbsp; I've read elsewhere to just sign out and sign in with a different account, then create a new user account and assign the new user account to the xbox account you want.&nbsp; This is ridiculous.&nbsp; If this were an answer to an enterprise type
 of issue for corporate users then it would be the demise of the OS.&nbsp;

            <p>I think this option only works if you have tied your "Windows 8 login account" to&nbsp;a Microsoft mail address.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Man, this sign in/out problem in that xbox-app, it is only one problem to be solved in the quest of changing my son's age in some account so that he can use Skype.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will now let my son run without any (software assisting) parental control, and I am so tired of the task to make my son able to use Skype that I will advise everybody to stay away from Windows 8. There's soooo many "beginner problems" with new software
 lacking tons of functionality both in the pc and the phone versions of that OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft I do not appreciate your products these days...</p>

            I eventually found a solution.&nbsp; When I was setting up Windows, I entered my Hotmail address for my initial account. Windows 8 was pleased that I did that and linked itself to that account. It downloaded my picture and used it as my profile picture. What
 I did not know is that it became linked to that account and automagically signed me in. The sign me out part is not an option from that point forward.
<br />
<br />
If you go to settings, there is an option to unlink your account from hotmail. When you unlink your account, THEN you are given the option to log out of your account.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps other with similar problems<br />

            OK this is the issue
<div><br />
<div>1. Are you logging into your computer with a Microsoft account ex: *** Email address is removed for privacy *** or are you doing it with just a name like John</div>
<div><br />
<div>If it is @live.com you will not be able to sign out. microsoft is not allowing you to have multiple emails on your live account that signed into during the lock screen</div>
<div><br />
<div>to fix this, go to from start menu (sorry this is how i got there. i know there is an easier way but i am not windows 8 literate)</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>right click on your picture upper right corner&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>click on account picture</div>
<div><br />
<div>click user&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>under the first section click on the first grey box it should say change account or something&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>go thru the process then add a new name/profile&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>(again i apologize of the crappy explanation)</div>
<div><br />
<div>NOW</div>
<div><br />
<div>when you sign in you can sign in and out of &nbsp;your xbox live GT.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>infact you can sign in under one microsoft account on xbox live, then one on people/messaging</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps&nbsp;</div>

            Hi Tadasha<br />
<br />
It does not work, I tried every step above. All I did is watch a video of the internet and it open the Xbox and now there is no option to close it. I tried signing up so I could log out, there is no log out or sign out option. It is always on my screen. I can
 choose other screen, but it is always available, and comes back to full screen as I scroll in the middle of my screen. Very strange.
<br />
<br />
Do you have any other hints?<br />
<br />
Thx<br />
<br />
Guylaine<br />

<h2>            Vista 32-bit to Windows 10 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, so its time to upgrade my PC. I built this thing years ago and it currently runs Vista 32-bit os. Obviously I know I cannot utilize the Win10 upgrade service, but thats fine. I figured what I would do is just buy a newer, larger hard drive and purchase
 a fresh copy of Win10 to install.<br />
</p>
<p>Current System:</p>
<p>Vista Home Premium 32-bit SP2</p>
<p>Core 2 Quad Q9300 2.5ghz CPU</p>
<p>4gb RAM (DDR2?)</p>
<p>GeForce GTX 260 graphics card</p>
<p>150gb hard drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will I have any issues with the other current hardware going from the 32-bit Vista os to say a new 64-bit Win10 os? Not trying to buy a whole new PC, just would like to get a bigger, better hard drive and cleanly install Win10 if its possible. Thanks in
 advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>-AK</p>

            <p>It meets the minimum requirements, but based on the age of the CPU, it might not be capable of running 64 bit Windows 10, so you will have to stick with the 32 bit version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To install Windows 10 on your PC, the processor (CPU) must support the following features: Physical Address Extension (PAE), NX, and SSE2. Most CPUs have support for these features, so if you receive this error, it is likely because the NX feature is not
 enabled on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer does support these extensions, you could still try using ISO media. In some instances, you might have to switch from your current architecture,&nbsp; 64 to 32 bit since these requirements mostly affect installation of 64 bit Windows 10:</p>

<h2>            Parallel Port Issue</h2>
                    We were using kind of software which uses a key lock ( which is connected to parallel port ) , we added new machines in our company,i.e HP3330 mt. which does not have Parallel port on motherboard. The problem starts here, Even after installing Add on Parallel
 port &amp; installing required driver, after running the programs,it gives an error " Key lock not found". Can this problem will solve by using USB parallel port?

<p>You mean that you purchased a discrete add-in card to provide a parallel port?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examine the device manager to see what parallel ports are available in your PC and what their status is...</p>

<li>Click Start</li><li>Click Run</li><li>Type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and hit enter</li><li>Expand (click +) the Ports (COM &amp; LPT) section</li></ul>
<p>Please reply with the information about your parallel (printer)&nbsp;ports.&nbsp;Is there more than one?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is it means that although there may be no physical socket, your mainboard has the capability to add one via a ribbon cable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that is the case there are two options...</p>
<ol>
<li>Configure your software to use the new LPT port (probably LPT2) not LPT1.</li><li>Remove the add-in card and replace with a ribbon cable from the mainboard to a back plate incorporating a parallel socket. You should be able to purchase this from th same place you purchased the add-in card.</li></ol>
<p>Tricky</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: 3rd option if you have 2 LPT ports: Disable the mainboard's port in BIOS, uninstall the add-in card and its drivers. Re-install the add in card and it should get given LPT1.</p>
