            Short answer is that you first need to activate win 7. Also the free upgrade period is over

    <title>Message to those of you who boot teammates for accidental betrayals. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> firebomb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Message to those of you who boot teammates for accidental betrayals.</h2>
                    
<p>So, I'm gonna rant, and if someone doesn't like it, tough. I'm so sick of some of these idiots that play Halo: Reach online. I am not the type of player that betrays teammates on purpose. It's immature and unsportsman-like. I play the game the way it's SUPPOSSED
 to be played....killing the <em>other</em> team. However, sometimes mistakes or accidents happen, and betrayals happen. But why is it when I
<em>accidentally</em> betray a teammate, I almost ALWAYS get booted for it?! Yet when I have a teammate killing me in Big Team Battle because I took the sniper/rocket/vehicle he wanted, I NEVER get the option to boot said teammate.</p>

<p>Twice tonight I accidentally betrayed a teammate and BOTH times I got booted. The first time I tossed a grenade into a few people on the other team, and an idiot teammate ran into it, betrayal, I got the boot. The second time, I'm shooting rockets at two
 people on the other team. The first rocket hits the first enemy. The second hits the second enemy, and kills the teammate who, by the way, DROPPED OUT OF THE SKY FROM A PELICAN IN FRONT OF ME. Instant boot. I'm so sick of people not thinking about it BEFORE
 hitting the X button.</p>

<p>I realize it's a game, but sometimes I just don't enjoy playing online because most people I get matched with are idiots, to say the least.
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">All I'm asking is PLEASE, if you get betrayed by someone, think about the circumstances of the betrayal BEFORE hitting the button. If there's a frantic firefight going on and a teammate accidentally kills you
 with, say, a stray grenade, don't be a jerk and boot the guy.</span></strong> If he's standing in front of you, with a sniper to your face with no one around and kills you,
<em>then </em>he deserves it. We all paid $60 for this game and would all like to get enjoyment from it without getting pissed at teammates who boot without thinking, or teammates who purposefully betray others for any reason. You being a jerk and booting a
 teammate for a betrayal that's CLEARLY either YOUR fault (running in front of his rocket for instance) or just a plain ol' accident, effects their earned credits and enjoyment from the game. Lastly, it's not ALL of you. Many people in the community play fair
 and don't boot 'just because they can'. I don't. I think about it for a second before I decide to do so, if I even get the option to. So this post isn't directed at everyone. Regardless, please do us all a favor, and think before you boot! Thanks!

<p>Only $60 ?! </p>
<p>It costs about $100 here! (...and seeing as our $ is close to parity with the US$ we get so ripped off. A 1yr gold subscription here costs about $80 too).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Anyhow, on with the original theme....</p>
<p>Accidental betrayals (?) happen a lot in grifball too, but I've never been given a boot option (there probably isn't one in that game for that reason).</p>
<p>SWAT is another one where it happens a lot too, but with one shot kills and many players propensity to run into the firing line, what can you expect.</p>
<p>I've read that the option is given on the performance of the player as well. eg: how many time over what period they betray, etc. How correct that is I don't know.</p>

<p>I rarely boot unless it happens a few times. However...this is going to sound awful-if the person that betrayed has like 1 kill halfway or more into the game and just keeps dying, I will boot just to get rid of him.

<p>Yeah, that's pretty mean. &nbsp;I'll assume though that you've put yourself in thier shoes and decided that were it you, you're hoping somebody boots you after an accidental betrayal for having a bad game. &nbsp;Do you quit when you're losing really badly aswell?

<p>Actually, yes. Typically, if I keep dying and I'm doing horribly and not helping, I think it's best if I just leave the game. And I only do it when it seems they've never played the game before. I'm not just talking they are negative. But -10+ is a bit hard
 to take. </p>

<p>Having that large of a negative implies that a player would be <em>trying</em> to go negative, griefing his team in other words. &nbsp;That's not how you put it earlier. &nbsp;You said "one kill halfway or more through the game" will get them booted by you.&nbsp; One is
 a hardline stance on people that aren't&nbsp;pulling their weight in the game due to skill level while the other is just something anybody who plays regularly would try to do to a player that was trying to lose the game on purpose.&nbsp; I know you see the difference
 that's why you changed your reasoning behind your actions.&nbsp; So what your trying to say is that you'll boot anybody that you think deserves it as much as&nbsp;any of us probably would.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What I mean is, I'm usually not a jerk, but sometimes I am. If a player has one kill or so halfway through the game and keeps running in and dying, thus being like -10 or more, AND I get the boot option..I'm probably going to take it. It's just too easy.
 If there are mitigating circumstances, however, I might not do it. Like if the person is a friend or is talking and seems to be nice. &nbsp;I've been booted before, but it's not a big deal to me. &nbsp;It's easy enough just to start another game.

    <title>When recording webcam video with Windows Live Movie Maker, screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paganini2012  say:</h3>
<h2>            When recording webcam video with Windows Live Movie Maker, screen stays black</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Life Cam Studio. &nbsp;It works fine using LifeCam Studio software (terrible, because I have to settle for low sound quality since they didn't put the option for alternate audio input), and it also works in facebook (better, because it allows me to
 use alternate audio). &nbsp;However, when I use Windows Live Movie Maker (the best option available considering terrible software support for the product), it recognizes that the webcam is there, but the screen stays black. &nbsp;The blue light goes on the camera, but
 the screen stays black and I can't save anything.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way I can use this preferred free software (Windows Live Movie Maker) with my webcam? &nbsp;I don't want to have to pay money for special video software to do something so simple.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running Windows 7 Pro x64. &nbsp;I have never had so much trouble with a webcam.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

            <p>Hi, &nbsp; </p>
<p>It's possible you are experiencing this issue because the Movie Maker and video card driver version you are using&nbsp;are outdated.</p>
<p>For initial troubleshooting, we suggest you do the following: &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;Ensure you have installed the latest version of Windows Live Movie Maker:</strong>
</p>
<p>a. The current 2011 QFE3 version: 15.4.3555.0308. Download <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here.</a></p>
<p>b. Windows Live Movie Maker is not supported on Windows XP &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Ensure that your video card drivers are up to date</strong> - Movie Maker makes extensive use of the video card GPU (graphics processing unit). The display driver affects the reliability, performance, and compatibility of the video card with different
 software To determine the version and video card driver date, run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool (dxdiag): &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DirectX Diagnostic Tool </strong></p>
<p>a. Click on Start button and type “dxdiag” in the Search programs and files box and press Enter key on the keyboard.
</p>
<p>b. Click on the Display tab and you will see the driver details including the driver version.
</p>
<p>c.&nbsp; If your video card driver seems outdated please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.&nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us</a>

</p>
<p><a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://downloadcenter.intel.com/</a> &nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case issue persists, we request you provide us Movie Maker log files for further investigation:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-program/how-to-gather-log-files-for-windows-live-movie/7a47f98c-5d51-4cc9-94db-073ee1320fd3">How to gather Log files for Windows Live Movie Maker and Windows Live Photo Gallery</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After gathering the necessary logs, please upload the files via the private message I've opened for you.</p>

<h3> jennster  say:</h3>
<h2>            refresh desktop icons automatically</h2>
                    
<p>I use two icons for my recycle bin - empty and full.&nbsp; They do not refresh automatically.&nbsp; I have to hit the refresh button to get them to change.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; When I put something in recycle bin I have an icon that lets me know there is something there.&nbsp; When
 I empty recycle bin it shows a different icon.&nbsp; Now when I empty recycle bin it shows it is still full (shows the full icon).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Your Microsoft order of Windows 10 Pro&#8207; &#40;But without Product - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryan paing  say:</h3>
<h2>            Your Microsoft order of Windows 10 Pro&#8207; &#40;But without Product Key&#41; &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have upgraded Windows 10 Pro from Windows 10 Home Edition on Sep 16, 2015 and I received confirmation email from Microsoft. I did not receive Product Key but the order confirmation email with Order ID. I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro from "Add features to
 Windows 10" in Control Panel. So the purchase was done smoothly and my computer was upgraded to Windows 10 Pro without needing to input any product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now I have done a fresh Windows 10 reinstall and couldn't find key to get to Windows 10 Pro. I am currently stuck with Windows 10 Home edition. I have contacted a lot of support staff, may be like 10 of them, and some support says that they do not find
 any purchase history under my mentioned email account when I can log in with my Microsoft Account and see the transaction as "Completed" under "Purchase History" in Microsoft page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone had ever experienced this kind of frustration, please do share with me and help me how to get on. The last option I can do is file charge back from my bank for the payment. I am really shock to see Microsoft have such poor system for payment tracking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ryan</p>

            <p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the very useful information. However when I try to fresh install Windows 10 Pro, it asked me to provide Product Key during the installation. I did not have it and I skipped that step. After the installation, I used
<span>Activation at Settings&gt;Update and Security&gt;Activation. However since I do not provided any Product Key, my activation is failed. I even tried to contact customer support for activation and they said they cannot help out since I do not have any product
 key registered.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This computer is the same computer that I used to use Windows 10 Pro (which I did not receive Product Key) except I deleted all the partitions before the fresh install. According to your article, I should be able to activate the Windows 10 Pro by doing
 this way:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Download and create Windows 10 Pro IOS/USB installer from Microsoft with Media Creation Tool</span></p>
<p><span>2. Install the OS using that installer without providing any Product Key</span></p>
<p><span>3. After the installation, I use </span><span>Activation at Settings&gt;Update and Security&gt;Activation.</span></p>
<p><span>Am I right? Please confirm. I will try to do that another time after your confirmation. Thanks!</span></p>

Clean Install Windows 10 Upgrade?</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>If so it explains in the link how to change version to Pro so it will reactivate with the Digital Entitlement you'd already earned for the life of the PC&nbsp; after Upgrade.&nbsp; Essentially you must insert the Pro Default Product Key VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T
 which will change the version only, then after connecting to internet it will activate with the Entitlement stored for your PC in MS Activation servers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is necessary because Windows 10 builders felt that those with embedded Windows 8/8.1 Product Keys should be forced to reinstall the matching version to the embedded key to prevent the "wrong version" being installed.&nbsp; We argued against this to them
 in MVP Communications channel but they were not moved to change it, thus this workaround is needed.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows Live Mail Unexpected Error - System.Runtime.InteropServices.COMException &#40;0x80004005&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I need guidance on this one.</p>
<p>I can receive mail and open mail.&nbsp; As I type a reply to an existing email or type in the body of a new email I get error seen below. It can occur within a few typed words or after 40 or 50 typed words. The only way I can recover is through task manager,
 end task, as the continue button keeps me in the same loop.</p>
<p>If I do manage to complete the text without error I can send the email OK. </p>
<p>I have tried:</p>
<p>Uninstalling windows essential programs but leaving windows live mail.</p>
<p>Uninstalling and re-installing all of windows live essentials including Live Mail per Microsoft web site procedure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>OK, thanks. The fact that the error persists even after installing new copies of all of the WLMail and Writer program files suggests that the fault is elsewhere, and your system restore may well have something to do with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Internet Explorer fully up-to-date on this machine? That would be 11.0.9 (KB2957689). WLMail (and Writer) use the IE libraries for HTML composition and rendering, so it's as well always to have the latest versions of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code that's failing is using .NET2.0 ("<em>Runtime version: 2.0.50727.5477</em>"). This is incorporated into Windows 7, so you'd be well advised to run a System File Check to make sure that there's no problem with vital Windows files. To do this,</p>
<ul>
<li>Close down all programs</li><li>Type <strong>cmd </strong>into the start search box and press <em>Ctrl-Shift-Enter</em> (all three keys at once). This should open an Administrator command window.</li><li>At the command prompt, type <br />
<strong>sfc /scannow<br />
</strong>(Note that there is a space after <strong>sfc</strong>)<br />
and press <em>Enter</em>.</li></ul>
<p>Let us know what happens.</p>

<h2>            Virus&#47;Malware not allowing me to open or install programs</h2>
                    <p>Hello-</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not been able to open certain programs on my system, or install programs (particularly virus and mal-ware scanning software) on my laptop. Every time I try to open or install programs I get one of the two following errors:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows cannot find 'C:\Program Files\(program name).....' Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>or&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"ShellExecuteEx failed; code 2. The System cannot find the file specified."</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, every time I turn on my laptop, windows 10 installer tries to run an update- but is never successful. It just runs endlessly in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another detail- I had someone do a harddrive wipe and full clean install on my laptop of windows 10 (which I think is the culprit of the issue) because of this same issue before, and nothing has cleared it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, I can run Avast Free Antivirus, but clearly it hasn't done any good in preventing whatever it is that is infecting my laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or suggestions are greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            HI Erica, 
<br />
<br />When did this start happening? My first plan of attack would be a system restore if this was in recent history this started. 
<br />
<br />Click on Start - and type "control panel" and click on it
<br />
<br />Once open, search "recovery" and hit enter. When it comes up, click on recovery. 
<br />
<br />On the next page, open "open system restore" 
<br />
<br />They'll be a box that says "click for more restore points" that I would click. Choose a restore point, and follow the prompts. (Make sure you choose a restore point before this issue started occurring)
<br />
<br />** Please note, all your files and photos, etc will be fine. Any applications (ex. candy crush) you've installed since the point you're going back to will be removed. Just a heads up **
<br />
<br />If this doesn’t work, I’d try to boot into safe mode. Click the Start button, then choose Settings .
<br />Select Update &amp; security  &gt; Recovery.
<br />Under Advanced startup select Restart now.
<br />
<br />After your PC restarts to the Choose an option screen, select Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Startup Settings - choose safe mode with networking 
<br />
<br />See if you’re able to install something like Malwarebytes 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/products/</a> - download the free home version (make sure you opt out of the free trial of their active anti virus while setting up) 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/</a>

            Hi Erica.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also do a Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this gets it cleanest and makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />Make sure that your files and program installers are scanned with Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner before reimporting them, then take your time to test performance after each group of Updates, program and files are installed to try to isolate what is causing the problem even after a Clean Install.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Microsoft Sidewinder x4 keyboard macros not working on Flight Simulator X on Windows 10 x64</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a Sidewinder x4 keyboard that has been working without any problems on Windows 7 x64.</p>
<p>Recently I upgraded to Windows 10 x64.</p>
<p>The keyboard works fine apart from one thing.</p>
<p>All S key macros do not work on FSX.</p>
<p>On all other applications they work fine.</p>
<p>This wasn't happening with Windows 7 x64.</p>
<p>I reinstalled the latest drivers with no success.</p>
<p>Anybody has any suggestions?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 fullscreen&#40;ed&#41; games keeps minimizing WHEN trying to launch or unminimize the app.</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I have an issue when I try to access games.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>WHEN I GOT THE LAPTOP:</strong></p>
<p>I have been using this laptop since May 27, 2017 (bought in February 2017) they bought me as a birthday gift. I noticed that my sister had already used the laptop, she made a Microsoft account on this laptop as the initial account. The laptop was utterly
 slow and unresponsive when they gave it to me, I managed get rid of the unnecessary/adware or suspicious apps like "Chromium" which was launched by start up and has no company name, I know Chromium is a legit project by Google, but what this laptop had was
 suspiciously different, so I removed it along with other unnecessary apps. I also cleaned the registry's startup apps and disabled some anti-virus apps because this laptop already has Defender or BitDefender.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ISSUE:</strong></p>
<p>Going back to the issue, when I started to install a game called GTA IV, it was running on windowed mode. And then when I tried to full-screen the game, it did, but it minimized about 2-3 seconds later. When I try to click the game minimized in the taskbar,
 It opens full-screen, but minimized again. I terminated the game, looked up for a fix but I only see solutions for "Windows 10 games keep minimizing every minutes", mine minimizes when launched or clicking the minimized game in the taskbar. I tried installing
 other games, but it did the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to find a solution online, so I went here. I need help please.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Marky,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The issue is most likely caused by a corruption or incorrect configuration with the display drivers. We arrive at this assumption based on the fact that most, if not all, of the games you install show this symptom.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, there are other possible causes and we would like to gather more information. Please answer these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prior to this, were other games or applications affected? Or was it only with the first game you installed?</li><li>Have you tried any troubleshooting steps? If yes, what were they?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For the meantime, we suggest updating the display drivers via the Device Manager, as well as Windows 10 itself. Also, it would be highly recommendable to run a full system scan to ensure that your PC is protected. Click
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17187/windows-10-protect-your-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> for more information.</p>

    <title>No preferred network after Windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rhart3888  say:</h3>
<h2>            No preferred network after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>When I first upgraded from Windows 7 to 10, I had no problems with my wireless connection to my home wireless network.&nbsp; Sometime in November, after an upgrade, My computer, a Dell Inspiron 14z-5423, would no longer connect.&nbsp; It still detects the home network,
 but when I attempt to connect, it just says it cannot connect to this network.&nbsp; I already have the newest driver for my network adapter.&nbsp; I have tried everything I could find on the Internet on how to correct this problem.&nbsp; I have ran every CMD command I could
 find mentioned, uninstalled the adapter and reinstalled it, told the computer to forget my home network, then let it find it again, etc.&nbsp; One of these commands, the last one where a -d is entered, caused my computer to see the adapter, but no wireless connections.
 I had to re-install Windows 10 after that fiasco.&nbsp; This didn't work to re-connect me, either, but at least I could see the wireless connections again!&nbsp; I have tried everything I could find on the Microsoft pages on connectivity problems.&nbsp; I have manually re-installed
 the network.&nbsp; I have disabled my virus checker and my firewall, to not avail.&nbsp; I have ran every troubleshooter there is on my computer for Internet connectivity problems.&nbsp; I have unplugged and replugged both my wireless router and the ISP modem.&nbsp; I have consulted
 with my ISP technical staff.&nbsp; Absolutely nothing has worked.&nbsp; I can connect by cable and every other device in the house has no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run the troubleshooters for either the network or the adapter, it asks for me to pick a wireless connection, but it does not show me any connections to connect.&nbsp; So, when they are done, it tells me, I have no preferred wireless network.&nbsp; The details
 just say it couldn't connect.&nbsp; It's like it cannot get by my security key.&nbsp; I have taken that out and put it back in. No go.&nbsp; I have found nothing that works.&nbsp; Can you help?&nbsp; I have asked before, tried everything told me and nothing worked.&nbsp; I can connect
 to my wireless network on this computer with a flash drive using Ubuntu.&nbsp; No problems at all.</p>

 screen updater process taking most of it. &nbsp;(Sorry, don't remember the exact process name. &nbsp;Will get next time.) &nbsp;Also have other strange problems with the Ctrl-Alt-Del login method. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>This issue could have occurred due to corrupt system files.</p>

            <p>Good suggestion, but the symptom occurs after wakeup from a sleep displays the lock screen. &nbsp;Something happens while the computer sleeps to hang the lock screen. &nbsp;Will the computer sleep from safe mode? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer seems to operate normally after a reboot until the next sleep/wake. &nbsp;Right now I plan to close all windows before letting the computer sleep to see if that prevents the issue. &nbsp;If it does I'll leave commonly used applications open one at a time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try the safe mode boot and clean boot next if closing applications before sleeping does not help.</p>

            <p>Tried the safe mode boot. &nbsp;The problem did not occur, but too many things are not available. &nbsp;Rebooted normally to use. &nbsp;Rebooted in safe mode again and left that way overnight. &nbsp;Did not need to login the morning. &nbsp;Will assume the problem does not occur
 in safe mode and move on to trying clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue does not deserve a lot of time. &nbsp;It takes about a day to occur and occasionally does not. &nbsp;This morning the computer booted normally. &nbsp; This issue is about on par with W98 memory leaks which caused me to reboot daily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft should be concerned, because it makes Windows 10 look very bad. &nbsp;Many users who hit this would not find a way to wake their computer without a forcible power down reboot daily. &nbsp;That is serious. &nbsp;I had to explain to my wife how to wake the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
 am concerned because the cause is unidentified and potentially serious. &nbsp;I will continue to work the issue, but at a very slow pace. &nbsp; I'll post progress here occasionally. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm open to other suggestions.</p>

            <p>The wakeup lock has stopped. &nbsp;I don't recall doing anything different. &nbsp; I started logging what applications were running at login after wakeup. &nbsp;So far 10 wakeups without issue. &nbsp;The last thing I recall trying was the safe mode boot, but I've rebooted many
 times while the problem was present without impact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll continue to log wakeups for awhile, but suspect something has changed and the issue will not occur now.</p>

            Nearly two weeks later and the computer still wakes up normally. &nbsp;I don't know what changed. &nbsp;One week or so of failing to wake up without reboot or Ctrl-Alt-Del and now everything seems normal. &nbsp;I've stopped logging wakeups. &nbsp;Another unsolved mystery.
 &nbsp;Case closed... &nbsp;unless the symptom returns.

<p>No one can answer that question but you.&nbsp; Programs that I use several times a day may be meaningless to you.&nbsp; But in most cases, uninstalling software won't make your computer more "efficient" - only free up some hard drive space.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for Posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are unable to connect the scanner to Windows 7 computer.</span></p>
<p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely help you with this.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please install the scanner drivers in compatibility mode in Windows 7 and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link.</span></p>

 the scanner.</span></p>
