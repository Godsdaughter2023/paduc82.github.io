    <title>corrupt administrative tools lnk&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            corrupt administrative tools lnk&#39;s</h2>
                    <p>The other day I started having problems with my WLAN printer being always offline. Looked at the services and found the printer services were stopped.&nbsp; I ran sfc /scannow and found that some malware had corrupted the lnk files in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start
 Menu\Programs\Administrative Tools and Accessories. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I looked for these two directories using the Control Panel, I found two different directories: Windows Administrative Tools and Windows Accessories. Used the command prompt to find the the first directories I mentioned. Went to another computer, found
 the files, and copied them to the the directories. Restarted my computer and found that my printer was still offline. Ran sfc and found the same corrupt files. I am at lose to figure out what else I can do to fix the problem. Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to ask some questions to know the best possible resolution to offer.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you install any applications on your PC or before the issue started?</li><li>Have you tried performing a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot</a> to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs? This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10.</li><li>Have you tried restarting your PC in <span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode with Networking</a> to

            <p>Yes, I did restart my computer in safe mode. Since safe mode does not repair corrupt files, I gained nothing. I realize it was possible to consider that the malware would still rewrite (corrupt) the files again. I think I have removed the files that caused
 the the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I decided to instead of copying un-corrupted files into the directories indicated by sfc. I copied them into the directories visible by the control panel - Windows Administrative Tools instead of Administrative Tools. That appears to be at least a partial
 solution. Am still unsure if all my start menu services have been started. sfrc still reports issues but not corrupted files.

    <title>Windows 7 and Iomega Minimax with NTFS file system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sdc1958  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 and Iomega Minimax with NTFS file system</h2>
                    I just purchased a Dell XPS desktop computer with Windows 7,&nbsp; I have all of my files stored on an IOmega Minimax external hard drive&nbsp; with an NTFS file system that I used with my old&nbsp; computer, which was&nbsp; running Windows XP.&nbsp; The external hard drive worked
 just fine with Windows XP.&nbsp; The new Windows 7 computer recognizes the external hard drive is attached but I cannot see or open any of the files on it.&nbsp; When I click on the icon for the Minimax (which has Drive letter "F") I get an error message that reads
 "Location is not available.&nbsp; F:/ is not accessible.&nbsp; Access is denied."&nbsp; How can I get access to the files on the external hard drive?:<br />
Thanks<br />

 me crazy! It makes updating a pain in the butt! I've gone through the BIOS to see if there's a setting causing this too no avail. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. PS BIOS is upgraded to newest version. This Laptop runs phenomenal, Boot time under

            Let's first find out if restart is actually working properly.
<br />To do click search and type command prompt then right click it and select run as administrator.
<br />Type the following.
<br />
<br />shutdown /r /t 0
<br />
<br />See if it restarts.
<br />
<br />If it does then sounds like start menu is acting up.
<br />I would first try creating a new account and see if it work in the new account.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/402692...</a>
<br />
<br />This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.
<br />
<br />Let me know how you make out.

<h2>            Changing the desktop background</h2>
                    
<p>I just purchased a Gateway Notebook with Windows 7 Starter and&nbsp; I'm wondering how to change the desktop background. My control panel does not have a appearance and personalization folder. When I search the control panel for change desktop background, I get
 nothing. I've tried right&nbsp; clicking on images and although the option to set as desktop background appears in the menu clicking that option gives me no result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you help me.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            Windows Memory Test detected hardware errors</h2>
                    <p>So back in December, after I was getting sick of all the crashing on Mozilla Firefox, I decided to do a RAM test. After that, it stopped crashing for a while, then it started crashing again, giving reasons like EXCEPTION_ACCESS_VIOLATION_READ. Here's what
 it said:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Memory Diagnostic tested the computer's memory and detected hardware errors. To identify and repair these problems, contact the computer manufacturer</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do to fix these problems? Driver date is May 27, 2015. I would really love your help. I don't want to take it back to a computer repair shop since I had it back in November. Those constant crashes started on the very first day.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate - Startup Problems</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 Ultimate on a home built system built in 2011. &nbsp;I have never had any problems until recently when I left the system running instead of switching it off. &nbsp;It appears that the SSD may have been overloaded but I am not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try and start the system, the PC boots up and goes into the Windows screen and then into a black screen with the cursor which is movable. &nbsp;After a couple of minutes the system re-boots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the options available, Startup Repair does not work, there is no system restore available and i do not have an image to restore. &nbsp;I have tried to manually restore the registry backup but this does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On running startup repair, the message "Windows cannot repair this computer automatically" appears.</p>
<p>On viewing the problem details, the following information is provided:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem Event Name: &nbsp;StartupRepairOffline</p>
<p>Problem Signature 01: &nbsp;0.0.0.0</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7</strong>.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;a serious error and "may" not be repairable without professional tech support from<br />
a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox Stores) or your<br />
System maker's Support. <br />
<br />
Go into Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch screen as you startup.
<br />
Set the boot order to CD/DVD to use Windows 7 disks. Remember to set back when done.<br />
<br />
<strong>With a Windows 7 or Repair disk </strong>try Startup Repair - (the possible fixes are same as these
<br />
though the titles are named differently.)<br />
<br />
Here are the troubleshooting methods to try to fix the issue :<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.) <br />

<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
These "may" help :<br />
<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Windows 7 disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you can retry System Restore from the Recovery or Windows 7&nbsp;disk.<br />

<br />
Or from the Command Prompt :<br />

C:\Windows\System32\rstrui.exe<br />

Hope this helps. </p>

<h2>            WINDOWS 10 UPGRADE CONSTANT REPEATING</h2>
                    Windows 10 keeps installing but does not complete and does not restart the download- it turns the computer off - when I turn it back on, it returns to the original version of windows - then immediately begins the Windows 10 download again, so I am in a
 constant downloading loop!&nbsp; How can I put an end to this?

            Hi Mary Jo.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />
<br />But What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            Hello,
<br />Microsoft provides many options to get the latest feature upgrade manually. You can use any of:
<br />Upgrade assistant
<br />Media Creation Tool
<br />ISO File
<br />to get Fall Creators update right now. 
<br />You can use the following guide having detailed Instructions on how to upgrade to the latest Feature upgrade i.e. Fall Creators update using all the three methods:
<br />How to upgrade to Windows 10 Fall Creators update right now
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade-to-windows-10-fall-creators.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade...</a>
<br />Media Creation tool has an Edge over the Upgrade assistant in my opinion as it offers a greater degree of flexibility of downloading and using the ISO file so that one can deploy it on multiple computers.

<p>Hi Wahid125,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows 7 starter edition was developed as a performance efficient operating system such as a netbook. As such, desktop background options are removed in this version of the OS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the following features are also removed from the Win7 starter edition:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>* Aero Glass, meaning you can only use the “Windows Basic” or other opaque themes. It also means you do not get Taskbar Previews or Aero Peek.</p>
<p>* Personalization features for changing desktop backgrounds, window colors, or sound schemes.</p>
<p>* The ability to switch between users without having to log off.</p>
<p>* Multi-monitor support.</p>
<p>* DVD playback.</p>
<p>* Windows Media Center for watching recorded TV or other media.</p>
<p>* Remote Media Streaming for streaming your music, videos, and recorded TV from your home computer.</p>
<p>* Domain support for business customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond that, if you want to change these features you will need to perform an upgrade. This has been the subject of some<span>&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7desktop/thread/4c3e0533-109b-4401-9160-193948fcb090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">controversy</a> .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the bottom line is that the Windows 7 starter edition is the lowest priced and least feature rich OS. This is for a combination reasons: One, the OS was designed for lower powered netbooks
 which would have a greater chance of issues such as lag<span>&nbsp; </span>which removing features helps to alleviate. Two, this is the lowest price point of the OS line and from a business perspective it's the one with the least features. One of the features
 that is not fully enabled is the desktop background options.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can get more information about a comparison between the Windows 7 starter edition and other versions here:</p>

<p>Some other features which the Windows 7 starter does not have:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is some general information about personalizing Windows 7:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One easy way to perform the upgrade is with Anytime Upgrade. Find the version with the the features you are looking for, and follow these stepos:</p>

<h3> shawnascy  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I get the POP3 &#38; SMTP codes if I use Yahoo as my ISP&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I was originally asked to sign up for Windows Live Mail, I was asked for the POP# and SMTP settings?&nbsp; You are told to contact your ISP provider for the codes...Well we have Yahoo, which essentially has no Customer Service and is free, so not much help
 due to this nice feature but not useful to get Windows Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We do have a router through AT&amp;T in the office which only one computer is attached to and mine and the other laptops wirelessly use the connection.&nbsp; I have tried POP3.yahoo.mail.com and using AT &amp;T as well.&nbsp; Neither work when sending or trying to receive
 email.&nbsp; Did anyone else reading these questions have this problem with not having the right "codes/settings" to establish the right routing addresses for Windows and Hotmail Email to work and now knows how to do it?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where do I go to solve this problem?&nbsp; I just need the right POP3 and SMTP addresses and this should set-up my account, correct?&nbsp; Ever since I got IE9, I can't even get to the set-up screen!&nbsp; But I will cross that bridge when I come to it if I ever get the
 right codes...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know there are milliions of you out there that had this same issue as their are millions of Yahoo Customers, I just left it be 4 years ago but now I need it to work due to a Reunion planning issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help what to do or where to go is greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>The only other infortmation that I know and can give you are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's only on my Toshiba laptop (my only computer)</li><li>It's only Windows Live Mail considering it's the problem shutting down and restarting</li><li>The reliabilty history, I believe it is called, calls the error 'APPCRASH'</li></ul>
<p>On troubleshooting, there were no options for me to even consider for my computer didn't give me any.

            I have had this happen many times, even after the uninstall repair, This seemed to have started after windows replaced messenger with Skype, and since I didn't complete the Skype setup process when it prompted me to upgrade, It removed messenger, and I
 think this may have something to do with the bug.<br />
<br />
Since the Skype is not something I really wanted to run, I was happy to just use windows without messenger, but I believe that is the problem as i never had the shut down happen before the upgrade new messenger prompt
<br />
<br />
I will say that it mostly happens while responding to ads on Craigslist, I also run the greasemonkey app Craigslist fusion if that helps debug the error, It does however occur at times I respond to other emails, and it has even happened when I take along time
 to write an email.<br />
<br />
I will screen cap the event and post them later<br />

            <p>Hello Dave,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum. I understand that your Messenger was removed when you upgrade to Skype even if the installation is not complete. Since you click the option on how to&nbsp;upgrade to Skype, Messenger will be automatically removed.
<span><span><font color="#000000">Last April 8, 2013, the upgrade has started.</font></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><font color="#000000">To help ensure a smooth transition, the upgrade will be gradual. Your upgrade is part of the process. Once the migration process is done, Messenger will no longer be useable and will prompt you to upgrade to Skype. To know
 more, please refer to this thread:</font></span></span></p>

            I'm afraid you are SOL and will have to reinstall. You can try removing the hard drive and attaching it to a second computer and then using
<a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDiskâ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TestDisk</a> and
<a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Photorec</a> but the chances are slim that you will recover anything. You can also send your disk to a place that specializes in recovery but it is expensive. Again, the chances are still slim.<br />
<br />
In the future, make sure to make daily backups of your important data to a second physical or the cloud.<br />
<br />
<b>EDIT: </b>I missed the part where you said it happened in an instant so maybe there's a good chance of recovery. I would normally tell you to fix the MBR but it looks like you have a custom MBR which may have the option of booting to a recovery/reinstall
 partition.<br />
What is the make and model of your PC?<br />

            The killing of the harddisk just finished up in a split second, I thought it will take&nbsp;some time&nbsp;and is stoppable in the process. So there's really no simple full restoration of my system to just before it was killed?

            I edited my post after realizing you had said that. Sorry about that.<br />
Read it again. It's possible only the partition information was destroyed so the tools I posted should help. TestDisk will probably find those partitions if so.Make sure to read the instructions on their page or you may be lost using it.<br />
Also, what is the make and model of the PC?<br />

            I read the manuals and it had no mention of a recovery partition. It comes with pre-installed software that makes recovery CDs to put your system back to how it came from the factory. I presume you didn't make those?<br />
<br />
How did you try to fix the MBR?<br />
<br />
You should do what I have already suggested, use <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk%C3%A2%C2%80%C2%8E" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TestDisk</a> and <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/PhotoRec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>No, I didn't make recovery CDs, I&nbsp;had tried using&nbsp;the Spotmau Bootsuite 2012 MBR Recovery function to try to fix the MBR, but it&nbsp;didn't work as the function can't find any harddisk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spotmau Bootsuite 2012 is a boot up CD&nbsp;temp system, crash and data recovery program, I'm using the temp system's IE to go online now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TestDisk and Photorec are similar data recovery programs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I should have mentioned this before but you should make an image or your hard disk by cloning in case something goes wrong. I mean the whole hard disk. Not just the partitions. Maybe your Spotmau Bootsuite 2012 has that capability. I don't know. If it
 does do cloning make sure the end result is a real image of the hard disk and not just a copy of the files/folders.<br />
Do this before attempting any more procedures!<br />
<br />
Free software, with cloning capabilities, you can check out are...<br />
<a href="http://www.todo-backup.com/products/home/free-backup-software.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">EaseUS Todo Backup Free</a><br />

<a href="http://www.runtime.org/driveimage-xml.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DriveImage XML</a><br />
Again, make sure the one you pick makes an <i>image</i> of the entire hard drive.<br />
<br />
Moving on now...<br />
<br />
<i>No, I didn't make recovery CDs</i><br />
Then you will have to get your hands on an OEM XP setup disk somehow to reinstall the OS if everything else fails. You could also install Windows 7 or 8 as they are easy to get,..<i>if</i>, your PC is fast enough for them.<br />
<br />
<i>TestDisk and Photorec are similar data recovery programs?</i><br />
Yes and no. TestDisk is mainly for dealing with hard disk/partitions but it can also recover files.<br />
Photorec is something you would use if TestDisk failed to recover your system as it will recover files.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />

You probably want the undelete feature. I've only played with TestDisk a bit so that's all I can say on the subject. Read the documentation if you want to be sure.<br />
It's under advanced on the main menu screen...<br />
<br />

&nbsp;<br />
<i>How do I make the system detect my harddisk to make the MBR Recovery work?</i><br />
As I've already said countless times, you use TestDisk.<br />
<i><br />
I don't want the system how it came from the factory, I want the system just before it was killed.</i><br />
You need to prepare yourself for the eventuality that that may not be possible. All you can do is try with TestDisk.<br />
<br />
I hope you have finally understood. I don't want to keep repeating the same thing over and over.<br />
Good luck!<br />

            <p>Hi <span>Mike,</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community. I understand that Windows Live Mail crashes periodically when you use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible that there is a corrupted file that is causing the issue. We would like you to try repairing the program to try to fix the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>On your computer, go to
<font><b>Control Panel</b>.</font></span><font color="#000000">
</font></li><li>
<span>Click on <font>
<b>Programs</b>, then <b>Uninstall a program</b>.</font></span></li><li>
<span>Look for
<font><b>Windows Essentials</b>.</font></span><font color="#000000">
</font></li><li>
<span>Right click on
<font><i>Windows Essentials</i> and click on <b>Uninstall/Change</b>.<br />
A window will pop up asking to either remove or repair Windows Essentials.</font></span></li><li>
<span>Choose
<font><b>Repair all Windows Essentials program.</b></font></span></li></ol>
<p>
<span>If repairing Windows Live Mail does not work, we recommend that you uninstall and reinstall Windows Live Mail. To do this, simply follow the same steps above but choose remove instead of repair.
 You can download a fresh copy of Windows Live Mail through this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.<br />
<br />
Let us know if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

    <title>Xbox 360 games download corrupted - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thevonce  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 games download corrupted</h2>
                    <p>Im sure this has been raised many many times before, so apologies if this has been resolved successfully. If so, then please direct me to the correct solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am quite frustrated, because I have tried all the solutions provided by the Microsoft team without any success.</p>
<p>I have deleted the item, cleared cache (system and marketplace) and re-downloaded at least 6 times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have purchased an Xbox 360 game from the Xbox Store (On Demand) and whenever I download the game, it shows up as corrupted.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, I am in the correct region as my store / account. What is even more confusing is that I have purchased other games from this same store, undergone updates on these games, and even downloaded "patches" for my Xbox OG games with this
 same profile... All is in order, and it has never caused any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can someone from the Xbox Support team provide a working solution to the problem?</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a look at these solutions:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>
</p><p>- Deleting any partial / corrupt / incomplete downloads and attempting to re-download again​</p>
<div>- Deleting and re-downloading your profile​</div>
<div>- Deleting the System Cache for all storage devices​</div>
<div>- Deleting the Marketplace file from System Storage​</div>
<div>- Formatting the internal hard drive and attempting to re-download again​</div>
<div>- Attempting to download to an external storage device instead of the internal hard disk.​</div>
<div>- Removing and reinstalling all system updates for the console (using the controller button combination while viewing Storage)​</div>
<div>- Using a wired ethernet connection instead of Wifi</div>
<div>- Downloading the same games direct from the marketplace (via PC) to queue them on your Xbox 360​</div>
<div>- Confirmed that downloading previous games from your download history work fine, along with downloading demos, etc.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>- Attempting to download on a different Xbox 360 console with your same profile - the same corrupt downloads occur. This leads you to believe it's nothing to do with the Xbox 360 console being at fault.​</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After trying all of the above, you can only assume the issue must either be with your account/profile or there is something wrong with the games themselves when attempting to download on an Xbox 360.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to what 'Tomesso' has suggested (which were all good by the way), but with the exception of formatting the hard dive, this would be a last resort I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Delete the game you downloaded that is always showing as corrupt.&nbsp; </p>
<p>2. Go to the marketplace and download some Xbox 360 demo's.&nbsp; Doesn't matter what you choose to download, just make sure they download fully.&nbsp; One or two should be fine.</p>
<p>3. Re-download your game you purchased again.&nbsp; Does it work now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work, you can attempt to download a game directly to an external storage device.&nbsp; The best option would be to use a suitable USB Flash drive.&nbsp; The drive must have at least 16GB to be sure enough free space is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Insert your Flash drive into the console and format it for Xbox 360 Storage.</p>
<p>2. Go to the marketplace and download something again, doesn't matter what, you're not going to complete the download anyway.</p>
<p>3. While the first item is still downloading, add your game to the download queue.</p>
<p>4. Bring up the mini guide, go to downloads.&nbsp; Go down to the game your having issues with which should be second this queue.&nbsp; Press A to select it and select 'Change storage device'.</p>
<p>5. Cancel the first download.&nbsp; Now your game will be downloaded directly to the USB Flash drive.</p>
<p>6. When the download completes, test your game.&nbsp; Does it work now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it works off the USB storage, but not your hard drive, it suggests your hard drive is on the way out and needs replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how you get on.</p>

<p>Hi again Temosso.</p>
<p>
</p><p>regarding the deleting and re-downloading of my profile...</p>
<p>Will this remove all games, saves, achievements etc, or will they still be available if I download my profile again?</p>
<p>What should I be concerned about in removing and recovering / re-downloading my profile?</p>
<p>Is there perhaps an FAQ or help link on the profile delete topic you can share?</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for this option as well.</p>
<p>I believe my HDD is still fine, because I can still download updates, demos and play games on the HDD. Will continue to download a few more demos to double check, and then resort to using a USB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quick question... if I download the game onto USB, would it be possible to bring it back onto my HDD from the USB without having to download it again?</p>

</p><p>BUT if you dont live.in an xbox live.region.there is no solution we can suggest bound by forum rules</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you dont.live.in a xbox live region then changing it to.a.non supportre region wont work</p>
<p>And selecting.random.regions wont work</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your actual.region is the only thing that.will.work</p>

<p>Thanks ngocphi.</p>
<p>I believe I have checked all the right spots for this test.</p>
<p>I may have missed some checks here. I see this come up quite often in other threads, so if you can maybe give me the detail on what and where I need to verify to check this box?</p>
<p>I can confirm that I bought my console in the same region I registered my profile and Xbox Live account. All my other Microsoft products are also in the same region (like Windows etc).</p>
<p>Lastly, I have purchased other games from the same Xbox Live account in my current region and they all worked fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just curious... If the game I am buying will not work in my current account/ console /profile region (ie, become corrupted on download), then surely this is something that Microsoft can detect and must notify the user about before they spend their money?
 Is there a suggestion box somewhere? :-)</p>

<p>
</p><p>Just because some games have no issues, doesn't mean the hard drive is 100% fine. Hard drives are mechanical, composed of disc platters, made&nbsp; up of tracks and sectors (a simplified explanation).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over time a failing hard drive will develop 'bad sectors'. These parts of the hard will have issues when they are read, but other parts of the drive may still be fine.&nbsp; This is why we suggest deleting the corrupt game, downloading demo's and then the game
 again, as this will move the game to another part of the hard drive. Just something to think about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can move a USB game over to the 360 hard drive, no problem.</p>

            hi Horizon.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.  If one of these methods work, then go to Step 3.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began, Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media or Repair Mode  Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi horizon82 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />First you will need to force your machine to get into the recovery screen.
<br />To do this boot up and wait for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle, when you see that press and hold power button to shut down.
<br />Boot up again and do the same thing by waiting for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle then shut down, power up for the 3rd time and you should get repair screen.
<br />Let it run.
<br />You will then get a screen with the Automatic Repair, select the Advanced Options.
<br />Once you are in there try using a system restore point.
<br />See if that works first.

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Let us try repairing the existing OS.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive

<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />
<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, consider doing a clean install after rescuing your files.

            I don't know if you can do it at the same time.&nbsp; I would just do them separately.&nbsp; If you could do it all at one time, it would probably take more time than just doing it individually.

    <title>Windows 7 &#34;no DNS &#40;or no network&#41; after resume &#40;wake - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anonymous squib  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 &#34;no DNS &#40;or no network&#41; after resume &#40;wake up&#41; from sleep &#40;or hibernation&#41;&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>The focus of this thread is to understand the expected behaviour of the Windows 7 TCP Stack and Adapter Cards on resume from sleep/hibernation -not- to post suggestions that have been posted in other threads.&nbsp; I also wanted to gather some of the folklore
 relating to this issue in one place ...</p>
<p>There appears to be a body of people having this issue Windows 7 "no DNS (or no network) after resume (wake up) from sleep (or hibernation)" without definitive (or with various) answers as to what the issue is.</p>
<p>Doing some reading on this in various places I see:</p>
<p>- Suggestions to disable UPnP.&nbsp; This should be largely irrelevant to the problem.</p>
<p>- Reset router to factory defaults.&nbsp; This should typically not be necessary.</p>
<p>- Reinstall Windows 7 (ah yes, the panacea for all ills!).</p>
<p>- Change from DHCP to Static IP.&nbsp; This should not be necessary (considered a workaround at best).</p>
<p>- - If it solves the problem it points the finger at DHCP functionality/state on resume from sleep?</p>
<p>- Disable firewall.&nbsp; This should not be an issue (why would it be).</p>
<p>- - If it is an issue, it is likely to be one in isolated, rather than the majority of cases.</p>
<p>- VMWare (or similar) Virtual Networks.</p>
<p>- - This could be an issue for some people.&nbsp; It would be useful for anyone having a problem to confirm if they have VMWare or similar virtualisation products installed (those which may create virtual networks).</p>
<p>- Disable TCP auto tuning (TCP Sliding Windows).</p>
<p>- - It is possible that TCP auto tuning could be a problem for some people -but- unlikely it would be an issue for people purely on resume from sleep.&nbsp; I suspect anyone having issues relating to TCP auto tuning (TCP Sliding Windows) would have intermittent
 connectivity issues rather than issues on resume.</p>
<p>- - Some people report improved performance when the turn off this feature.&nbsp;&nbsp; MSFT report from 10x to 1000x performance in lab. conditions.&nbsp; This is one you'll have to test yourself to see if it helps or otherwise.</p>
<p>- - - NETSH INTERFACT TCP SET GLOBAL AUTOTUNING=DISABLED</p>
<p>- - - NETSH INTERFACT TCP SET GLOBAL AUTOTUNING=NORMAL</p>
<p>- It works on XP but not on Windows 7?</p>
<p>- - It is commented widely enough that the TCP stack has been re-written/improved through Vista and Windows 7.&nbsp; It is no surprise therefore that problems occur on Windows 7 that do not occur on Windows XP.&nbsp; This does not necessarily imply that the Windows
 7 stck is buggy, just that not all software and devices in the TCP food chain are speaking the same/current language (for want of a better technical description).</p>
<p>- - One wonders therefore are the issues related purely to additional tuning/offloading optimisations that have been made in the new TCP stack?&nbsp;&nbsp; How does that tie up with issues that occur only on resume from sleep/hibernation?</p>
<p>- Some people recommended preventing the system from powering down their adapter cards during sleep/hibernation.&nbsp; Does this imply:</p>
<p>- - That the card is not stateful.</p>
<p>- - If the card is allowed to be powered down then there will be a disconnect between the state recorded in Windows and the state represented (none) in the card when the system is brought out of sleep (or hibernate).</p>
<p>- - - Perhaps this is something that needs to be addressed in the Windows 7 TCP stack/sleep functions - how to handle/recover the situation when the NIC is powered down?</p>
<p>- - If we are putting systems to sleep, do we want to have to have power supplied to the adapters, or not (what are the implications)?</p>
<p>- - Are people having the same issue for hibernate?</p>
<p>- - If there is a state issue relating to adapters, could that be why in some cases people have resolve the problem by turning off optimisations that involve some processing being handed off to the adapter cards rather than being performed using the CPUs.&nbsp;
 If it were kept in the CPUs, would we have consistent state on resume (versus the adapter cards)?</p>
<p>I think what I would like to understand from MSFT here is:</p>
<p>- What is the designed behaviour in the revised stack for ensuring consistent state between the adapter, stack, previously obtained DNS, DHCP settings, etc, on resume from sleep/hibernation.</p>
<p>- Unlikely connections persist through sleep/hibernate - so are they remembered/re-established?</p>
<p>- Does Windows 7 need more work to handle this properly for cards that --are-- powered down during sleep?</p>
<p>- Is it a requirement of MSFT at this time that for a clean resume, the adapter card should remain powered on?</p>
<p>Some discussion from MSFT on how this is supposed to work would be useful.&nbsp; Then maybe the hundreds if not thousands of people experiencing this issue can understand correctly why it occurs and how they can address it.</p>

            <p>Thank you for spending time and energy on this. I've had a frustrating time dealing with this issue, but -- finally, disabling the virtual network adapters seems to have helped.</p>
