<h2>            Mbamservice.exe causing high CPU usage error from Resource and Performance Monitor.</h2>
                    Recently I've stopped using Steam workshop to get mods for some games as the Workshop for me doesn't work very well. So I started going to Gamemaps.com as a source for mods for games like Left 4 Dead 2. I've downloaded mods from their in the past and searched
 the web to make sure the website is reputable. After downloading I ran Resource and Performance monitor like I usually do. After it was complete it showed the mbamservice.exe for Malwarebytes had a high CPU consumption. Would anybody know what could cause
 this?. Is this possibly a virus?.I've also scanned my computer both with Malwarebytes and Microsoft Safety Scanner with neither of them finding any infections.

<h2>            Roku stick no longer mirroring after windows 10 update</h2>
                    I was miracasting just fine from my laptop to my Roku device for 6 months until the Windows 10 update last week. Now when I connect, the bar that tells me it is connecting only goes about 1/4 of the way and then is "stuck." Eventually it goes back to the
 Roku home screen and the computer says that it cannot connect.&nbsp;

            Thank you for replying to my post. I was actually able to speak this afternoon to Microsoft Customer Service and they were able to diagnose and solve my problem in 5 minutes. Needless to say, I was impressed, since Roku took a lot longer to not respond
 to me and then after I asked again, they sent me to Microsoft. Anyway, the problem was my antivirus. For whatever reason, it is now blocking access to connecting my Roku stick.

    <title>system image restore from a USB external drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markfrayne  say:</h3>
<h2>            system image restore from a USB external drive</h2>
                    <p>Long story - ill try and keep it short :-</p>
<p>Had win 10 pro installed (free upgrade from my genuine win 7 pro so, no actual install disk and no product key)&nbsp;on HDD with a (hopefully) good &amp; intact system image backup on a 500g ext. USB drive. 3 weeks ago I switched my PC on and after many days of frustration
 lengths (all the usual repair this computer, blah blah) to try and resolve the problem of it not booting I took it to a PC repair shop. He told me my HDD with the OS system on had damaged sectors and that was the cause of its inability to boot. He said buy
 a new drive and do a system image restore.</p>
<p>Bought a new 960gb SSD but what then???</p>
<p>After researching on my wife's win 10 laptop I learned that I had to reinstall win 7 from my installation DVD then follow the upgrade path to reinstall win 10.</p>
<p>After niggling problems that I wont go into I eventually managed to get a clean install of windows 10. I then connected my USB drive containing the system image backup and proceeded to revert to that.</p>
<p>Great! It worked - here's my desktop image and familiar icons - but wait... - no games launcher icon, no Games icons; in fact, no it hasn't worked...</p>
<p>So what did I actually do to get this extremely slimmed down version of my precious win 10 lost install?</p>
<p>when I explore the USB backup drive I see an icon with my old previous "computer name". This is what I clicked on to retrieve my "old" (original win 10) install. But I backed up thousands of songs, many thousands of photos spanning 30 years, at least 8 games
 and countless other things. what happened to all that? Did I do something different from system image restore which, as I understand it replicates an EXACT copy in every detail (every folder, file, programme etc.) of a functioning system?</p>
<p>Also on the drive is a folder "windows image backup". exploring this folder eventually gets me to a folder containing two hard disk image files and a bunch of XML files. So, reasoning that I had invoked the "wrong" kind of restore I did it all again after
 researching online info.</p>
<p>Then just as all seemed to be proceeding normally a window opens with an error code 0x80042407.</p>
<p>I go out and purchase ANOTHER 1tb&nbsp;USB external drive hoping to address the problem (boot drive that's selected as primary in the bios isn't large enough). Even after connecting that it still came back with the same error!</p>
<p>So, my question is will I ever back my original install of windows 10 and if so, how?</p>
<p>If some kind person out there has a "SOLVED" solution and replies to this thread can I ask for it to be kept simple please?</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this and thanks in anticipation for anybody who answers it.</p>

            <p>A few things, and this may be in that Wiki, but Win 10 after being activated can be installed cleanly on the same machine without reinstalling previous software.&nbsp; The Digital key is kept online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folder you saw with the computer name is the File history backup.&nbsp; The WindowsImageBackup folder is where the system image backup is.&nbsp; If you boot to the install or recovery media you can replace that image on a clean hard drive and it will look just
 like the original install.&nbsp; If the recovery does not find the backup image you need to tell it where it is..&nbsp;The new drive does need to be at least as large as the one from which the image was created assuming the entire original drive was formatted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had made a Recovery Drive, you can reinstall Win 10 from that but it will be missing some of your personal stuff.&nbsp; Recovering the File History after the clean install may have recovered other personal items but I have not done that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your problem scenario seems to happen more often than even Microsoft might expect.</p>

            <p>Hi Sujata - I actually tried this (the system repair tool thing) with three different mediums (a 16gb USB stick, a CD with the files written to it and finally the new 1tb USB drive I mentioned in the original post. The stick and the CD always got me to the
 same point while the 1tb drive quoted on a black screen "cannot find an operation system".</p>
<p>Anyway this is where I get to :-</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>At the point where the progress bar is about 5mm in the green (about 10 seconds) the dreaded "0x80042407" error message appears.</p>
<p>As to the rest of the article you directed me to - I don't think it's applicable. My original install drive was 1tb but my new SSD is 960gb (sold as a 1tb) - would that affect anything?</p>

            <p>Hey Saltgrass - first of all - a big thanks for persevering with the original post &amp; for the snippets of info I didn't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did get the heads up from the repair guy that when attempting to install or re-install win 10 Microsoft "knows" your PC by embedded data on the mobo - but for that you need an internet connection. My predicament was a new hard drive with no OS and NO internet.
 I've done that many things now I can't remember if (besides the bios) there was even drive recognition USB or otherwise when attempting anything with the aforementioned recovery media&nbsp;. I definitely know it didn't make an online connection. So in order to
 get an internet connection I did what I thought I had to do ( win 7 install).</p>
<p>I'm quite willing to concede that my knowledge is very limited so, with that said, If I took my PC and the drive containing the system images (there's 2 on there) to someone who knows what they're doing, will the fact that the said images are present mean
 that they can be recovered?</p>
<p>I'm actually starting to think that somehow the system Images are corrupt in some way. Would Win 10 still allow them to be saved on the backup drive? It would explain why the re-image process starts then stops with the "error" window.</p>

            <p>I am not sure what you are wanting to do but if you want to move or create additional backup images you can rename the
<em>WindowsImageBackup </em>folder.&nbsp; That way, if there is room on the drive, another one can be created or that one moved to another location.&nbsp; But it must be put back to the original name for the image recovery utility to find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind if the image is on a local drive it must be in the root directory of&nbsp;a partition.&nbsp; If you move it to a Network location in can be in other places.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version of the recovery/install media can also be very important in recovering images.&nbsp; Exactly what all the build number changes does to this process I am not sure, but it you can find an image you know is there, it may be the wrong version to what
 you have installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From Win 10 you can mount one of the partition in the image.&nbsp; Go to the partition the size of the c drive and right click and select Mount.&nbsp; It will give an error but ignore it.&nbsp; Then open Disk Management and assign a drive letter and you should be able
 to access the partition.&nbsp;&nbsp; A word of warning, if you want to close the image go to the left end of the graphical view and select dismount or whatever word is used to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most newer systems have USB drivers built into the Bios.&nbsp; On some, certain USB ports are disabled during boot to help speed that process.&nbsp; You might check to see if that could be the case on your system.&nbsp; I have an external Seagate Backup Plus and on earlier
 versions of the OS I had to go through the restore process until it had already looked for an image.&nbsp; After that I plugged in the external drive and searched again and the image was found.&nbsp; There was some type of problem with the system booting and that particular
 drive plugged in.</p>

            <p>Does that error number <span style="color: rgba(0, 27, 160, 1)">0x80042407</span>&nbsp; tell you other information ?&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Should say something to the effect of partition&nbsp;too Small or can't make another Partition because its reached the max number of partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally a windows 7 computer - &nbsp;it probably is MBR&nbsp;?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (which is 4 basic&nbsp;partitions max)&nbsp;&nbsp; You might look at this page&nbsp; https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/f15bfe2f-e265-479a-afa3-f055530c97f5/windows-server-backup-0x80042407-seriously
</p>
<p>which not much is different on win10.&nbsp; Might consider fresh install and resizing C to what you want as long as its bigger than original system image - then reimage just the C drive and fix your boot errors if any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being your windows 10 system image in WindowsImageBackup is being written to new blank larger drive... it should just work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>~</p>
<p>Your main purpose seems to be you really want your games back - why not just install them new to a fresh install of windows 10 and gather your personal files by mounting your windows partition in that WindowsImageBackup last made image&nbsp;shadow and copy them
 to the fresh install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You've done so many things I have no idea what you have now.&nbsp; I'd surely blank the drive by booting off a win10 install iso and using the repair function or the custom install then quitting and boot it again to repair and search for system image or path
 it to the WindowsImageBackup folder.</p>

            <p>OK - a big thanks to Mike P for your interest in helping me with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To recap :-</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter which way I try, all attempts to retrieve the image file I'd previously created fail with the 0x80042407 error.</p>
<p>The ultimate reason for retrieving that image is to retrieve all the missing photos and songs I had on my original install.</p>
<p>I've reinstalled my games on my present install but I cant play them (in particular - Battlefield 3 'cos now I cant find a download for the essential plugin) but that's inconsequential because I've still not got my photos and songs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>after changing my BIOS boot priority and getting my PC booting from the original USB system image repair tool (created&nbsp;from the original "the one I want back" installation) I now get this message :-</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The system image restore failed. Windows cannot restore a system image to a computer that has different firmware. The system image was created on a computer using BIOS and this computer is using EFI."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I've tried - but backed out of at the final stage, was a clean install - choosing that option prompted that I was unable to install to C drive (can't remember the reason why now) but I did have the option to FORMAT that drive - surely if I
 did that I'd delete data required for an internet connection; meaning Microsoft wouldn't identify my PC for the install and I'd be back to square 1 (updating via the Win 7 route)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The single most important question I'd love an answer to if possible guys is If I took my PC and the drive containing the system images (there's 2 on there) to someone who knows what they're doing, will the fact that the said images are present mean that
 they can be recovered?</p>

            <p>You haven't yet dealt with the drive size situation.&nbsp; If the SSD is actually smaller, even by a little bit, the image may not take.&nbsp; Perhaps try a larger HDD to test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears the image was made from a system running as Legacy.&nbsp; Is that how you want the new install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And remember, you can access the image to copy over files contained in the image to a new install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:&nbsp; If your backup image is of the UEFI configuration it should show a Esp.vhdx file.&nbsp; If it doesn't then it is Legacy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also don't know for sure if a Win 10 install done as Legacy will activate if then installed as UEFI.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>A few things, and this may be in that Wiki, but Win 10 after being activated can be installed cleanly on the same machine without reinstalling previous software.&nbsp; The Digital key is kept online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folder you saw with the computer name is the File history backup.&nbsp; The WindowsImageBackup folder is where the system image backup is.&nbsp; If you boot to the install or recovery media you can replace that image on a clean hard drive and it will look just
 like the original install.&nbsp; If the recovery does not find the backup image you need to tell it where it is..&nbsp;The new drive does need to be at least as larg as the one from which the image was created assuming the entire original drive was formatted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had made a Recovery Drive, you can reinstall Win 10 from that but it will be missing some of your personal stuff.&nbsp; Recovering the File History after the clean install may have recovered other personal items but I have not done that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your problem scenario seems to happen more often than even Microsoft might expect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hi again Saltgrass - after reading your reply again - in particular "If you boot to the install or recovery media you can replace that image on a clean hard drive and it will look just like the original install."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, armed with my original system image repair USB stick (created from when I had my "good" win 10 install) &amp;/or a newly created system image repair DVD (created from this "now" installation) and of course, the USB ext. drive containing the system image
 I want to restore, this is what I'm proposing to do :-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Format my C drive (primary/OS drive)</p>
<p>Set BIOS to prioritise boot up</p>
<p>1st question - which of the two is best to&nbsp;boot&nbsp;from&nbsp;- the stick or the DVD? (I'm asking this 'cos I seem to remember reading something about the EXACT build data being essential) - the product key for the stick ended AA491&nbsp; - my "now" installation that
 created the DVD system repair tool ends AA209...</p>
<p>2nd question - If this procedure fails will the fact that I've formatted my C drive (thereby loosing my internet connection and the resulting "Microsoft recognising my PC by the mobo data") mean I'm back to square 1 and reinstalling Win 7, getting internet
 connection back and installing 10 that way?</p>

<br />You need to call them.
<br />But you have to go through the virtual agent.
<br />Just keep saying No that you are not helping then you will have an option where they call you back.

<p>Recently I have been experiencing problems staying connected to Xbox Live. &nbsp;I have wireless Internet and connect via the Xbox wireless adapter. During matches online in games such as Black Ops, my Xbox drops connection to my Internet, forcing me offline.
 &nbsp;This problem is completely random and, I can go weeks without it occurring, just to see the problem reappear and occur multiple times over the span of hours. &nbsp;. &nbsp;My wireless internet connection is perfectly fine and can normally connect and sign on to Xbox
 Live with no problem. &nbsp;After I am booted offline, I normally sign back on right away and I connect easily. &nbsp;It is just frustrating to get disconnected when I have a good Internet connection. &nbsp;I don't believe it is a problem with Live, but a problem with stay
 connected to the Internet. &nbsp;I normally receive an error message saying "You must be connected to the internet to play on Xbox Live". &nbsp;</p>

<p>Check to make sure that no one is downloading anything around these times wirelessly. &nbsp;If that is happening it is possible that there is not enough bandwidth and can get kicked off. &nbsp;Also make sure that the router is not too far away. &nbsp;Having a internet
 strenght of 1 or 2 bars will not be enough to do games or anything online. &nbsp; Also try a wired connection for a while to test that theory as well.</p>

            Hi Alan,<br />
<br />
I agree with considerate_guy in uploading the video in SkyDrive and sending the link to your recipients. Here's a detailed step in uploading the file:<br />
<br />
<span>1. Go to&nbsp;</span><a href="http://skydrive.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://skydrive.live.com</span></b></a><span>
 then sign in using your Windows Live account. </span>
<p><span>2. Click
<b>New Folder&nbsp;</b>to insert a new folder in your SkyDrive&nbsp;files then name it.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span>3. Once you've successfully created the folder select the target folder and then&nbsp;click on
<b>Add files</b>.&nbsp;A new window will appear&nbsp;it will ask you to Drop files there or Select&nbsp;them from your computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;Drag and then drop the file or locate it by selecting the file, after that you will see a new window that the file is being
 uploaded. It will be automatically included to the selected folder. </span></p>
<p><span>5. Once the file is uploaded, click the
<b>Share Folder </b>link. It is located at the right side of the web page under sharing category.
</span></p>
<p><span>6. A&nbsp;new window will pop-up, click on the
<b>Get a link</b>&nbsp;tab&nbsp;and then click <b>Make public</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>7. Copy the entire link and include it in your email message.<br />
<br />
Regarding on the upload limits, on the SkyDrive webpage the upload limit is 300mb per file.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Gerard G.<br />

<p>A backup will not let you restore the operating system in case you have a major problem. You should do this instead:</p>
<ol>
<li>Burn a Windows Repair CD.</li><li>Create an <strong>image</strong> of your system partition. Park it on your external disk.</li><li>Use the Windows Repair CD to boot the machine into Repair Mode.</li><li>Check if the Image Restore process will detect the image you created in Step 2.</li></ol>

    <title>Windows 8 need to speed up indexing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> that1guyyep101  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 need to speed up indexing</h2>
                    I have a Windows 8 64bit laptop.<br />
It is currently indexing my 1tb external hard drive.<br />
It's taking quite a while because I'm using it, so therefore it says "Indexing speed is reduced due to user activity"<br />
I got curious and looked up if there is a way around this.<br />
Turns out there is and it involves changing a registry key value.<br />
Specifically the one named "DisableBackOff"<br />
The value needs to be changed from 0, to 1.<br />
I tried doing that but I get an error saying "Cannot edit DisableBackOff: Error writing the value's new contents.<br />
I then looked up how to fix this problem, and the answer a website gave me was... (see quote below)<br />
<br />
"To get write access to the registry key, open regedit by right-clicking on the start menu item and choose 'Run as Administrator'. Go back to the registry entry mentioned in step 1, right-click on the 'Gathering Manager' item in the registry tree and choose
 'Permissions' then the 'Advanced' button and the 'Owner' tab.<br />
On the Owner tab change the owner to Administrator and click OK.<br />
Back on the Permissions | Security dialog make sure the Administrator has Full Control then click OK.<br />
Now you should be able to edit the DisableBackOff key in step 1. If not, check the permissions and owner carefully."<br />
<br />
<br />
I followed those steps as best I could and I get an error of "Unable to saver permission changes on Gathering Manager. Access is denied."<br />
<br />
What's the problem? All I want to do is change a value for a registry key from a 0 to a 1 so that indexing will go faster.<br />
But Windows 8 is being all difficult and won't let me.<br />
<br />

            <blockquote>I have a Windows 8 64bit laptop.<br />
It is currently indexing my 1tb external hard drive.<br />
It's taking quite a while because I'm using it, so therefore it says "Indexing speed is reduced due to user activity"<br />
I got curious and looked up if there is a way around this.<br />
Turns out there is and it involves changing a registry key value.<br />
Specifically the one named "DisableBackOff"<br />
The value needs to be changed from 0, to 1.<br />
I tried doing that but I get an error saying "Cannot edit DisableBackOff: Error writing the value's new contents.<br />
I then looked up how to fix this problem, and the answer a website gave me was... (see quote below)<br />
<br />
"To get write access to the registry key, open regedit by right-clicking on the start menu item and choose 'Run as Administrator'. Go back to the registry entry mentioned in step 1, right-click on the 'Gathering Manager' item in the registry tree and choose
 'Permissions' then the 'Advanced' button and the 'Owner' tab.<br />
On the Owner tab change the owner to Administrator and click OK.<br />
Back on the Permissions | Security dialog make sure the Administrator has Full Control then click OK.<br />
Now you should be able to edit the DisableBackOff key in step 1. If not, check the permissions and owner carefully."<br />
<br />
<br />
I followed those steps as best I could and I get an error of "Unable to saver permission changes on Gathering Manager. Access is denied."<br />
<br />
What's the problem? All I want to do is change a value for a registry key from a 0 to a 1 so that indexing will go faster.<br />
But Windows 8 is being all difficult and won't let me.<br />

<h2>            Uninstalling a browser &#40;Chromium&#41;</h2>
                    <p>There is a Chromium search engine across the top of my computer screen on my laptop. I have been trying to uninstall Chromium so this search engine will go away but in order to uninstall, I need to close all of the Chromium browsers. But I cannot close the
 search engine at the top of my screen (so I cannot uninstall the browser).&nbsp; Can anyone help me to figure this out and get rid of Chromium? Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Boot from New SSD</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
I knew this was too good to be true...</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
So, I decied to use Acronis True Image 2014 because my SSD came with a key for the program. Unfortunately, it turned out to be one of the **** programs I've had the misfortune of using, but I'll leave my complaints about it out of the discussion.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
I made a backup of the 1TB HDD on my PC, which contains the Windows 8 drive as well as several recovery partitions using Acronis. I backed up the nearly 300 GB to an external hard drive. I then created a bootable flash drive with the Acronis program on there.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
I replaced the HDD with my new SSD rather easily. I turned on the computer and (after much difficulty because Acronis sucks ****) I booted into the Acronis program and after a nice 2 hrs waited for all of the partitions to be restored, as well as the MBR and
 master file table.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
Well, the computer will not boot. It recognizes that there is an MBR there on the SSD but something is wrong with it. I've tried this process multiple times and done a bunch of other things that didn't work and I've wasted my entire weekend.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
So now I have the old HDD back in the computer.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(111, 113, 112, 1)">
Is there any way I can get this to work with Acronis? Am I doing something wrong? Any help would be appreciated. Thank you</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have any luck selecting a Boot Device, you may need to try one of the other options...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your new SSD may not work if you checked the MBR and Track 0...</p>
<p>If you were restoring the image to the same drive it came from, that MIGHT be OK, but not on a different size drive... You may need to reload the image to the new SSD...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this happen a number of times when I wasn't paying attention...</p>
<p>It also took awhile to figure out why things were not working....</p>
<p>Common Sense tells you that you should select the entire disk, but that usually doesn't work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you go through all of that trouble though, you might try setting your Windows partition as "ACTIVE"... Disk Management won't do this...</p>
<p>That may be the&nbsp; reason the Startup Repair couldn't fix the problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have 3rd party program to do this, an easy one to use is Partition Wizard 9.</p>
<p>It's free, and comes as an ISO that can be burned to a bootable CD...</p>

<p>

</p><p>There is a 3rd party tool called YUMI that will put Partition Wizard 9 on a bootable flash drive should that be needed...</p>

<h2>            Pictures...where&#47;how does Windows store this vital info &#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This is something that has puzzled me and I haven't found the answer too. It's to do with where data for "edited" photos is held, the data that allows the image to be "reverted". The example here is using and editing an image directly on an SD card as the
 numbers show easily to explain what I mean, exactly the same happens with images edited on the HDD.<br />
Taking this to a silly extreme, if you cropped all your pictures down to virtually nothing, they then take "vitually no space up". Yet thay all have the property to "revert".</p>
<p>The question is where and how is this info held... does it take as much space as the original image etc ?</p>
<p>Example,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I format a small 256 mb SD card,&nbsp;setting the card to it's "defaults" and it shows 255,565,824 bytes free. The starting point.</p>
<p>2. Picture is added of nominal 3.3mb size. The free space is now 252,096,512. in other words 3.3mb space taken as expected.</p>
<p>3. I open the picture in Windows Photo Gallery and crop it down to around 21kb in size. The free space is now 255,541,248 with just 24kb in total used.</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<p>If this cropped image is opened the ability to "revert" is present.</p>
<p>Where is this info held to rebuild the image ? Is there 3.3mb of data held somewhere to revert this image. The same question applies to when the image is on the HDD too. Where is the information to revert the image held.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's something that has puzzled me for a long time.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            My computer&#47;control panel&#47;folders etc won&#39;t open.</h2>
                    
<p>I started my laptop the other day, and the start bar/desktop/everything seemed to be gone. I could ctrl alt del and open certain things through task manager, and kept running virus checking software and various other updates etc, and restarting... and my
 desktop finally came back (but my wireless internet was blocked). I kept running random things until my internet was working again (I'm not entirely sure how I got it back) but Control Panel, My Computer, Windows Update, and general folders etc won't open,
 and just give me the following&nbsp;message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;"This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action. Please install a program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel."</p>
<p>And seeing the "windows" sticker is on the bottom of my laptop (and I didn't write the details down when I got it) all of the numbers etc have worn off it, so I can't reinstall windows (windows was pre-installed when I bought it)</p>
<p>If anyone can help, I would appreciate it. <br />
Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Syed, <br />
<br />
Thank you very much for your time, I tried all of your suggestions, but it said there were no problems, and after restarting my laptop, the problem is still there.</p>
<p>The virus program that I am running is Norton 360, which I purchased along with the laptop, and I don't remember making any changes before the problem occured. Do you think there are any other options available?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much again for your time and effort,</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Paul</p>

<p>Hi armtheinsane,</p>
<p>I suggest performing a clean boot to see if a startup program might be causing a conflict and delaying the Desktop for loading:</p>

<p>Thanks for your suggestion Chris,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried this, but the problem is still there. The problem is not the desktop loading anymore, that problem has fixed itself, the problem is control panel and folders and my coputer etc won't open, and give an error message instead (&nbsp;"This file does not have
 a program associated with it for performing this action. Please install a program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel.")</p>

<p>Looking for info on your <a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/productkeysactivation/ht/windows-7-key.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
product key</a>? How badly worn is the sticker? I think you have a worm or a virus! See anything about this copy of windows is not genuine in the lower left corner of your desktop? If you can get to the internet do a free scan at mcafee or something. Does it
 look like your hard drive is filling up? Do you or your friends have a windows7 disk, a real one? Try to run startup repair (which is sfc) but it should be fixing that stuff. If you have to take norton off your computer and try a free one like avg, better
 anyway imo.</p>

<p>sounds like something I had back in the day when I was running windows 98.</p>
<p>a malicious software had been installed on my PC and the anti-virus caught it, but only after it was installed.&nbsp; once it was removed by the anti-virus it fialed to open any type of exe file including Explorer.exe.</p>
<p>now just as a test.&nbsp; if you go into Task manager and on the applications tab, then click new task at the bottom right and type explorer.exe</p>
<p>this should open a basic windows explorer menu and give you access to your files and control panel.</p>
<p>if you get that error again than it is most likely the same thing that happened to me and it means something was maliciously changed in your Registry.</p>

<p>Thanks very much Kathusela, the sticker is very worn (it's on the bottom of the laptop, and I guess the numbers have all worn off when the sticker has rubbed up against stuff, all that I can read is that the sticker is not to be sold seperately and it's
 a proof of license certificate of authenticity). I don't see anything about windows not being genuine in the corner of my desktop, I hope it's a genuine copy of windows, as I bought the laptop (with windows installed) brand new at a reputable dealer (I didn't
 think to take the sticker off and stick it somewhere else, but will definitely do that next time) My hard drive is nowhere near full, and I wasn't given a windows disc with the laptop (when I asked, he told me that windows 7 was already installed and I wouldn't
 need it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried the startup repiar, and nothing was any different, I will try run AVG, and see how that goes. But the computer salesman told me that norton 360 was the best antivirus available, and charged me $100 for it, so I was kinda hoping that it would
 be better than a free antivirus! Trust me to get ripped off!!</p>
<p>Thankyou for your help :)</p>
<p>P.S. I downloaded one of those keyfinding programs, and I think it found the key, but am not 100% sure, I might download another one and see that they both come up with the same key. Thankyou</p>

<h2>            BSOD Everytime I go on Wolfteam</h2>
                    Hey, I was just wondering weather you can help me with this common problem. Every time I open a game called "wolfteam" (yea i know you don't do games) but its a common problem. I have researched and tried to install it again but still happens. It says
 the problem was caused by the files watchdog.sys, dxgkrnl.sys, and ntkrnlpa.exe. Is it because of the computer like its dirty, or the software or something else........
<div>I don't know what to do can you please help me</div>
<div>Thanks &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2.What is the exact and complete error message?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>3.Is the game installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1.</span></b></p>
<p><span>You may contact the game vendor to see if the game is compatible with Win 7 or not as we don't have the compatibility information according to this link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Software&amp;s=Wolfteam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Software&amp;s=Wolfteam</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2.</b></p>
<p>Setting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>

<p><span>Note:</span><span> After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow <span>Step 7</span> in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3.</span></b></p>
<p><strong><span>Resolving stop (blue screen) errors in Windows 7</span></strong><b><span><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Important: While performing check disk on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found, then check disk will try to repair that sector. Any data available on that sector might be lost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 4.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Try to update graphics and display driver and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 5.</span></b></p>
<p><span>You may </span><span>install the game in compatibility mode and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

So I have:<br />
Mine<br />

            <p>Hi edelmanr,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I understand that you want to reposition the email accounts that you have on Windows Live Mail. You can simply do this by
<strong>right-clicking</strong> on the email account and then choose to either <strong>
Move up</strong> or <strong>Move down</strong> to reposition them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to ask if you have further questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Johan</p>
