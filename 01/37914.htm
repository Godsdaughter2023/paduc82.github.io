<h2>            Can&#39;t complete installation-error code 0xc0000001 &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    Hey guys. I'm installing windows 8.1 from my bootable USB &nbsp;flash drive, but everytime the first restart/reboot of the installation process, it says that my PC fails to start and needs to be repaired. It says 'error code: 0xc000001' . What should I do?
 Please help.

<p>Does it give options in game for keyboard or controller also can you see the joystick in the options in game to enable or customise? Did this controller work with Windows 7 or 8,? You can set compatability for previous versions if it worked then.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other thing is to see if any patches on game sites... Good luck&nbsp;</p>

            Jordan, I have my Sidewinder 2 working it just loaded once connected. The only hint I can give you is try a different USB slot. I have experienced devices working on some USB and not on others. WHY I HAVE NO IDEA. Plug and pray hey. However one thing I
 can say is that you should try the option of unplugging and then reconnecting as per above. As far as drivers etc I am sure I could not find anything like you. I also had issues with the controller crashing when I tried to calibrate it. I found the controller
 software and after that no issues. Works on Steam and other Direct Games I play VIA internet or loaded locally. I know I have really told you nothing but hopefully trying a new USB works for ya. You know when you buy a controller hoping its going to work ten
 years and not break. Great hey till you run into this :)<br />

<p>The USB works on other things for some reason it puts the driver for the controller on 1 USB and not the other which means it is a software issue. If I reinstall the software on the new USB it works....yes I should have mentioned this but I was trying the
 KISS principle :p<br />

<h2>            3 unresolved issues with Windows 10 - please help if you can</h2>
                    <p>MS designs the worst software I have ever used. Their MS Assure techs don't know much about MS products either and constantly need to put customers on hold as they disappear for long periods of time from to look up things that aren't on whatever simple algorithms
 MS provides them with to try to solve customer issues with MS's bug-ridden, poorly designed products that don't seem to integrate well with any other systems, including even the simple things, like CD drives, that run on MS machines. Bizarre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two PC's running Windows 10 with problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On one machine, the installation of Windows 10 made my CD drive stop working. It's a common problem, among many others with Windows 10, from what I can find on non-MS websites but I haven't been able to find a solution on line to this problem. MS needs to
 hire hackers who know how to code stuff that actually works. All they seem capable of hacking is cumbersome, poorly designed systems. &nbsp;Does anyone out there know how to solve this problem with Windows 10 making CD drives stop working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other PC is a brand new Dell XPS 8700 with i5-4460 CPU @ 3.2GHZ, 8.00 GB RAM, 64 bit OS, x64-based microprocessor. It has never completed a back up on a Seagate 2TB Expansion Desktop External Drive - USB 3.0. &nbsp;This too is yet another problem with PC's
 running MS's inferior, bug-ridden systems that I have found on many non-MS sites. Does anyone know how to solve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, anyone know how to remove the lock screen image? I don't need to see some serene scene every time my machine boots or wakes up from sleep mode that I need to hit a key on the keyboard to get rid of so I can get to the login screen?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My friends all have Apple machines and never have problems with them and my other PC running Ubuntu is a great machine with a completely transparent and accessible operating system, including access to the kernel code. MS stuff is mostly just obscure garbage
 run by the most cumbersome OS and other systems I have ever used.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>MS error codes are nearly meaningless but it's 0x8078014B for what it's worth. &nbsp;I purchased the machine earlier this year before Windows 10 was released so it came with Windows 7 and it has never once backed up. I've never had any new MS products work properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS just codes crappy software. I'm surprised people buy their ****. It's really inferior. I love my Ubuntu machine. It actually works like a PC is supposed to. I am so glad that Apple and Google's Android, which are both Unix/Linux kernels, took over the
 smart phone market before MS could pollute that with their garbage. Outlook 2013 completely screwed up my Outlook 2003 files and the unqualified Assure "tech" when he set it up blew by a few errors as I watched him set it up. I went back and corrected them
 but now my inbox is filled with triplicate emails of every single email and my calendar is all messed up. It's horrible how incompetent MS techs are and MS has the nerve to charge for Assure. MS products are so inferior that MS can't even properly train people
 to use them. I am surprised MS is still in business.</p>

    <title>Rat Attack Glitch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tallion myst  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rat Attack Glitch</h2>
                    
<p>My son, my wife, and I all three have characters and play Oblivion 5th Anniversary.&nbsp; My wife has run into a problem that the other of us 2 have not had.&nbsp; When she gets attacked by a rat, she just gets pushed into a corner and can never move, attack, cast,
 or do ANYTHING at all other than just stand there and die.&nbsp; This wasn't an issue until she went into the Elven Gardens Sewers.&nbsp; She is the only one that does not have a XBox Live account (if this could be an issue).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Is there anything that we can do?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

            <p>Hello Vinklee_texe, <br />
<br />
I suggest a "repair upgrade" to install Windows 7 over Windows 7 (using the same media as the first time, of course - edition, language, architecture, etc. must be identical).<br />
<br />
Here's is a detailed tutorial of How-To: <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/3413-repair-install.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/3413-repair-install.html</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you don't have a installation disc, you can download the correct version of Windows 7 from the following location:
</p>
<p>Download the corresponding edition of Windows 7 with SP1 integrated that you have a license for:</p>

You will need to use the product key you already have for your computer. </p>

<h2>            Problem with file sharing...&#40;HELP&#33;&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Right, I have 3 computers on my network, all connected through my router. They all have no problem connecting to the internet.</p>
<p>Computer 1 - Windows XP, wired to router</p>
<p>Computer 2 - Vista, Wireless</p>
<p>Computer 3 - Windows 7, Wired.</p>
<p>All of these are in the same workgroup and have file sharing enabled. I have also disabled all firewalls, including the router.</p>
<p>Computer 1 and 2 can share files to&nbsp;each other&nbsp;perfectly. However, computer 3 seems to have a problem connecting to the others. When&nbsp;I&nbsp;go to the network it shows all of the computers, but cannot connect to any of them. I can open computer 3 (from computer
 3's network places), but when&nbsp;I&nbsp;try to open the folders it says they 'could not be reached' - even though their on that PC! (But&nbsp;I&nbsp;can open them when finding the folder on the C:, not from network places).</p>
<p>Computer 3 is also listed on Computer 1 and 2's network places, but will not connect, computer 2 displays a messages about not being able to&nbsp;access&nbsp;port 445. I also did a port check on the internet (cant remember the website) and it showed all of my ports
 were in stealth mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have only just purchased computer 3, and i understand that he upgraded from windows xp to windows 7 a few months ago,&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't&nbsp;know if that could possibly have anything to do with this? Also could this be caused by him not uninstalling a firewall properly?</p>
<p>one other thing to mention is all computers can ping each other (IP&nbsp;address&nbsp;and computername)&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for anyone who can help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>Maybe this can Help.</div>
<p><em><strong>---------------------<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The following looks like a long story<strong> (it is only 600 words)</strong></strong></em>.<em><strong> I do not know what the user's overall knowledge is, and what exactly was already done. Thus the info goes through the motions
 of configuring and checking most of the common aspects of Windows OS' LAN features.</strong></em></p>
<p>All aspects should be checked, stating that it<strong> "worked before"</strong> , or perseverating on<strong>"I did Not do any thing</strong> ", is not a way to deal with<strong>current Sharing problems.
</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>----------------------</strong> </em></p>
<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network has <strong>three</strong> types of Sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup Network</strong> = Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Work Network</strong> = Basically similar to the previous methods of sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing</strong> = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a Network with the same name while each computer has its own unique name.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted
 Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq.html#trusted<br />
</a><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd
 party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p>-----------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Networking&nbsp;Win 7 with other version of Windows as&nbsp; Work Network.</strong></p>
<p>In the Network Center, clicking on the Network type opens the window to the right.</p>
<p>Choose your type of Network. Notice the check mark at the bottom, and check/uncheck it according to your needs.</p>

<p>-------------</p>
<p><strong>If you have Permission and Security issues, check the <strong>following</strong> settings.</strong></p>

<p><strong>In both the Security panel, and the Permission panel you have to highlight each User/Group and examine that the Permission Controls are checked correctly.</strong></p>

<p><strong>**Note</strong> . You have to establish specific users. <strong>Everyone</strong> means all of the users that already have an account and been established as users. It does not mean<strong> Everyone</strong> that feel that they would like to login.</p>

            Hey, thanks for the reply. Should have mentioned that the network is set as 'Home' or 'Private' on all computers. so I don't think that is the issue. Also, the folder that I'm trying to share has permissions and security set to 'everyone'. Any other ideas?

<blockquote>Also, the folder that I'm trying to share has permissions and security set to 'everyone'. Any other ideas?</blockquote>
<p>Whether you use <strong>Everyone</strong> or not, account has to be set for all users that are llowed to use the share.<br />
------------------------------</p>
<p>If accounts are set only for John, Jill, and Jack, using the Everyone setting in the Folder Permissions saves the effort of setting Permission separately for John, Jill, and Jack.<br />
<br />
Everyone else is Not in the Everyone group, only John, Jill, and Jack.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
What that means? It means that users have to be established on each computer network that participated in sharing.<br />
<br />
Then if you want to same permission to all of them, you do not have to enter them one by one&nbsp; use Everyone.</p>

            But i cant even connect to the computer, so surely its not a problem with the permissions of a file inside it. I personally think it is a problem with firewall/ports, not permissions.&nbsp;

<p>Hi AmyFulthorpe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the possible reasons why you are unable to see the subscription on Skype website:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are signed in to a different account. If this is the case, kindly sign out and manually sign back in using your Skype user name or the account name indicated on the order details that our system sent to your email address.</li><li>Or, the subscription you want to cancel is a Skype number. If it is Skype number, to cancel it, sign in to Skype website using your Skype user name &gt; under manage features, click on Skype number tab, then click on Settings &gt; then click on Cancel button.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that this information helps!<br />

            Had the same problem, both on my tablet and on my computer - the "manage" button simply didn't show, only a button to "buy now" a different subscription. -- My solution: I used a different browser that I had never used with Skype before (Brave), logged
 into my skype account, and suddenly the "manage" button was where it should be. So I could actually cancel my subscription. Not sure I'll be back, though.<br />

<p>Sorry to hear that. A different browser still worked for me. There was no "manage" button logging in via my Android Tablet or Mozilla Firefox, but using the Brave browser, the "manage" is always accessable now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I agree, canceling the entire account is probably the best solution, if you can. Even after I canceled my trial subscription and payment method, I received another funny email from Skype announcing that they would bill me once my trial period ended.
 And no hotline to contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But then, how do you cancel the entire account? Let us know once you actually did it! Because I don't see anything in my account that would enable me to do that.</p>

    <title>Remove items from right-click menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danae72  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove items from right-click menu</h2>
                    Okay, I wanted to remove items from the right-click context menu in certain situations (I'm using Windows 8 64-bit). Before installing a program for only one use, I want to make sure that it will actually work, because the items I want to remove aren't
 any I've seen asked about -- or rather I saw it once, for an older version of Windows, and the solution didn't apply.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I want to remove the "Share With" item. I rather doubt I'll be using that option ever on this computer, so why have it taking up space?</li><li>When right clicking on a Word document (I'm using Office 2007) I get "Open", "New", "Edit", and "Print". I'd like to get rid of all except "Open"</li><li>When right clicking on a PDF document, I get "Open with Adobe Reader XI", "Open", and "Print". I'd like to get rid of the "Print".</li></ul>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm sure for some people, these are very useful and even necessary. At this point, for me, they aren't. I always keep note of changes I've made in case I need to reverse in future, but if I plan on editing a word document, I'll just open it. The document
 needs to open before printing, so...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Although I appreciate all help, and not to be picky, but please make sure your answer is relevant. I've received answers sometimes (and seen other questions answered) with information that does not apply to either the proper version of Windows or the program.
 If you give an answer that worked for Windows Vista or even Windows 7, make sure it will also apply to Windows 8, because I've discovered, not many things do!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

 menu and choose Settings to get the "create a restore point" link).&nbsp; 60 seconds spent making these two backups can sure come in handy if any problems arise.</p>

<h2>            System hangs with a buzzing noise when playing DOTA 2 online after upgrading to Windows 10 Anniversary upgrade version.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have upgraded my system to Windows 10 latest updates. After the upgrade I connected to steam and started playing DOTA 2 - online game. After few minutes my PC got hanged with a continuous buzzing sound.&nbsp; There is no&nbsp;function or key that works and I&nbsp;had
 to force restart to recover. This does not happen when I browse or work normally in PC. Do I have to downgrade or what is the solution?</p>

            From what I can see Printmaster Platinum V17 was released for Win XP.  So it is entirely possible that some part of Windows that Printmaster was depending on has been removed because it was considered "obsolete". 
<br />
<br />You should contact Broderbund support to see if they have any suggestions.

            Uninstalling will not remove files created with it. You have a couple options you could consider. You can try reinstalling using compatibility mode:
<br />
<br />Run Old Software on Windows 10 with Compatibility Mode - groovyPost
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work out, you could try setting up a virtual machine with a compatible version of Windows and install it there:
<br />

<br />
<br />If none of the above are viable options, then you might want to considering upgrading to a compatible version.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are the Adobe programs working correctly on the PC?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SideBySide errors are typically caused by the current Microsoft Visual C++ version not being backward compatible with the application that failed.&nbsp; In this case it refers to Adobe programs.</p>
<p>Check the link for <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2019667/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
latest supported Visual C++ downloads</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The file ARKCmdCaps.dll is part of the OOBE (Out-of-box experience) folder of Adobe programs in the Common Files folder. The term OOBE includes the setup process and the initial configuration of a piece of software, as the preparation for the first usage
 of the product.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the Adobe program and check if it helps.</p>
<p>a. Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, choose <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.</p>
<p>b. Find the Adobe program, right-click on that and choose Uninstall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also refer to this thread.&nbsp; The affected program is different in this thread.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_programs/event-id-33-source-side-by-side/ef67e34f-07b2-4d52-a807-f9f81a7c32f8">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_programs/event-id-33-source-side-by-side/ef67e34f-07b2-4d52-a807-f9f81a7c32f8</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;Note: Also applies to Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to post your query in the Adobe support forum.</p>

    <title>Vista memory diagnostic results error 1202 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Vista memory diagnostic results error 1202</h2>
                    Was wondering if anyone could possibly have a solution to the issues I have been experiencing. &nbsp;I have OS Vista Home Premium 32 bit system. &nbsp;Over the past while, the PC has been freezing. &nbsp;I ran a memory diagnostic check and it displayed that I had hardware
 problems. &nbsp;When I looked up the event in Admin Tools the number of the error was 1202. &nbsp;The RAM Speed was upgraded only a year ago to max 3gb (it was 1gb) and it was working fine until about two months ago. &nbsp;I did a system restore thinking it would resolve
 issues, it didn't. &nbsp;I've carried out a disk clean up. &nbsp;I've checked pc for virus and malware - nothing. &nbsp;So, it happened today that I ran a Mem Diag check and it's a hardware issue. &nbsp;If anyone could possibly shed some light on this before I bring it to a tech
 expert, that would be most helpful!! &nbsp;

<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span>The computer has been freezing and you get error 1202.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>The issue may occur if some of operating system files are missing or if there is issue with the RAM. To verify, I would suggest you to
 follow the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Method 1:
</strong></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Remove one RAM stick at a time and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Note: Do this only
</span><span>if you know how to do if not, ask someone who knows to do.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:
</span>System File Checker (SFC) Scan</strong></p>
<p><span>SFC scan will find any missing or incorrect system files and repairs them.</span></p>

    <title>Why doesn&#39;t SD card doesnt appear in my computer anymore&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mc3650  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t SD card doesnt appear in my computer anymore&#63; DIFFERENT than previous posts</h2>
                    So when i insert it, it makes the connection sound, but the ejection sound plays immediately afterward. It was working recently until after I installed some windows updates for windows 7. When i did a rollback, the problem was fixed but i reinstalled the
 updates and now i dont remember when those specific updates were installed which caused it to cease functioning properly. The card reader appears in the Device management console and i have tried uninstalling it, restarting my computer and going from there
 but to no avail. Even uninstalling and reinstalling the manufacturers drivers hasn't worked. The SD card does work on every other computer, and it isn't a problem that it is a SDHC card because, as i mentioned, it was working previously.
<br />
<br />
What other steps can i take instead of just reinstalling windows?<br />

            Hi, <br />
<br />
I think you might be right, this does sound like it might be a power issue. Please try the following:
<br />
<br />
Click the <span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span> button and search for <span style="font-weight: bold">
Device Manager </span><br />
<br />
At the bottom of the window should be the the <span style="font-weight: bold">Universal Serial Bus (USB) Controllers
</span><br />
If you click it, it should open a list tree below. <br />
You'll want to find the <span style="font-weight: bold">USB Root Hub</span> (you may have multiple USB Root Hubs)
<br />
<br />
Right click on the <span style="font-weight: bold">USB Root Hub</span> and click <span style="font-weight: bold">
Properties</span><br />
In the new window, click the <span style="font-weight: bold">Power Management</span> tab
<br />
<br />
Make sure the checkbox labled "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" is<span style="font-weight: bold"> Not
</span>checked. <br />
<br />
Note: If you have multiple USB Root Hubs, you may need to do this for each one unless you can tell which is the specific one you need.
<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this helps. <br />

<h2>            Unable to wake Win8 pc using usb keyboard&#47;mouse</h2>
                    After approx 30-40 mins of the PC going to sleep I'm unable to rewaken the PC with either my keyboard or mouse, curiously I have to reboot the PC and although it reloads the OS it goes straight to the users page showing me as locked and when I enter the
 password every thing's is as it was before I rebooted even logged in applications are live. I'm using Win 8 Pro fully patched with 8 Gb ram, and the MS USB comfort 5000 keyboard / mouse.

    <title>Surface book lock up. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gaborfeeney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface book lock up.</h2>
                    <p>My surface book continues to be very unreliable particularly when starting, it won't boot to log in option and just locks up. They only way I can restart is by holding down the on button. Can up to three or four goes to get it to start properly. This is
 particularly frustrating when trying to present to a client and I couldn't imagine it is very good for the computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My feeling is that the surface book is a dud and still needs development to get them reliable. Would not advice anyone to purchase one considering all the problems I have experienced, some of issues listed below. It's a real pity because it's great when
 its working. Reliability is not negotiable for a work tool.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Battery life in very poor still, even after all updates have been installed. Still only getting about 4 hours max.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Locking up on start up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Crashing when disengaging the screen to use in tablet mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I can gather these are commons issues people have been facing with the new surface book.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I had the chance I would certainly like my money back and buy some thing that is not going to be continuously problematic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interested to see if others are as frustrated with the new surface book?</p>
<p>

            I have had my surface book now for 3 months and very disappointed with it as it crashes often when disengaging the screen. Often processor running on full memory capacity (mostly with office 365) and struggling although I have 16G Ram&nbsp;version specially
 working with my office 365 I have lost many hours of my work working with Excel 2016. I will not recommend it as currently is.

<p>Yes it does, but its not 100% guaranteed to work correctly. It works for some programs but not for all.</p>
<p>Right-click your program, properties, &lt;compatibility&gt; tab, tick 'run in compatibility mode' and W95 is top of the list. There are also some specific options like use 640x480 res or use 256 colours etc.</p>
<p>But nothing is certain as to if the program will run or not.</p>

    <title>How to add context menu commands for file types &#40;add - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skie_m  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to add context menu commands for file types &#40;add associations&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I like to download anime and re-encode to standard dvd format (mpeg2) before burning to a DVD for better quality.&nbsp; I have a program suite that takes care of the grunt work, but there needs to be a context menu command that calls the initial batch file
 which the user has to manually add to the context menu through file association.&nbsp; I have found that I can enter the file associations menus, but the option to add a new association to an existing filetype does not seem to exist.&nbsp; Is there a registry entry
 I must modify or add in order to allow me to customize my context menues in Windows 7?

            In the file and folder defaults, I can set Queue.bat as the default action to open the file .....<br />
<br />
And then change it back to Windows Media Player or Media Player Classic to auto-play the file ...<br />
<br />
When I want to queue the file for encoding, I can use the "open with" context menu and select "Queue"&nbsp; This seems to be the best solution for this problem, though I wish I could edit the context menu like before.<br />

            create a new text file (make sure you have the setting where you DO NOT hide known file extensions unmarked)<br />
<br />
edit the new text file... copy the following:&nbsp; [quote]<br />
<br />
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
<br />
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\WMP11.AssocFile.AVI\shell\Queue For Encoding]<br />
@="&amp;Queue For Encoding"<br />

save the text file .... rename the text file to have an extension of .reg<br />

double-click the new registry file to add the context menu commands to your registry... all done! :)<br />
