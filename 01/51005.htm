<h2>            All File, Icon and folder names disappeared from my desktop after Creators upgrade.</h2>
                    <p>Is anyone else having problems with the Creators upgrade? I have tried it twice and both times, all text disappeared from my desktop. The icons are there, but no filenames or other text. The same happens with my app programs - the pages' forms load with
 no text in them. Also, Word and Excel files open with blank pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had to uninstall twice.</p>

<p><strong>I am&nbsp;experiencing some problems with my OS. I decided to run the Microsoft Fix it Automated troubleshooting Services. I ran the installer and then it told me&nbsp;<span><strong>&nbsp;"Windows PowerShell is required before we continue.
 It gave me 2 options "Install Windows PowerShell 1.0" or "Skip this installation and Microsoft Fix it diagnosis." I clicked on Install PowerShell. Then the install box froze (not responding) and then it went back to normal with the 2 options. Its like I never
 clicked anything. So I clicked Install PowerShell again, But still it did the same it ,wouldnt do any thing.&nbsp;</strong></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><strong>How do I run the program?</strong></span></strong></p>

    <title>Music and Playlist problems with Groove Music - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sonic98  say:</h3>
<h2>            Music and Playlist problems with Groove Music</h2>
                    <p>Is there a known issue with Groove Music in either the latest build or it's latest update. Over the years I noticed that XBox Music and Groove Music downloaded music in a strange way. If I wanted to make a playlist available offline, it wasn't simply downloading
 music from OneDrive into the default music location. It hadn't even preserved the name of the file. Now in the last few days I just noticed a couple problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I'm starting to see duplicate files. I'm starting to see files I downloaded manually as well as those files in "OneDrive Cache." Before they all just showed up as the song tile. Now some show up as that funny file name.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. All of the sudden a lot of my songs on playlist are showing as streaming only.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Some playlists let me re-order them and some don't. </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Some songs are now listed under unknown artist instead of the artist for the song, I guess because not both artist and album artist are filled out in the file data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. A lot of my playlist are having a problem I once saw in the old XBox Music app. Adding a song to the playlist seems to make the playlist reorder itself.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a Lumia 640 on the latest mobile build and all apps completely up to date. I've had no real problems with Groove since I first upgraded to Windows 10 Mobile. I've recently done a master reset. This is a strange issue.</p>

                    <p>Since upgrading to Windows 10 my btinternet email account on my laptop has gained a "Sent Item" folder as well as a "Sent" one.&nbsp; Emails sent from my laptop go into this "Sent Items" folder and are not visible on my Ipad and smartphone when I look at my emails

            <p>Hi Sayan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your comments.&nbsp; I believe the problem is in the settings for my btinternet account on my laptop running Windows 10.&nbsp;On my smartphone in its "Settings" for this email account I have options as to where sent messages go, on both the phone and on
 the server.&nbsp; I have both of these set to the "Sent" folder and this makes all messages sent from the smartphone appear in the "Sent" folder no matter which device I use to view my email account.&nbsp; Where are these options in Windows 10?&nbsp; At the moment sent items
 from my laptop are being put in the "Sent Items" folder which is unhelpful and I want to change this so that they go into the "Sent" folder on the server.&nbsp; How can I do this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Brian</p>

<h2>            So many problems - can they be fixed please&#63;</h2>
                    <p>1.&nbsp; Can the small Skype popup window remember where it was put and how it was resized?&nbsp; Every single time I make a call it goes back to the same default spot and size - I have move the window and make it smaller so it's not in the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Can buttons for conference AND dial pad be on the Skype pop up?&nbsp; It's annoying to ALT + TAB back to the main window every time just to do these simple things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Conference calls:&nbsp; Can I please just be able to paste a phone number into the field?&nbsp; Why do they have to be in my contacts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; When I press CTRL + D to make a new call, it highlights the CLOSE button, and not the field where I can put in the phone number.&nbsp; So I have to click into the number field before pasting.&nbsp; Defeats the point of the having a shortcut key to make a new call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; Can the number keys PLEASE operate the dial pad to enter extension numbers?</p>

            Understand our frustrations about how none of the Skype team seem to even look at the uservoice page and barely respond to problems when they do. There is a lot more to feedback than hundreds of people shouting into the void and one person acknowledging
 the noise after a month, we need a more consistent, constant dialogue.

    <title>Credential Manager PIN - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rgb66rgb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Credential Manager PIN</h2>
                    <p>I routinely use the Windows 10 Credential Manager (CM) to view forgotten internet passwords.&nbsp; Works great.&nbsp; Can't live without it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use a PIN to log into Windows, which is (and always has been) associated and logged into my corresponding MS live account. No problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the start of Windows 10, I've been able to use&nbsp;that PIN to "Show" the hidden passwords in CM.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, for fun, I deselected "user must enter a username and password to use this computer"&nbsp;using Run &gt;&nbsp;control userpasswords2.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was tired of having to enter PIN at Windows login at first boot.&nbsp; Only I use this computer, so what the heck? One less login
 password I need to enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After&nbsp;turning this off,&nbsp;I opened CM and discovered it wanted me to sign in to view a stored password not with my PIN but only&nbsp;with my MS live account PW.&nbsp;&nbsp; No "Use PIN" option was available.&nbsp;&nbsp; That wouldn't do at all, so I changed the control userpassword2
 setting back to require login, rebooted, and presumed things would be as before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nope.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now whenever I try to view an internet password stored in&nbsp;CM&nbsp;I get&nbsp;the security dialog requiring my windows live login via password.&nbsp; No PW option available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get CM to let me use my PIN to view CM data again?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows should not be this hard.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Deepika ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was/am a member of the administrators group ... that's pretty well the first thing I set when I install Windows.&nbsp; I confirmed this using your suggestions and indeed that is the case today as always.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PIN works fine when logging into the _machine_; it is just the Credential Manager that now always wants me to log in using my Windows live account password. (My machine is always logged in to live to use onedrive and save settings).&nbsp; I have also tried
 deleting then recreating the PIN.&nbsp; This does not change the issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Responding to say I confirmed my account is already part of the administrators group.&nbsp; The problem persists.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me this change occurred shortly after I made a change to regional settings to select English US, rather than English UK, as the preferred region.&nbsp;This was in regards to a suggestion to correct an indexing issue I am having (saying 'not quite
 ready yet' when searching for items under Settings, but getting the expected items from the Cortana search box - there's a separate thread on this under Win 10).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;What is confounding me is the actual login dialog looks totally different than it did when I was logging on using the PIN :
</p>
<p>
</p><p>what I used to get (taken from web as example) </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d093e8d-9f6a-460b-8ed8-167c970df93f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d093e8d-9f6a-460b-8ed8-167c970df93f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>... and what I get now.&nbsp; Clicking 'more' only presents the log on as another user option.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11d81d2d-d9f1-464d-9c07-1935070c46cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11d81d2d-d9f1-464d-9c07-1935070c46cd" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And further, what is especially confounding is that the Windows Sign-in options screen states "you can use this PIN to sign into Windows, apps, and services".&nbsp; Yet I can't. Yes, I can use a PIN to log into Windows when it first starts, but not in Cred Mgr.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I am signed into my MS live account.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Changing user interface language in Windows 7 Home premium</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have created two recovery media from Toshiba recovery media Crater. However, when I have booted that two media, I foud out that my own language(Arabic) isn't available. However, there are many other languages. The windows system is Windows 7(64Bit) Home
 premium. <br />
Thus, the interface was in English. Since the Windows home premium doesn't allow a user to install another language, I would like anyone to let me know how I can change the user interface from English language into Arabic.</p>
<p><br />
I really have heard that some people can change the language of Windows home premium into Arabic.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no valid and working way to completely change display language on Home Premium. Your only option is to upgrade to Ultimate and then use language packs to change the display language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your Windows language is English, French, Spanish or Russian you might be able to install a Language Interface Pack (LIP) in your language that changes the most common menus and dialogs to your chosen language. However, according to official LIP site
 of Microsoft an Arabic LIP for instance does not exist.<br />

Thanks a lot
<div>&nbsp;Yes, the base language of the recovery media setup of my windows &nbsp;7 home premium can be chosen an English, Spanish, German language and so on, languages, except Arabic.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, I've put my laptop in the retailer from whom I have purchased it and he converted the interface from English into Arabic. I really don't know how he did. Is there any program to convert the language from English into Arabic.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Yes, I am only needing to change the display language in the menus.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am completely sure that even 'Install/remove language' button is not available in the Region and language in Windows 7 home premium's control panel.</div>

Thanks a lot,</p>
<p>I wish that you understood me very well.</p>
<p>I have said in my very first post that my Windows version(Home Premium) coming from the factory was only in an English language. However, I didn't know how that retailer I purchased my laptop from let Windows 7 get in Arabic user interface. I thought he
 installed some program</p>
<p>I hope you let me know if&nbsp; I can find that program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Besides, I've checked another laptop whose brand is Dell and I found that Windows 7 Home permium coming with it can allow the user to install additional language because there is a 'install/remove' button. If you have looked at this screenshot below, you
 will see that base lanuge is Arabic</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c35ce31-dc84-4b4d-9fed-2786fa063275" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I've checked another laptop whose brand is HP and I found&nbsp;I can install&nbsp;Windows home premium with either English or Arabic. In other words, Factory Recovery discs let me choose Arabic or English while installing Windows 7 from Discs, However, I cannot
 install additional lanuguge becaue there is no 'remove and isntall language' button.</p>

<p>Some Windows 7 home premium&nbsp;coming from Factory don't have the option to select&nbsp;some languages. For instance, the recovery discs of Windows 7 home premium coming from Factory of Toshiba laptops doesn't have 'An Arabic, an others". However, they are only
 English, French, Germany, Chinees, and so on. But&nbsp; I know&nbsp; retailers I purchased my laptop&nbsp;from&nbsp;had translated my windows 7&nbsp;Home premium&nbsp;&nbsp;with an English base lanuge into&nbsp;an Arabic langauge. I don't how they did.</p>

    <title>Screen Time Reporting for Children NOT Working&#63;&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Screen Time Reporting for Children NOT Working&#63;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a brand new HP computer (2 days old) running Windows 10. Was very excited about the parental controls. I immediately set up my two children as CHILD users and set day/time limits on their screen time. Yesterday was child&nbsp;#1's first day on the
 computer. I hung around to see how it went. He was made to log onto his own user. CHECK. He played on his approved gaming web site. CHECK. He got the "less than 15 minutes remaining" warning. CHECK. He got two more warnings, including the final "under two
 minutes remaining". CHECK. When his time was up, he was logged out. YAY! DOUBLE CHECK! So far so good. I was impressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, out of curiosity, I logged into my parent/admin portal on Microsoft to have a peek at what the reporting looked like. Under my son's user account for yesterday it indicated his total screen time use was 3 MINUTES. Huh? WHAT?! I was present for the
 entire 120 minutes he was allotted to play. Also, it indicated he was visiting web sites multiple times at 10:40 pm!! I was in the room with the vacant computer at the time and it was in sleep mode and my son was ASLEEP as well...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone anywhere (Microsoft?) please explain what is going on? If I can't reply on the reporting accuracy of my son's screen time, then what is the use? If I hadn't been home, I would have first praised him for his gaming restraint then punished him for
 being awake and playing when he shouldn't have been!&nbsp;PLEASE HELP!</p>

            <p><em><strong>I solved the problem</strong></em>. In every user account, in the "YOUR INFO" section, you have to go into "Edit Your personal info" and make sure you select your region, postal code and time zone. This is MICROSOFT SPECIFIC and will not take
 this information from your device!</p>
<p>

<h2>            DesignPro 5.0  ERROR 1722, and ERROR&#58; -1603 FATAL ERROR DURING INSTALLATION</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to install Avery's DesignPro 5.0 (also tried previous version 4.5), and get two&nbsp;errors:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1:&nbsp; Error 1722&nbsp; There is a problem with this Windows Installer package.&nbsp; A program run as part of the setup did not finish as expected.&nbsp; Contact your support personnel or package vendor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2:&nbsp; Error: -1603 Fatal error during installation.&nbsp; Consult Windows Installer Help (Msi.chm) or MSDN for more information.&nbsp; This one comes when the installer is removing the failed installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I googled these errors, but didn't find anything useful.&nbsp; Do I have a MS Installer problem?&nbsp; I am running XP Home SP3 with all current updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any suggestions.</p>

<p><br />
The only changes to my computer have been the automatic updates.&nbsp; The last program installed was a few months ago, and installed without any problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried both suggestions above.&nbsp; Method 1 - Windows Installer was already set to manual.&nbsp; I started the service.&nbsp; Received the same errors when trying to install DesignPro.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2 - Received no errors when unregistering and reregistering msiexec.&nbsp; Same errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Went to the MS knowledgebase.&nbsp; XP Home is in "simple file sharing" mode, and according to the article, cannot be changed.&nbsp; Folders are not encrypted, and not using a substitute drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It installs files, adds registry entries, and seems to get to about 80% done when the problem occurs.&nbsp; Then it rolls back, and gets the second error.&nbsp; I then&nbsp;downloaded DesignPro directly from Avery (first download came from Cnet), and get the same issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What do I check next?&nbsp; I appreciate the help!</p>

<h2>            Installing Windows 8 Pro</h2>
                    Have used the Upgrade assitance (UA) for Windows 8 pro - purchased the product through it - was not ready to upgrade the product at that precise time as UA was asking to remove two apps due to incompatibility. So I saved the product as an ISO file with
 the provided product key. The UA was closed.<br />
<br />
Later from various forums learned that those two applications will work with Windows 8 pro, just that those drivers will be appropriately get added when installing under Windows 8. After I uninstalled the two applications. I ran UA again - and it prompts me
 to purchase Windows 8 again!<br />
<br />
The ISO file is written on DVD - its bootable - is there a way for UA to take the DVD source? It sucks to keep asking for purchase option again.
<br />
<br />
What happens if I do an installation from the DVD? Will it upgrade from Win7 and keep the settings and programs?<br />
<br />
You know how frustrating it can be if something is missing...<br />

<p><br />
Hi Troy</p>
<p>I'm not aware of a keyboard shortcut to show those icons.</p>
<p>You can have the old style, where all icons are shown by clicking the Customize link when you expand the Notification Area. Select the option at the bottom of customize windw, "Always show all icons and notifications on the Taskbar. You can also select the
 behavior of any individual icon in that same window.</p>
<p>You can also drag an individual Notification Area&nbsp;icon up from the Taskbar and drop it on the small window to hide it. You can also expand the Notification Area and drag icons down to the Taskbar to make them visible.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p><span><span>Thank You for using Windows 7</span></span></p>

    <title>Faxing in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelfalke  say:</h3>
<h2>            Faxing in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I too am so sorry I upgraded to windows 10 from Windows 7. Seven was probably the best operating system you ever came out with. No wonder you decided to give away Windows 10. Nobody in their right minds would buy it. I too have a problem faxing out of 10.
 It seems to only allow tiff files to be sent. Why would you do this?? Are all your programmers brain dead?&nbsp; Why would you ruin something that has worked so well in previous versions?&nbsp; I just got rid of my analog phone line and if you cared at all you would
 have included a fax program that allows you to fax to the internet.&nbsp; the cheapest program I can subscribe to is $10 a month. Not cost worthy for a retired person who may only fax occasionally.&nbsp; Oh and BTW I had three computers with windows 7 and they worked
 fine. Now with windows 10 they are all glitchy.&nbsp; Way to go Microsoft. You have managed to continue your reputation of putting out products that we have to work the bugs out.&nbsp; Remember us when you remember how much Bill Gates profited from us.

<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
</p>
<p>I have recently restored windows after the registry was corrupted. I then re-installed windows live mail and then imported several years of emails from various sources. In the end, I had around 20 folders
 inside the storage folder. After spending several nights merging these into 2 folders, I exported them to an external drive for backup. When I checked the drive, things didn’t look right. I then checked the appdata storage location and this still contained
 the original restored folders and not the final version which I had spent several nights creating. I would like to know why the actual storage location does not contain the current structures which are shown inside windows live mail? How can I update the folders
 in the appdata storage? I restored around 30.000-40.000 emails with loads of duplicates, don’t makes a difference? I am using the latest version of windows live mail on windows 7 ultimate 64-bit.</p>

[quote user=RudiHorvath]After spending several nights merging these into 2 folders, I exported them to an external drive for backup[/quote]<br />
That is expected behavior.<br />
WLMail tracts the changes, but does not physically move the messages in the store folder.<br />
I have an email account that I named Other when I added the account.&nbsp; I have change the account name to Sommer.&nbsp; The account folder in the store folder is still called Other.<br />
This is why all changes to folders and messages should be made in WLMail.&nbsp; No changes should be made in the store folder.<br />
<br />
To have the WLMail folders match the store folder, create folders in WLMail.&nbsp; Drag and drop messages into open WLMail folders.

<p><span>Hi, Many thanks for the replies. I have started to copy the emails back into the main folders rather than the storage folders, so it will hopefully solve the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Once I get them back in the email folders, I plan to copy them to outlook 2010. This is because I had to restore the emails from lots
 of external places and some emails exist 8-10 times.</span></p>
<p><span>I am not looking forward to this as I need to uninstall 64 bit office and buy a copy of 32 bit office. I cannot believe that WLM is
 not compatible with office 2010 64 bit, even though they are both Microsoft &nbsp;products. Something to do with MAPI.</span></p>
<p><span>Anyway, btw, I have not yet found any good software which will work with WLM which deletes duplicate emails but I am told lots exist
 for outlook. Being another WLM user, do you by any chance know anything you can recommend which actually works which will delete duplicates?</span></p>

            Hi again, I have now successfully uninstalled ooutlook 64 bit and have installed outlook 32 bit in its place. I have started moving my emails over to outlook by first moving them from the WLM storage folders to a gmail account which has no size restrictions.
 Unfortunately, whilst I can store all my emails in gmail before moving them to outllok, it will only let me move around 1000 emails before I exceed the bandwisth restriction which freezes the a/c for 24 hours. So this is no good for me as it will take many
 weeks to migrate all my emails. So I have therefore decided to use the built in function within WLM which lets me export emails to exchange. This has thrown up 2 problems (which may be related), firstly, when I click on "all folders", as my WLM view is out
 of sync with the physical storage location in appdata, it is&nbsp;not copying&nbsp;the folders I can see when I open WLM. Secondly, if I click on "selected folders" and then highlight an individual folder I want to copy, it tells me it

I have tried to sync the folders by changing the compact database setting to "1 run" however, each time I exit, WLM just abends and restarts.<br />
I am attaching a screen print of the WLM folders, the AppData folders, and also the Error msg.<br />
Is there a reason why I am unable for force the sync of the folders? Is this a known WLM error?<br />

<p>Hi Joseph.B, many thanks for your post and for asking for the screenshots, which I have uploaded.<br />
<br />
There are 5 screenshots in all:<br />
1) WLM Folders OLD - original folders I see when I open WLM<br />
2) AppData Folders OLD - original folders physically stored in the AppData location<br />
3) WLM Error - the error I got when I set the compact option to 1 and exited WLM<br />
4) WLM Folders NEW - current folders inside WLM<br />
5) AppData Folders NEW - current folders physically stored in AppData location<br />
<br />
I have been through all of the folders in the AppData location and whilst I can see some of my WLM folders inside "storage folders" &gt; "imported all", they are still out of date (an old list of folders) with what I had.<br />
<br />
Also, while I am typing this, I can see that my "storage folders" inside WLM seems to be growing, so I am not 100% sure if it is slowly downloading emails from inside AppData.<br />
<br />
I cannot upload a 6th screenshot, but I now have the following folders:<br />
<br />
storage folders<br />
&gt; recovered items<br />

I wil leave the laptop connected up for a while and see if it pulls in any newer mail since 2008. This is still not ideal as my 2007 mail folder was called "M07" as shown on one of the screenshots, the one being restored "all mail 2007" is an old version.</p>

            Hi Melanie<br />
<br />
I left my pc on all day and gradually the emails returned, but the only problem is that the folders are what I had 2-3 weeks ago. I have spent some 30-40 hours over the past 2 weeks moving messages into new folders, so I can get rid of duplicates and now it
 looks like all my hard work was wasted as WLM has put back old folders.<br />
<br />
Some history : One reason for the extra effort is that I have emails going back as far as 2001. Following a recent issue with windows 7, where a standard windows 7 update caused a chkdsk to run which corrupted my regsitry, I had to reformat my hard drive as
 a windows repair install didnt work. I then had&nbsp;to restore emails from a variety of external drives and many backups taken during the past 2 years. This meant I ended up with many duplicates. I normally have around 40.000-50.000 emails stored, but last week
 I had over 420.000, mostly duplicates. These were stored in some 200 different folders.<br />
<br />
One reason I have to move emails around in folders is that where in some cases I had many copies&nbsp;of emails spread accross a variety of folders, it was impossible to find duplicates. So to assist with this, I was in the process of going through every folder
 and storing all 2001 emails in a single new folders, 2002 emails in a new folder etc. That way I can find duplicates easyly by subject/date without worrying about checking accross folders.<br />
<br />
I now&nbsp;feel&nbsp;that I am between a rock and a hard place, as I do not want to waste another 2 weeks effort to sort out the folders only to find that WLM does the same thing again in 2 weeks time. Yet the folders are unworkable as they are.<br />
<br />
I am very upset as it was microsoft who caused the original problem and now I find that two microsoft products I use being WLM and office 2010 64 bit arent even compatible with each other to the extent that I had to uninstall office 2010 64 bit and buy a new
 32 bit version, just so that I can copy data into outlook, as WLM has no way of deleting duplicate emails, where as outlook has some utilities availbe which I can download.<br />
<br />
What would help is some advice on (1) the best way to sync my WLM folders, so that they eaxctly match what is in the AppData physical location. That way I can be confident that if I work on the folders, my changes are reflected in the AppData store immediately
 rather than being updated later, so that if&nbsp;WLM abends again, it will not restore old out of date versions of folders again??<br />
<br />
2) Secondly, I would like to know the best way to get all my data accross to outlook and then once there, what software do you recommend which will delete the duplicates??<br />
<br />
Any help I am offered would be really appreciated.
