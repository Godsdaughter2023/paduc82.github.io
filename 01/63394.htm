    <title>is it possible to reorder the top action buttons &#40;reply, delete, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> _phoenix2000_  say:</h3>
<h2>            is it possible to reorder the top action buttons &#40;reply, delete, archive, etc...&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am often annoyed by the fact that the buttons in Windows Mail aren't the same as in Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The position of the Delete button is frustrating in Windows Mail because it's on the far right, while in Outlook.com, it's the second button right after Reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see why the order of these buttons aren't the same in both Windows Mail and Outlook.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook.com, the Delete button is always visible, while in Windows Mail its visibility depends on the fact that the navigation pane is open or not. If navigation pane is visible, you have to click the triple dots button to show the Delete button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So guys, can you fix that in Windows Mail so both show the same buttons in the same order, or let me know how, if possible, to reorder the buttons?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot in advance :)</p>

<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />My apologies. Mail app is a very basic editor and reordering of the buttons is not possible.

<p>Thanks a lot for this quick answer.</p>
<p>I'm not too much surprised by your feedback. But i think there's an opportunity here to make an easy improvement that, i suppose, doesn't cost much in development.</p>
<p>My suggestion would be to sync with Outlook.com Developers and make the order of the buttons the same in both Windows Mail and in Outlook.com. This will increase the consistency of those both Microsoft products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Especially the position of the Delete button in Windows Mail, which isn't best placed and not always immediately available to click depending on how we use the application.</p>
<p>In Outlook.com, the same button is always there, and is the button i use the most in both Windows Mail and Outlook.com :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So fix in next version? :)</p>

    <title>Bluetooth not working after Windows 10 Pro update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth not working after Windows 10 Pro update</h2>
                    <p>I have an MSI GS60 with Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of days ago Windows was updated (according to update history: Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3176936)), and since then my Bluetooth does not detect any device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is on (or at least the Bluetooth light is on in the laptop), but it is not detecting anything, while it did right before the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the solutions mentioned in other posts (Troubleshooting, updating Bluetooth drivers...) but nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have other colleagues that have experienced the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can be done to fix this?</p>

                    <p>I am trying to install Family Tree Maker 2012 Software on a new Windows 8 Pro&nbsp;touch laptop. The install was downloaded as a single exe.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it is run in the Windows 8 environment, I am getting the following error message on the install:&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error Number: 0x80040707&nbsp; Description:&nbsp; DLL Function Call Crashed:&nbsp; ISRT._WaitOnDialog
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Setup will now terminate </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see several messages that it is extracting the cab files and other files.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then it begins InstallShield Wizard. Next box is this dialog error.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this some security setting that is preventing it from reading the temporary folders it extracted to?&nbsp; Is
 this some other permissions problem in Windows 8?&nbsp; It will install fine on a Windows 7 machine!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any information will be appreciated.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

            Thank you for your response to my questions. I was able to resolve the problem by doing a CLEAN Boot as suggested in Method 1.&nbsp; However, it still required some more tinkering to work.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It did present the dialog box asking for serial number.&nbsp; That was crashing before.&nbsp; Then It complained that the windows installer service was not running.&nbsp; Sure enough, it was not running!&nbsp;I did a search for services, opened up the services window and checked
 on Windows installer -- It was stopped in manual mode.&nbsp; I started it and then the install completed properly!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I rebooted the machine in normal mode and the software worked and I am good to go!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, thanks for your help.&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Atheros Qualcomm AR9485 Driver disappearing&#47;reappearing- limited connection</h2>
                    <p>I have googled and searched microsoft's forums for 4 hours within the last couple days without solving this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wifi card in my asus laptop is in title. &nbsp;It constantly disappears from the device manager page and will randomly reappear. &nbsp;When it comes back and I try to connect to the internet, it does momentarily but then goes limited and then disappears if I disconnect
 from my wifi network. &nbsp;I believe it said Code 12 was the limiting factor and after looking through that, I haven't found a solution there either.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have deleted, reinstalled, disabled and reenabled the driver.</p>
<p>I have deleted the ethernet driver and reinstalled that as well.</p>
<p>I have tried every solution which has come up on google (there were 5 or 6 different things, I can't remember.......)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only windows update is KB3000850 - 700+mb. &nbsp;I have tried downloading this 4 times and it never goes past 0% without failing. &nbsp;I'm not sure that this is my problem since I had sporatically had wifi last week and yesterday my wifi worked for 5+ hours.
 &nbsp;It only stopped when I decided to begin my online homework (lucky me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am definately not one to post on forums for help because I will more than likely find a solution online first but, this has stumped me and I really cannot afford to let this problem persist any longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Scott</p>

            turns out the atheros chip in my laptop is fried. &nbsp;I'm guessing it was from walking in and out of the school building when it was 0 degrees outside plus sometimes leaving it in the car in this weather. &nbsp;I got a little usb wifi adapter and it's working
 just fine. &nbsp;Will be looking for a better and more durable laptop in July.

<h2>            Slow after cumulative Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>My PC installed a cumulative update to Windows 10 yesterday. Now, it sounds like it's running loads of processes all the time, and I'm unable to work particularly productively. Simple actions stutter and freeze while these annoying background processes are
 running. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So thanks for the update Microsoft - it's really made my computer so much better.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<br />
<p>Based on your description, it appears that the performance of your computer got affected after performing Cumulative update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For initial troubleshooting, we suggest that you run the Windows Update troubleshooter through this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>I have noticed that my PC is running slowly too after downloading the update on the 16th of March 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the troubleshooter as you suggested, but it hasn't made any difference whatsoever!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you offer any other solutions or better yet, a "working" fix?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Mouse 2000 doesn&#39;t work anymore and I can&#39;t get support from them, since my serial &#35; is somehow for a different mouse</h2>
                    
<p>I bought a Microsoft Wireless Mouse 2000 in April 2010 and about a month ago it stopped working. Before that it had times when it wasn't responding and now it does not work at all. I googled about this a lot and have done anything that Microsoft suggested
 on their help/forum pages. Last week I went to the store I bought it from, but they said I have to call Microsoft. So I did, or tried at least. When you go through their phone support page, at the beginning they ask you for the product type and Serial number.
 Unfortunately, it seems that my serial # corresponds to a Wireless Mouse 4000. What I am supposed to do? I don't get how it can be wrong since it is printed on the back of my mouse and I can clearly read it.</p>
<p>Any suggestions are welcome</p>
<p>Zz</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for replying. I did all of that, gone through those steps a couple of times with no luck. I even connected it to 2 other computers, but they can't sense anything has bee plugged in. I am sure it needs to be replaced, but how can I do that, if my serial
 # is "wrong"? Should I just lie before I call them, saying I have a Wireless Mouse 4000 and try to explain later my problem? Will anybody believe me?</p>

    <title>Shut down defaulting to Switch User - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobfol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shut down defaulting to Switch User</h2>
                    <p>I posted a question way back when Windows&nbsp;8 was in it's Consumer Preview and I never got the issue resolved.&nbsp; The problem was when pressing Alt F4 from the desktop to bring up the Shut Down dialog box.&nbsp; Sometime it would default to "Switch User" instead
 of "Shut Down" and would continue to do this for days before reverting back to the default of Shut Down.&nbsp; I think I finally figured out when this occurs (it still occurs in the full release of Windows 8).&nbsp; This behavior happens when Windows 8's auto update
 has download(installed) an update that requires a system restart.&nbsp; On my system.&nbsp; If a restart is needed by update, I will get&nbsp;a default of&nbsp;Switch User instead of Shut Down until I choose Restart and apply updates.&nbsp; Seems like a bit of a bug to me.&nbsp; I'm wondering
 if anyone else has ever noticed this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bob</p>

            <p>I had Windows 8 preview on the machine, but completely formatted the hard drive and put a fresh install of XP on the machine before installing the paid upgrade to Windows 8 (which required XP to already be on the machine because of the upgrade licensing).&nbsp;&nbsp;
 As to the multiple required reboots this month by auto update.... I probably got&nbsp;the&nbsp;second required reboot this month because for an unrelated issue I did a system restore to an earlier date in the month.&nbsp; Therefore there&nbsp;were several updates applied all&nbsp;at
 the same time, so I don't know which&nbsp;required the reboot.&nbsp; I can tell you this is not an isolated case though.&nbsp; As stated, I've seen this behavior several times over the past year and a half.&nbsp; I could wait and post the exact update the next time it happens,
 but I don't think it's really specific to&nbsp;a particular&nbsp;update itself,&nbsp; more if an update requires a reboot.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to Action center prompting to do a reboot.&nbsp; I've yet to see that directly.&nbsp; Once in a while I'll see a pop up bubble message in the bottom corner stating that a recently download update requires a reboot and it will happen in 2 days if I don't do it sooner.&nbsp;
 I always shut my computer off after each use&nbsp;so I'm not sure why that isn't enough for the update to be applied, but for some reason It will only get&nbsp;applied if I choose reboot from the menu (which of course is now defaulting to switch user).</p>

<p>I'm also wondering if you're not waiting long enough each month to encounter Action Center's prompt that the computer MUST BE shut down in order to complete the installation of updates?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternately, when you <em>do</em> see the "bubble" telling you that a reboot will be

not</em> using the <strong>Alt+F4 </strong>shortcut) without encounter the "Switch User" prompt?</p>

<p>=&gt; Of course, you can always trump Automatic Updates and run manual checks for updates &amp; reboot if prompted to do so. See...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • HOW TO run a manual check for updates<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt; Just about every security-related update (i.e., most of those released on the second Tuesday of every month)
<em>require </em>a reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt; Keep in mind that if an update <em>requires </em>a reboot, the update IS NOT INSTALLED unless &amp; until you've rebooted. Security updates address many specific vulnerabilities: If you've not rebooted since Automatic Updates downloaded &amp; initiated the install
 of an update, you computer remains at-risk <em>until you've rebooted</em>. [1]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt; Tip: Ideally, you would never, <em>EVER </em>use System Restore to "undo" an update, Service Pack, or IE upgrade (which often leaves the system in a "confused" or "torn" state) or to correct something else that's happened after you've installed updates!
 If you think one or more of the updates may have caused your problem, <em>uninstall</em> the update(s) &amp; reboot. If that doesn't correct the problem,
<em>then</em> try System Restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt; Tip: Life will be must more pleasant if you learn what an application or Windows version
<em>does </em>&amp; live with it instead of trying to make an application or Windows version do what you
<em>think </em>it should do. &lt;wink&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: Who knows? Whatever bugs Win8 RTM has [and there are <em>lots</em> of 'em IMHO!] may be fixed with the release of Win8.1 later this year!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>==============================================================<br />
[1] I'm all for minimizing reboots but NOT if my computer remains subject to a security vulnerability!</p>

            <p>I will have to wait until the next time I see the switch user prompt before trying to shut down with the side swipe method, but that is not ever going to be my preferred shut down method (at least as long as I'm a mouse/keyboard&nbsp;user.&nbsp; So much of Windows
 8 is geared around catering to touch screens.&nbsp; They seem to have forgotten that most desktop users are still using a mouse.&nbsp; It's a big part of why Windows 8 is considered by so many to be a bit of a failure.&nbsp; As to my system restore this month.&nbsp; It was done
 to&nbsp;remove a suspected virus or some kind of malware that Defender didn't catch.&nbsp; As to trying to make Windows do what I want or expect.&nbsp; I don't think any logical person would think the Shut Down dialog box should change it's default to Switch User because
 an update pending a reboot.&nbsp; That just makes no sense.&nbsp; It should either remain at the default Shut down option or switch to Reboot and apply updates.</p>

            OK, so I went to shut down today and I got my buggy "Switch User" instead of "Shut&nbsp;Down"&nbsp;for July.&nbsp; If I go to Windows Update, I see "Restart Your PC to finish installing updates.... Your pc will restart in 2 days if you don't restart now.&nbsp; So as I stated
 the incorrect default for the Shut Down Dialog is related to Windows Update pending a restart.&nbsp; I'm going to hold off on doing the restart so if anyone wants me to do some testing in its current state I can.&nbsp; FYI, going through the whole overcomplicated putting
 the mouse in the corner and shutting down.&nbsp; I get 3 options (there is no default) I have sleep, shut down and "update and restart"&nbsp; One other note.&nbsp; Action center doesn't tell me that the restart is pending until the 2 days have passed.&nbsp; The only indicator
 I have that an update/restart is pending is by the "Switch User" coming up in the Shut Down Dialog.

Well, I suggested doing&nbsp;the opposite: Approve the restart then see if the behavior persists afterwards.</p>

            <p>I already know doing the restart fixes the problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Windows will display "Shut Down" as the default after doing the restart/apply updates, but there's still a bug not being addressed here.&nbsp; When Windows needs to do a restart&nbsp;to apply updates, no logical
 person would think the default shut down menu option should be&nbsp;changing to "Switch User".&nbsp; It makes no sense.&nbsp; My guess is that is should be switching to "Restart and apply updates", but is erroneously defaulting to "Switch User".&nbsp; Seems like a pretty cut
 and dry bug report that's racked up way too much debate.</p>

                    I have an Acer w500 that is using LManger by Dritek as well as their Acer Device Control and I need to have the bluetooth default to ON at all times. I haven't figure out a way to do this.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have found in the registry if you go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Dritek\LManager\Setings\Bluetooth there are 3 lines in there</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any idea if I were to switch (Default) to a 0 or a 1, it would turn it on?&nbsp;</div>

            We had thought about writing &nbsp;an application that loads at startup that would simply simulate a tap on the screen as a specific coordinate (over ON on the Bluetooth toggle) and then a second one on the X to close the screen, but we decided against it because
 if the user changes the resolution, it wouldn't work and we would have to write conditional formatting in there so that IF this resolution, THEN tap here. ELSE tap here.&nbsp;

<h2>            System Restore for Windows XP Service Pack 3</h2>
                    <p>Hello: &nbsp;I am trying to get my PC running smoothly again. &nbsp;Many thanks to Andrew E. who helped me to correct my Windows Installer issue. &nbsp;Your assistance was greatly appreciated. &nbsp;Your instructions were clear and easy for me to follow--much appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system restore utility for XP is still not working. &nbsp;When I try to restore to a previous date there is no calendar for me to select a restore date. &nbsp;It will also not allow me to type information to create a new restore date. &nbsp;Do I need to uninstall and
 re-install system restore again? &nbsp;Is so, could someone please assist me. &nbsp;I was hoping that this issue would have gone away by fixing the Windows Installer issue. &nbsp; I am new to technology, but am learning at a quicker pace than I though I would. &nbsp;Any suggestions
 you have would be helpful?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much,</p>

 any difference between the 2 options as far as PC performance is concerned?</p>

            I would always recommend a 'clean' install over an 'upgrade'. <br />
<br />
Why? Because a 'clean' install will ensure you are starting from scratch and gets rid of all the garbage which is sometimes left over by poor application uninstall routines and so on. You're left with a purely Windows 7 operating system, no hangovers from Vista
 which <em>might</em> cause issues in the future. Of course, doing an 'upgrade' saves you the time and hassle of having to backup up your data, re-install your applications from scratch, and restoring your data, but I think most professionals would always recommend
 a 'clean' install.<br />
<br />
As for performance, it will probably run a bit quicker, but only because you've got rid of all the garbage.

            Screen saver could add to battery drain but is non consequential to the situation. If the above didn't resolve it lends to the probability that this is a hardware issue (bad battery, bad charging port, bad charging cable) instead of being a Windows software issue

            Hi,
<div><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community and we are happy to help you on this issue.</div>
<div><br />
As per the query description, it seems like you get an error message prompting “<strong>No CD/DVD-ROM drive found</strong>” when you try to start a program after installing it using a CD through an external CD/DVD drive.</div>
<div><br />
I would like to gather some information on this issue to help you better:</div>
<div><br />
1) Is this issue specific to particular program on the computer? If yes, what is the specific program that you are trying to start?<br />
2) Are you able to use other CDs or DVDs on CD the internal drive on the computer?</div>
<div>3) Does the program requires a disk to run on the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it does not require a disk to run the program, I would suggest you to copy the files on the hard drive and then use the files&nbsp;to run the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
As we are&nbsp;unsure about the exact reason that has caused this issue, it would be better if we can get more information on this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Please reply us with more information on this issue to help you better.<br />

            Thanks for your reply, here is more information about my problem:<br />
<br />
1. My laptop does NOT have an internal CD/DVD drive, that is why I used an external CD/DVD drive to install the program on my computer and then wanted to run but got the error message “<strong>No CD/DVD-ROM drive found</strong>” which is strange because the
 program files are copied on my computer and I neither have nor should need an internal CD/DVD drive to start the program after installing it on my computer.<br />
<br />
2. the program is a game, championship manager 03/04 from Eidos Interactive. I played it on my previous laptop (running on Windows 7) which also did not have an internal CD/DVD drive by simply installing it on my laptop from an external CD/DVD drive, the same
 I now tried on my new laptop running on Windows 8 which also does not have an internal CD/DVD drive and which did not work.
<br />
<br />
3. As said my laptop does not have an internal CD/DVD drive but I can use CD/DVDs from my external CD/DVD drive without problems.<br />
<br />
4. The program does not require a disk to run on the computer, it worked before without disc and after installing it from an external drive. I have copied/installed the program on the hard drive and tried to run it, that is when I get the error message quotes
 above.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!<br />

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Thank for providing us a quick update on this issue.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>This could be an issue related to the compatibility of the game with Windows 8.<br />
<br />
<div>After having a look at the compatibility of the game “<strong>Championship Manager 03/04</strong>” on Windows compatibility center, it seems like Microsoft does not have any information on the compatibility of the game on Windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can refer to the link to check:</div>

<br />
<div>As you had mentioned that you were able to ply the game on previous version of Windows, I would suggest you to uninstall the game and reinstall the game in compatibility mode. Check if it helps.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can follow the steps:</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Uninstall the game from the Control Panel:</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Press <strong>Windows and x </strong>key together and select <strong>Programs and Features.<br />
</strong>b) Locate the game from the installed programs list and right on the game icon.<br />
c) Select <strong>Uninstall </strong>and follow the onscreen instructions to uninstall the game.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
You can refer to the link to install the game in Windows compatibility mode and then try to start the game on the computer:</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the section “Apply a compatibility mode”</div>
<div><br />

</p><p>I understand BitLocker encrypts the data on your hard drive.&nbsp; My questions is: ig someone hack's your laptop will they be able to access your files/data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A scenario would be when using the laptop over public wi-fi <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>WITH</strong></span> a quality VPN enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BitLocker appears to be similar to encrypting an iPad in that a non-authorized person might be able to access the iPad but not obtain the data on it.(?)(?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello InquisitiveMind3,</p>
<p>
</p><p>BitLocker Drive Encryption is a data protection feature that integrates with the operating system and addresses the threats of data theft or exposure from lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BitLocker provides the most protection when used with a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) version 1.2 or later. The TPM is a hardware component installed in many newer computers by the computer manufacturers. It works with BitLocker to help protect user data
 and to ensure that a computer has not been tampered with while the system was offline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On computers that do not have a TPM version 1.2 or later, you can still use BitLocker to encrypt the Windows operating system drive. However, this implementation will require the user to insert a USB startup key to start the computer or resume from hibernation.
 Starting with Windows 8, you can use an operating system volume password to protect the operating system volume on a computer without TPM. Both options do not provide the pre-startup system integrity verification offered by BitLocker with a TPM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most operating systems use a shared memory space and rely on the operating system to manage physical memory. A TPM is a hardware component that uses its own internal firmware and logic circuits for processing instructions, thus shielding it from external
 software vulnerabilities. Attacking the TPM requires physical access to the computer. Additionally, the tools and skills necessary to attack hardware are often more expensive, and usually are not as available as the ones used to attack software. And because
 each TPM is unique to the computer that contains it, attacking multiple TPM computers would be difficult and time-consuming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The recommended practice for BitLocker configuration on an operating system drive is to implement BitLocker on a computer with a TPM version 1.2 or higher and a Trusted Computing Group (TCG)-compliant BIOS or UEFI firmware implementation, plus a PIN. By
 requiring a PIN that was set by the user in addition to the TPM validation, a malicious user that has physical access to the computer cannot simply start the computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you're using VPN, all your internet traffic is sent from your device through an encrypted tunnel to the provider's endpoint. With this, the traffic is secure fro many local eavesdropper on the public Wi-Fi network. Bitlocker is not easy to hack at
 all, it uses a hardware key protection and if they guess a password, then the hardware locks you out.
</p>

<h2>            Deleted files in user&#47;appdata&#47;local&#47;temp &#38; downloads now not working</h2>
                    <p>To recover some space on my C drive, I deleted all of the 10GBs of files in my users/myname/appdata/local/temp folder, assuming they were not essential/would be re-created as necessary. However I now find that I can't download files when using a browser.
 I've tried IE, Chrome &amp; Firefox and a couple of different download files, but as soon as the window pops up where I would specify the download folder, the window isn't fully populated &amp; the browser stops responding. Cancelling the action causes the browser
 to close.</p>
<p>I've re-booted a couple of times, tried different browsers &amp; download files but always the same effect.</p>
<p>I'm assuming the deletion of the appdata/local/temp files is linked to the problem as its the only system type of activity I've done on the PC since downloads were working.</p>

            <p>Hi Nelsonseye,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally speaking, you really shouldn't tamper with the AppData folder. Its name suggests what it does, it's the folder your programs use to store their information.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are most likely correct in assuming that the deletion of folders in AppData have affected your system. For the correction of the downloads issue, try resetting Internet Explorer settings for starters.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Restoring Internet Explorer Settings to Defaults</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>a. In IE, click on the gear in the top right-hand corner, and then click on "Internet Options".</p>
<p>b. Click on the "Advanced" tab</p>
<p>c. Click on&nbsp;"Reset..."</p>
<p>b. Reboot your PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If this worked, you can reset Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox's settings to their defaults, too.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Ahmad</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help. Your solution worked in IE but not Chrome or Firefox. I'm getting round the problem in Chrome by setting a default download folder, rather than selecting a folder at the time I download. I've now got a bigger (and probably separate)
 problem with Firefox as it won't run other than in Windows Safe Mode. In normal Windows, it only appears as a Process in Task Manager &amp; never starts as an application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've worked through all of the firefox help but to no avail. Any thoughts from a Windows perspective?</p>

            <p>Hi Nelsonseye,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this with Chrome:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong>Open <strong>Settings </strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d03140f0-33ac-4b06-83db-430a62e7997f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. </strong>Scroll down to <strong>Users</strong> </p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fab29036-0908-4815-bc59-b4c67dd2f31a" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3. </strong>Click <strong>Delete this user</strong>, and confirm the operation.
<strong>Note: </strong>This will delete your bookmarks, history, and other settings you have individually set. Make sure to backup your bookmarks to a file, and export them back later.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4. </strong>When Chrome reopens, go back to <strong>Settings</strong>, and then click on
<strong>Show Advanced Settings </strong>towards the bottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>5. </strong>Scroll down some more, and then click on <strong>Reset Browser Settings</strong>. Hit yes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>6. Reboot, </strong>and you should be ready to go with Google Chrome. If you need information on how to export your bookmarks and then import them later, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong>Click the Chrome menu <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fstorage.googleapis.com%2fsupport-kms-prod%2fSNP_9721C573E41777FBA43E1498AD084E3B160C_2696434_en_v2" height="29" width="29" />on the browser toolbar.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Select <strong>Bookmarks</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Select <strong>Bookmark manager</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Click the <strong>Organize </strong>menu in the manager.</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong>Select <strong>Export bookmarks</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chrome will export your bookmarks as a HTML file, which you can then import into another browser, or back into Chrome itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Firefox, try the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong>Type <strong>about:support </strong>in your address bar</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Click on <strong>Reset Firefox. </strong>Firefox will then reset itself, and reboot the browser.
</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Your old user information will be saved on your desktop in a folder called "User Profile" or similar. It contains your old bookmarks, and that sort of stuff. If you no longer need it, I recommend deleting it because it contains sensitive

            Yikes, I'm sure glad I was [finally] able to present this inquiry to &nbsp;google in a manner which it could find this answer ! &nbsp;I was just about to delete all the downloaded assuming that once installed I'd no longer need the automatically saved downloaded
 file. &nbsp;The list which pops up for each "download now" confirmation &nbsp;is at least 50 entries long, some of which are duplicates so noted as &nbsp;blablabla(1) or (2) and saved on C drive. &nbsp;If I understand your reply correctly I should not delete anything on that
 list. &nbsp;Yes, I've voted it as Helpful. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            The Thieves Guild &#40;Lost Histories&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>This might be a glitch in the game but I am having trouble finding the butler Shum gro-Yarug in the Skingrad Castle. I need to find him in order to get a job to get to Theranis in the dungeon. He has a book that the Thieves Guild wants. I have tried to sneak
 into the dungeon with no luck. I have also tried to find him in town. If you talk to a Skingrad Guard they tell you that Shum gro-Yarug spend most of his time at the castle but he goes to the West Weald Inn at ten and the Colovian Trader at noon. I have waited
 at both spots for him numerous times and the correct times and he never shows up. I cannot advance in the Thieves Guild until I pass this quest. Any help on how to find the butler or maybe another way of completing the quest without him?</p>

<p>Shum gro-Yarug has buggy AI that sometimes causes him to walk off the bridge between the castle and the city. So if you can not find him, then you gotta try pickpocketing a key from a guard, sneaking in the back way, or just plain getting yourself arrested.

<p>Which is the best way? I tried getting arrested but lost all my stuff. How do you sneak in the back way and where is the back way located? Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>Shum gro-Yarug has buggy AI that sometimes causes him to walk off the bridge between the castle and the city. So if you can not find him, then you gotta try pickpocketing a key from a guard, sneaking in the back way, or just plain getting yourself arrested.

<p>For a game this huge and on only one disc, this is the first real bug that I have found. I used an invisibilty potion and just walked past the guard in the dungeon. Thanks for the help.</p>

<p>No, believe me, there are much worse bugs. Bethesda knows about all of the bugs in their game. The community makes sure of it. The fact is: they are not going to patch it. Oblivion is 5 years old.</p>

<h2>            Netflix showing in 720P, but I have a 4K TV, xbox One S and a 100MB&#47;s connection</h2>
                    
<p>I'm really baffled that despite having a 4K TV, Xbox One S(set to 4K resolution) and a 100MB/S internet connection, I'm only getting a 720P picture based on the information netflix shows when I click in the right xbox controller stick. &nbsp;The show in question
 is Jessica Jones and should be at least 1080P. &nbsp;The show was also filmed in 4K.</p>
<p>I did not see a way to change netflix quality within the xbox One settings or within the netflix app.</p>

<p>Im having same issue with this poorly designed console. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I just tested my speed test via the speed test app on my ipad and my wifi. &nbsp;I get 26.78 down and 6.24 up.....yet on my xbox one S it days download speed only 18.60 down and 6.09 up, NAT open. &nbsp;So......Xbox/Microsoft youve got a big, massive issue on tour
 hands with sometging throttling my speeds diwn on your system. &nbsp;Yet I'll reiterate again, i used to have only 20mbps and my tv's netflix app did 4K. &nbsp;How do i know, there was a Ultra HD 4K category and when i played the movie or show, if i hit pause tge ultra
 HD symbol would appear in the upper corner where the HD symbol usually is- the fact that it showed me a 4K category meant i had fast enough speed. &nbsp;Now precisely what is wrong with your console? &nbsp;What design flaw in either the hatdware or softeare us causing
 this? Is it time for me to trade this in for a PS Neo? &nbsp;I bet that console will have uhd rentals, a Vudu app with 4K purchases, like i already have. &nbsp;It'll pribably have MGO uhd content and most assuredly have UHD digital &nbsp;rentals and purchaess via download
 onto the hard drive. &nbsp;Where was the effort put into this fonsole because i dint see it.</p>

<p>Xbox One launch= ball dropped, Xbox One S launch= ball dropped and punted. &nbsp;I wanna know where was the test phase to solve these issues? &nbsp;Im sure they had to test vut they launch anyway because they think we are suckers and will take the beating. &nbsp;This is
 it Xbox. &nbsp;Im moving to a loyal Playstation customer after two failed launches. &nbsp;This one possibly worse brcause tou said it can do something and it cannot. &nbsp;I see no uhd rentals or sigital purchases via download and netflix doesnt work in 4K. &nbsp;Again, how did
 this get out of the labs or manufacturing facility? &nbsp;They tgink we are sheep and will take their garbage and sit for them to fix. &nbsp;No longer will I.

<p>1st of all you need to upgrade to the top tier in netflix. 11.99 a month i believe. thats the only way you get 4k. second you need to go online and check that you have the stream quality as high as possible.</p>

<p>Once the One s launched regardless if you have a top tier Netflix account it still wasn't displaying 4K movies. There was an update and fixed all that. Once you open Netflix youll see the 4K ultra HD content available. Pretty decent amount</p>

 </p></blockquote><p /><p>From what I've seen the console has been designed pretty well. Your issue from what I can gather is speed related.</p><p>The speed your getting down the line doesn't necessarily reflect how much will be allocated to your console +&nbsp;online speed tests never reflect your true speed. Your console is not throttling your&nbsp;speeds, this would be generally down to how your router is allocating resources. </p>
