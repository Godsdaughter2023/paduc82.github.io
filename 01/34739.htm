    <title>December Rewards Promotion - Really Microsoft&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            December Rewards Promotion - Really Microsoft&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been on board with the Xbox system since the original Xbox. I love the system, love the games and for the most part have been treated well by Microsoft.&nbsp; I am getting to the point where I feel they are extremely disconnected from the reality of their
 fanbase and customers.</p>
<p>Halo: The Master Chief Collection was announced and I couldn't have been happier. All of my favorite shooter games from my Xbox consoles of the past on my new Xbox One all in one nice package with all four multiplayers intact. It was like a dream come true.
 So imagine my horror and distaste that the game was colossally broken at launch. All I could do is play solo Campaign. Which while Halo 2 Anniversary was fantastic was not the main reason I bought the title. This is all well and good. 343 has been working
 nonstop to fix the problems and for the most part the game is finally playable. It still has crazy problems and really bad connections but you can actually find a match and even play some online co-op Campaign with a friend.</p>
<p>Then December hits and low and behold a new promotion to get you to spend money and earn rewards points. After such a terrible launch of Halo the last thing you would think Microsoft would do is then give a 15 dollar back promotion to people who buy "Halo"
 products in December. That's clever. They don't come right out and say that you get the 15,000 points for buying Halo: MCC but its a 60 dollar price limit to get the rewards points so unless someone is buying several copies of Spartan **** and Halo 4 how
 the hell do you think you are getting those rewards points?</p>
<p><br />
Talk about a HUGE slap in the face to fans of Halo who eagerly waited for MCC only to find it broke and unplayable and now also being denied any sort of compensation for the state of the game.</p>
<p>Now I imagine someone will post a comment calling me a crybaby, or I should have waited, or you should know not to buy early. NO!&nbsp; This is unacceptable behavior and my complaints is 100% valid. This isn't like someone who buys a 500 dollar Xbox One at launch
 then laments their decision a year later when the prices go down for Christmas.&nbsp; At launch for 60 dollars a consumer should be able to have a reasonable expectation that the product the are buying WORKS! All this so that they can get Halo out before Christmas.
 The December Promotion to get people to go out and buy Halo for Christmas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am very unhappy with what is going on with this.</p>

<p>I bought Halo MCC on release day, not from the MS store either and this really doesn't bother me. I think you are making a mountain out of a mole hill, as the saying goes....</p>

<p>Completely your fault. MS offered 15k rewards credits last month for buying the physical disc from the MS Store. You did not take advantage of it so it is your fault. No one to blame besides yourself for any of this.</p>

<p>No, he's saying it's your fault you didn't take advantage of the promotion by purchasing at the MS store. Also, there is no real store as in a shop front, you order online through the MS store and the game is shipped to you....</p>
<p>It's definitely your fault that you'd rather complain about a broken game then get a refund like any other normal unsatisfied customer would do.</p>

<p>Launching broken consoles and games seems to be the norm these day's. </p>
<p>Best to vote with your Dollars and not buy until well after launch. Then perhaps M and Devs will get the hint and actually start shipping fully playable out of the box products.

    <title>Have any enforcement or suspension related questions&#63; Check out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Have any enforcement or suspension related questions&#63; Check out our guide here&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello fellow gamers!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Do you have any
questions about the <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/howTo#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Code of Conduct</a> or the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/servicesagreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Services Agreement</a>? Have
you recently seen an&nbsp;enforcement actions on your Xbox account? Well you've
come to the right place, because we've got some answers for you. In this sticky we'll cover a few different
scenarios and provide you with&nbsp;some links to where you can learn more about the XBLPET aka the&nbsp;Xbox Live Policy and Enforcement Team, as well as how to find more
information about Staying Safe on Xbox Live. </p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>I received a message from Xbox Live that said
"Notice of enforcement action: For more information, check the email
associated with your Xbox Live account, or visit enforcement.xbox.com."
What does this mean?</strong></p>



<p>If you're seeing
this message on Xbox Live, that means there has been an Enforcement action
taken on your account and at some point there was a violation of the Code of
Conduct or Microsoft Services Agreement. You can learn more about the
enforcement action by checking the email address that’s associated with your
Microsoft Account or by visiting the Xbox Live Enforcement website <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>When does the enforcement action/suspension on my
account end?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Generally,
suspensions end at approximately the same time of day that they are issued- not
at the beginning of the calendar day. For instance, a 24 hour suspension issued
at 3:00 p.m. will end at approximately 3:00 p.m. the following day, not at
midnight.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What type of enforcement actions/suspensions are
there?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is many different types of account suspensions that can
occur through an enforcement action. Communications Suspensions, Account
Suspensions, Forced Gamertag Changes, Temporary Console Suspensions, Privilege
Suspensions, Game-Specific Suspensions and Permanent Console Suspensions are
some of the typical actions. For more information and details about each one,
be sure to check out the Xbox Live Suspensions page <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/howTo#sub-topic0-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>How do I contact the XBLPET about my suspension? Can I post here on the Xbox Forums?</strong></p>



<p>The
XBLPET doesn't communicate through the Xbox Forums contrary to popular belief.
Previously the team has communicated through the forums, but have since evolved
and the process has changed to a Case Review system.<br /></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What is a Case Review?</strong></p>



<p>The Case Review is a
tool that allows players who have received an enforcement action (for example,
an account suspension or forced Gamertag change) to have their enforcement
reviewed by a member of the Xbox Live Policy &amp; Enforcement Team. Suspensions
are never issued lightly, but Case Review allows Xbox Live members to interact
directly with the XBLPET and gain greater understanding of the enforcement and
why actions was taken. In the very rare event that the review determines that a
mistake was made or the enforcement was not necessary, steps will be taken to
remedy the situation.<br /></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Who can submit a Case Review?</strong></p>



<p>Any Xbox Live member with an&nbsp;active&nbsp;enforcement
action may submit a case for review through the account's&nbsp;Enforcement
History, provided the enforcement meets the
following requirements:<br /></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<ul>
 <li>The enforcement's duration
     is greater than 24 hours in length</li>
 <li>The enforcement was issued
     in the last 12 months</li>
</ul>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can&nbsp;only request a review of your own active enforcement actions, and must be
signed in to the account that received the enforcement (or signed in to the
parent account if a child account was suspended). Prior to submitting a Case
Review, you may be prompted to complete a short questionnaire designed to gauge
your understanding of the Code of Conduct. Failure to pass this questionnaire
will temporarily prevent you from submitting a review, during which time we
recommend familiarizing oneself with the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/Legal/CodeOfConduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;Currently, Xbox device bans&nbsp;are not eligible for a Case Review.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>I meet the requirements, how do I submit a Case
Review?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>Submitting a Case
Review is easy, and can be accomplished in just a few steps. For the full
details and information, be sure to check out the Case Review page <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/howTo#sub-topic0-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a>.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;As mentioned in the previous question, sometimes you're asked to complete a

<p><strong>Will I get a suspension just because I received a

<p><strong>How to Stay Safe on Xbox Live and avoid Enforcement
Actions.</strong></p>



<p>We're here to help
you learn about the policies that govern the Xbox Live service so you can avoid
behavior that will result in a suspension. Many enforcements are
straightforward, such as suspensions issued as a result of harassment or
profane content. However, other enforcements and policies may seem a bit more
complex. Check out Stay Safe page <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/staysafe#topic0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a> for more information on the different
policies.<br /></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>My Reputation is in "Avoid Me" what does
that mean and how do I fix it?</strong></p>



<p>Xbox One and Xbox on
Windows feature a completely overhauled and redesigned player reputation
system. This system was designed to better your overall experience on Xbox Live
by helping to improve the way that players interact with each other on the
service. At its most basic, the reputation system rewards positive behavior
(such as playing fairly and with good sportsmanship), and creates a downside
for those that exhibit poor behavior (such as cursing, being disrespectful, or
cheating).<br /></p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>To get your
reputation back up again from an "Avoid Me" status, you'll need to
keep playing online games with other gamers and over time it will improve.
Playing MMO type games such as APB Reloaded or
Neverwinter will help you match up with other users and be able to get your
reputation in the green again.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>What should I do if I'm seeing someone on Xbox Live
who's not following the Code of Conduct or Microsoft Services Agreement?</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you think a
player violated the Microsoft Services Agreement or Code of Conduct, submit a
report to Xbox. You can report a player’s behavior or report specific content
such as messages, Clubs, and activity feed items. This page <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/howto#sub-topic2-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a> will show you
how to file a report on the Xbox One console. And this page <a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-US/home/howto#sub-topic1-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a> will show you how to file a report on Xbox 360
consoles.</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;</p>



<p>There's a wealth&nbsp;of additional&nbsp;information available on the XBLPET website here&nbsp;at <a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://enforcement.xbox.com</a>. If you're

<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />
<br /> Do you need the version history of the different documents(word, excel, notepad, etc.) or the history of recent windows 10 files?
<br />
<br />
<br />Hope the information provided is useful. If the issue persists, reply here and we will be glad to help you.

            Hi Nadim.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Set File Explorer to Quick Access View in  View &gt; Options &gt; Change Folder and Search Options &gt; General tab &gt; Open to Quick Access View, Apply, Save.  This will give you a list of Recent files when you open Explorer.
<br />
<br />From the Microsoft Office group in All Apps in Start Menu, you can pin Office Word, Excel, etc. to Taskbar so when you right click the icon it will show recent history, same in the Word, Excel, etc. Window's File tab.  
<br />
<br />I'm not sure Notepad will do that as it's very rudimentary with no editing or history features AFAIK.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>Hi,</p>

<p>Also tried rebooting with WIN 7 disc on startup rather than using system folder for startup (still got message).&nbsp; Didn't proceed with reinstalling Windows with wizard as was unsure of consequences.&nbsp; I do have a remote hard drive for back-ups but am unsure
 where to locate the needed file or program where it is located.</p>

            <p>I think your barking up the wrong tree and being led on some wild goose chases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched my system for comchannel.dll and did not find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I performed a Google search and it appears that commchannel.dll might belong to Avast software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a matter of fact there are many topics about commchannel.dll in the Avast forum/community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So since the file doesn't appear to be a Windows file it is extremely unlikely that sfc /scannow will help you, it is extremely unlikely that creating a repair disc will help you but what those ideas will do is waste your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you now or have you ever had any Avast software installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the message appears at startup and most third party AV softwares have some startup items configured it sounds like at least that problem is related to Avast software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to uninstall/reinstall your Avast software but most third party AV products these days have their own special way or program to uninstall them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking this link will take you to the Avast page where you can download their uninstaller:</p>

</p><p><a href="https://www.avast.com/uninstall-utility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.avast.com/uninstall-utility</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After uninstalling, restart your system and see how things look and if things are good, consider reinstalling Avast or replacing it with something with less overhead like Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE):</p>

    <title>After Anniversary Update, Win10 login&#47;lock password prompt goes in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr v  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Anniversary Update, Win10 login&#47;lock password prompt goes in endless loop</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just after build 1607 got updated on my PC, I started noticing an odd thing when on each boot-up,
<em><strong>the windows would not accept the login password or reject it</strong></em>, the little circle animation would go for about 40-50 seconds, and then with no further information or error message, the "Enter your password" prompt would be there again.
 Repeat forever. If you entered a wrong password or no password at all, there would be no information like "Wrong password, try again", but the system would be going again for 40-50 seconds, and everything gets repeated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Amazingly, <strong>the problem tends to go away (short term) after I restart the PC</strong>. On that second boot-up, password logs me in immediately, in most cases (60-70%), but on odd occasion, I would need to restart 3 or 4 times before the system logs
 me in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have side-stepped this by removing the password login for the user on boot-up, but I am obviously not comfortable with this.
<strong>However, the problem manifests itself also when I lock the screen</strong>. Upon screenlock, in 95% of cases entering the password will not instantly bring you back, but the little circle will keep going and going for 50 seconds, only to present the
 password login again. This is completely infuriating especially in work conditions where locking the screen is absolutely vital. Strangely, "Sign Out" option almost always works fine, but "Sign Out"/"Sign In" option also loses all unsaved data, so it is not
 useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought this could be a one PC problem, but just after 1607 update got installed on my laptop,
<strong>the identical behaviour followed</strong>. <strong>My laptop and my desktop are not of the same manufacturer and share 0 common hardware</strong>. The only common features between two are that (1) they both have Windows on SSD, and \Users folder on
 hard drive and (2) in both cases I am using the local account, I do not have MS live account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have tried:</p>
<p>1. Logging to Safe Mode (works fine) and back to normal - issue persists</p>
<p>2. Start-up repair - did nothing</p>
<p>3. Created a new User profile - the issue persists with the second profile as well</p>
<p>4. Tried PIN instead of password</p>
<p>5. Running <strong>System File Checker tool</strong> or <strong>DISM (System Update Readiness tool)
</strong>as suggested here - no problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it matters, Fast start-up is turned <strong>off</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I can see at least 5 people just on this Windows 10 section, probably even more on others. Similarly, I can easily list about 5-6 other people on tenforums, windows10forums, and reddit. This does not seem likely at all to be a corrupted file issue, or a
 single user issue, there most definitely seems to be a problem in something that Anniversary Update 1607 brought. I have two completely different Windows 10 Pro machines, and the behaviour since 1607 was consistent 10/10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since 1607 more than 3-4 updates have been applied, the problem is not going away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>-Is this a known issue? Known by MS that is, as it keeps propping up often around forums.</p>
<p>-Is there a known solution that I haven't tried (short of reinstalling the whole Windows 10)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Mr. V,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to determine what's causing this problem, we suggest that you perform a clean boot. Check out

            <p>Hi Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying, I am presently at work but I will try this when I get round to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after I perform the clean boot, do I need to do anything else? Create a dump of some log, or perform any tests? Or is this simply to determine if the issue persists even after the Clean Boot?</p>
<p>

            <p>Actually, I found some time to do it immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot most definitely did not fix the issue. Straight after the boot-up, I tried to lock screen, and on the very first attempt to unlock it, the problem occurred again and I had to shut down manually. Windows was neither accepting correct password,
 nor rejecting blank or very incorrect password, the little "please wait" circle just kept going for 40-50 seconds, and there is the password prompt again.</p>

            <p>Okay, just to illustrate how infuriating and unworkable this is, here is my today's meeting at the clients' office:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> During some verbal discussions, I left the laptop untouched for about 5-10 minutes, it went into sleep, upon trying to enter password to bring it out of sleep, the password got nowhere, one minute to ask for password again -
<strong>needed to SHUT DOWN and boot up</strong>. <strong>One.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.</strong> There was a short meeting that I had to lock the PC because I had confidential data on the screen. Came back to it, tried to unlock it, the password got nowhere -
<strong>needed to SHUT DOWN and boot up. Two.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3.</strong> This time accidentaly, the screen timed out on me due to inactivity, tried to wake it up again, failed due to this problem -
<strong>needed to SHUT DOWN and boot up</strong>. <strong>Three.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4. </strong>Again I needed to be away from the desk, I had to lock the screen, and seeing that I was unable to unlock it -
<strong>needed to SHUT DOWN and boot up again. Four. </strong></p>
<p><br />
This is what my life is like with Windows 10, after the Anniversary Update. At home, on my desktop, I can almost live with this, but working on the laptop, in business environment, it is infuriating. Just during 09h-12h period this morning I had to shut down,
 losing any open work, and boot up again no less than four times. Heavens only know how often will this happen over 3 days of meetings that I have.
<em><strong>All due to some silly error over something so basic and crucial as entering the password for the username</strong></em>
<em><strong>and system being unable to log me in</strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try anything that any MS community experts ask me to attempt (short of reinstalling the whole 10 Windows - I simply do not have the time), or provide any logs as asked. But this has to be resolved soon, Microsoft has to acknowledge that there is a
 system problem here, so many people are experiencing this. <br />
<br />
Clients and contacts ask us what is our experience of Windows 10, and up until this August, it was actually quite good. Right now, we are telling them to stay away from Windows 10 for as long as possible.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;I have tried the above and none of it worked. First of all, i tried to create a new admin account using a brand new microsoft account, as instructed. Even though it did not resolve the issue at hand, it created a second one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- before (with the local account), when I received the loop error, i would go back in safe mode, disable pass protection on the account, restarted normally and it would skip the login screen (since it was not disabled)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- after (with microsoft act), I cannot disable the sign in screen no matter how many times i've tried, the screen pops-up, regardless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Warren,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had moderate success with re-installing Windows 10 using Windows media creation tool, which will install a fresh copy starting with build 1607. I have provided detail instructions on another thread</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hello/log-in-screen-on-loop/ec6bb6fd-847b-43f7-85ad-187ef7d506f8?page=1">log in screen on loop</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>end of page two and page three, as LawrenceRositani suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I say "moderate" because the problem did seem to be solved - temporarily. Unfortunately, since then, the problem reappeared 5 days after, and on my laptop, 3 weeks after. It most definitely did not come back after some installed update, just seemed
 to come back randomly. It is simply infuriating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As stated on that thread, the difference between what I did and what Lawrence did (which apparently 100% solves the issue) is that I just re-installed Windows 10 over the existing installation, keeping my personal files, settings, applications, registry.
 Lawrence completely reformated his hard drive and started clean afresh, which obviously sounds better, but what is infuriating is that even my "way"
<strong>worked</strong>, it most defintely worked, I spent hours locking/unlocking, but somehow the problem is re-appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Warren, just out of interest, do you have Windows OS and your User profile folders on two different drives?</p>
<p>

            So this ends HERE?&nbsp; No one has any idea?&nbsp; Even a complete reinstallation can't cure the pc from this problem.&nbsp; The man has problems at work.&nbsp; I have problems with this, too.&nbsp; Other people do.&nbsp; Microsoft, you release an OS with a pretty serious bug which

            <p>Hi Greg, and everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This thread has been re-activated quite timely, as yesterday morning I was fairly fed up with the problem still being there, and I attemtped what&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/150b8357-00ac-47dc-a71a-78f2d65e8ca7" title="LawrenceRositani">LawrenceRositani</a>
 suggested to have found several weeks ago, that a completely clean reinstall of 1607 build + updates solves the problem.<br />
<br />
<strong>No, it does not I'm afraid</strong>. After spending the day since 08:00 yesterday morning, reinstalling, updating, tweaking, and installing work packages and data, amongst which countless reboots and re-logins have gone smoothly,
<strong>around 20:00 in the evening the laptop timed out, and upon waking it I was presented with a locked screen through which I couldn't log in</strong>. The problem is back on a 12-hour-old clean Windows installation.<br />
<br />
Only this time, the problem was even worse - in the past, with the problem present, the Windows allowed me to log in at a success rate of roughly 50%. Last time, I must have rebooted close to 30-40 times, spent most of 2-3 hours on this, and the password
<strong>worked only once</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So without a choice, I have done a clean install yet again, starting from last night. I am only 50% through this, and on my estimation, I have completely wasted a solid week of work trying to resolve and investigate the problem. This is quite simply atrocious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I am creating a system recovery point almost after every install. I have completely switched off login/password upon the system boot-up, and have only kept it on lock/unlock, because last night
<em>I could not even log into the system or started in Safe Mode</em>. So now I am stuck with a
<strong>very insecure laptop that is not password-protected except on a lock</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I noticed last night is that this problem first appeared after one (I cannot swear was it the only one) sleep mode, when laptop went to sleep. Right now I have switched of all
<em>Sleep / Hibernate / Fast boot-up / Turn Hard Drives Off Power</em> options, and am presently monitoring and taking System Restore points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one thing that I noticed. Not sure how helpful it is, but... </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Upon a boot-up (or a lock action) just before the password prompt I will always see the full background photo. Like
<a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/images/wp/purch-api/incontent/2015/07/1436549419-670x392.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a>. Just a full photo all over the screen. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>Username and password prompt will not appear until I press a key or click a mouse button. If it is like this, the password will be accepted and everything will work fine</strong></span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2.</strong> If upon a boot-up (or a lock action) I am immediately presented with the background photo but with the username and password prompt already visible on it,
<a href="https://www.schoonepc.nl/i/windows10_1/welkomstscherm.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
like here</a>, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>then the password will just go nowhere</strong></span>, and I can enter a blank, or a rubbish password, or a correct one, and Windows will spin the little circle for about 40 seconds, and bring
 back to a (curiously, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">full</span>) <a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/images/wp/purch-api/incontent/2015/07/1436549419-670x392.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
background photo</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have no idea if that is helpful or can it be used in error tracking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have to reiterate, that even though a very small number of people has this problem, it is absolutely mind-boggling that it is present for almost 5 months now, since the Anniversary Update, and Microsoft is seemingly doing nothing about it. For heaven's
 sake, <em>this is about a user/password login, it is absolutely crucial and can render the entire PCs useless</em>! Yes, a very small number of users, but it is not a corrupt profile, it is present across different hardware desktops and laptops, and it is
 not even solved by a complete clean reinstall. How can users be expected to make head or tail of this?!</p>

    <title>windows 7 msi installer error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shawn soszka  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7 msi installer error</h2>
                    Hello All,<br />
<br />
I have been unable to install any .msi based program on my Windows 7 Professional, 64 bit, SP 1 OS based laptop for the past 5 weeks. At first I thought it was a program specific error, but have found that all msi programs won't install. I don't have specific
 error codes, but each program says that the msi file "cannot be accessed or located".<br />
<br />
Here's what I have tried so far (without success):<br />
<ol>
<li>went into services.msc and found that MSIExec was in fact turned on and set to manual</li><li>Re-registered MSIExec</li></ol>
That's what I've tried thus far. I have all windows updates as of today (6/15/2011).
<br />
<br />
Also, not sure if this is related but I cannot uninstall MS Office 2010. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Shawn<br />

<p>Sometimes the only option left is to save all your valuable data and then to reinstall Windows.&nbsp; When this problem is finally fixed, if you don't already, you should look at System Image backups as a safety solution to avoid the hindrance of reinstalling
 Windows.<br />

    <title>Trying to install windows 7, keyboard and mouse stop working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Trying to install windows 7, keyboard and mouse stop working</h2>
                    I recently built a computer and when I try to install windows 7 via disc, the mouse and keyboard stop working despite still having power. They work just fine in the BIOS and other screens. I have tried every USB port and none have worked. I am using an
 intel 7 with a rog strix z390e gaming motherboard. I have tried nearly everything and this is beyond frustrating. This seems to be a common issue but none of the other solutions have worked for me. Thanks for reading.

<p>The CPU is an intel i7 8700k processor, thats what i meant by intel 7, sorry. I dont think this should have any bearing on peripheral operation during windows 7 install screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally I called windows support today and after a half hour of symptom elaboration they had no solution. I ordered an older ps/2 keyboard so hopefully it will be recognized by windows despite the usb-ps/2 converter not powering the usb keyboard, which
 i am assuming is due to a problem in the converter itself. I might just try windows 8 instead.</p>

<p>You have an eighth generation Intel processor.&nbsp; That is the problem.&nbsp; The chipset that comes with that processor has no USB 2 drivers.&nbsp; Win7 install has no USB 3 drivers.&nbsp; That is the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that your processor is 6th gen or later is why I asked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to create a Win7 ISO with integrated USB3 drivers.&nbsp; The problem you are experiencing has nothing to do with your keyboard or mouse.&nbsp; It is with the ports they are plugged into.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell has a web page that describes how to do this.&nbsp; It is quite technical.&nbsp; A key tip: you can copy those long command strings using the clipboard feature and paste them into the command window.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.dell.com/support/article/ca/en/cabsdt1/how11804/how-to-install-windows-7-on-systems-with-skylake-chipset?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.dell.com/support/article/ca/en/cabsdt1/how11804/how-to-install-windows-7-on-systems-with-skylake-chipset?lang=en</a>&nbsp;
 This page refers to Skylake processors which is the 6th gen, but that's alright, same problem, same solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done this myself.&nbsp; It works.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once you have created that USB ISO, save it.&nbsp; It is valuable.&nbsp; It has been several months since I did this, so you may find other instructions or even an ISO somewhere, but I doubt it.</p>

            Ok thank you, i will definitely apply this as soon as I can. However I dont think I can get online and copy the material until the initial install. Once the PS/2 keyboard gets here it will hopefully work and then i can get the usb 3 drivers

            Best thing to do would be contact the live chat of support or request a phone call and explain it to them, most of the time your issue means they've put a temp block on purchases. Normally when you contact them they can take any restrictions off the account.

            That means there's something wrong with your payment method. You might not have enough in your bank account or something along those lines. I would suggest contacting your bank or checking it online. Also, make sure your payment methods and billing information
 is correct.

<p>Hi Rachel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Windows Hello may stop working after installing an update because of driver incompatibility. For us to provide an accurate solution, we would need you to answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which build and edition of Windows 10 is installed on your computer?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages when you're trying to use the facial recognition feature?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest updating the drivers on your laptop, especially the driver for your camera. Use this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link</strong></a> as your reference on how to update drivers in Windows 10.</p>
<p>

            <p>OK,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just so we're on the same piece of music :-)... I'm taking a blank CD and burning a .wav file on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So... I tried what you said. I took a blank cd and made a "Data CD" of the same .wav file. It came out as .wav file so I played it on two different boom boxes. On one I just got noise and the other nothing, I also played it on my computer and it worked fine.
 Any other ideas? Help!!</p>

    <title>how to create a USB bootable media - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            how to create a USB bootable media</h2>
                    <p>I have an Acer desktop computer running Windows 10 and I got only the update Version 1803. I can't get 1809 and 19093 because after installation, I can't boot the computer. On the other hand, Microsoft informs that I need to get the newer version update.
 That is why I need to have a USB bootable media to fix these issues. Thanks</p>

            Hi Phong.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br />You can then either run the media by opening it in Windows, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator, proceed with the in-place Upgrade.  If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails or you want a much better install that lasts longer with fewer problems then do this Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi  Phong, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

            How is the printer connected to the Network? Is it setup as a wireless printer (which it is) or do you have it connected to another computer and share it? Is the printer recognized on any of the computers? It should be setup as a wireless printer that
 is directly connected only to your router instead of another computer--especially not directly connected to a vista computer. You must setup the printer for wireless access and that includes changing firewall settings on all computers. You will be guided by
 the install software to set it up as a wireless printer. You cannot use the install disk. You must download the latest windows 8.1 drivers and software for the win 8 computer--

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this problem with my printer saying it was offline even though I keep it plugged in permanently. I found that to change the status to online, I had to press either the black or colour photocopy button to wake it up so that my documents would print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is annoying considering the whole point of being wireless was that you didn't need to go near the printer to print.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only problem now is that with Windows 8.1 my documents print half a page and then stop printing, with my laptop telling me that there was an error but no explanation to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how I can overcome this? I installed straight on to Windows 8.1 as I upgraded my windows 8 before I bought the printer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shannon</p>

            I am having the exact same problem. &nbsp;I try to print, I get the printer off line message. &nbsp;I "wake" it up &nbsp;by walking down the hall to where the printer is, come back here and print. &nbsp;Once the document prints it goes to sleep again, that is if I get a complete
 print and not half sheets as this person noted. &nbsp;This has worked well for over a year now and has just started this. &nbsp;I re installed and updated the drivers, so please don't tell me to do that. &nbsp;Again, what's the point of being wireless if you have to constantly
 wake up the printer manually?

<h2>            My profile was signed in somewhere else&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Apparently and randomly, my account disconnects from Xbox Live because it is signed in some place else. I have not given my account information to anybody. I have changed my password three times and I put a password on my account before signing in. I also
 get FIFA 12 which is a game I do not own in my recent games. I don't know what the cause is to this and I would like to have this resolved.</p>

<h2>            &#39;the dependency service or group failed to start&#39; in Network &#38; Sharing Center &#40;and red X network icon&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi. </p>
<p>i am running win7 home premium SP1, no Home Group in use,&nbsp; Kaspersky IS 2010, wired network connection to router (using DHCP on the lan).&nbsp;two issues (possibly related?!):</p>
<p>first the network icon always now shows a red X, even though i have lan/internet access (wired)
</p>
<p>also in the network/sharing centre, it shows my current connection as 'unknown' and underneath says 'the dependency service or group failed to start'.
</p>
<p>it was suggested to run an 'sfc /scannow' which showed an error regarding nlasvc</p>
<p>any feedback would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>Thanks, Steve</p>
