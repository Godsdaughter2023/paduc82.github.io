<h2>            Windows 10 update rolls back &#64; &#62; 90&#37; completion with error 0x8007002C - 0x4001E</h2>
                    <p>After repeated attempts, the Windows 10 installer is failing with error 0x8007002C - 0x4001E "The installation failed in the SECOND-BOOT phase with an error during PRE_OOBE operation".</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, I had successfully upgraded this particular laptop (running Win 8.1 Pro) a couple of weeks ago, but downgraded back to 8.1, as I had a problem with the left mouse click not working on Start, Edge, etc. and I didn't have time to diagnose it.&nbsp;&nbsp;(There
 was nothing on the forums on that problem back then; there is now.)&nbsp; I&nbsp;have also upgraded several other machines, with no problems whatsoever.&nbsp; Since I had a bit of spare time, I thought I'd take another run at my left click problem, but I haven't even been
 able to get tot that point, given this error.&nbsp; I've been using both Windows Update and the ISO builder (upgrade on this machine) but they both fail with the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since getting this error, I have tried various things, including:</p>
<p>SFC</p>
<p>DISM</p>
<p>Turning off AV, etc. prior to running</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried the clean boot approach, but that doesn't seem to get me anywhere as turning off all the MS services then makes the thing essentially unusable (and slower than heck, too).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions here?&nbsp; The only ones I've seen on various forums suggest that it's a program migration problem and to fix it by not migrating those programs.&nbsp; This more or less defeats the point, IMO&nbsp;- I don't have time to do a&nbsp;fresh install of the OS and
 all apps.&nbsp; Or, that there's not enough disk space, which in this case there certainly is - ~130GB free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA!</p>

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I tried this - it was at least new advice that I hadn't seen anywhere else - and sadly it didn't work.&nbsp; At this point, I have in fact tried several more times (perhaps 6 or 7 in total) since this advice, including different approaches to getting the
 downloader to run (ISO vs. Windows Update), cleaning up some programs I'd installed since the time I +was+ able to get Win10 to install (but then backed out again), cleaning up the registry, turning off connectivity, unplugging all USB peripherals, removing
 all external disk drives so that the single internal SSD remained, turning off firewalls, running Windows Update fixit, SFC, DISM, and anything else I could think of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, a reading of all of the MS forums on this precise error code suggests that the only consistent way that people are actually getting past this issue is to do a clean upgrade of Win10 (i.e. no apps/data being migrated), and then do a re-installation
 of all of their favorite apps.&nbsp; That is quite time-consuming in my case, as I do admittedly have a decent number of programs I use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless anyone in the community, or an MS support engineer can come up with a new suggestion that fits the symptoms - that it's something to do with converting the existing app portfolio, and that therefore the clues to fixing this are in that area -&nbsp;I am
 going to give up this enormous time suck for a few more weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx - Michael</p>

 one each time, i figured it out and realised i didnt clear my cmos. after i cleared it my laptop would start up perfectly and let me log in and let me do almost everything. I increased the RAM so i could do more with games and streaming but when i try to start
 a game my laptop just shuts off and restarts. my specs are as follow:</p>

            <p>Hi Austin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you update the display drivers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Blue screen errors can be caused by a variety of hardware, firmware, driver, or software issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may install all the pending updates and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to boot the system in Clean Boot and check if&nbsp;the same issue exist&nbsp;in clean boot state.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. It starts Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you install all the updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer the question asked in my previous post and this post, as the information is important to troubleshoot the issue better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may follow the below methods and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 1: We would suggest you to visit the computer manufacturer website to check for the latest BIOS version &amp; chipset driver and install it to check if it helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>BIOS Disclaimer: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: If the issue still exist after performing the above method, sometimes new hardware can cause blue screen errors. If you recently added new hardware to your PC, shut down your PC, unplug the new hardware(RAM), and then restart your PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may remove the newly installed RAM (i.e., use the old RAM) and check if the system crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope the information helps, do reply if you need further assistance.</span></p>

<p>Hi Vaughanthesheep,</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Firstly, I’d suggest you to visit your computer manufacturer’s website and download and install the latest sound card (audio) drivers.</p>
<p>Refer the links below for more info on updating drivers:</p>
<p><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Update drivers: recommended links<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links</strong></a></p>
<p>Stereo Mix is available if the other devices (Microphone, Rear input) are enabled and set as default devices.</p>
<p>In order to enable and make the Stereo Mix available, you would have to right click on Stereo Mix and select ‘Set as Default Device’.</p>
<p>This would make the Stereo Mix available.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>If the "Stereo Mix" type device did Not show up in the "Sound" window when right-clicking and selecting Show Disabled Devices, it may indicate that you have Integrated Sound, and recording streaming, etc. is Not supported. In that case (on a Desktop PC),
 installing a sound card into an available slot should solve the problem.</p>
<p>If you're using a Laptop or a Notebook and aren't able to get your preferred Input Sources showing, that is hard to resolve. The best thing to do in that case is to contact the manufacturer to see what they can recommend.</p>
<p>If your laptop has a PCMCIA slot, it might be possible to use a PCMCIA sound card to resolve the problem but haven't been able to test that yet.</p>
<p>(Sometimes downloading and installing your sound card manufacturer's latest drivers can add additional sources like What-U-Hear, Stereo Mix, etc. Also, some users have reported that "downgrading" drivers to older versions have helped them instead of "upgrading").</p>
<p>As a last resort, you can use a mini-plug Stereo-to-Stereo cable plugged in from Headphone/Speaker Out to Line-In or if Line-In is not available you can use a Stereo-to-Mono cable plugged in from Headphone/Speaker Out to Microphone In.</p>
<p>Then select the appropriate Input Source in the recorder's Options: Line-In or Microphone.</p>
<p>When using the cable connection method, make sure to start with very Low volume settings so you don't damage your sound card.</p>
<p>(Also using the "cable" method into Line-In activates and enabled the previously unavailable "Stereo Mix" Input Source).</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Also you may run the Audio Troubleshooter if you are unable to record audio:</p>
<p>If your computer is having problems recording sound, try using the Recording Audio troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common issues, such as making sure that both a working sound card and a recording device are installed on your computer.</p>
<p><strong>Open the Recording Audio troubleshooter<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Recording-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Recording-Audio-troubleshooter</strong></a></p>
<p>Also refer:</p>

    <title>How to prevent users from adding files to a folder&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to prevent users from adding files to a folder&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a "backup" of a cloud folder that I store on my computer. &nbsp;I never want to accidentally make any changes to that folder, including adding a new file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've marked the folder as read only but as the setting states, this only effects files in the folder, not the folder itself. &nbsp;Is there a way I can prevent all users from being able to add a file to that directory (at least when a certain partition Windows
 7 is running) ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought about just zipping the folder but foreign characters in certain filenames are giving me problems with that. &nbsp;Any help/ideas would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave</p>

            <p>I'm thinking maybe the best way for me to create a completely read-only directory (meaning no new files or folders can be created in it) is to create a .vhd file, mount it and then point a shortcut to it... Any thoughts on why this might not be a good idea?</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player 11 in Windows XP, Play Next is greyed out</h2>
                    I have been having trouble for a while now. WMP used to play one song in the Library then play the next one. It has stopped doing this and only plays one song at a time. Also, 'Play &gt; Next' is greyed out. I have to either :<br />
- highlight the next song, then press Play, or<br />
- create a playlist (or rather 3 as I have a big library), in which case it works and Play &gt; Next is not greyed out any more. But then I can't edit the tracks as it is a playlist.<br />
I have re-created my Library a few times, but the problem persists. <br />
I aso have the same problem in another computer. <br />
It may be the size of the size of the Library (it has about 20,000 songs, well below the limit of 100,000).<br />
I do not think it is the size of the filepaths.<br />
I have a new computer but am reluctant to instal my Library there, I'd rather solve the problem first.<br />
My apologies if this query has been replied to before. I looked in the forum but could not find this query or a reply that would help.<br />
Many thanks.<br />

            Thank you for your reply, will try this in a few days when I finished sorting the new laptop. But briefly :
<br />
Restart - is this the same as Reboot ? if so, both computers have been rebooted many times and the problem remains.<br />
Or is it&nbsp; your suggestion 2 ? (sorry I'm not much of a techie)<br />
Re your two Start/Run suggestions : what are they for ? - I have already recreated the library a few times, to no avail.<br />
Again, many thanks for the help. <br />

<br />
Restart - is this the same as Reboot ? if so, both computers have been rebooted many times and the problem remains.<br />
Or is it&nbsp; your suggestion 2 ? (sorry I'm not much of a techie)<br />
Re your two Start/Run suggestions : what are they for ? - I have already recreated the library a few times, to no avail.<br />
Again, many thanks for the help. <br />

Those are to re-register and fixing the problem.<br />
<br />
Just Click Start &gt; Go to Run menu&nbsp; &gt; copy-paste those two commands (one followed by another) and press the Enter Key in each case.<br />
<br />
You are using Windows XP-so if you find the above process difficult just reinstall

            I know this is an old topic, but I had to reply to give marilou an answer to this problem, because I know exactly what she's talking about.&nbsp; I've been searching for the last few days trying to remedy it and there's been nothing out there.
<br />
<br />
I also use WMP 11 for all my music.&nbsp; I view my library in what he says "songs mode."&nbsp; If you're looking at the library, the path up in the left hand corner shows the symbol for a musical note &gt; music &gt; library &gt; songs.&nbsp; I also then switch it from an "expanded
 tile" view to a "details" view.&nbsp; It lists all 20,000 of my tracks.&nbsp; I have them sorted by "artist" alphabetically.&nbsp; If I wanted to, I could click on the first track and it would continue to play all 20,000 tracks in a row without stopping.&nbsp; In this "mode"
 I also like to shuffle them, where it will randomly play tracks from my whole collection.<br />
<br />
Now, for some reason I'm not sure of, it stopped doing this.&nbsp; When I clicked on a track it would play that track but stop and not continue to play the next.&nbsp; Pulling down the "view" menu showed "next" as greyed out.&nbsp; Shuffle did not work.<br />
<br />
I realize I could create playlists but this is what I was used to.<br />
<br />
So the remedy I stumbled upon by fiddling around:<br />
<br />
Looking at your library as described above (symbol for a musical note &gt; music &gt; library &gt; songs), click on "Songs" in the left pane, do a right click and click on "play."<br />
<br />
That's it!&nbsp; Everything back to normal. <br />
<br />
I had rebuilt my database a couple of times, thinking it was corrupted, and I lost some custom settings and tags, but at least it's back to my comfort level.<br />

            THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU!!!<br />
I had tried everything (for years it seems) to no avail, even after having checked all the tips I could find on this subject. All I could think of doing was to create playlists and use them to have the tracks playing after one another, or shuffling. I don't
 know how you came across it cos I thought I'd tried everything, but obviously I hadn't!<br />
Thank you so much! Is there a star system in this thing, you deserve a gold medal, that is the only tip that worked.<br />
With best wishes for a fantastic new year!<br />

            Hello again,I seem to have hit a glitch since I did what you suggested, and wondered if you did too - in which case, did you manage to solve this one? The Library doesn't update any more, although 'Add media files to library when played' is still ticked
 in the Tools/Options tab. Neither do dragging the file from Windows Explorer into the WMP library, nor redoing the Monitoring folders exercise (no new tracks found although I have 2 new ones which should be in). Since you were lucky in finding a solution to
 the 1st hurdle (the only person who has so far in my opinion) I just wondered if you had any idea... Many thanks in any case.

            Hello again again again!<br />
Having googled the fault, it appears the library database is corrupted so I deleted it in order for WMP to repopulate an uncorrupted one&nbsp; in the library. Which it has done, but only the non-mp3s. Since the majority of my music is mp3 it is a tad annoying.<br />
I have tried it variious times, and even put back the original dbase (I'd made a copy of it), but it's always the same. I'm looking for a solution online but no luck so far...<br />
All the best.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire Collection 2018 update</h2>
                    I have been playing MS Solitaire Spider free for years and it has always been the best version.&nbsp; Now it has been ruined by games apps ads hijacking the game before you can start playing.&nbsp; There is no way to get rid of them unless you pay, which defeats
 the whole purpose of letting you play these card games for free because now, obviously, it isn't, unless you suffer through the video clip until it has played out, which is really, really annoying and not good for anyone's blood pressure.&nbsp; I feel really resentful
 that Microsoft has done this&nbsp;to what was a marvellous card collection.&nbsp; So, my question is: Why does Microsoft need to make even more money from lowly solitaire players on top of the megabucks they already make from selling its other products?&nbsp; Are they being
 downright greedy and don't give a **** about their end users?

            <p>Hi Kaloyan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depends upon how far away they are from each other. At best, a wireless keyboard has a maximum range of 30 feet, very often much less, maybe around 5 feet</p>
<p>It is possible to select different channels by pressing the buttons on the bases of the units, but channels can't be set manually. You may find the process problematic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keyboards of the same make and model are more likely to become unresponsive even if you do manage to get different channels, but that is not to say that they definitely will. Again, it is all down to distance apart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please post in case you have any further issues, we will be glad to help you further.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>"Wireless 800" is pair from one keyboard and one mouse. In my case mouse works fine but keyboard doesn't connecting to dongle and there is not button on dongle. So my question is there any way to pair keyboard with dongle?It’s same brand and model "Wireless

    <title>Removing foreign language fonts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcbarker69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing foreign language fonts</h2>
                    Does anyone know of a way to remove the many foreign language fonts from Windows 7? There wasn't an option to exclude them during setup. I've tried deleting them, but Windows tells me that they are system fonts which cannot be deleted. I've also tried
 "Hiding" them, but they still show up in the font list in Office and other programs. All I want and need are the basic English language fonts. Having to wade through dozens of useless (to me) fonts is a major annoyance. There should be a way to exclude them
 from my system if I don't need them.

<p><span>Hello mcbarker69,<br />
<br />
The reason that I did not know the fonts in question is because no particular fonts were mentioned, and I had gone into fonts and removed a couple foreign&nbsp;fonts with no problem. However that being said, in order to remove the fonts that are being referred to
 follow these steps:<br />
<br />
Take ownership of the file:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;- Click <strong>Start Orb</strong> &gt; type <strong>fonts</strong> in the search box &gt; click
<strong>Fonts</strong><br />
&nbsp;- Right-click the <strong>font</strong> &gt; click <strong>Properties<br />
</strong>&nbsp;- Click <strong>Security tab</strong> &gt; click <strong>Advanced<br />
</strong>&nbsp;- Click <strong>Owner</strong> &gt; click <strong>Edit<br />
</strong>&nbsp;- Select your <strong>Username</strong> &gt; click <strong>OK<br />
</strong><br />
Click <strong>OK</strong> on the Windows Security box<br />
<br />
Change Permissions of the file:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;- Click<strong> Permissions</strong> &gt; click <strong>Change Permissions</strong><br />
&nbsp;- Select your <strong>Username</strong> &gt; click <strong>Edit</strong><br />
&nbsp;- Checkmark<strong> Allow </strong>for<strong> Full control</strong><br />
&nbsp;- Click <strong>OK<br />
</strong>&nbsp;- Click <strong>OK<br />
</strong><br />
Click&nbsp;Yes on the Windows Security box<br />
<br />
&nbsp;- Click <strong>OK</strong><br />
<br />
You will need to remember the names of your font(s) that you want to delete.<br />
<br />
Delete the file:<br />
</span><br />
Will need to start Safe mode with command prompt<br />
<br />
Restart your computer and tap F-8 continually, this will bring you to your Advanced Boot Options, select Safe mode with command prompt.<br />
<br />
Once you have booted:<br />
<br />
In command prompt navigate to fonts:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;- type <strong>cd c:\windows\fonts</strong> &gt; press enter<br />
&nbsp;- type <strong>del "font name"</strong> &gt; press enter *Do not use the quotes around the font name<br />
<br />
This should bring you back to a clean prompt.<br />
<br />
Once you are finished &gt; Ctrl+Alt+Del &gt; select restart from the arrow in the bottom right corner of your screen and start Windows normally.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />
<br />
As the Windows Security box states; this could cause Windows to act differently. Make sure you know which fonts you are removing and that Windows does not need them before you remove any protected system fonts. This could cause many complications with your
 installation of Windows.</p>

<h3> momogom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touch keyboard not popping up &#47; language layout error &#47; Touchme engine not being installed</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have several problems with my Surface Laptop 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. touch keyboard is not popping up even when it's on Tablet Mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have to click on the keyboard icon everytime I want to type in something, which is very bothersome.</p>
<p>I updated the Windows and drivers but nothing got fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Korean language layout is not working properly on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2-1. the toggle key (Korean/English key) was missing.</p>
<p>I was trying everything but nothing worked; I am now using Autohotkey instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2-2. sometimes the language input doesn't work properly.</p>
<p>For example, I want to type in ? but instead - gets typed in.</p>
<p>When this happens, I cannot even change to other languages (EN to DE, for example) using Window logo key with space bar.</p>
<p>I have to restart my laptop everytime this happens.</p>
<p>I reinstalled the language several times but it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>This is a major problem that puts me off from using this laptop.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I can't install Touchme engine on my laptop.</p>
<p>It keeps saying I have to check my Internet connection or restart the computer.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with my Internet connection and it doesn't work although I restarted my laptop several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly, I hope I can get a refund for my laptop; I just didn't expect these errors to occur...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks for your help in advance.</p>
<p><br />

                    what is needed is the correct drivers for the hp w2558hc monitor, specifally the web cam and mic and all other devices. Currently what MS7 windows has is incorrect and when the pc doc runs it says there devive driver problesm we tried deleting the drivers
 still it does not work, the only way to fix it is unplu the webcam cable, then the device driver goes away.&nbsp; It was working ok in in vista and when hp gave me the free upgrade to ms7, that when the errors started. I still thing there was trouble even in vista
 because of the blue screening. MICROSOFT And HP needs to get to get together and put the right drivers in MS7 or update the old the last time it was updated was 2006.&nbsp; they sstesm now i have is a 64 bit MS7, we have tried everything. it works but it does not
 run right because of the driver problem and the only way to correct it to unplu webcam cable from monitor when not in use.&nbsp; it gives you 3 errors and it all evoles the internal devices of this monitor like the w

    <title>Can its controlling registry key&#40;s&#41; be identified&#47;located - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlesskripka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can its controlling registry key&#40;s&#41; be identified&#47;located from a particular file explorer file or folder&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Every time my Asus X55LA 1.0 Windows 10 laptop reboots it loads a "www.trovi.com" file, "secure prefrences", in the same location--"C:\Users\hyperneph\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Secure Prefrences". &nbsp;I delete It only to have it reappear
 at the next reboot. &nbsp;I have a similar but less frequent problem with "MyWebSearch", which is loaded at at reboot in these two locations: &nbsp;"C:\Users\hyperneph\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\cmedhionkhpnakcndndgjdbohmhepckk" and "C:\Users\hyperneph\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User
 Data\Default\Extensions\ocifcklkibdehekfnmflempfgjhbedch.<br />
</p>
<p>Both of these species of malware are langliape/junkware/toolbars downloaded along the way with freeware. &nbsp;I find them with an anti-malware tool (SpyHunter4, free version) which runs on reboot. &nbsp;Since deleting them does not prevent them from returning, there
 must be controlling registry keys that SpyHunter4 does not detect. &nbsp;Hence, my question: &nbsp;"Can its controlling registry key be detected/located from a particular file explorer file or folder?".<br />
</p>
<p>I hope this is not an unreasonable question. &nbsp;Any help help would be really appreciated. &nbsp;I have had this problem for over a year. &nbsp;I apologize for the length of this communication.</p>

<p>1. On which browser does it load? Is it Microsoft edge, Internet&nbsp;explorer&nbsp;or chrome?</p>
<p>2. From when are you facing this issue?</p>
<p>3. Did you make any changes in the system prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the issue is due to malware. So, I suggest you to run the Microsoft safety scanner, and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your interest Ms. Devadika.<br />
</p>
<p>I have seached File Explorer for similar entries in Edge and Internet Exploer with negative results. &nbsp;I cannot thoroughly search the registry for them since the appropiate keys are not all identifiabe, which is the reason for the original quirey in the first
 place. &nbsp;The very presence of these known entries in File Explorer implies the presence of at least two species of malware; the locations of these entries in File Explorer indicates their presence in Google Chrome, my default browser, and to which I have added
 several apps and extensions.<br />
</p>
<p>The difficuty preventing these entries reloading may also mean other malware is present as well--another reason for inquiring whether one can backtrack from a File Explorer entry its controlling registry key. &nbsp;I have not been able to document the presence
 of any other malware with any of several free version, third-party, anti-malware tools such as Spybot, Malwarebytes, Exterminate It, and AdWare Cleaner as well as McAfee Security Center, Mirosoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool and now with Microsoft
 Safety Scanner.<br />
</p>
<p>I have been working on this issue since it first appeared about eighteen months ago, the first time I ran SpyHunter4 which predated my upgrading from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.<br />
</p>
<p>I hope this the information you requested.<br />

<h2>            Account password recovery</h2>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do remember that before everything changed I transfer my account to another email address. But it turns out that it is only a change of account name instead of my contact email address. Can I recover my Microsoft password with the email address of my account?
 What could I do now to recover my account?</p>

            Hello
<br />
<br />A pleasure to help you as an independent collaborator.
<br />
<br />I regret that this happening through this situation, to find the best way of solution I recommend you validate the following situations.
<br />
<br />1- You want to recover your email account, simply access the following link by placing the requested values.https: //account.live.com/acsr
<br />
<br />2 - If you have problems to recover your email account, which was created a while ago and do not remember the password, alternate email or phone number associated with the account, I recommend.
<br />
<br />- Fill out the form to create a new request for technical support, you must provide correct and sufficient data so that this process is satisfactory. Otherwise, the system can identify that they are insufficient and will not provide the link for the recovery.
<br />From the following link. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/es-es/supportrequestform/d75c9d92-a918-3a46-52bd-565a528f1b64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/es-es/supportrequ...</a>
<br />
<br />- After completing the form, you will receive an email with the number of the application which can follow up or respond to the expert assigned to your request from the link that you attach in the email you received.
<br />
<br />3- In case you can not establish communication, I recommend contacting the Support team via chat where you will receive an immediate response by a non-virtual expert. He will ask for the 9-digit application number he received when filling in the form for the ownership of the account.
<br />
<br />You can establish contact with a Microsoft Support Agent

<br />
<br />If you are presenting some of the situations below:
<br />
<br />If you do not remember your password, reset it
<br />If you can not get a security code
<br />If you change your security information and have a 30-day waiting period

<br />If your profile is temporarily blocked
<br />If you are traveling or using a new device
<br />If you are trying to log in to your PC with a local account and not with a Microsoft account

<p>If you have a set of recovery DVDs or CDs that either came with the system or that you made after you set it up, place the first DVD or CD of the disk set in the DVD/CD drive when you first power it on. Boot from the DVD/CD and follow the on-screen prompts.</p>
<p>-or</p>
<p>If there is no usable recovery partition on the HD and if you do not have a recovery disk set, contact Dell to purchase the recovery disks for your model.</p>
<p>-or-</p>
<p>Failing all that, place the Windows XP SP2 disk in the drive. Boot from that. Use the facilities on the disk to delete the present installation and install a new copy of the OS. You might have to visit the Dell site to get the supporting device drivers for
 the laptop's hardware. If possible, do that first and burn the drivers to a D or copy them to a USB thumbdrive or the like.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Lenovo G580 - cant connect to certain wifi networks</h2>
                    <p>Hello I have a Lenovo G580, it has trouble connecting to certain wifi networks for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a wifi tplink exteneder at home which every device can connect to apart from my Lenovo laptop.</p>
<p>Also at work, there is a wifi network, everyone can connect to it on the team except for me. I am the only one with a windows 8 laptop and the only one unable to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this laptop for 2 years and not been able to connect once to these 2 networks.</p>
<p>I can connect wifi ok to my main home one fine, but its really frustrating that i cant connect to the 2 mentioned networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the 2 years ive had 3 different antivirus programs so don't think its anything to do with that, ive also had to do factory reset twice but still these 2 networks ive not been able to connect to ever.</p>

            <p>Hi Jan, thank for your input</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is, it connects to my modem at home fine, its the wifi extender its not connecting to upstairs. All other devices in the house connect to the wifi extender (tlink) fine, only this laptop doesn't. I have 4 phones 2 tablets a win 7 desktop and an
 old winxp deskptop in my daughters room which all connect ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At work we have a wifi network that every other user can connect to apart from this laptop, more than 100 different devices have connected successfully at some point to the work wifi network. Besides I don't have power to change the work modems and routers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm seriously considering getting rid of this laptop and getting a MacBook, unless theres a way to downgrade to windows 7 as my old laptop used to connect to this network fine which was windows 7..</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Neo JunkieInfiltrator,<br />
Thank you for replying back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to perform these below steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Try resetting TCP/IP and check if it works.</strong><br />
Follow the steps <br />
a) Boot to the desktop view.<br />
b) Open command prompt, right click in the left corner when the Start window appear and select command prompt (admin).<br />
c) At the command prompt, copy and paste (or type) the following command and then press ENTER:<br />
netsh int ip reset c:\resetlog.txt<br />
Note: If you do not want to specify a directory path for the log file, use the following command:<br />
netsh int ip reset resetlog.txt<br />
d) Reboot the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer this:<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/299357?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/299357?wa=wsignin1.0</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Reboot the Device</strong><br />
• Open the Network Connections Panel<br />
• Select the corresponding Network Connection by either right clicking (Mouse) or Hold Selecting (Finger).<br />
• A Context Menu will popup. Please Select Forget Network.<br />
• After the Network Connection is dropped, please Reconnect.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong> If the issue does not resolve try to connect the computer directly to the router using an Ethernet cable to troubleshoot a network connection in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connect the computer directly to the network router using an Ethernet cable to determine if the connection problem lies with the router settings or with the wireless signal. It is not necessary to turn off the computer's wireless network device during the
 testing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Move the computer closer to the router (if needed) and connect an Ethernet cable from one of the available ports on the router to the network port on the computer.</p>
<p>2. Wait for one minute, then check the Network Connection icon in the notification area on the Windows desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 4:</strong><br />
This problem may be fixed by switching your network adapter driver from Broadcom 802.11n Network Adapter to Broadcom 802.11a Network Adapter. By default, the system uses Broadcom 802.11n Network Adapter. Here is how to do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press Windows Key + R and put devmgmt.msc in Run dialog box and hit Enter to open Device Manager.
</p>
<p>2. In the Device Manager window, expand Network Adapters and right click on your WiFi network adapter, select Properties.</p>
<p>3. In the next window so open, switch to Driver tab and click Update Driver. </p>
<p>4. Next, click Browse my computer for driver software.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5. Moving on, click Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer in below shown window.
</p>
<p>6. Now you’ll reach Select Network Adapter section, where uncheck Show compatible hardware option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
7. Last step will result enlisting of available network adapters. From the Manufacturer section, pick Broadcom and from Network Adapter section, pick Broadcom 802.11a Network Adapter. Click Next.
</p>
<p>8. Finally, click Yes in Update Driver Warning prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this way your system is updated to Broadcom 802.11a Network Adapter setting. You should reboot the machine to make changes effective. After restarting, check if the issue still persists.</p>

            <p>Thanks Annu, but unfortunately all these methods have failed.</p>
<p>Well I can connect using an Ethernet cable, but that's not really practical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its baffling how I can connect to some wifis but not others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I brought my sisters Toshiba windows 8.1 laptop to work to test it and that connects perfectly, as does my phone and Blackberry playbook tablet.&nbsp; So its definitely not the wifi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Lenovo laptop connects to my home wifi fine and other wifis, but not the work wifi or the home TPlink wireless booster.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Some routers have built in Firewall. You need to check whether it’s enabled, if so you won’t be able to connect to the Wi-Fi through that Router. I would suggest you to get in touch with the ISP and check the
 router firewall whether it’s causing the issue. Also you should get in touch with the IT Admin at work as they have their own security parameters which won’t allow you to connect.</span></p>

    <title>Turn off purchas notification - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pioneer411  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turn off purchas notification</h2>
                    
<p>Is there a way to not receive an email every time I make a purchase? It wasn't like that before they got rid of Microsoft points, now I get an email for every purchase I make and it gets a little annoying having to go into my email and delete them all the
 time. I understand the point of letting you know if an unauthorized purchase was made or something, but I live alone and have no worries of anyone sneaking on my Xbox and buying something without my knowledge. There has to be a way to turn this notification

            <p>I think it's there as a security measure, and a pretty good one to have too.</p>
<p>If the emails bother you, you could go into your email settings and automatically filter them out into a separate folder or set them to deletion automatically (auto-deleting is inadvisable, though) using rules and such.</p>
<p>However, there are other ways for people to gain access to your account (not just through the console) and if they started spending money through it I am fairly certain you would want to be informed immediately.</p>

<p>How can I "add" an email address to be notified when purchased are made to an account? &nbsp;My child has an account and has rung up purchased and didn't find out until getting CC bill a month later. &nbsp;Basically a way to add a secondary email for purchase notifications.

</p>
<p>I desparately need a way to reduce/eliminate white backgrounds due to dry eye/eye fatique issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; The XP os seemed to have greater flexibility in this area.&nbsp; Windows Vista and Windows 7&nbsp;seem to be&nbsp;another story, however.&nbsp;&nbsp; Under "personalize &gt; advance
 appearance settings&gt; window color and appearance" in Windows 7 Enterprise,&nbsp; I am selecting a custom color&nbsp; for "window" to suit my needs, however, the result is less than desired.&nbsp;&nbsp;The "window" color selection will control&nbsp;applications like MS Word, but other
 windows such as those for open file folders still come up with a bright white background.&nbsp;

    <title>Cannot boot after Windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robblazina  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot boot after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    I did the upgrade from 8.1 to 10 which seemed to work okay but the machine was really slow. I tried to restore/reset the OS (keeping 10). I started getting a no boot device error and it kept restarting. So I went through the process to completely reinstall
 OS (including partitions) and now I get a message "no bootable device--Please restart system". So I went through the process of creating a bootable USB drive and a DVD using the &nbsp;Microsoft tools. No change. The machine can see the USB and DVD drives in the
 BIOS and is set to boot from them but now luck..... now what.....?

<p>
</p><p>Up until just a few days ago, maybe a week, my black list in MS Family Safety worked great, which includes bing.com&nbsp; (haven't tried google yet).&nbsp; All of&nbsp;a sudden it won't block Bing. I removed Bing and readded to the block list, I flushed browsers (chrome
 and IE11), I rebuilt the family filter profile. No good. It will block any site I put in there EXCEPT bing.com

<p>
</p><p>Is the porn so important to Microsoft that they can't allow their search engine to be locked down at will or filtered?</p>

            <p>Clarification:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I added Bing.com to the block list in FF, which worked for months, but as of last week, it's blocking everything in the list but Bing. &nbsp;I recreated the FF profiles and added all the sites from scratch to the block list and still everything is blocked by
 FF, except Bing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the method 1 and it said that FF was not installed (which it clearly is) then did a repair reporting a corruption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran it again and it said the same thing. Now ANY new sites I add to block list are not blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I think I need to uninstall &nbsp;FF altogether. &nbsp;Are there preferred instructions for that which will wipe out whatever corrupted setting there is? &nbsp;I have have all the necessary passwords and such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>B.S.</p>

            <p>BTW, I'm sorry for my irritable indictment that MS did that on purpose. It seemed like a targeted change and not being able to 'lock' the search filter in Bing leads me to believe that MS doesn't really care, but I shouldn't flame like that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
