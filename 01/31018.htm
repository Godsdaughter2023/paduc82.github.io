<h2>            Dell 5437 touchpad Multitouch gestures behaving not as expected</h2>
                    Hello,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have a Dell 5437, and I recently upgraded it to Win10.&nbsp;<br />
The problem I am facing is that when I swipe 3 fingers up, it opens the Search, and if I swipe 3 fingers down, it opens settings. How do I revert these back to the default ones? I dont see any such option anywhere in settings.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Yash

            <p>It does not show that I have a precision touchpad, but in the Dell touchpad settings, it shows all the multitap and swipe gestures (and they are enabled).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But initially when I had upgraded to Win10, the gestures worked perfectly. Could it be because of some windows update?<br />

            <p>I got a temporary solution to get the gestures back, without the trouble of reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. open "Task Manager"</p>
<p>2. In the "processes" tab, find the process "synaptics touchpad 64-bit enhancements".&nbsp; For a different driver version, the process may get different names.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3. right-click and select "open file location". Remember&nbsp;its&nbsp;location, just in case the program won't restart automatically.
</p>
<p>4. in "task manager", end the process &nbsp;"synaptics touchpad 64-bit enhancements".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process should restart instantly as if it had not been ended at all.&nbsp; If it do not restart, run it manually.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then gestures are back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It works on my Inspiron 14 5447.&nbsp; Touchpad driver version is 19.0.15.2.&nbsp; Other version might&nbsp;get a different name for that process. Its&nbsp;favicon in "task manager"&nbsp;is the same as the touchpad icon on the down-right corner of desktop.</p>

            <p>I just woke my laptop from sleep mode. The 3-finger-gestures were all mixed up again, just as expected. Then I ended the said process and the gestures were all back instantly. It worked like a charm on my laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you end the right process? There are 3 synaptics process in task manager. </p>
<p>What's&nbsp;the touchpad driver version on your Dell laptop? </p>

            I choose the right process, exactly like the one in the picture. I have the same driver version as you as well. I even tried downloading the latest drivers from the Dell website for my laptop but so far nothing has worked.&nbsp;

            <p>If killing the process as said in my previous replies does not help, try the following.</p>
<p>1. open "device manager"</p>
<p>2. In "Human interface devices", find "I2C HID Device". Disable it, then enable it.&nbsp; Multi-finger gestures might be working properly now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Notice: There's a "Synaptics HID Device" under "Human interface devices". Just leave it alone.</p>

            Although you could follow those instructions, usually the place to create new folders and documents is in My Documents (just so that you have all of your user-created material in the same place).<br />
<br />
I suspect that the reason the instructions have you place My Website in the root of the drive is so that it's easier for the person writing the directions when they later have you save things there.<br />
<br />
Click Start and then click My Documents.&nbsp; This opens a Windows Explorer window showing the contents of your My Documents folder.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Depending on how your computer is set up (and which version of Windows you're using), you may see a blue column on the left side of the window with the heading "File and Folder tasks."&nbsp; See this image:
<a href="http://onlineitpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/mydocs.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onlineitpro.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/mydocs.png</a><br />
<br />
If you have the blue column, just click on the link that says "Make a new folder."&nbsp; A new folder will appear at the bottom of the list in the right pane with the words "New Folder" highlighted.&nbsp; Just type My Website and press Enter and the new folder will be
 renamed My Website.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If the blue column does not appear, just click File (at the top left) and then New and then Folder.&nbsp; This is exactly the same as clicking the "New Folder" link in the File and Folder tasks column.<br />
<br />
If you want to follow the directions exactly, after you click Start &gt; My Documents, just type C:\ in the address bar and click the green Go button.&nbsp; This will change the display from your My Documents folder to the location where the instructions want you to
 put the folder.&nbsp; Then follow the rest of the directions above.<br />

<p>It was deleted with the same method received in early reply from you, it was marked as an answer and solved the issue.</p>
<p>I also found free utility called Superantispyware free edition, which is capable of deleting files but tend to keep the folder which has then to be deleted manually.</p>
<p>I have also&nbsp; tried initially to change permission in windows to everyone but I did not make this as inherited that may be the reason it did not work.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Microsoft shocked the world with a brand-new lineup of Xbox One consoles at E3 2016, and they are moving swiftly with their plan to provide different options to gamers. Next year will bring Project
 Scorpio, but now has already brought&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Xbox One S</span></a>.</strong></span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Those who have picked up the Xbox One S have been able to enjoy the features of the slimmer, slightly newer system. Albert Penello, who is the&nbsp;senior director of product marketing and planning at
 Xbox, talked about the Xbox One controller that has come with Xbox One S.</strong></span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>“Personally, I think we have best controller ever made! To be clear, connection to the Xbox One S still uses our high-bandwidth, low-latency Xbox Wireless protocol. We make that Wireless Protocol
 available on PC with ourXbox Wireless Adapter for Windows.</strong></span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>“However, we wanted people to be able to use their same controller more easily OFF the console in tablet and laptop situations. By adding Bluetooth support people playing on a Windows 10 tablet or
 PC can use the controller ‘on the go’. I think our Xbox One Wireless Protocol provides the best experience, and now I love the added flexibility we provide by adding Bluetooth,”&nbsp;Penello told&nbsp;<a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2016-inside-xbox-one-s-tech-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Eurogamer</span></a>.</strong></span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Gamers will ultimately be the judge of such a claim as they tend to be, but the Xbox One S controller at the very least seems to be an upgrade from the controller we saw with the initial Xbox One
 release in 2013.</strong></span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Microsoft will release a slew of Xbox One and Windows 10 exclusives this coming fall with games like&nbsp;Forza Horizon 3&nbsp;and&nbsp;Gears&nbsp;of War 4.&nbsp;The firm plans to space out its exclusives more in the coming
 years, instead of the fall heavy lineup they’ve exuded the past few years. Xbox One S is available now.</strong></span></em></p>

<p>I posted recently that the original XB1 pad was the best I've ever used.</p>
<p>The XBS pad is better in my opinion. </p>
<p>Not a huge jump but feels more comfortable, better quality, just slightly better all round.
</p>
<p>Someone said to me on Twitter, hardly worth buying a slim model for but as I explained, I didn't just buy it for the controller but the controller plays a big role. I mean it wouldn't be that great to be playing on some of your favourite games with a pad
 you were struggling with, whether it was just too big/small, uncomfortable, made your hands ache etc

<p>I really like the XB1 controllers however they are not as durable as the 360 as my Xbox one controller has stick drift. And I've also heard people having issues with elite controllers breaking too

<p>1 Elite controller.</p>
<p>And no problems.</p>

<p>The standard controller as well the elite controller is the most worst experience i've ever had.
</p>
<p>1,5 years = 3 standard controllers....the actual elite controller is half the way done.</p>

<p>^ Maybe the problem is how you treat them if your going through that many. &nbsp; If everyone else was I could see the issue, but clearly three standard and an Elite isn't normal.

<h2>            My Acer pc is running very slow after only just managing to load the desktop after many boot failures.</h2>
                    My Acer pc is running very slow after only just managing to load the desktop after many boot failures.&nbsp; When I first tried to load it it gave me the option of system repair which fixed nothing and at one point I received an error message about a d3d10_1core.dll
 file. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am on windows 7.<br />
<br />
I tried doing a bit of research about cpus running slow and found I needed to update the d3d10core.dll file (the one below in system32 folder) which I downloaded and replaced after restarting it loaded the desktop again but still runs just as slow.<br />
<br />
I also found that issues with these files can be caused by viruses, trojans, etc.&nbsp; which I must have had.&nbsp; I can't even do a virus scan because my Norton security won't work and appears to be corrupt, the icon on the taskbar has gone and can't find the app
 to start it.&nbsp; The desktop icon brings up a tiny window with nothing on it.<br />
<br />
What can I do fix the problem?<br />
<br />
EDIT:&nbsp; BTW my cpu usage isn't the problem, It rarely goes above 5%<br />

<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>

 the computer to start as usual</b>”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Try to run
<b>Microsoft Safety Scanner</b> for any spyware or malware infection and check if it helps.</span></p>

                    <p>I got this year on May 3rd my new headphones, and I got home, I connected my headphones through Bluetooth to my computer (this are my&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/inspiron-15r-5537/configuration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">computer</a>&nbsp;specs,
 with windows 8.1), and they worked perfectly, after this (about a month later) I got a Bluetooth update, I read what it did, and it was a normal update, just some bug fixes and some other stuff. When I finish updating my computer, the computer asks me if I
 want to restart it because I did some other updates that required it, so yeah I restarted it, but when it turns on again, I go to Settings to connect my headphones, and there is no Bluetooth option, so I restart my computer and there's still no option, so
 about 2 weeks passed without me really paying attention at this problem, but afterwards, I actually reset my computer (going back to windows 8) so I get the Bluetooth option back, and my headphones start working again, so as soon as I update my computer to
 windows 8.1, and the headphones weren't working, there was still the Bluetooth option but they just didn't work, they appeared as Paired but when I turned them on and try to connect 2 things would happen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st.- They would connect in a strange way (normally when you connect the Hesh 2 Wireless headphones a voice says "connected" but they would only beep).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd.- They appear as connected but then in the Bluetooth menu that appears on the desktop they would appear like they weren't even making a signal to try to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And before you ask</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, they work with Mac, my phone and other PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I tried to set the Bluetooth support service to Automatic, and it already is in automatic and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I tried the troubleshoot options, it finds problems, but when it tries to reinstall the drivers it fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, if you plug them in with an auxiliary cable they work (and you may ask, if they work with an auxiliary cable why would you need Bluetooth? Because I paid $40 more just so they could have Bluetooth)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tested, and other Bluetooth devices aren't working either, at least another set of headphones I have, maybe it could be something about Bluetooth audio devices</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for my english, I'm from Venezuela :)</p>

            <p><span>Hello Andres,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and I appreciate your efforts taken to resolve the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Mostly these type of issues occur when try drivers are not installed correctly and interference with other devices. So in that scenario we try multiple methods to fix this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try to remove the hidden device drives from the Device Manager and restart the computer. Let the Windows install the generic drivers and then see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also try to update the chipset and firmware drivers from the computer manufacture’s website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Press <strong>Windows Key + X key </strong>and click on <strong>Command Prompt</strong> (Admin) from the task list.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Right-click <strong>Command Prompt </strong>from the start search list and then click
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow.</strong></em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. At the command prompt, type the following lines, pressing <strong>Enter
</strong>after each line:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1 </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>cd\ %SystemRoot% \System32 </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>start devmgmt.msc </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Device Manager window will open.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. Click on <strong>show hidden devices</strong> under View menu Tab.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>6. Expand all the nods under device manager<strong>.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>7. There would be many greyed out entries in device manager.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>8. <strong>Right-click</strong> on every <strong>greyed out entries </strong>
under all the nods and then click on <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>9. Restart the computer. On restart, Windows will re-install the generic drivers automatically.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>10. Now test to make sure that the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, then try method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try to <strong>manually remove the corrupted registry key </strong>
and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so, follow the steps given below and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>a. </span>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> key and Run window opens.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>b. Type <strong>RegEdit </strong><span>in the open box and click<strong> Ok.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c. Click on the plus sign (+) next to the following location:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Go to <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}
</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>d. <strong>Right Click </strong>on the key in the Left Pane - Export it so you can reverse in case of a mistake. Save as Remove-Filters.reg (any name is ok with .reg as extension).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>e. In the Right Pane look for any of these = <strong>UpperFilters</strong> -
<strong>LowerFilters - UpperFilters.bak - LowerFilters.bak </strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>f. If any exist <strong>Right Click</strong> on them – <strong>Delete.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><em>Important this section</em></strong><em>, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these
 steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article

    <title>Formatting the PC with a Windows 10 Single Language from another - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wilson_filho_1610  say:</h3>
<h2>            Formatting the PC with a Windows 10 Single Language from another locale&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I currently have a Notebook with a Windows 10 Home Single Language from the pt-BR locale.</p>
<p>I'm going to make a clean install from a Media Creation Tool USB, due HDD failure. Can I use the en-US media? Because I prefer using Windows in English. Will it will only activate with the pt-BR version, that was the first activation?</p>
<p>I don't actually need the UI to be in Portuguese, so I won't bother to change after installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a Lot.</p>

<p>The IT person I took my computer too says it is locked up. He can get it to turn on, to where he hears the fan running, but it won't reboot. He is the one that told me it's because I downloaded Windows 10.</p>

</p><p>I can not login skype on my Belkin skype wifi phone (Product ID: AKF1PP000GN-SK) recently.&nbsp; I have tried many times that it always showed "Try in was not successfull, try again".&nbsp; It could be the software problems I thought.&nbsp; So I made my phone to reset
 all to the original setting and reconnected my wifi router again.&nbsp; After several minutes, a message appeared "May be require web authentication (not supported by this device)" before&nbsp;I connected to the wifi network. When&nbsp;it connected to the wifi network normally
 it always told me to login skype unsuccessful when I tried to login.&nbsp; This situation has happened never before.&nbsp; Is my device not suport to use for skype now?&nbsp; If it is not, please tell how to solve it out.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>This has happened to me as well. The weird thing is, I didn't have online for awhile and it did NOT let me play the game(Mass Effect 2). I don't know what causes it though.</p>

<p>It occasionally does that with ME2 for me and it has done it once with the ME3 demo. I honestly do not know why it keeps doing it.</p>

<p>There was a period of about a week where I got this message once a day for both the ME3 demo and ME2. My friends received it as well, but not with the frequency that I did. I will assume that it was EA's spectacular (read crappy) servers, or the assimilation
 of the ME3 server into the fold. </p>

<p>Yeah. I've been getting the same thing. Each and every time I start Mass Effect 3. It's like it has to start twice each time. Strange as I always use the same exact same profile, each time.</p>

<p>I have had the same problem too.</p>
<p>I have installed the latest app on my phone and it has all my recent conversations and on my laptop I have updated my profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both accounts seem to be different but has the same password and the same email address associated to the account so I am sure the programme knows who I am but the two are not Sync'd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody know how to get the two programmes to recognise changes and update either accordingly?</p>

<p>Open a different browser, this will ensure that no accounts are automatically signed in.</p>
<p>Access this link: <a href="https://go.skype.com/account.diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
click here</a> enter your primary email address and click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p>
<p>You will be routed to a page where you can see the Skype account/s associated with your email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are more than one accounts, access them one by one and check if you will be able to see your contacts and chat messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if the same issue persist.</p>

<h3> gluepack  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I restart download after failed</h2>
                    <p>I lost power during the download of Windows 8 and have tried restarting the download.
</p>
<p>The only method I could find was executing a desktop icon called Download Windows which appeared to do nothing. However, when you attempt to run it a second time it does imply that it is already running although there is nothing obvious to indicate that.
</p>
<p>Unsure of what was happening I tried contacting support in my country of residence (where I don't speak the language) who didn't have a clue what to do (err, "restart the system" - lol, I think it did restart when the power came back on)&nbsp;and then contacting
 support in my country of language who didn't seem to speak my language very well&nbsp;for some reason.</p>
<p>Anyway, I was given a website address <a href="http://www.mswos.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.mswos.com</a> where I could enter my order number and restart the download.</p>
<p>However, there is absolutely no indication that anything is happening apart from in Task Manager there is a background process called Windows 8 Setup that is running at approx. 50% cpu. I assume that is responsible for the download (although disk activity
 is pretty minimal) but how on earth do you know? The download was going to be about 45 minutes originally so I guess I have to wait at least that long to see what happens but surely MS could show some indication that something is happening. Who would think
 of looking at Task Manager? </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is it a wired or wireless network?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b>Let’s run the Network troubleshooter and see if it can detect and fix the problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the Microsoft Help and How-to article for more information on running troubleshooter:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Using the Network troubleshooter in Windows 7</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-the-Network-troubleshooter-in-Windows-7</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>Additionally, I'd recommend updating the firmware of your router as well as updating your wireless network adapter's drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The majority of connection problems within Windows 7 have been solved by installing the latest driver for the network adapter obtained from the manufacturer. Download and install
 the Windows 7 compatible drivers and check if the issue gets fixed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on updating drivers, see

<span>System passes POST, bootloader, "Windows is Starting" animation. USB devices initialize, and the mouse pointer appears. The screen remains black (no background, login dialog, accessibility/power buttons, etc.) indefinitely. The mouse still moves and NumLock
 can be toggled, so the system has not halted - it just doesn't get any further than that. After 15 minutes power-saving kicks in and the display goes to sleep - Moving the mouse or pressing a key turns it back on again as though everything is normal, but it's
 still stuck at the black screen.</span><br />
<br />
<u>Events leading up to this:</u><br />
<br />
<span>I have been using a PCIe JMicron-based SATA card with a broken eSATA port, and I recently got an ASM1061-based SATA 6Gbps card to replace it. This new card is PCIe 2.0 and my motherboard only has two 2.0 slots - the x16 and x8 slots meant for video -
<span>I have been using a PCIe JMicron-based SATA card with a broken eSATA port, and I recently got an ASM1061-based SATA 6Gbps card to replace it. This new card is PCIe 2.0 and my motherboard only has two 2.0 slots - the x16 and x8 slots meant for video -
 so I was testing what difference it made running my gfx card in x8 mode. I decided running it this way was OK, so I started tweaking the SATA card. I had seen reports that using the generic Microsoft driver with this chipset was hugely detrimental to write
 performance, so naturally I tried to install the newest ASM one. This didn't work, as Windows told me "this location does not contain information about your hardware". I resorted to using the driver's installer program, which ran perfectly - but Windows kept
 using its own driver anyway.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Finally, I decided to try the older version of the ASM driver. This installed properly and the device was no longer listed as a generic ATA controller. On a hunch, I tried updating the driver again (without rebooting) to the newest driver, and Windows
<span>Finally, I decided to try the older version of the ASM driver. This installed properly and the device was no longer listed as a generic ATA controller. On a hunch, I tried updating the driver again (without rebooting) to the newest driver, and Windows
 accepted it with no complaint this time. However, my firewall (Outpost) asked me whether I wanted to allow direct disk access to an uncertified/??? driver. I affirmed this as it was intended. It's worth mentioning that Outpost was being a nuisance when I was
 testing PCIe slots, as it wiped its configuration file each time I moved my NIC. This meant it lost all the rules regarding which system components were allowed to do what, and had me confirm each one.</span><br />
<br />
<span>I then rebooted to MS-DOS on a USB stick to update the SATA card's firmware. I restarted into Windows several times without issue, but the SATA card didn't show during POST or in the Device Manager. Turns out the uploader mislabelled a BIOS OROM module
<span>I then rebooted to MS-DOS on a USB stick to update the SATA card's firmware. I restarted into Windows several times without issue, but the SATA card didn't show during POST or in the Device Manager. Turns out the uploader mislabelled a BIOS OROM module
 as the add-on card's firmware. Back in DOS, I flashed the correct/original file, but the card still didn't seem to work (no BIOS info page, still absent in Windows) so I went back and flashed it a third time. After that theBIOS splash screen re-appeared and
 it seemed like everything would be fine.</span><br />
<br />
<span>However, upon booting into Windows, I was now getting a consistent BSOD:&nbsp;</span><b>STOP 0x00000024 0x0000000000190494</b><span>&nbsp;(I only have the first two numbers, which I googled on my phone out of curiosity). I rebooted to safe mode and the same BSOD

 came up after CLASSPNP.SYS was listed. At this point I inserted my Windows DVD and ran the Startup Repair function, which took a while but completed successfully. I checked the log after it was done and the only reported issue was that the 100MB System Reserved
 partition was "corrupt". After restarting, the BSOD is gone but I now have this black screen/no login issue.</span><br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry that you are facing such an issue with Windows. It seems you have tried most of the troubleshooting steps to correct the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try to repair the
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927392#method1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Boot Configuration Data</a> and the master boot record and check if it helps. Go through the steps and check if
 it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists you may perform a system restore from Windows Recovery Environment and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Insert the Windows 7 installation disc into the disc drive, and then start the computer.<br />
b. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD".<br />
c. Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and then click Next.<br />
d. Click Repair your computer. <br />
e. In the System Recovery Options dialog box, choose the drive of your Windows installation and click Next<br />
f. At the System Recovery Options Dialog Box, click on System Restore.<br />
g. Follow the System Restore Wizard instruction and choose the appropriate restore point.<br />
h. Click Finish to restore the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Refer:</b></p>
<p><b>What are the system recovery options in Windows 7?<br />

            <p>This is probably because the logon files are corrupt. This has happened to me, also. Safe mode will not do anything but hopefully, you created a repair disc. If you did, boot from the disc, and use System Restore. Follow instructions and it should work.
 It did for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also: Do refrain from excess customizing. Windows is good the way it is.</p>

            Thanks for the replies.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c478213e-2ee3-4e0e-9bf6-7d9e76c9e9ad">Rohit Chettri</a>: I tried using bootrec.exe, no luck. The actual
 boot-up sequence should be fine though as the correct installation is detected and executed. As for System Restore, there are no restore points to revert to.</div>
<div><br />
<div>AJHDMI: You might be right - when this debacle started, one of my applications (a self-contained .exe which keeps track of whether it has been run before) presented me with a "welcome new user!" screen.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried booting into Vista, and proceeded to completely remove my Users\MyName folder onto another drive. Nothing changed, but when I rebooted into Vista again to put the folder back, it appeared Win7 had created a new MyName folder and all the default
 folders within it, so it's at least getting that far.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Knowing this led me to try a different angle of attack - I tried connecting to the machine via Remote Desktop. Unfortunately it times out and reports a connection failure. Went to the command line, and tried pinging the machine - no luck. So it's not even
 bringing up the network.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Next I'm going to to take a deeper look at the NTBTLog.txt generated when the "Record Boot Trace" or similar startup sequence is chosen... I glanced at it briefly but it seems to contain years' worth of data and only address whether each driver was loaded
 or not, not the reasons why. There's also the log created by SFC.exe, however that is many, many kilobytes of text for each boot and most of it is above my head.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If anyone has other suggestions, please let me know.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to perform a repair install also known as an

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important: do not forget to backup your data before performing the steps.</p>

            Hi again, I would love to do the repair install as I am 99% positive it would fix the problem, however as far as I know this procedure can only be done from Windows - which is a problem since I cannot log in to Windows in any mode (Safe/Normal/VGA/Etc.)
<div><br />
<div>I would love to find out that I am wrong about this though.</div>

            I would recommend running a repair upgrade
<br />See link below by Andre Da Costa on how to do this.
<br />This will not remove data or applications but reinstalls WIndows over-top to fix any corruption.

            Hi, Renee, 
<br />If it is not hard to you to reinstall system, do this, System is damaged,
<br />Alternate way - to analyze dism.log and trying to repare can take more time.

<h2>            Windows 8 stuck at microsoft logo on install</h2>
                    Hello, i recently purchased windows 8 Pro. I am upgrading from windows 7 but something seems to have gone wrong and I'm not sure how to fix it. I get through the entire installation process, checking files, the install, etc. After the computer restarts
 it goes through the setup process, gets a black screen and the windows logo pops up with no loading circle and gets stuck there. I left it for a couple of hours to see if it would progress and it still failed to get any farther. Any guidance on how i could
 fix this?<br />

            <p><span>Hi Gv1222,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to the Windows 8 Community.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From your problem description, I understand that you are unable to install Windows 8 and gets stuck in the middle.
<span>&nbsp;</span>It might be disappointing. Please don’t worry; I’ll try my best to help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have compatible hardware and your computer still stops responding, disable any unnecessary hardware. Remove universal serial bus (USB) devices; remove or disable
 network adapters, sound cards, and serial cards; and then restart the installation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to that here are some steps that you can try.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Disable the security software temporarily</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</b></a><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</b></a></p>
<p>Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus
 software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Place the computer on clean boot.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Clean boot: To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is
 known as a "<b>clean boot</b>." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.
</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong> When the troubleshooting is over, do not forget to reset the computer
 to normal startup. Follow step 3 in the above-mentioned article.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Place the computer on hardware clean boot.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Please restart the system twice and check if it boots to the desktop. If you have connected any external devices like printer, scanner, camera, USB drives, external hard
 drives etc, please unplug it and restart the computer once again. If it works, please connect the device one at a time and identify which one is causing the problem. Then install updated device drivers.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 4: Run CheckSur on the computer.
</span></b></p>
<p><span>Please Download, install and run System readiness tool and check if are able to download and install Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>System Update Readiness Tool fixes Windows Update errors in Windows 8, Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2008:</span></b></p>

 &nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>This may take about an hour to run completely and not to cancel the scan at any point. Once done, ask to restart the system and then install Windows 8.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue is not resolved, Please follow below path and send us the file named as
<b>CheckSur</b></span></p>

<h2>            Updated to Windows 8.1 and system crashed</h2>
                    <p>I updated to my system to 8.1 and a week later after shutting down for the night, the next morning I get the&nbsp; blue screen that says
</p>
<p>Recovery </p>
<p>Your pc needs to be repaired. </p>
<p>The boot configuration data for your pc is missing or contains errors.</p>
<p>file:\EFI\Microsoft\Boot\BCD</p>
<p>Error Code:0xc0000185</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You'll need to use the recovery tools on your installation media. If you don't have any installation media (like a disc or USB device), contact your system administrator or PC manufacturer.</p>

<p>I've done all of this... and my computer seems to be responding BUT for it to boot into the flashdrive, it took about 3 tries and 23 hrs. From there it took another 24 hrs for the pc&nbsp;to ask me if I wanted to "refresh" or " reset" is this at all normal...
 this is my first time experiencing such a slow boot</p>
