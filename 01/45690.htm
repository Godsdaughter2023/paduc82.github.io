<h2>            Windows wont play .MOV files</h2>
                    After downloading a .MOV video, windows will not play it. A message appears that says required codec not found. In the media player options, the box marked download codecs is checked. Why does window media player not download the .MOV&nbsp;codecs ?

<div>=========================================<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

The 3ivx codec is supposed to enable WMP to play <br />

<h2>            Samsung series 5 ultra touch, intermittent touchscreen problems</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;
<div>Windows 8 was already installed when i purchased the computer. Now sometimes when i boot it the touch screen doesn't work. The computer seems to think it isn't a touch screen, even in PC info it says that there is no touch or pen. When i restart is always
 seems to fix the problem and then in PC info it says full touch support. I have to restart it almost every time I turn it on to get touch screen.</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>
<div>Thanks</div>
                </div>

            <p>The problem is likely Fast Startsup, the PC boots faster but all the drivers do not always load but they will when you restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn off <strong>Fast Startup</strong>, your system will take longer to boot but it should resolve your problem of double booting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to Control Panel &gt; hardware and Sound &gt; Power Options, click Choose what the power buttons do, under Shutdown settings, uncheck Fast Startup if there is a check mark in it.&nbsp; When you do a Cold Boot it will slow down the boot and your touch screen should
 take effect,&nbsp; but like I said, booting will take a little longer.</p>

<h2>            Chrome has stopped working</h2>
                    chrome has been working perfectly on windows 10 until today.&nbsp; As a Chromecast user it is important that I have chrome on my PC.&nbsp;An update has just finished on my PC and now when I open chrome, it opens, then a box pops up saying that chrome is no longer
 working.&nbsp; I have restarted my computer, un-installed and re-installed Chrome, and through the file menu used "troubleshoot compatibility".&nbsp; has the last update done something to stop chrome from working altogether?&nbsp; Or am I just an idiot?

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome and thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I understand you are facing difficulties in browsing web.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As reported by Insiders on the build 10525, 64 bit Google Chrome will crash on launch.
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=522201#c36" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Google is aware of the issue.</a> In the meantime their 64 bit Google Chrome Canary build or 32 bit Google Chrome will work on this build. So, I would suggest you to contact Google support
 for this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Reference:

            <p>Canary works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still pretty pissed though since I have been using Chrome 64-bit without problem until today. It worked this morning but stopped after the restart to apply updates.</p>
<p>Tried&nbsp;re-installing fresh and tried the compatibility troubleshooter. Neither helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was something in that last update which broke Chrome. Maybe it is time to switch to a Chromebook and dump Microsoft completely.</p>

<p>I don't like the fact that Google is a big brother now and no one is saying anything about anti-trust toward Google.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand this is not the first time that Microsoft made changes to stop a competitor browser from working.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I am grateful for all the good that Microsoft has done, but lets just make the product capabilities bring the users toward it not forcing them.</p>

            Can you post some info about your statement "<span>Microsoft made changes to stop a competitor browser from working." such as where did you get that info? I'm running 3 systems all have Google chrome, and many of my customers
 also use Chrome and are not having any issues.</span>&nbsp;Also helps if you check the date of the poster as the one that you replied to is over a year old and yes Chrome was having issues with it's code on that older build, which was fixed in a couple of days.

<h2>            Acer Aspire V5&#40;431P&#47;471P&#41; In-built mic not working.</h2>
                    I recently bought an Acer Aspire V5 about a week ago, It worked totally fine for the week until I realized I wasn't able to use Voice Search on Google, so I thought chrome was having a issue and I checked the mic using Skype Call testing service. I wasn't
 able to hear my voice at all and I tried things I found in the Control Panel, Troubleshoot and check Sound &amp; Devices to make sure the microphone was not muted. There was also a tick mark indicating that the microphone is working fine. But it was not. This
 is an urgent issue because I use Skype pretty often now. Hope anyone can help.<br />

            <p>Hi Alvin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You seem to have an issue with in-built Microphone, refer to the following information and check the issue status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000">This might be due to some incorrect audio settings or it might be due to the out-dated audio HD drivers. Let’s try the following methods and check if that resolves the issue.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i><font><font color="#000000"><font>Method 1: Make sure that the Microphone is not disabled and is set as default.</font></font></font></i></b></p>
<p><font color="#000000">Make sure that the microphone that you are using is not disabled and is set as default in the computer. Follow these steps to check this:</font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>a)</font><span> </span></span></span><font>Right click on the volume icon and select “Recording devices”.</font></font></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span><span><font>b)</font><span> </span></span></span><font>Now, right click on an empty space and select, “Show disconnected devices” and “Show disabled devices”.</font></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">Now, check the issue. If it is already enabled, then try the next method and check the issue.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i><font><font color="#000000"><font>Method 2: Run Recording Audio Troubleshooter</font></font></font></i></b></p>

<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Do
 you remember making any changes to the computer (hardware or software) before having this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This issue can be related to hardware on your computer. The front and the rear jacks on a computer operate on different sound cards.
 If the sound does not play on rear jack, you can try to reinstall the drivers for the sound card which you have already tried. If still fails to play the sound on your computer. I suggest that you check if the soundcard on the computer is defective. You can
 contact Touchmate to help you better with this. </span></span></p>

    <title>Windows Firewall is turned off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> violets  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Firewall is turned off</h2>
                    I've had ZoneAlarm firewall installed on my computer for some time, the Windows Firewall is turned off. When I started my computer today there was a red security alert icon in the lower right screen telling me the Windows Firewall is turned off. As far
 as I know it's been turned off since the ZoneAlarm was installed. I restarted the computer and the alert was still there. Windows Security Center shows only the Windows Firewall, it doesn't show the ZoneAlarm. The ZoneAlarm is on and running normally, I've
 confirmed this in the Task Manager. I ran my anti-virus and spybot programs and nothing turned up. Why am I suddenly getting alerts about the Windows Firewall being turned off? Is this something I should be concerned about?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The real issue is ZoneAlarm.<br />
<br />
Low cost 3rd party software firewalls are pretty much problems waiting to happen. They all have compatibility<br />
issues and offer only a few enhanced controls. In fact their issues often actually lower the overall security
<br />
instead of raising it. The Windows Firewall has no compatibility issues and is extremely secure if you know<br />
enough to bypass most of the hype. Quality software firewalls cost thousands. Most routers have&nbsp;hardware<br />
firewalls built in and those are considerably better additions for the buck than any cheap/low cost software<br />
firewall.<br />
<br />
So I recommend you get rid of ZoneAlarm and stick with the Windows Firewall. Of course you should only have<br />
one active firewall as they will interfere with each other if 2 or more and that really lowers security and causes<br />
problems.<br />
<br />
======================================<br />
<br />
Remember only 1 Firewall running at time and many of the low cost ones will interfer by just being on<br />
the machine much less by being active.<br />
<br />
Some antivirus/security products could be&nbsp;causing this error. McAfee, Norton, Windows Live OneCare,<br />
Threatfire are a few. Which antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on machine now. And<br />
which have you EVER had on it even if you uninstalled them. (These leave remnants which cause
<br />
strange issues.) <strong>So with ZoneAlarm its a definite in your case.</strong><br />
<br />
Check the default services and dependencies to make sure they are running.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend :
<p>Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have thrown at them.<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very reliable and compatible.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and Network running.</p>
<p>Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free</p>
<p>Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)</p>
<p>IE - Protected Mode</p>
<p>IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)</p>
<p>I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom right of IE)</p>
<p>Avast - Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and Network running.<br />
(Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields - Terminate those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security programs. This is
<br />
a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp</span></a>&nbsp; &lt;-- download<br />
</p>
<p>PCmag - Prevx - Editor'a Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a></p>
<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that would be unsual with<br />
Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie (no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as<br />
a scanner. I have many scanners and they never find anything of note since I started using this setup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />

                    <p>I recently acquired a Nexus 5 phone.&nbsp; When connected via USB to my Acer laptop (Windows 8.1) it is recognized by Control Panel and also by the "Safely remove device" facility, but not by Windows Explorer so I can not access photos on the phone.&nbsp; However
 everything works perfectly on my wife's old Dell laptop running Windows XP.&nbsp; Can anyone help with this problem - thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just fixed the connection problem. Just follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Connect Nexus to PC using USB<br />
</li><li>Open Device Manager;</li><li>View &gt; Show hidden devices;</li><li>Expand ACER Device and double-click on the first ADB interface icon that's connected (i.e. doesn't appear dim);</li><li>In the Properties pop-up, Driver &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse computer for software &gt; Let me pick from a list...&gt; select MTP interface
</li></ol>
<p>After selecting MTP as your interface, you should be able to access your Nexus folders and everything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>

            Visual FoxPro is no longer being developed by Microsoft is not officially supported especially under newer feature updates. You might want to consider moving Firefox off Windows 10 and to a virtual machine running a stable supported release of Windows 10 such as Windows 7 or Windows XP.

</div>
<div>I recently installed W8.1 and all is well except that the spellcheck does not work in my browser(Chrome), or anywhere else except MS Office 2010. The notifications are on, auto-correct is on and the option to highlight is also on. Still it doesnt work.<br />
I use a Dell Inspiron 1564 if that relevant.</div>
<div>Does this have something to do with the drivers in the computer?</div>

<h2>            Wifi Configuration Utility has Stopped Working</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to set up WiFi on my laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I access: My Wifi Technology the Profile was created except for the end. When I attempt to complete the process in "Advanced" I receive the following message -- My Wifi Configuration Utility has Stopped Worked". A problem occurred then it closes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within My Wifi Techology: I have checked all areas such as: Options -- Automaticlly Enable; Power etc.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've checked Device Manager/Networ Adaptors: at which point, I updated all listed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I access: Proset/Wireless Tools/Diagnostics I get a message indicating, "Hardware Radio Off".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not have an option to turn it on. When I access the Radio Switch via the Task Bar the "Enable" option is grey.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I am not able to tell if Wifi is on via the keyboard (ie f12)&nbsp;due to it does not light up when selected.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions or comments are greatly appreciated. </p>

    <title>Win 10&#58; Recovering a mirrored drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ephonk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10&#58; Recovering a mirrored drive</h2>
                    <p>I had a Win 10 system working fine with twin 1 TB drives setup in an Windows controlled mirror, as drive F:.
</p>
<p>Then my boot drive failed. I had to replace it and reinstall Win 10 from scratch. I have been unable to reintroduce my mirrored drives to it.
</p>
<p>In Disk Management they show up as disks 3 &amp; 4, Dynamic, 3725.90 GB, Online. But in the partition part of the view it reads "Failed". They are not in any way accessible.<br />
What the heck happened here?&nbsp; I contacted Microsoft support and was told "mirroring is not within our scope of support since that concerns harddrive and hardware part of the pc".&nbsp; Is drive mirroring an unsupported feature? How do I recover the data?</p>

            Hi Ephonk.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />After ten years daily, I've never seen anything good in forums about any RAID or mirrored drives.  The data is always lost if one drive fails, mirrored or not.  For this reason I do not recommend them except by IT professionals who have their own science about maintaining them and who may need to help you now to recover.
<br />
<br />Here are the best resources for how to recover Windows software RAID from the IT Pros: 
<br /><a href="https://www.anchor.com.au/hosting/dedicated/recovering_from_windows_software_raid_failure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.anchor.com.au/hosting/dedicated/rec...</a>

<br />
<br />The only method I've seen work in those ten years to recover is using Test Disk as shown in this tutorial to back up data and convert to Basic disk:  <a href="https://mypkb.wordpress.com/2007/03/28/how-to-non-destructively-convert-dynamic-disks-to-basic-disks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://mypkb.wordpress.com/2007/03/28/how-to-n...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            DS4 Controller and windows-&#40;Bluetooth issues&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello I'm Deidre and I'm a average PC gamer, I've had my HP Pavilion Desktop for a while now:</p>

<a href="https://www.amazon.com/HP-Pavilion-580-023w-i5-7400-Graphics/dp/B077S27YLP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;</a>580-023w

-Integrated Bluetooth 4.2 and Wireless LAN 802.11a/b/g/n/ac featuring Dual-band (2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz) 1 x 1 technology-
<p>
</p><p><strong>LONG STORY VERSION:</strong></p>
<p>Just until recently I've wanted a controller a controller for my video games, the DS4 ps4 controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought one off amazon and was very joyed when it arrived, i played for 3-4 days until it died from not being plugged in (The Bluetooth was working)</p>
<p>And it wasn't until recently when i plugged it into my pc to charge did it stop working....i let it charge for a full day.</p>
<p>When i went back to play with it, here was the issue: I'd turn it on and it would connect immediately (As normal) the issue was it had a different color bar color than normal (The original factory color is blue, i change mine to pink...when i turned it on
 it was blue...Not good) I knew something was up, i waited a few seconds and my PC told me it was registering..."setting up your controller"(Or something of the sorts) while doing so i questioned everything i did in the past week for it to rest or whatever
 it could be, or maybe i was reading to deeply into it...So, it had set up my controller but when it asked me to pair...i accepted, it turned off my controller and didnt connect at all.</p>
<p>Since then I've tried all the processes below, It's made me regret my purchase of the controller and windows 10 for my gaming PC's OS...( I heard controllers work better on windows 7, Windows 10 just refuses...)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SHORT STORY VERSION:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>New controller (DS4) Bluetooth worked for a week then it kicked the bucket, only working with usb...i need bluetooth, i play on my couch...not at the desk of a computer.</p>
<p>It wont connect now, it will...but when it tries to pair it turns off the controller and says it's connected...only a few seconds later it disables the image of it actually being connected to the pc.</p>
<p>Tried using the DS4 windows app...only works for USB...want Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Things i did to try to fix it:</p>
<p>-Uninstall then reinstall my Bluetooth drivers.</p>
<p>-Rollback my Bluetooth drivers</p>
<p>-Reset the controller from the back<br />
-When it paired and acted like it was connected i spammed the power button on my controller to see if i could fool the process that was turning it off...that failed.</p>
<p>-Mess with device manager for the properties of the controller and the Bluetooth....no succession.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Microphone only DOESN&#39;T work with Skype. How to fix&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using a Mac with Sierra OS and a Blue USB microphone. I also have a differrent mic set up via a SCarlett2i2 USB connection and the results are the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I test the mic's via the Apple System preferences the mic's work fine. They also work fine in Garage Band. However when I select them in the Microphone settings in Skype, they don't work. Oddly enough, they also don't work when I attempted to use it
 to recorde a Google Voice recording.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a solution for this? This all used to work but something has changed, I can't pinpoint what though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h3> west dan utd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sharing Xbox live gold</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have had an xbox one s for a number of years. I have an xbox live gold account that my eldest son uses for online gaming. I have just bought a second xbox for my younger sons and have set up their own accounts and gamer tags.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can i share the xbox live gold membership across my three sons’ logins and their gamertags? Can i share the gold membership across the 2 xboxes and can both xboxes be online gaming at the same time, for example, both playing fortnite? Or do i need more than
 one gold membership?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks in advance for any assistance</p>
<p>

            Your eldest son would need to set the new console as his Home console in order to share the gold and games. Then as long as he is signed in on his console he can still access the subscription and games while the other sons play on the new console.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox</a>

            So as long as you make your&nbsp;younger sons Xbox&nbsp;as the home Xbox&nbsp;for your Gamertag, the Xbox&nbsp;live gold will be shared, however only you will be able to use the gold membership on your console

<p>Hi there West, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out. In reference to your question, Yes most definetly you may share the gold subscription within 2 consoles.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take a look at the following troubleshooting article: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to designate an Xbox One console as your home Xbox</a>. </p>

<p>Let me clarify it a little better for you we will go with this scenario.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A1= Account 1 son with gold subscription and games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A2= Account 2 Son 2 w/o gold</p>
<p>
</p><p>A3= Account 3 Son 3 w/o gold</p>
<p>
</p><p>C1= old console</p>
<p>
</p><p>C2= new console</p>
<p>
</p><p>A1 can play on either console with no problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>A1 can set ONE console at a time as his home console and all 3 would be able to use his gold subscription and play his digital games on that one console.
<strong>Keep in mind though he would only be able to switch which console is set as his home console FIVE times a year.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now in your situation lets say C2 is going to be the A1s home console A1, A2, and A3 would be able to play any digital game A1 owns and use A1s gold subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On C1 A1 will Still be able to play his digital games and use his gold subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If A2 and A3 want to use C1 then they would have to be signed into A1s account at the same time they are signed in. The problem with this is if A1 wants to play on C2 at the same time as A2 or A3 are playing on C1 that is not possible because each account
 can only be signed into one console at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But say A2 and A3 want to play together on each console that would work just A1 would have to be signed in at the same time on whatever console is not set as the home console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this explains things a little better.</p>

<p>Hello! yes , its possible. One of the consoles must have the account designated as home xbox and in the other console you must have the session started all the time with the account that has the active xbox live membership. Here I leave you information about
 how to configure a console as your home xbox.</p>

    <title>The Sad Reality of Condemned 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dogtag duke  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Sad Reality of Condemned 3</h2>
                    
<p>I read this online........As an obsessive fan and follower of all things horror, I have lately been hooked on the unique combat and tone of the Condemned series, largely because it’s so baffling that such a promising and ambitiously different type of first
 person horror has since been completely forgotten.</p>
<p>Even though Condemned 2 did improve a lot of the problems from the inaugural game, I don’t think anyone would argue that the series didn’t have a long way to go to really find its sweet spot. So naturally, I’ve been aching to know: is there&nbsp;<em>ever&nbsp;</em>going
 to be a Condemned 3?</p>
<p>Silly me. Of course not.</p>
<p>A little while back, one of the developers spoke up on NeoGAF, flat-out crushing any prevailing hope for Chapter 3:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span style="color: rgba(78, 78, 78, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(71, 71, 71, 1)"><em>Sadly it will never happen. Condemned 2 just didn’t sell enough copies.</em></span></span></p>
<p>It is sad that Condemned 2 got caught up in the ‘everything needs multiplayer’. We could have really used the staff on multiplayer to make the single player campaign amazing.</p>
<p>There was some good ideas of where to take the game. I’ve always wanted to do a reboot and just play Condemned 2 off as a bad hangover and have Thomas closer to what he was in C1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, we all pretty much assumed that a third game was never going to happen, but that doesn’t make the sting any less unbearable. Condemned had so much unrealized potential. Hearing these words about forced multiplayer just makes it worse. Believe
 it or not, gaming industry, some developers really,&nbsp;<em>really&nbsp;</em>don’t need their attention diverted by something so extraneous as multiplayer in a horror game. As proven here, such distraction has the capacity to actually kill really promising franchises.</p>
<p>Nowadays, you can easily find both Condemned 1 and 2 at any Gamestop for a measly $5 each. The visuals and controls are dated, and both games come saddled with their own problems, but the franchise honestly boasted some of the best ideas and set pieces I’ve
 seen in horror this generation. <em>Please</em> give them a try.</p>

<p>Condemned:CO is a great game, especially early on in the lifespan of the 360.</p>
<p>As for Condemned 2, the campaign felt too different from the first &amp; just lost its edge.</p>
<p>The Multiplayer was clearly tacked on &amp; was one of those games I knew the MP wouldn't be anything special before the purchase.</p>
<p>I say developers need to drop the PVP MP for games &amp; add more Co-op Wave based combat scenarios if they really want people to play online. &nbsp;Like Mass Effect 3, something Dead Space 2 should of done.</p>

<p>The original condemned was awesome..loved every bit of it...Condemned 2 was not as good as the first in a lot of ways but was still decent game...I think&nbsp;the throw in of a ho hum multi-player really stole from the single-player experience....if they made
 Condemned 3 more like the original with less elements of the second than it would probably do a lot better.I would buy it.</p>

<p>Condemned needed repairs in some areas like most games, especially the 2nd game, but overall I liked the Story, and I'm still feeling sore about the 1st game because there was no patch ever made to fix the bugs that nearly cost me the final battle. I hoped
 over these years I would hear an announcement about a 3rd game, but clearly it doesn't have enough demand, would be nice to see Condemned in a whole new light.

            This is such a bummer to hear as Condemned was groundbreaking for immersive/visceral horror...the sequel went in a more action oriented direction and had some below average PvP but I had a great time with it. It was a fun universe and I’m glad we at least
 have the two games!

            It's a real shame because the first Condemned game was pretty great, the atmosphere was legitimately intense. It was really well designed from a aesthetic and artistic view, each shadow moving in the light spiked your heart rate, especially when you had
 a weapon that was almost broken. It could have stayed an awesome cult classic and beloved single game, or even a mainstay franchise with a new game every few years. Instead, Condemned 2 killed the whole thing dead, and even soured the memories of the first
 game.

<p>
</p><p>Cannot for the life of me figure out why my headset will not work. I have tried Drivers, and all usb ports. when i plug the usb part of the headset into the pc it will connect and show in playback devices, only for a couple seconds then disappears from the
 list.</p>
<p>If i set my device to realtek HD optical, and use my headset it works i assume that only because of the optical part. still cant use any DTS or surround just stereo</p>

            Hi Dominique, my name is Max and I'm an independent advisor.
<br />
<br />You mentioned that you can see your laptop name using the Reflector 3 app. Hence I suggest you refer to the manual “Using Reflector Teacher in the Classroom” and look through the section “To Connect on iPads or iPhones”
<br /><a href="http://docs.airsquirrels.com/reflector/RFT-in-the-classroom.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://docs.airsquirrels.com/reflector/RFT-in-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If it doesn’t help, I suggest you get in touch with the company developer of the Reflector Application

<p>========================================<br />
If the projects have been&nbsp;saved in&nbsp;the .wmv movie format...<br />
just import the collection of .wmv files into Movie Maker, drag <br />
them all to the timeline and save in the .wmv format to create <br />
a single video file.</p>
<p>Also...the freeware 'Format Factory' has a Video Joiner option.<br />
Once downloaded and installed...in the left pane...go to...<br />
Advanced / Video Joiner.</p>
<p>(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Format Factory<br />
<a href="http://www.pcfreetime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcfreetime.com/</a><br />
(FWIW...when installing...you may want to uncheck<br />
'all' of the boxes on the final screen)<br />
<br />
First...after downloading and installing Format<br />
Factory...you may want to open the program and<br />
left click the 'Option' button on the toolbar and<br />
select an 'Output Folder' / Apply / OK.<br />
(this is where you will find your files after they<br />
are converted)<br />
<br />
Advanced / Video Joiner / choose an output format / <br />
click the Add File button and select your video clips / <br />
OK / (back&nbsp;on main screen) / Start.</p>

<p>I have the same problem, but first a SIMPLE possible solution to the OP teacher's problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although this will not actually make one long movie, it will be an easy fix to achieve the same goal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every DVD maker software I have ever tried allows you to burn more than one movie file onto the same DVD.</p>
<p>Almost every DVD player software allows you to start the first movie on a DVD and when it is done it will automatically launch the next.&nbsp; So burn one DVD with multiple movies on it (I suggest titling them by students last name.) Then carry around just 1
 DVD, and be able to play all of the individual movies back-2-back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't be intimidated by the DVD maker software. Some call the individual movies "Chapters" but they are simply individual WMV files (The output of Windows Live Movie Maker). Also, unless you want to do a bunch of hard work, put the individual movie files
 all in the same folder and rename them in the sequence you want them to appear on the DVD. Unless you tell it to do something different, The DVD maker software is going to load the movies onto the DVD in alphabetical order using the file name.&nbsp; So if you give
 it three files called</p>
<p>&nbsp;"Smith, Jones, and Adams" then it will burn them as Adams first followed by Jones and last will come Smith. If you want them to play in the original order then name the files something like "AAA-Smith, BBB-Jones, and CCC-Adams."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>= = = = = = = = =</p>
<p>So back to the original problem. I have two WMV files already created that are basically slide shows with music. I would like to make one WMV from them. I followed the instructions for merging the PROJECTS and found a big problem. When each PROJECT was originally
 done they used the trick of using that button that fits the pictures to the length of the music. It, of course, adjusts the DURATION of each picture to whatever it needs to be but it is usually something like 4.318 seconds.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>O.K. The problem is that the duration in the first project is not the same as the duration in the second project so when the projects are merged and then the movie is saved it re-works the duration so that ALL of the pictures fit with ALL of the music. That,
 of course, messes up what we are trying to achieve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up reloading all of the pictures from both projects and all the music from both projects and then painstakingly setting the duration of EACH individual picture. It took a long time... Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
