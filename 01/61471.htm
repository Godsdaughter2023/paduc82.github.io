<h2>            Transfer music files from Windows Media Player to PC hard drive</h2>
                    I ripped a CD to my PC and the files were automatically available on Windows Media Player but not on my PC hard drive.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I get them to my hard drive from Windows Media Player in order to apply them to videos I'm creating?

            <p>Your files have already been put on your hard drive.&nbsp; WMP is just a "library", a set of pointers to hard drive locations - nothing is "on" WMP.</p>
<p>To find out where your files are, open WMP, click on Organise in the upper-left of the window then Manage libraries, Music.&nbsp; It will then show you which hard drive folders your music is in.&nbsp; You can do the same check for Videos &amp; Pictures.&nbsp; You can then
 open Windows explorer &amp; go to the folders concerned to do whatever you want with your files.&nbsp; A quick way of getting to an individual file quickly is to use Bikesh's suggestion &amp; right-click on a track in the WMP window then select Open file location.&nbsp; That
 will take you to the location of that music file.</p>

<h2>            low memory warning windows 7</h2>
                    I am getting low memory warning. I have been deleting files and uninstalling programs not needed, but the memory does not increase or change at all. I had plenty of memory and then suddenly one day I did not. Suggestions of possible solutions please.

            Hi catunegi,
<br />
<br />That password must be changed on your WiFi Router . . .
<br />
<br />In the back or bottom of your Router is a sticker with a UserName, Password and IP address (something like 192.148.006.001) printed on it
<br />
<br />Note those down
<br />
<br />Go to your PC and open a Web Browser
<br />
<br />In the address type the IP address and hit Enter
<br />
<br />That will bring up your routers configuration page
<br />
<br />Somewhere on that page you will find settings or advanced settings to to change your WiFi Password and if needs be the name of your WiFi connection
<br />
<br />Before you can change that, you will need to enter the UserName and Password you noted down from that sticker on the router
<br />
<br />That's It!       
        </p>

            Hey catunegi,
<br />
<br />It depends on how your network is setup. Call your internet service provider (Comcast, AT&amp;T, etc) if you don't have the credentials to your router.

            Hi Catunegi
<br />
<br />You must access your router  with your password and then in the configuration of the Wi-Fi connection, you can change.
<br />
<br />To get the router's page  you have to put the following address in the internet explorer 10.1.1.1
<br />
<br />I have one of the routers that installs xfinity in my home. I'll show a picture you how I do it but it depends what router and provider do you have.
<br />
<br />You can also call your Internet provider to show you how to do it.
<br />
<br />
<br />Let me know if I can help you further!
<br />
<br />Have a great day<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b8b5f1f5-9bb9-41e9-b920-3558c37bb79d?upload=true" />

<h2>            Error code 0x87DD0016</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i've been using my xbox one without any issues for quite a long time now. But yesterday, it wouldn't let me sign in. Everytime i wanted to sign in i was redirected to test my internet connection. Everytime i tested it it said that everything was fine but still couldn't get connected. So i decided to delete my account from my xbox and add it again. But when i did that it was then impossible to add a new account. So i decided to reset my xbox to factory settings. And now when i turn it on, it says "time to update" and then put me the error code 0x87DD016 saying it can't update right now. My internet connection is still perfect, i haven't changed anything of the settings i used for years.&nbsp;</p><p>Is someone familiar with that issue ?&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you and sorry for my language, i don't speak english often&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            32bit to 64bit with windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    When my 32bit windows 7 professional upgrade to 64bit windows 10 or will it be 32 bit still. I mistakenly had installed a 32bit OS but I have 16GB of ram. Would it be best to see what happens when it upgrades, then if it doesn't upgrade to 64bit, would
 buying windows 7 64bit cheaply after the 29th still upgrade to windows 10 for free.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You will need to download the Windows 10 RTM ISO when it is available to be able to
<br />
switch from&nbsp;32 to 64 bit.&nbsp;That will be on or after July 29th.<br />
<br />
Or&nbsp;you could now install the Windows 10&nbsp;Technical Preview 64 bit and then upgrade<br />
it to the Windows 10 RTM 64 bit.<br />

<h2>            Selling my 360, Is there any way to keep my digital games on the hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm selling my Xbox 360 but it has quite a few digital games installed on the hard drive. What I'd like to know, is will those games still be accessible if I delete my profile from the system? I'm trying to find a way to keep these games usable (so that
 I don't loose so much money on the sale), without making my profile accessible to whatever stranger purchases it from eBay. Is this possible?</p>

<p>[quote user="XEUS12"]So even if I delete my profile, those games will still be playable?[/quote]To repeat myself. Yes providing the licenses are in place the games will be playable. Easiest way to check is to unplug your console from the internet and see
 if the games will play offline. If they do then the licenses are in place.<br />
<br />
[quote user="XEUS12"]The buyer just won't be able to re-install them if they're deleted, right?[/quote]Again repeating myself. The buyer wont be able to download them again without buying them on their own profile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well I don't plan on buying a new system to transfer the licenses to. I'm just clearing out all of my old 360 stuff to make room for my XBOX One...so having them on a hard drive wouldn't help me very much. And yes, all personal info will be deleted before
 I ship, that's why I wanted to make sure that the digital games would still be functional after that info was removed.</p>

<p>Copy the data (not the program) to the Public folder (C:\Users\Public). Then when your wife and son log into their user accounts they can grab their data from Public and put the files in their own user directories as desired (My Documents, My Pictures, etc.).</p>
<p>As for programs, did you install the program for All Users? If not, uninstall it and reinstall it and make sure you don't install it just for the current user. Otherwise you can put the shortcut to the program in the All Users Start Menu. Right-click on
 "All Programs" button on the Start Menu and choose "Open" to get to the user-specific Start Menu folder. Choose "Open All Users" to get to the system-wide Start Menu folder. Just copy the program's shortcut from your Start Menu to the All Users Start Menu.</p>
<p>You also mentioned that your user accounts are administrators. This is not optimal. See below for the recommended setup of user accounts in Windows 7.</p>
<p><span><span style="font-weight: bold">User accounts - Recommended Setup</span> (<span style="font-weight: bold">Vista</span> and<span style="font-weight: bold">Win7</span> )</span>
<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista and Windows 7 are multi-user operating systems with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, and Guest. These accounts should be
 left alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista and Windows 7 because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily
 work and that account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it may require more work than you want to do. Best not to get into a bad situation to begin with.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</p>

<p>Thanks for the info unfortunately still not able to resolve the program issue.&nbsp; I have successfully managed to copy the shortcut to the other users desktop using the open all users etc but it does not link to the program even though mine does?&nbsp; so the shortcut&nbsp;sits
 there proudly but does not function.&nbsp; I have looked at permissions and owners but nothing I do sorts the problem.&nbsp; The program however still works perfectly via the shortcut from my own desktop.</p>
<p>Any further advice welcome!</p>

<p>You don't need to apologize but you do need to give me more information. First of all, what program are you installing that is giving you the problem? Secondly, have you set up your users as recommended? All your daily accounts should be Standard with an
 administrative user created for emergencies and elevation. You should be installing programs while logged into the Standard user account. Just provide the password/OK to the UAC prompt(s). Where are you installing this unnamed program? What version of Windows
 7 do you have? Example would be "Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit".</p>
<p>If this program is supported in Win7 and you are installing it in the accepted place (either C:\Program Files [for 64-bit programs] or C:\Program Files x86 [for 32-bit programs]) then the program should be available to all users. If the shortcut isn't working
 on your wife's or son's Desktop, what happens if you delete the one made by the program installation and just create a new one linked to the program's executable? Can you run the program's executable from the Search box? Example: Start&gt;Search&gt;type: winword.exe</p>
<p>Post back with the missing details and I'll be glad to try and help. You're not being a nuisance at all; I like to help nice people. That's why I'm here. :-)</p>

<p>The program is Microsoft money. I am using a disc that came with my last computer and from what I can gather is only supported up to about 5 years ago.&nbsp; Because I only want to use it as a glorified spreadsheet and not with any internet links and have been
 doing so now for years to manage my finances&nbsp;I am trying to continue using it&nbsp;with Microsoft7.&nbsp; I am doing so successfully on my own user page and perhaps its because it is not supported by 7 that it won't copy across to other users.&nbsp; My version is Windows
 home premium 64-bit and I have set up the users as recommended.</p>
<p>I have to confess that your 2nd paragraph last sentence is completely over my head!!</p>
<p>I may have answered my own query here but confirmation or otherwise would be good.&nbsp; I do appreciate your time on this.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I suspect that your old version of Money is simply not supported in Win7. If you want to pursue this, I suggest that you post in the Money forum.</p>
<p><a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/money/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/money/threads</a></p>
<p>It doesn't look very active, though. As you know, MS Money has been discontinued. If all you want is a spreadsheet (which is how I manage my own finances), then probably you should just get MS Office 2010 and use Excel or even just buy MS Excel 2010 separately
 (comes out next Tuesday). Another option, if you don't want to buy Office, is to download/install the free<a href="http://www.openoffice.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OpenOffice suite</a> and use OpenOffice Calc. Calc is a spreadsheet program similar to Excel and works perfectly on
 Win7. And one more option would be to use Quicken. Intuit has stated that their latest version of Quicken (which is compatible with Win7) can import your old MS Money data.</p>

<p>I hope this has helped. If you have more questions, don't hesitate to ask them.</p>

<h2>            The Same Windows 10 Updates Are Being Installed Every Day</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Windows 10. I have three updates that are being automatically installed every day, sometimes two or three times per day. The updates are KB2267602, KB3063843, KB2990967. For some reason no other updates have been automatically installed
 in the past two weeks. The updater seems to be caught in a loop. How do I fix this?

<p>Hello Pasindu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 may have encountered a system file corruption that caused this taskbar issue. For us to assist you with this, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>What is the current build and version of your Windows 10? To check, type in <span style="font-weight: bold">
winver </span>on the search bar and press <span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest that <span>restart the Windows Explorer.exe to refresh your taskbar functionality by following the steps below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Task Manager
</span><span>by right clicking the taskbar.</span></li><li><span>Click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">More details</span><span> at the bottom to expand the Task Manager window.</span></li><li><span>Under the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Processes tab</span><span>, look for</span><span style="font-weight: bold"> Windows Explorer.</span></li><li><span>After selecting the Windows Explorer, click the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Restart
</span><span>button at the bottom.</span></li><li><span>It may take a few seconds and things like your taskbar and Start menu may disappear momentarily, but when it restarts, things should behave better and you can exit Task Manager.
</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your reply.</p>

<p>Hello Xylee Del,</p>
<p>Yes I did made 2 changes!</p>
<p>1. I upgarded my laptop's RAM which was 4GB to 12GB</p>
<p>2. I tried updating my graphics card's drivers through the radeon software which is AMD Radeon R5 M355.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing the problem is with the AMD Radeon graphics card update, I've tried to download and install in three times, and each time once the installation started the windows crashes into a blue screen saying "Your PC ran into a problem, collecting more
 information". Then when i restart the PC this issue happened!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the steps you said such as restarting Microsoft explorer from task manager, but it made it worst after, where i couldn't even shutdown the pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally decided to make a reset of windows, which did work out but deleted all my programs which were installed, and I'm back with my task bar icons!
</p>
<p>Am I the only one who's getting this windows crashed while updating to the latest graphic drivers? wired!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way thanks for the help, if you have any suggestions about how to update without crashing please let me know!</p>

 ("adrenaline" which I'm not sure whether optional).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Not getting reward credits for pre-orders and purchases</h2>
                    <p> Last Thursday I got a promotional email from y'all offering 15,000 credits to my xbox live rewards if I pre-ordered Watchdogs 2.  I did this yesterday and don't see it reflected on the rewards site :(  I've had this happen in the past, pretty much every game I've bought in the last two years has been through the store but I'm not getting credit! </p><p>I haven't paid as close attention as I should because frankly, I find this all confusing, especially as it works with ordering things through the store directly from my xbox.&nbsp; But for this one I followed the link in the email and believe I did everything correctly.</p><p>I'm pretty bummed :(</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is what i get every time I try to system restore. I have tried chkdsk and sfc scannow and all is clear, I have also tried restoring from safe mode and deactivating my antivirus. Any help would be greatly appreciated, I deleted data that means a lot
 to me and I would like to get it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failing that, if anyone can tell me if there is another, simpler way of restoring deleted flash player local storage that would be fine, too, as the data I lost was due to clearing all of my local flash player storage by accident.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fall Creators Update introduces new features for a better customer experience. One of these features is to dictate Cortana what to do instead of typing it. However, this feature is available in US English only. If you are having trouble using Cortana after
 the update, here are some thing you can do to resolve it:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Troubleshoot problems with the Start menu or Cortana</strong></p>
<p>Follow the troubleshooting steps provided in this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12385/windows-10-troubleshoot-problems-opening-start-menu-cortana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to help resolve Cortana issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Re-register Cortana</strong></p>
<p>If the issue persists, try re-registering Cortana using Powershell command and see if it works. Follow the steps below:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the search bar, type <strong>powershell</strong> and select <strong>Windows Powershell.</strong></li><li>Right-click on it and select <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. Enter your admin credentials when prompted to continue.
</li><li>On the Powershell command window, type or copy-paste the following command and hit Enter:
<strong>Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers Microsoft.Windows.Cortana | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</strong></li><li>When the process if finished, close Powershell. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, try using Cortana again and see if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Get back to us with the outcome so we can help you out further.</span></p>

    <title>Xbox Live quests and Game Pass quests questions and concerns - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frostbyte33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live quests and Game Pass quests questions and concerns</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I was hoping to get some help determining if I was eligible for the rewards for the Xbox Live quests October and last month, December. I got a $5 dollar gift card today for the December&nbsp;month but that's only half the value as promised in the terms and condition, which is $10. I Also remember doing all of the objectives for October but never revived a message for a reward. I got Novembers reward just fine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Also about the game pass quest. I haven't revived the rewards for December yet even though I got a $5 dollar rewards from the Xbox Live quest so far. But those could be different, just again wanting to determining If I am eligible and if the reward will come.</p>



<p>So yea, just some concerns about past Xbox Live rewards rewards and Decembers&nbsp;Game pass reward, hopefully some one from Microsoft and help.. Thank you very much for reading.</p>

            <p>Hey Frostbyte33! The codes are sent out over the course of the following month so you the rewards for October should have been received in November. We have been able to determine that you received your November Game Quest reward, though it may have been late. You should receive your December reward in January, if you do not get it by February, please post up a new thread and we will take a look. Thanks!<br /></p>

<h3> jeremycheong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 1511 Black Screen After Login</h2>
                    <p>I have installed the Windows 10 november update(v1511) and it's working fine. I haven't touched my laptop for 2 weeks since December. Windows had started to download updates without notifying me(I knew it was downloading because my internet became slow).
 A few hours later, downloads were finished and I pressed the install button. Everything was fine after a restart. I typed my password to login and a black screen with a working cursor was shown.</p>
<p>
I tried to connect my laptop with an external monitor but both monitors showed the same thing. I booted into safe mode and reinstalled intel graphic card(my laptop has 2 cards, intel and nvidia) but it still shows me a black screen after login. There is an
 exclamation mark besideGeneric PnP Monitor in device manager.
</p><p>
</p><p>The windows update contained a cumulative update, security update for IE, update for windows malware removal tool and a few office updates, if I remembered correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could use the Ctrl-Alt-Del menu but it was very "laggy". For example, if I hover my cursor on a button, the button should "glow". But in fact, the button glows after a few seconds later. I tried to launch task manager from that menu but nothing was shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

            <p>Hello Pushyanth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything I could do before posting. As I stated in my post, I had reinstalled my intel graphic card but sadly, that didn't help. There was no RunOnce process either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I boot Windows 10, (my laptop is from 2011, it doesnt have UEFI), I notice that the spinning dots under the Windows logo are laggy. At first, it is fine but after a while it starts to be laggy. I am not sure if this has happened before.</p>
<p>Another thing is, my laptop display will suddenly bright up when booting. It will go dark after a while. This has never happened before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me asap. Thank you.</p>

    <title>SKYPE video is distorted for me but not for those I call - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chanaluntz  say:</h3>
<h2>            SKYPE video is distorted for me but not for those I call</h2>
                    <p>On Skype, the&nbsp; video on my screen showing me what I supposedly look like is very distorted, although the people I am SKYPing are seeing a perfect picture of me.&nbsp; How do I get my video to show what they see - rather than long lines going down that badly distort
 the picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is manageable, but very annoying, as i can't see what they are seeing, and so don't know where to hold up items etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On old versions of SKYPE there used to be buttons to create effects on the video, and it looks like one of these but:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) this is a new account on a different computer than I have SKYPed on before (with the camera moved from another computer, where it never caused these problems);</p>
<p>b) the distortion is not seen at the other end, just on my account (although when I try the test my video, it shows me the distortion).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot seem to find the distortion effect buttons anymore.&nbsp; But if it was one of them, surely those seeing me would also see the distortion.&nbsp; So it seems to be an internal problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any tips?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
Depending on the version of software you had and the key associated with it, you may be able to download a new version from Kaspersky's website. I would recommend e-mailing their customer service to make sure you can do this.
<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope this helps,<br />

Daavee,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the courtesy of&nbsp; a reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that, permit me to respond to your comments.&nbsp; Then perhaps I can get an answer to my original - quite simple, I think - question.</p>
<p>You commented in reference to my follow-up to the single reply I received to my original question, "I just read your other thread, which included these words:
<span><b>"This was not helpful.&nbsp; It would be more correct to characterize it as pedantic and circuitous."&nbsp;
</b></span><span>That might be a reason. If you present yourself as someone with a chip on his shoulder, don't be surprised if many people don't respond."&nbsp; In my opinion, the reference to an article which obliquely applied to my question was, as a result, pedantic
 and circuitous.&nbsp; In my opinion, it was not helpful.&nbsp; Perhaps I should said, 'thank you for your response', asked the question again. and hoped that I got a more responsive answer.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the annonymity of this forum does not permit direct response.</span></p>
<p><span>You commented, "<span>Another reason is you aren't giving much information. We don't know
</span></span>..."&nbsp; It is likely impossible to anticipate everything that all readers might find relevant.&nbsp; As a start, I included the information I thought would be of interest.&nbsp; I would be pleased to fill out a questionaire for any interested respondent,&nbsp;if
 asked.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You commented, "<span>Actually, the less impolite you are,&nbsp;</span><span>the more likely you are to receive a "competent response." Instead of behaving as someone who feels he is entitled to special treatment, you should remember that this is a peer-to-peer
 group. We're Microsoft Windows users, too. And you are not paying us for our assistance, either."&nbsp; I regret that you characterize my response as 'impolite' or seeking 'special treatment'.&nbsp; If a way was provided to communicate directly with the respondent,
 I could have asked a relevant follow-up question, such as, 'on what page in the referenced article might I find something relevant to my question'.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>I believe that the vast majority of Microsoft users would agree with my characterization of their [Microsoft's]&nbsp;reference materials as 'pedantic and circuitous', rarely straight-forward, and usually not helpful.&nbsp; Searching the Microsoft Knowledge Base
 is somewhat like asking a general question of the EncyIclopaesia Britanica without using the index,&nbsp; The answer is probably in there somewhere.&nbsp; Good luck finding it.&nbsp; Nonetheless, I appreciate the time and effort of you and the person who offered the singular
 response to my original question.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now, let me characterize the system.&nbsp; It is a Compaq laptop: Presario A900.&nbsp; It shipped with Microsoft Windows Vista Home Premium OS.&nbsp; The hard drive failed logically.&nbsp; I replaced it with a similar drive [Seagate].&nbsp; Because new computers do not ship
 with OS discs, I initialized the new drive with an available Windows 98 original CD.&nbsp; From this basis I was able to follow a defined upgrade path using an available Windows XP Professional original CD for upgrade.&nbsp; The Network Connections screen, found using
 the Control Panel,&nbsp;has only an Ethernet&nbsp;icon - no Wireless icon is provided at start-up, appears&nbsp;as a result of proximity to the wireless router, or is accessible from any</span> tab on this screen, or from any&nbsp;other screen.&nbsp; It appears that without the Wireless
 Icon present, there is no way to cause the computer to&nbsp;link to&nbsp;the available wireless service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p><span>Now having said all of that, let me re-ask my question: </span><span>Was&nbsp;Microsoft Windows XP&nbsp;Professional shipped with - or was it updated through the three principal&nbsp;Service Pacs&nbsp;before ending support to include&nbsp;- a wireless icon in the Network Connections
 screen found through the Control Panel?&nbsp; If not, since later OS packages do include such an icon, is there a straight-forward way to add this capability?&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>*****</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I realize that neither you nor anyone else owes me a response.&nbsp; I understand that I am not paying you.&nbsp; Please understand that - like many others who participate in this forum - while I am an experienced computer user, I am not a Microsoft employee,
 certified professional or professional IT consultant.&nbsp; If no one has a solution&nbsp;to offer, perhaps someone will have a reference to a soltware package I may purchase or a service I may&nbsp;hire to solve this problem and the related problem of recovering the data
 files from the old drive which is mechanically operative but logically unreadable.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>Quicktime is currently at version 7.7 (at least) so 3.0 is now considered old. Do a Bing or Google search for Quicktime 3. Be careful that your antivirus and malware detection programs/services are up to date before you download anything. Also, backup your
