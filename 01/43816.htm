<h2>            Mouse pointer hangs and freezes Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>I have this week-old Acer Aspire R11 (4GB RAM, Intel Pentium Processor), which I recently updated to Windows 10, and I noticed&nbsp;the pointer starts lagging when doing some tasks like playing YouTube videos on almost any quality, while downloading an application,
 and while playing any game, which can end up being really annoying most of the time. Does anyone know what might cause it and how can I fix it?</p>

<h2>            Skype...not able to sign in</h2>
                    <p>Dear Support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Samsung S9+ and I am not able to login to my Skype account.&nbsp; I have reset the password.&nbsp; I have cleared the data and cache.&nbsp; And I have also installed it from the Galaxy app store to no avail.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I go to the Skype Support page I get this message:&nbsp;
 &nbsp;This site timed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;When I go through the login process, I get this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oops there was a problem with Skype.&nbsp; Try signing out and back in.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is repeated.&nbsp; &nbsp;First in Black font then White.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is accompanied by a black Signout button and a LOGIN_ERROR message immediately beneath it.&nbsp; I have an interview on Wednesday and I really need to get it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reality I have had this problem since I bought the S9, but since skype worked on my&nbsp;laptop never really worried about it.&nbsp; But now Sype is not working on my laptop either!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank soo much.</p>
<p>

&nbsp;<br />
How are you trying to create a system repair disk?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</span><span>Value: 0x80004005 signifies - Unspecified failure.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Value: 0xC0AA0207 signifies - The drive reported that it is performing a long-running operation, such as finishing a write. The drive may be unusable for a long period of time.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
System recovery options can help you repair Windows if a serious error occurs. To use system recovery options, you'll need a Windows installation disc or access to the recovery options provided by your computer manufacturer. If you don't have either of those
 choices, you can create a system repair disc to access system recovery options.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Make sure that you follow the below steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>To create a system repair disc<br />
For more infromation, refer the below link:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</strong>1. Open Backup and Restore by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Backup and Restore.
<br />
2. In the left pane, click Create a system repair disc, and then follow the steps. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />

            Go to file explorer (Win Key + E)
<br />Click this PC.
<br />DO you see your camera?
<br />If so, right click on it and do you have an option to import pictures and videos?
<br />
<br />This maybe an issue with your drivers. 
<br />Best to go to the vendors site and download the latest drivers for your camera.
<br />
<br />Make sure to download the drivers for the system type of your machine.
<br />To find this out go search and type system.
<br />Look for the system type.
<br />It will either be 32bit or 64bit.

            Hi Amber,
<br />
<br />When you plug your phone into your PC
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />On the left click This PC
<br />On the right, double click on your Phone
<br />The videos should be in a folder called DCIM
<br />
<br />If your phone is an Android phone, it is also possible your videos are stored on Google Drive rather than on your phone. Most modern Android phones store data to the Cloud by default . . .

            Just like the iPhone and Windows Phone, you can also use the Camera Wizard to import your photos and videos. You can also use File Explorer or Photos app to import them. Connect your Android Phone using the USB cable, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC. Right click the Android Phone then click Import pictures and videos. This will start the Import Pictures and Video wizard.

<br />I notice the wizard takes a bit longer to find your photos, so give it a little time.
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Just like a digital camera, you can select your groups, enter a name then click import.
<br />
<br />Using the Photos app and Android device
<br />
<br />You can also use the Photos app in Windows to import photos and videos from your Android Phone. Simply connect your Android Phone using the USB cable then click Import and your Photos should show ready to be imported.
<br />
<br />Troubleshooting
<br />
<br />Now the instructions are straight forward, but problems can occur from time to time. Here are some things you can do to ensure your device works.
<br />
<br />Make sure the USB cable you are using to connect the device to your computer is not loose. If the male end connecting to the female end on the device is shaky, it’s possible you might need to nudge the cable for the device to appear or you might need to change the cable.
<br />
<br />Make sure the device is unlocked. If your device is locked using a passcode, you will need to unlock it so it will show up in Windows.
<br />
<br />If the device does not show, restart Windows, launch File Explorer again and see if it appears.
<br />
<br />If you more than one USB port, try connecting the USB cable to another USB port then see if it appears.
<br />
<br />Sometimes unplugging and reconnecting will work. Check to make sure the Camera initialization wizard is working.

    <title>Windows XP boot process halting at a black screen with the error, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hoagiebot  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP boot process halting at a black screen with the error, &#34;Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt&#58; &#92;WINDOWS&#92;AppPatch&#92;drvmain.sdb&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am an experienced computer troubleshooter, but this latest problem has me scratching my head a bit since the most obvious troubleshooting solutions don't seem to be yielding any kind of positive results for me.&nbsp; As a result, I would like to present my
 case to the Microsoft Answers community to see if any of you can provide me with&nbsp;some helpful suggestions or insight.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a Compaq Evo N620c laptop with Microsoft Windows XP Professional SP3 32-bit&nbsp;installed on it.&nbsp; It has worked flawlessly&nbsp;for years and
 up until now it hasn't given me any trouble.&nbsp; After working&nbsp;perfectly fine the day before,&nbsp;when I powered it on one morning&nbsp;it failed to boot into Windows with the following error message on a black screen:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:<br />
\WINDOWS\AppPatch\drvmain.sdb</strong></p>
<p><strong>You can attempt to repair this file by starting Windows Setup using the original Setup CD-ROM.<br />
Select 'r' at the first screen to start repair.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem occurs when the laptop&nbsp;begins to boot Windows XP no matter which boot option&nbsp;that I&nbsp;choose&nbsp;from the F8 boot menu-- whether&nbsp;I choose to have Windows boot normally, boot into "Safe Mode," use the "Last Known Good Configuration," etc., the booting
 always halts after just a couple of seconds at a black screen with the error message that I&nbsp;listed above.&nbsp; This means that I cannot boot Windows at all, including into "Safe Mode."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no obvious cause for why the laptop started to have this problem all of a sudden.&nbsp; I&nbsp;have not added or changed&nbsp;any hardware&nbsp;on the laptop in the past few years, let alone right before I started experiencing the problem.&nbsp; I did install&nbsp;two&nbsp;small
 pieces of&nbsp;software onto the laptop before it was last shutdown, but it was nothing major-- an update to the Avast! anti-virus scanner's malware definition files, and an upgrade to the DivX video player.&nbsp; I checked the Avast! AV scanner's support forum to see
 if the new virus definitions that I recently installed could have been the cause of my current woes, but I did not see any posts there that came anywhere close to resembling my problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wish that I could say the same for DivX video player website, but their
 support forums are currently "under construction."&nbsp; However, I saw no posts made to their&nbsp;website's&nbsp;primary blog or their "Labs" blog announcing&nbsp;any problems that any of their recent&nbsp;software updates had caused, for what that's worth.&nbsp; The laptop was not dropped,
 jolted, or physically mis-handled in any way.&nbsp; The laptop did not suffer through any sort of power surges or brown outs.&nbsp; In fact, the outlet that the laptop was plugged into was surge-protected, power-conditioned, and battery backed by a UPS.&nbsp; Combine that
 with the fact that the laptop also has its own built in battery protecting it from power loss, and I think that it is safe to come to the conclusion that power fluctuations were&nbsp;very unlikely to be the cause of&nbsp;my current&nbsp;problem.&nbsp; To make sure that my problem
 wasn't being caused by failing RAM, I ran Memtest86+ on the laptop for 36-straight hours, and it went through 29-complete passes of the testing suite without generating a single error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have read in other forums online that sometimes these kinds of boot errors are caused by failing hard disks, so I also looked into that possibility as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first thing that I tried was to boot the laptop from a Windows XP installation CD-ROM and enter the Windows XP Recovery Console, and then run "chkdsk /r" on the hard disk to check the integrity of the disk's NTFS file system.&nbsp; The very first run through
 of chkdsk did report that it found an error with the file system and corrected it, but unfortunately the Recovery Console version of the chkdsk utility seems to be criminally sparse with its output, as it didn't tell me what kind of file system problem that
 it fixed, how many errors that it fixed, etc., leaving me completely in the dark as to what it found that was wrong.&nbsp; For all I know&nbsp;the problem that it found&nbsp;could have been something&nbsp;that was relatively&nbsp;benign, or it could have been something serious.&nbsp; I
 have know way of knowing.&nbsp; What I can tell you however is that chkdsk was able to fix whatever the file system problem was after only a single pass-- I have probably run "chkdsk /r" at least 5 more times on the hard disk since then, and the disk has passed
 all of&nbsp;these additional checks with flying colors every time.&nbsp; I also took my hard disk investigation a bit further by&nbsp;checking&nbsp;the hard disk's&nbsp;S.M.A.R.T. data and running the S.M.A.R.T. short and extended hard disk self-tests.&nbsp; The S.M.A.R.T. data showed
 that the hard disk had no errors in its error log, and the hard disk passed two "short" self-tests and one "extended" self-test without error.&nbsp; The S.M.A.R.T. data also showed that the&nbsp;hard disk&nbsp;has only been in operation for a few hundred hours, so it is
 by no means a well-worn hard disk or anything like that.&nbsp; Lastly, I booted the laptop using a "Parted Magic" Live CD, and was able to successfully mount the hard disk and&nbsp;browse all of the laptop's files.&nbsp; So while all of this can't absolutely rule out all
 possibility of there being a problem with the hard disk, I would say that it still does make a very strong case that the hard disk installed in the laptop is just fine, and that the cause of the Windows XP booting problem lies elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next step that I took to attempt to&nbsp;resolve this error was the obvious one-- since the Windows boot process&nbsp;was reporting that the "\WINDOWS\AppPatch\drvmain.sdb" file&nbsp;was either missing or corrupted,&nbsp;I then checked to see if that file was indeed missing
 or corrupted.&nbsp; A quick look in the "C:\WINDOWS\AppPatch" directory showed that the drvmain.sdb file was indeed there, so it definitely wasn't missing.&nbsp; I renamed the drvmain.sdb file in that directory to "drvmain.old" so that I still had&nbsp;the original file&nbsp;if
 I ended up needing it, and then proceeded to find a replacement copy of the file elsewhere within the file system.&nbsp; I found several copies of the drvmain.sdb file in various directories on the computer's hard disk, but I chose to copy the instance of it located
 in the "C:\WINDOWS\ServicePackFiles\i386\" directory over to the "C:\WINDOWS\AppPatch" directory since that instance of the file had the exact same size and "date modified" properties as the original file.&nbsp; However, when I rebooted the laptop nothing had changed--
 it still froze during the boot process throwing up the exact same error message that "Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \WINDOWS\AppPatch\drvmain.sdb".&nbsp; Then, to be thorough, I also tried replacing the drvmain.sdb file
 on the laptop with a copy of it from another known working Windows XP Professional SP3 32-bit machine, but that also had no effect-- when the laptop booted it still froze in the same place throwing up the exact same error message.&nbsp; Lastly, I tried replacing
 the drvmain.sdb file with the copy of it that was on my Windows XP Professional installation CD-ROM.&nbsp; The copy of the file on the CD-ROM was older than the one on my machine and had a different file-size, but for the sake of trying all of the options I copied
 it over anyway, and as you might expect, the laptop *still* froze during boot at the very same spot and threw up the same error message.&nbsp; Defeated, I once again replaced the drvmain.sdb file with the one from the "C:\WINDOWS\ServicePackFiles\i386\" directory,
 because as I stated above, that copy of the file had the same file-size and file-date of the original.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am now thinking that the problem with my Windows XP SP3 laptop not booting has nothing directly to do with the drvmain.sdb file being corrupted at all, and that the problem actually lies somewhere else with the above-mentioned error message being just
 a symptom of what is really going awry.&nbsp; Going on that hunch, I tried to research what the drvmain.sdb file actually does and what role that it plays in the operating system.&nbsp; I did this to try to get a better understanding of what was going on during that
 part of the Windows XP boot process and determine what could possibly cause the boot process to halt at that point.&nbsp; The best info that I could come across was this:&nbsp; A ".sdb" file is what is known as a "Shim Database File."&nbsp; These files are part of the Windows
 XP "Application Compatibility Core" feature.&nbsp; The drvmain.sdb file in particular is the shim database&nbsp;for Windows XP's "Driver Protection" feature.&nbsp; It&nbsp;stores a list of device drivers that are incompatible with Windows XP&nbsp;and prevents those device drivers
 from loading&nbsp;so that&nbsp;those drivers&nbsp;don't halt&nbsp;the&nbsp;Windows XP boot process or cause system instability.&nbsp; As a result, the drvmain.sdb file gets loaded before the rest of the system's device drivers in the Windows XP boot process so that the device drivers that&nbsp;get
 loaded after it can all be checked against the database for compatibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only truly insightful information that I gained from my research is that you don't have to use a current version of the drvmain.sdb file if you don't want to.&nbsp; According to the Microsoft TechNet article
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490823.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"Driver Protection,"</a> you can use an older less-up-to-date version of the drvmain.sdb file if you wish to.&nbsp; This was enlightening to me because it meant that I wasn't getting the "Windows
 could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \WINDOWS\AppPatch\drvmain.sdb" error message due to using some&nbsp;not quite up-to-date&nbsp;version of the file-- according to the TechNet article any Windows XP-appropriate version of the database
 file&nbsp;should still work.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I did not gain any additional insight as to what else could cause the error message to appear.&nbsp; However, as I mentioned, I have tried several different copies of the drvmain.sdb file on my system now, so I really don't
 think that it is the drvmain.sdb file that is actually causing the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone here encountered this problem before and successfully resolved it without&nbsp;resorting to something drastic such as performing&nbsp;a full-blown repair installation of Windows XP?&nbsp; If you have, please explain what you discovered&nbsp;was causing the error
 message and what you had to do to resolve it.&nbsp; I am extremely hesitant to the idea of using&nbsp;a Windows XP&nbsp;setup CD to try to&nbsp;install Windows XP over itself with a repair installation, as I am afraid that performing such a drastic and heavy-handed measure could
 end up causing me more problems than it solves.&nbsp; I would much rather get my laptop back up and running by identifying and fixing the actual problem that is preventing it from booting itself, which would both get my laptop back onto its feet with the least
 amount of "collateral damage," and provide me with the knowledge of how to fix this problem if it ever shows up again in the future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your help, and hopefully someone here can shed some light on this!</p>

Srimadhwa B,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your reply-- I greatly appreciate your taking some of your time to attempt to try and assist me.&nbsp; I read through both of the&nbsp;pages that you linked to very thoroughly, and unfortunately I don't think that either of them can help me
 with my particular problem.&nbsp; The first hyperlink, which linked to a Microsoft Answers forum thread entitled, "Problems with \WINDOWS\AppPatch\drvmain.sdb at start up," seemed very promising at first, but it turns out that in that person's case the reason why
 his Windows XP machine was throwing up the error message&nbsp;"Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: \WINDOWS\AppPatch\drvmain.sdb" was because his Windows XP machine actually
<em>was</em> missing the drvmain.sdb file.&nbsp; Once that person copied that file over to the appropriate directory on their machine, it quit giving that particular error message when it was being boot up.&nbsp; In my case, I always had the drvmain.sdb file on my machine
 to begin with, and just in case my copy of the file was actually corrupt I replaced it with other copies of the drvmain.sdb file taken from several other sources.&nbsp; Despite this, my Windows XP laptop still halted its boot with the "missing or corrupt drvmain.sdb"
 file every time, no matter which drvmain.sdb file that I am using.&nbsp; Some of the other suggestions made in that Microsoft Answers thread, such as running chkdsk /r from the Windows XP Recovery Console until it reports no errors, is something that I have already&nbsp;tried
 as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second resource that you linked to was an article from the Microsoft Windows XP Professional documentation on how to use the "fixmbr" command in the Windows XP Recovery Console&nbsp;to repair my computer's Master Boot Record (MBR).&nbsp; Based on everything that
 I have observed thus far, my Master Boot Record shouldn't be the problem.&nbsp; I&nbsp;arrived at this&nbsp;conclusion because my computer is failing too far along in the boot process for me to have a bad MBR.&nbsp; To explain, the Master Boot Record essentially&nbsp;holds two pieces
 of information: the hard disk's partition table, and the first stage of the bootstrap loader for the operating system.&nbsp; If my partition table was bad the computer wouldn't be able to detect the file system on my hard disk at all, however that is not the case.&nbsp;
 I am able to see my files and directories just fine from both the Windows XP Recovery Console and the Linux PartedMagic Live CD, and if my MBR was bad that probably wouldn't be possible.&nbsp; In addition, I know that the first stage of the boot loader is working
 fine, as my laptop is successfully loading the&nbsp;"ntldr" file, which is the second stage of the Windows XP boot process.&nbsp; If my MBR was bad, the ntldr file most likely wouldn't be able to be loaded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the&nbsp;very good Microsoft TechNet article, <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457123.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
"Troubleshooting the Startup Process,"</a> the Windows XP boot process is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Power-on self test (POST) phase </li><li>Initial startup phase </li><li>Boot loader phase </li><li>Detect and configure hardware phase </li><li>Kernel loading phase </li><li>Logon phase</li></ol>
<p>The MBR comes into play during phase 2 of the boot process, the "Initial Startup Phase."&nbsp; My Windows XP machine is halting during phase 5, the "Kernel Loading Phase," when Ntldr and Ntoskrnl.exe are trying to load the device driver shim database before it
 loads the device drivers for my system.&nbsp; If a bad MBR was to blame I really shouldn't be able to get to phase 5 in the boot process-- I would instead probably be halting at phase 2 or 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, I am starting to suspect that one of three things might be causing my problem here:</p>
<ol>
<li>A damaged NTFS file system, which would prevent Ntldr and Ntoskrnl.exe from "seeing" my "C:\WINDOWS\AppPatch\drvmain.sdb" file.&nbsp; With that said, I
<strong>don't</strong> think that this is the case, since chkdsk /r runs without detecting any errors every time, and I am able to access the directory and file in question just fine from both the Windows XP Recovery Console and a Linux Live CD.
</li><li>The system files Ntldr&nbsp;or Ntoskrnl.exe may be corrupted, however I <strong>don't</strong> think that this is very likely either.&nbsp; This is because the boot process would most likely fail long&nbsp;before the kernel started loading the device drivers if these
 two crucial system files were <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/B/borken.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
borked</a> in any way. </li><li>I may have a seriously messed up Windows registry.&nbsp; The device drivers that get loaded during startup are determined by a Windows registry key, "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<em>servicename</em>".&nbsp; Maybe the entry in&nbsp;the registry
 for the drvmain.sdb file is corrupted.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I have not been able to look into this possibility yet since I have yet to figure out how to view and edit&nbsp;my laptop's Windows registry from the Windows XP Recovery Console.&nbsp; If anyone out there knows
 a good way to do this, I would definitely be interested in learning how.</li></ol>
<p>I don't really know if any of the three suspects that I mentioned above are to blame for my booting problem,&nbsp;but that is the direction that I am currently going to&nbsp;investigate in right now.&nbsp; In any case, thanks for your suggestions thus far-- they may have
 not solved my problem, but I don't mind having ideas bounced off of me.&nbsp; In the mean time I am going to continue to keep on trying to troubleshoot this problem.&nbsp; Everyone please feel free to keep posting their troubleshooting solutions or suggestions, and
 if I somehow manage to solve this problem on my own I will definitely post the solution here so that others with the same problem can benefit from it.&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            This is a peculiar problem...<br />
<br />
You can't look at the Registry from the XP Recovery Console, but you can from a Hiren's boot CD that you can download from here (a sizable download but worth it):<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a><br />
<br />
Burn the ISO to create a bootable Hiren's CD, boot on it and choose the Mini XP mode and there are
<i>lots </i>of tools on there.<br />
<br />
If you have never burned an ISO to make a bootable CD, I like to use ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD (do not install UniBlue or the Ask Toolbar - ever!):<br />

            <p>Hello Hoagiebot,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just encountered the problem of my Win XP not booting up due to the same reason you explained in your 8/24/12 post.&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows XP boot process halting at a black screen with the error, "Windows could not start because the following file is missing or
 corrupt: \WINDOWS\AppPatch\drvmain.sdb"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you find a solution to fix the non-boot problem w/o having to reinstall Win XP?&nbsp; I will do this if it is what is necessary but since it is after the 4/8/14 support date I do not know where I will be able to download all the updates and patches for Win
 XP.&nbsp;Also, I have never backed up Win XP Pro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main difference in OS install is that I have 2 Seagate 320GB drives set in a RAID 0 array with 2 partitions.&nbsp; The 1st was made for Win XP.&nbsp; XP Pro was installed 1st.&nbsp; The 2nd partition was for Win 7 and was installed after Win XP was setup.&nbsp; I can still
 get into Win 7 just fine and have replaced my drvmain file with one from my laptop that also uses Win XP Professional w/ SP3. Exact same file size and date. No help.&nbsp; I have not run chkdsk /r yet but will do so to verify hard drive health is OK.&nbsp; Thank you
 for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

            <p>XP will boot just fine if the drvmain.sbd file is missing or if the file is corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To verify this boot into the XP Recovery Console so Windows File Protection is not running, navigate to the c:\windows\apppatch folder (assuming XP is installed on the C drive in the Windows folder) and rename the drvmain.sdb file to something you can remember:</p>
<p>
</p><p>rename drvmain.sdb&nbsp;&nbsp; drvmain.xxx</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the file is "missing".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your system and it will boot just fine, but you will have two events in the Event Viewer System log:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Error<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Application Popup<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;877<br />
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4/21/2015<br />
Time:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1:56:36 AM<br />
Description:<br />
There was error [DATABASE OPEN FAILED] processing the driver database.<br />
<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Error<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Application Popup<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;877<br />
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4/21/2015<br />
Time:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1:56:36 AM<br />
Description:<br />
There was error [DATABASE NOT LOADED] processing the driver database.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then reboot into the Recovery Console and put in a "corrupt" drvmain.sdb file and I like to "corrupt" XP system files by copying something over the top of them like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>copy&nbsp; c:\boot.ini &nbsp; c:\windows\apppatch\drvmain.sdb</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the drvmain.sdb file is present, but it is "corrupt".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot normally and XP will boot just fine with the same two messages in the Event Viewer System log and a third message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Error<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Application Popup<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;877<br />
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4/21/2015<br />
Time:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2:01:31 AM<br />
Description:<br />
There was error [INIT DATABASE FAILED] processing the driver database.<br />
<br />
So you have verified that XP will boot just fine if the drvmain.sdb file is missing or corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we know XP keeps copies of important files in the dllcache folder, be sure to replace the missing/corrupt file either by renaming the copy made earlier or entering:</p>
<p>
</p><p>copy c:\windows\system32\dllcache\drvmain.sdb&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\windows\apppatch</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respond in the affirmative if asked to overwrite an existing file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with troubleshooting the message is nobody tells any details about how the system got into this condition in the first place - what happened prior to the incident of not booting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Editing the registry will not help - unless you edited the registry beforehand and messed it up somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running fixmbr will not help since there are no symptoms indicating a missing or corrupt MBR and the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" fails to warn that if your system has a built in Recovery Partition from the factory, you will not be able to
 use it after running fixmbr.&nbsp; These are just more of their wild goose chases when they have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it.</p>
<p><br />
There is something else wrong and without knowing what happened prior (or any other system details) all you can do is start guessing and trying things, or pursuing wild goose chases and I tend not to waste time on such things.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Can&#39;t reset Windows 10&#59; Could not find Recovery Environment.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded my Dell Inspiron 14 from Windows 8 to Windows 10, and I had performed a "Reset This PC" without keeping any files once and it had worked fine. I was trying to do it again today, but now it say that it "could not find the recovery environment,
 please insert your installation/recovery media."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have the installation/recovery media; I had upgraded from Windows 8. I was thinking of using the Media Creation Tool, but would they require me to re-enter my Windows product key? I don't think I have it since I bought my laptop activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone could let me know how to proceed to wipe my computer, that would be great. Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jack</p>

</p><p>I believe that I downloaded a virus couple of days ago. That made chrome and IE non functionable and diabled the windows defender from the group policy. I uninstalled few applications as well. Then I decided to reset my laptop. It's not happening at all.
 I tried both options, "keep the files and reset" and "remove the files and reset" but no luck. I cant download any utility to recover and dont have a recovery media as I upgraded my windows online.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Freezes&#47;Deadlocks randomly.</h2>
                    Hello fellow Windows 10 users. I have been running a clean install of Windows 10 for about 2 months. But yesterday it started. My computer completely freezes to the point of no return, where the only thing left is to force a restart or to power down. Sometimes
 after a freeze, it restarts and instantly freezes at the login screen. I have performed many system and disk checks and Windows said it repaired some stuff, but clearly it didn't repair this. I have looked in Event viewer and there doesn't seem to be any problem
 related to this, only the "Unexpected Shutdown" error. I have no idea what is causing this especially since this has never happened to me before in 15 years of computer usage.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Do I need to perform a fresh reinstall or do you need any specific information to tell me what's wrong?

            I know I am very late for a response, but none of that was needed. I was a hardware problem. One of my two sticks of DDR3 RAM was faulty and I replaced it, now everything works perfectly. Thank you anyways.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Nigel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community, I understand your concern and we will try our best to help you resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like&nbsp;you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Did you download the Media Creation Tool from the official Microsoft&nbsp;website?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like&nbsp;to inform you that Windows 10&nbsp;download and installation may take longer than it is generally expected. I would suggest that you wait for 24hrs and check if the issue remains the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business 2016 disconnecting and reconnecting during  meetings</h2>
                    <p>My company has been using Lync and then Skype for Business for many years</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recently switched from in-house servers to a hybrid system with Office 365 and Skype for Business 2016</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time, the connection is fine but when there is a meeting with multiple attendees and someone is sharing their desktop, my connection fails then will not reconnect completely. Skype attempts to reconnect but often the audio is missing. &nbsp;After
 the meeting is over, Skype will then be OK for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read all the reports of similar problems and our IT have tried to investigate without success</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest recommendation is to bypass automatic configuration by using &nbsp; sipdir.online.lync.com:443</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also used the Lync connectivity analyser &nbsp;https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com which fails with&nbsp;</p>

            <span>Hi Des,<br />
<br />
Firstly, I’d like to confirm whether the ‘hybrid system with Office 365 and Skype for Business 2016’ means the Skype for Business 2016 on-premises server and Skype for Business online in Office 365.<br />
<br />
Also as you have performed a connectivity test with, please send the entire connectivity test result to us in
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">private message</a>.<br />
<br />
Besides, I would also confirm the following information to better understand the issue:<br />
1. Did the issue occur on all the Skype for Business accounts in your organization?<br />
2. If you change to another network environment, will the issue persist?<br />
3. Please provide more details about ‘switch from in-house servers to a hybrid system’.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Yang<br />

            <span>Hi Des,<br />
<br />
Sorry for the delay.<br />
As the issue only occurred when someone else shared desktop with you in a Skype for Business meeting. The issue could only be related to the Skype for Business client or the PC in your home. So I suggest you try the following steps:
<br />
1. To check if there are some third party program conflicts, please run Windows in Clean Boot Mode by referring to the following article:<br />
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a><span>.<br />
2. Please install all the Windows updates in the affected computer.<br />
3. Install the updates for your Skype for Business by referring to the article below:<br />
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3123065/how-to-obtain-the-latest-update-for-skype-for-business-2016" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3123065/how-to-obtain-the-latest-update-for-skype-for-business-2016</span></a><span><br />

</p><p>I have tried to apply the latest Skype for Business updates but none of them were necessary. My company applies regular updates for Windows and Office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not observed any issues for more than a week. My ISP told me that there were reports of instabilities with Skype for Business recently. Is it possible that those issues have been resolved and the problem is not associated with my laptop or network
 ?</p>

            Hi Des,<br />
<br />
The instabilities your ISP told you could be related to the issue because the network environment is important in Skype for Business meetings. So I would suggest you keep monitoring the situation on your side. If the issue appears again in the future, please
 post back.<br />

    <title>Windows Firewall inbound rule - allow connections from named computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mathguy-ro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Firewall inbound rule - allow connections from named computer</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a Windows 10 laptop. My wife has an OS X MacbookPro. I set up the Mac with a static IP address on our home router, and I created an Inbound Rule in Windows Firewall to allow all inbound connection requests coming from the (fixed) private-network
 IP address of the Mac machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far so good, but this seems like overkill. Since the router has a name resolution table, it seems I should be able to allow connection requests from the Mac laptop by name (say "HerMacbookPro") rather than by IP address. "ping" by computer name works
 perfectly in both directions. The router should be free to assign IP addresses dynamically; when her Mac makes a request to access a database server on my Windows machine, for example, that should still work, even with dynamically assigned IP addresses. Is
 that possible to set up&nbsp;in Windows Firewall?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see where I can allow inbound connections from "Remote Computers". I see that I must change the Action from "Allow" to "Allow if the connection is secure." (Is this different from accepting inbound connection requests from an IP address? If it is different,
 why? Why is a secure connection required if the request comes from a named machine, but not if it comes from an IP address?) - anyway, I selected "Allow if the connection is secure" and then I went to the Remote Computers tab, checked the "Only allow connections
 from these computers" box under Authorized computers, and I clicked the Add... button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This opens a dialog box with the title "Select Groups". WHAT GROUPS? Am I not supposed to select Remote Computers here? Then: "Select the object type:" - Groups or Built-in security principals. Huh? The object type I would like to select is a Remote Computer,
 I don't care which user is using the Remote Computer. (Same as allowing requests from this computer's IP address!) There is an "Object types..." button to select what type of objects to look for, but Computers is not among them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, so I still enter the computer name in the "Enter the object names to select" box. There is even a&nbsp;web link "examples" that takes me to a Microsoft TechNet page with examples of object names. The web page is for Windows 8.1 - Windows Server 2012 R2 (highly
 professional on MS's part); anyway, it shows examples for "Object type = Computer" but there is no such option in the dialog box in the Firewall (contradicting the examples shown on the web page). I enter the computer name all the same and click Check Names;
 I get Name Not Found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts? Did I miss some steps or is this not doable? Thank you!</p>

    <title>Skype 8 for desktop should support Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> te0_b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype 8 for desktop should support Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I'm sorry if there is another thread for this particular subject. I simply couldn't find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We all know the limitations we have on the Windowsn 10 Skype. A lot of features are missing, features that make our use much easier.</p>
<p>Most of these features can be found on 8th version of the Skype for Desktop app. However, this new version does not support Windows 10.</p>
<p>I don't like the fact that the Windows 10 version is kinda forced down our throats.</p>
<p>I myself and other people (I bet) managed to install it by running the installer in compatibility mode for Windows 7 or 8.
</p>
<p>The app runs fine, and besides the update function (which is blocked intentionally by the windows version) everything is working as it should.</p>
<p><br />
There is no reason to deny Skype 8 Desktop to Windows 10 users. Please make it available.</p>

</p><p><span>To start with, the new Skype for Desktop (v8.xxx) is not designed for Windows 10 version 1709 or Fall Creator.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can use&nbsp;the&nbsp;preinstalled Skype for&nbsp;Windows 10. For your reference, you can check this FAQ link:
<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype?q=system+requirment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What are the system requirements for Skype?</a></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We understand where you are coming from and definitely respect your feedback regarding this.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We will take note of your suggestions or feedback and will send to our developer team for Skype's system and features improvement.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The application is still a work in progress and we are trying to provide you, our users with the best features so please stay tuned for updates.</span></p>

<p>I totally understand that the store version is still a work in progress, and I do respect that. However, I would very much like to use them both, if I can, and I bet a lot of people are in the same situation. Some of them don't even know about the workaround
 I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>I will continue using the store version and give feedback as much as I can. However, I would also like to have the update function working for the desktop version so I wouldn't be forced to download the offline installer every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if it's not designed for the fall creator update, the app appears to be working fine. I myself haven't found any compatibility issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you can, please unlock the fall creator's update, or at least unblock the update function for this particular build.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. </p>

</p><p>
</p><p>We really appreciate your initiative to send us&nbsp;feedback to any unusual&nbsp;behavior you might encounter using the Skype for Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to unblocking the Falls Creator, I'm afraid to say that we do not have an option as new Skype is not designed for it and we encourage our users to use the built-in Skype for Windows 10.

<h3> benton6  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t start a .bat aka Batch file.</h2>
                    <p>I am looking to make a small text mini-game in batch, and I am able to code the batch itself, but I can't seem to make it run. And it's not a "ErrorInScript62" or something like that if I double click it, instead it just goes into a text file. I have spent
 a while on this so I don't want to have to redo everything, but if it can run like that that works. I need to get an answer soon-ish, because I am doing this a a project in my history class.</p>

    <title>Why is windows Unable to undo a Dedication to Readyboost and Brick - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nameloc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is windows Unable to undo a Dedication to Readyboost and Brick flash drives&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently I was mislead with windows Readyboost in thinking that if I used any flash drive with readyboost, I could undo it at anytime; As stated here:</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-ReadyBoost-on-or-off-for-a-storage-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-ReadyBoost-on-or-off-for-a-storage-device</a></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/readyboost" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/readyboost</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On the first link it Clearly states this:&nbsp;<span>ReadyBoost works with most flash storage devices.
 In</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Windows&nbsp;7</span><span>,
 it can handle more flash memory and even multiple devices—up to eight,<u> <i>for a maximum 256 gigabytes (GB) of additional memory</i></u>.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Now, the simple "Use this device for Readyboost" function only goes up to
 4GB, and as explained in the first link, if you dedicate the device to Readyboost you
<i>can use all available free space</i>&nbsp;on that drive for Readyboost.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>With this in mind, I popped in my
<i>$600 256GB Kingston Data Traveler 310</i> flash drive, with high intentions that nothing could go wrong.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>Heres the list of things that have happened since then:<br />
1 Readyboost's cache got Corrupted</div>
<div>2 Write protection
<b>Would not go away</b></div>
<div>3 Updating drivers and the like
<b>Failed</b>&nbsp;to do <b>Anything</b></div>
<div>4&nbsp;<i>All
</i>attempts at formatting <b>failed</b></div>
<div>5 Force-deleting and Force-formatting via command prompt failed (Write protection)</div>
<div>6 Online sources explaining how to take off write protection did not help, these all led to
<i><b>editing some registries in regedit </b>(These did not work)</i></div>
<div><b><i><br />
</i></b></div>
<div>So there I was, with a complete knowledge of how screwed this drive really is, and I decided to boot up linux to see if I could
 simply format it from there.</div>
<div>In linux I was able to delete the dreaded ReadyBoost cache, but unable to delete a folder named "FOUND.000", which clearly held
 the files for Write protection.</div>
<div>I looked around and tried all types of formatting in Linux, one of them seemed to work. But now my flash drive is basically
 "Bricked". Why? Because of being mislead from Microsoft and corrupted files.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is what my bricked flash drive is now.&nbsp;http://screencast.com/t/WAk90dksZx</div>
<div>When trying to Update drive software, windows gave me this:&nbsp;http://screencast.com/t/X5p8R0WjUaW</div>
<div>(Can windows mock me anymore?)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any possible solution to this Madness?</div>
<div>
</div>
                </div>

            They do not have any recovery tools. (Only for the Data Traveler 400 series, which cost money to get said tools.)

<h2>            Windows 10 in Tablet Mode on a Touch Screen Laptop - Tiles Page Doesn&#39;t Pop Up Unless Press Start Key or Button&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I first installed Windows 10, I set the startup screen to be in tablet mode for my touch screen based desktop and laptop, and that worked fine, except now,&nbsp;when I power on,&nbsp; Windows 10 gives me the login screen, I login, but I don't get the full screen
 of window panes "until" I manually press the Windows key or the Windows onscreen start button.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get it back to where the Windows 10 panes come up automatically, like it does for tablets?</p>
