<h2>            Controller Stick moving... BY ITSELF</h2>
                    
<p>So guys with my Xbox One Controller (that I literally had for 1 year), just broke... I think. Here's the problem: My controller a few days ago while I was playing battlefield 4, decided to move left thumbstick, even though I didn't even touch it. I then
 tested in a private server too see if I'm going crazy, then I set the controller down, and my soldier started walking! I then tested on the dashboard, without the game running. The interface automatically went up. Same thing in Destiny, or Halo: Spartan ****.
 I then decided to use my other controller, which I also had for a year and it worked fine. So why does the left joystick, and only the left joystick move by itself? Is it the controller? My console? Please Help</p>

<p>I've personally had this same problem and know a few others who have before, it can really go either way. Sometimes, you can fix this problem by plugging the controller into the console through a Micro-USB wire, then you can "Update" the controller, once
 updated, hard reset the console and see if that works. I know a few people who have had this fix it for them.</p>
<p>I on the other hand, tried this and it did not work, it turns out my controller was broken. I got a hold of Microsoft Support, since it was the controller that came with the Xbox One console, they allowed me to ship it off to them, free of charge, they then
 sent me a replacement. They were pretty quick to get it back to me as well, took about a week.</p>
<p>Hope it turns out you just need to update the controller. Best of luck to you.</p>

<h2>            cut paste disappeared</h2>
                    Hello, <br />
<br />
I am on holiday in the UK and was moving photos from my SD card onto my laptop. The first card I dragged and dropped and all files and folders were moved.
<br />
<br />
With the second SD card, however, drag and drop didn't do anything but create an empty folder on the laptop. I tried again just to see if it would work, but it didn't.
<br />
<br />
Generally I copy and paste, but for some reason I cut instead and pasted and the same thing happened. It pasted the folder, but the folder was empty. Of course, it was gone on the SD card as well. The option to still "paste" was no longer there and ctrl-Z didn't
 do anything. <br />
<br />
Now I don't know where any of the photos/videos are at. I am hoping that there is a simple answer to this issue. I am not convinced that everything is just simply gone.
<br />
<br />
Google search came up with a few things, but mainly recommendations for recovery programs. I am willing to pay for one that works, but I am not familiar with any of them.
<br />
<br />
<br />

            yes you can connect an Xbox One S/X controller to an android device as long as the android device supports controllers. I know you can do this as I have connected mine to my android device (Amazon fire 10), and it works well. All you have to do is turn
 on bluetooth on your device, and go in bluetooth settings and select scan for new device, then with the xbox one s controller, turn it on, and press and hold the sync button until the light on the controller flashes quickly. Your device should find the controller
 and pair them together.

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I found that there is one file named desktop.ini (notice that it’s not virus like_desktop.ini) in many of my folders where there are customised icons in such folders. I know its function is to store the

 folders.</span></span></span></p>

            Hi MdHafiz1 
<br />
<br />Those are not just hidden files, they are system files . . 
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer (folder icon on your Taskbar)
<br />
<br />On the view Ribbon, click Options
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, click on the View Tab
<br />
<br />Scroll down the list to find 'Hide Protected Operating System Files (recommended)
<br />
<br />Check that box and click Apply and OK
<br />
<br />That should hide the desktop.ini files for you . .

<h2>            White Screen</h2>
                    I keep getting a white screen that blocks out my desk top. Its large so there is no close X. I don't know what is causing this and the only way I can get to the internet or other things is to use the window key on my key board. Help Please.

<p><span>Hi Bren4Wood,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error message when you start your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is there any message on the white screen or is it just a blank white screen?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Exit Explorer.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<span>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong>Start</strong> button.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press and
<strong>hold</strong> the <strong>CTRL</strong> and <strong>SHIFT</strong> keys, and right-click on an empty area in the Start menu.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You’ll see a Popup menu containing the two options namely
<strong>Exit Explorer</strong> and <strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Note that the above Popup menu can be launched by holding the
<strong>CTRL</strong> and <strong>SHIFT</strong> keys and then right-clicking on the Start menu
<strong>power</strong> button itself.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select
<strong>E<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">x</span>it Explorer</strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Start a new explorer in Task Manager.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Use the
<strong>CTRL+SHIFT+ESC</strong> key sequence to launch <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to
<strong>processes</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Start a new
<strong>Explorer.exe</strong> process.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do so:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to
<strong>File</strong> tab and click on<strong> New Task (Run.. )</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type explorer.exe and press
<strong>enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Does this bring up your desktop icons and other items?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Run SFC (System File Checker) scan</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If explorer doesn’t come after launching a new process from task manager, it shows the possibility of the process being corrupt.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If there’s no explorer.exe process listed, it could be possible that the process is corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run the above scan to fix any corrupted system files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s how:</span></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Clean Boot</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if there’s a third party service preventing the explorer from launching properly.</span></p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t find Command Prompt in System32, and when I use the Start bar to search for it, the only thing I find is a link that I can&#39;t use.</h2>
                    so, I was messing around with the command prompt, I figured what could go wrong... I think that what happened was I tried to rename Command Prompt using Command Prompt. I tried renaming it to &lt;Pandora's&gt;, and now there is a file called Pandora's in my
 system32 folder, but it doesn't work as anything. I am still able to use the computer in question and have been looking on the internet for a downloadable command prompt, but all i have found is a smattering of third party tools...

    <title>Windows Vista won&#39;t start on my Toshiba laptop even after running - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> defunk99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Vista won&#39;t start on my Toshiba laptop even after running Startup Repair.</h2>
                    Upon power up, screen gives 2 options: 1) Start normally, or 2) Run Startup Repair.
<br />
When Start Normally is selected, system hangs on black screen with the Microsoft logo and scrolling green bars.
<br />
If startup repair is selected, the repair process runs for a while, reports that there are no errors, then hangs up on the same screen as above.<br />
<br />
Problem first appeared after computer was improperly shut down while on a wireless network. Subsequently, the computer may have been improperly shut down again while running Startup Repair.

<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista,
 and just serves as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's decent of Microsoft
 to make this available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>

<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>

            The .mov extension is for an Apple video file. Why do you think you should be able to open it in Paint? You should be able to open it in Windows Media Player.

    <title>Why cant I unplug the Kinect&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why cant I unplug the Kinect&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Microsoft, you say we can disable the features of the kinect. Ok fine. But why not just let us unplug it? I do not want this camera/microphone in my living room plugged in unless I want it to be. And how disabled can we make the kinect? Can I disable all
 of it then put it, still plugged in, in a small box and stash it behind my TV? Or will I get error messages from it?</p>
<p>Let me unplug the kinect and I will preorder my Xbox One today. Do not allow us to unplug it and I guess I am going to PS4 or strictly PC. Your choice....</p>

<p>No I do not own a smartphone. I do not carry them. I used too. But when I found out all that can be picked up from the camera and microphone. I changed my mind on them. We lived for centuries without one. I lived 30 years without one. I can continue living
 without one. Plus when your in a fight with your wife because you pocket dialed her while your talking to a friend about some stupid thing she did... Yah I dont want one anymore.</p>
<p>I dont mind buying an Xbox One with a kinect. I have a kinect right now. Its in a box in the cabinet under the TV. If a game comes out that I want to play that requires it... Fine ok. But I just want to be able to unplug it to be sure. That is all... If
 we can disable the kinect features then we should be able to unplug it entirely.</p>
<p>And as for little Timmy losing his kinect. Well considering how big it is, if he loses it, then he should not have been in charge of the xbox in the first place.</p>

<p>All were askign is it can come in the box. Just don't force us to connect it. If you want to use it, YOU HAVE IT. IF WE DONT WANT TO, WE CAN LEAVE IT IN THE BOX. MS can lie to Dev that it ships with every console, you'll be happy because you have kinect,
 we will be happy because we don't need it. MS gets me to buy the console, everyone wins!</p>

 is to make it easier to position.</p>

<p>trust me Im guessing most of the games will have some kinect functionality on the xbox one so for most it would be out of the box anyway. and what is this paranoia with spy cams?? you living in a crack den or what?

<p>Yes I am on a PC and no it doesnt have a webcam connected to it. Yes I have a webcam but its sitting in a drawer on my desk. I hardly have use it for it so I dont use it. As for my two laptops. Both my wife and my daughter's. They have webcams on them sure.
 And both are covered with tape. I have seen many laptops with built in cams. And the people that owned them covered them with tape.</p>
<p>As for the comment about most games will require the kinect. Maybe. But I think about it differently. First your going to have many games on multiple platforms. Xbox, PS, WiiU, and PC. Do you think the developers are going to worry about kinect functionality
 for the Xbox release? Doubtful IMO. Then look at the current Xbox. Many people buy Xbox 360s now with kinect coming along for the ride. Yet how many developers are making extra functionality for their games using the kinect on the 360? And if you can disable
 the kinect on the Xbox One, like they are saying, then even games that just have some kinect functions would be playable with a disabled kinect.</p>
<p>I got a new Xbox 360 recently that came with the kinect. And my kinect is in a box in the cabinet under the TV. If a game was released that I liked that needed the kinect I would use it. But none have been released I am interested in.</p>
<p>Call me paranoid all you want. I just dont want this camera and microphone connected to my internet and going through a device using one of the most targetted operating systems in the world. They can say its disabled all they want. But you cant be 100% certain.
 Best way to make 100% sure is not to have it connected. If they say we can disable it then it shouldnt be an issue to let us disconnect it. And alot of people out there, that I talk to about Xbox One, this is a major issue to them. Many of my Xbox friends
 have already started preordering PS4s or asking me to build them PCs.</p>
<p>Its no skin off your back if they allow it. And it could help them increase sales even more. So why fight people on this? It doesnt hurt you does it? Being able to disconnect a device that can be disabled really bother you and others in this thread that
 much?</p>
<p>Icestorm III -</p>
<p>Why does me not having a smartphone have anything to do with an Xbox One? Even if I did own one, and I did once, it would be in a pocket. Not sitting under my TV aimed at my living 24/7 now would it?</p>
<p>As for your argument that it could get lost. Dude damn near anything could get lost. So by that argument we should have to tether the controller too. And all remotes to all devices. Also game disks and blurays should be tethered to players. Got a wireless
 mouse? How about a wireless keyboard? Well they arent tethered either. Better get you some rope. That is not a good argument for you.</p>

<p><br />
Oh and Kabigan, they are making a new standard deal with it, I had the original xbox at launch... then xbox live came a year later.. guess what, not all games were online on Xbox, 360 came out and ALL games had live functionality as a standard.. for multiplayer
 and so on.. so this is just a new standard.</p>

    <title>Restore personal files backup after system refresh - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonl2016  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restore personal files backup after system refresh</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I recently "refreshed" my computer. Before I did so, I used File Backup to backup my desktop, documents, photos, etc. Not a system image, just&nbsp;a few folders of files.&nbsp;However, now that my computer is "refreshed" I want to recover my backed up documents.&nbsp;
 But Windows backup and recover does not recognize them. Everything I have found says to turn on File History. But I turn on File History and it starts fresh, it does not see the backed up files on the back up drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I recover my backed up files in this situation?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>When choosing a restore location, choose the location where your backup files are located</p>

<h2>            Got new console, need some &#38;quot&#59;content transfer&#38;quot&#59; help...</h2>
                    
<p>OK, so my original Elite 360 (Falcon based, BTW) decided to RRoD (out of any extended warranty of course). So I bought a new 360 Slim.... sure did enjoy that...</p>
<p>I've already used the OFFICIAL transfer cable that I also had to purchase (that was fun too)&nbsp;and have already&nbsp;transferred all my DLC from my Elite HDD to my Slim HDD...</p>
<p>I then completed the online&nbsp;"content license" transfer tool that MS has provided... and this is where my question comes into play...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Must I redownload everything again (even though I've transferred via the transfer cable) to enable the "new licenses"???</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or did the transfer process basically already update the licenses??</p>

<p>I ask because I'm looking at re-downloading around 100GB on slow internet connection and on top of that some of my older DLC is no longer available on the servers so I certainly can't even re-download that stuff.</p>

<p>The license transfer alone should do it, sign into live, try to play an arcade game or DLC, then sign out and try again. Be sure try it while signed in first, so the 360 can get the transferred licenses.</p>
<p>If re-downloading is necessary (it shouldn't be) you can check your download history here on xbox.com - even if your DLC is no longer for sale, you might still be able to download it if you've paid for it.</p>

<p>thanks... I tried playing two DLC games (ilomilo and Pac-Man CE DX) while singed into live and both downloaded a small update... I then signed out and tried again, but they had converted to trial versions. :-(</p>
<p>I'm currently re-downloading them to see if that will work.</p>
<p>I mis-typed above as well... the order I did things in was this.</p>
<p>RRoD while playing game, new console next day, online license transfer same day, downloaded one DLC package again same day for some gaming, then two days later finally had chance to buy transfer cable, transferred everything today (even overwote the previous
 DLC download).</p>
<p>Would that have messed this up?? &nbsp;I lean towards no, but I can't use any DLC offline currently.</p>

<p>OK, I think I figured it out...</p>
<p>YES, I have to redownload everything, BUT all that happens is some type of online check or downloading a super small (less than 1kb?) file and then they work offline.</p>
<p>I noticed after posting my last message that my downloads were already done (not possible) so I tired downloading a large DLC package 800MB+ and found it instantly finished (so fast that it takes the menus more time to catch up, which is why I thought I
 was fully redownloading ilomilo as I ran away to post after starting it).</p>
<p>After doing that then the DLCs are available offline.</p>
<p>I'm still not sure how this will effect some of my DLC that's no longer available though. &nbsp;((this is content that I purchased, but now only gives an error code when trying to download via Xbox and a statement that "this contect is no longer available" via
 Xbox Live website))</p>

<p>Yes since you already have the DLC it will finish "instantly" (you're only getting the same file that downloads to turn demos into full versions).</p>
<p>If the old content is still on your hard drive then you should still be able to use it, but if it was removed completely (not just delisted) then I'm not sure why it wouldn't let you play offline with it (does it still have a license?).</p>
<p>But whatever you do, don't delete that content.</p>

<p>I'm not sure, but I certainly won't delete the content as I can at least still use it when logged in. --
</p>
<p>Mostly it's just some Aircraft DLC for Ace Combat 6 and a premium theme. &nbsp;Basically I get an error 800700E8 via the Xbox... and "Sorry, this item is no longer available" via the Live website. --
</p>
<p>I'm just happy to have most everything back to normal after the RRoD. &nbsp;I just wish I could add more than 30 items to a download que or have the option to "add all" as I had to click around 400 times to get everything, lol.</p>

<h2>            System Service Exception &#40;atikmdag.sys&#41;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a laptop which I upgraded to windows 8 at release. I updated this to 8.1. The laptop worked fine until yesterday when I saw a blue screen at boot up along with SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (atikmdag.sys). I thought this was a hardware problem but I
 ran all the diagnostics available as well as a system recovery but all to no avail. Everything passed the diagnostics. I tried today to boot the laptop but again, I was presented with this error. I proceeded to try to boot it into safe mode which was completely
 successful. I am lost now because I don't know what could. be wrong. This started happening after the laptop restarted to complete the install of a windows update but I have already checked the DSIM and everything is noted as installed instead of pending.
 Is there any known reason as to why the laptop boots into safe mode but not normal mode given the symptoms noted above?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would be very grateful for a quick solution to this problem as I require the laptop for college work. Thanks in advance.</div>
                </div>

            Hey Dick.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try creating the bootable media, prepare using these steps to see if it will Upgrade first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If not follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI. 
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            Hi Dick,
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<h2>            Audio issues after installing XSplit</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded a program called XSplit, so I can stream on twitch. Ever since I did I’ve been having problems with my audio. Either its set up defaultly on my turtle beach headphones or on my normal speakers. I have to go back and forth with the trouble shooting
 to change between the two. I never had to do that before. All I had to do was hook up my headphones and it would automatically do it itself. When I go to fix the problem through trouble shooting this appears.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi.gyazo.com%2f15ec1181a480579e9bd1b4efd294d609.png" /><br />
</p>
<p>I have uninstalled XSplit but that option is still there. Also I still have the deskstop icon too. I dont know why its still there, I got rid of it.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">&nbsp;why is it still there? I cant see it when I go to the programs and features.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive recently tested my audio and know when I plug in my headphones, the audio continues to play on the normal speakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have messed around with it more and now i have more problems. When I plug in my headset it switches to them like it used to but not really.</p>
<p>When I switch between unplugging and plugging in my headphones, the video im watching stops playing and it takes a while for the audio to switch between the speakers and the turtle beach. Before I installed this program, there was no lag between the switching
 now there is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do it the screen goes completely white and the page has to reload. Or it goes completely black and the window kinda disappears. Whats going on?</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. I appreciate your efforts towards the resolution of this issue. As per the description, I understand that you are facing issues with the audio while plugging and unplugging
 headphones. I will certainly help you with this issue. This issue may arise due to a conflict with a third party software or driver. I would like to know, what is the make and model of your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Please try the methods below in order to fix the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Uninstall the software completely</span></strong></p>
<p><span>There are possibilities that the XSplit software is not completely un-installed from your computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Run the un-install and install fixit:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/program_install_and_uninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/program_install_and_uninstall</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, try to restore your system to an earlier date by following Method 2.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: <span>
&nbsp;</span>System Restore</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Since the computer was working fine a few days ago, before installing XSplit, I would suggest you to do a
<strong>System Restore</strong> on the computer. It will revert the software and settings of the computer to the date when it was working fine. To know more about system restore, click on the link below:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Disclaimer:
</span></em></strong><em><span>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.<br />
<br />
</span></em></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I would suggest you to try method 3.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Update Audio drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This issue may also arise when there are issues with the audio drivers. This issue may arise due a conflict with a third party software, hence I would recommend that you update the drivers. To do
 so, you may download the latest driver from the support website of computer manufacturer or you may follow the link below.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say remove it , but in my lap top only the options: uninstall and disable appears. Which one I choose?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tamara, Henry gave this procedure to remove the non-working miniport:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you right click the non-working miniport you should see the "Update Driver" option. If you don't, try choosing Properties and then selecting the Driver tab. There should be an "Update Driver" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>So, to remove each non-working miniport, do the following:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>1.Right click on the non-working miniport, choose “Update Driver”.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>2.Choose “Browse my computer”.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>3.In the next window, choose “Let me pick driver from a list”.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>4.Uncheck “Show compatible hardware”. From the “Manufacturer” list, choose “Microsoft”, and from the “Network Adapter” list, choose “Generic Mobile Broadband Adapter”. (It can be any device the user
 is allowed to uninstall.)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>5.Back in the device manager, delete the device that just turned into the “Generic Mobile Broadband Adapter” device.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Once done removing the bad miniports,
<strong>reboot computer</strong>. Don’t skip this, it’s important. Otherwise there is a change things will go bad again.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
