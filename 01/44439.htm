                    <p><em>lnstal dual boot win 2000 on existing Win7Pro64bit</em></p>
<p>|'m trying to install Win2000 Pro so that I can dual boot to it (or to the existing installed Win7 Pro). I have shrunk the Win7 C Drive and have set up a new formatted SimplePartition called ' 'D' Windows2000' it is NTFS' When I start my computer with the
 Win2000 Installation CD present, it offers me the choice of booting from the CD - I do this and then it sits there for about 5mins - no messages of any sort, until finally I get a locked up screen telling me that 'Windows is starting up' - nothing then happens
 and the only way of getting back to my original op. sytem is to disconnect all power sources, including the Laptop's battery. When I reboot into Win7 there is no sign that anyhting has taken place atall (apart from being intersted to know where all that info
 from the Win2000 CD ended up!), I would be very grateful if anyone could tell me what I'm doing wrong?<br />

            <p>A lot of modern systems are phasing out support for Windows XP, I don't think you would have much luck getting Windows 2000 Professional to properly install on a modern system. I know some persons who have gotten XP drivers to work under Windows 2000, but
 this is after a successful install. Your case is unique since you are trying to&nbsp;install a 12 year old operating system on a modern machine. Have you considered alternative solutions such as running Windows 2000 Professional in&nbsp;a virtual machine? I have Windows
 2000 Professional in a VMWare VM and its exceptionally fast with just&nbsp;256 MBs of RAM.
</p>
<p>VirtualBox is a free solution you could try:</p>

<p>Its possible things like chipset driver and build of Windows 2000 you are using are not compatible with your system. For example, trying to install from a Windows 2000 RTM CD versus a Windos 2000 SP4 CD might present different results.

</p></blockquote>
<p>SCAM.</p>
<p>Bill Smithers has it in a nutshell.</p>
<p>DO what he has stated to protect yourself and <strong>contact your Bank.</strong></p>
<p>Try what Lacrumb has stated to try and remove any of these Programs<strong> that you have been sold</strong> and may be malicious and&nbsp; may now be installed on your computer.</p>
<p>Check in your ADD or REMOVE PROGRAMS Folder for the so called Protection Programs
<strong>that you were sold</strong>, and if by chance if they were installed try to Un-install them and only them.</p>
<p>Depending on how devious they were this may not always be possible due to where the files may be hidden / how many folders they may spread through / the parts of the Registry they affect / or Rootkits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try running MS Security Essentials / any Anti Virus Progs that you have installed / Malwarebytes in whats called SAFE MODE.</p>
<p>To enter SAFE MODE tap the F8 KEY whilst booting your computer.</p>
<p>Once SAFE MODE&nbsp; has loaded see if you can run the MS Security Essentials and Malwarebytes and let them do a scan to see if they locate anything in relations
<strong>to what you have been sold</strong>&nbsp; and may be installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn OFF : Allow Remote Assistance connections to this computer.</p>
<p>Go to the START MENU.</p>
<p>Type in :&nbsp; Allow remote assistance.</p>
<p>Select and open : Allow remote assistance invitations to be sent from this computer.</p>
<p>In REMOTE ASSISTANCE Remove CHECK MARK from Allow remote assistance connections to this computer.</p>
<p>In REMOTE DESKTOP select Don`t allow connections to this computer.</p>
<p>Then click APPLY and OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many other ways that scammers can access you computer.</p>
<p>For instance they can con you into downloading LOGMEIN ( a remote access type of app ) and there fore bypass the above.</p>
<p>Be very wary of any such calls / messages / requests and in general do not answer them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Identity Theft is on the rise and used for many ill gotten gains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft does not cold call you or message you in such a way.</p>

So bring this up because one night while I was recovering my account on a new 360 I purchased all of my 360 Gamerscore was wiped and I watched it happen over the course of about 4 mins. Now I am past it now since I have gone back into PC gaming for the most part but I am wondering if there has been updates on a fix for this?&nbsp; Now I have taken all the steps as in re-downloading my profile to a friends 360 since I have returned the one I did purchase because of this and before any says I "cheated" I have never cheated in my gaming because I am too competitive to allow myself to do that and to make sure I have already checked at the Enforcement website and it has when I was suspe

<h2>            aggiornamento obiettivi</h2>
                    
<p>salve, ho un problema ed il supporto mi ha indirizzato qui, é da qualche giorno che sblocco alcuni obiettivi in fallout new vegas, sulla consolle vengono correttamente aggiornati ma se accedo al mio profilo o da pc o da smartphone no, qualcuno sa darmi qualche
 consiglio perché temo che se dovessi scaricare il profilo dalla rete avrebbe il punteggio non aggiornato, e visto che ultimamente, giocando su diverse consolle mi é proprio capitato di doverlo fare diverse volte... grazie in ogni caso</p>

<p>Non credo esista questo problema.</p>
<p>Il tempo in cui questo forum o applicazioni smartphone aggiornano il tuo punteggio può dipendere da parecchie cose, tipo che stanno lavorandoci e solitamente non ha niente a che vedere coi tempi in cui il tuo profilo è aggiornato sui server del live.</p>
<p>Da quanto ne so se giochi online l'aggiornamento è immediato.</p>
<p>Ma puoi sempre fare una prova: salva il profilo su una chiavetta, togli la chiavetta dalla xbox.</p>
<p>A quel punto recuperalo dal live e vedi che ti dice.</p>
<p>Più semplice di così...</p>

    <title>Restore a system image from Windows 10 on Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tomfitz70  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restore a system image from Windows 10 on Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I have a Sony Vaio with Windows 10 that repeatedly crashes. The tech I took it to could not resolve the problem but suggested that replacing the hard drive might do the trick. I opted to try it myself so that I could learn something new but now I may have
 to go back and pay to have it done. Unless I can get my answer here!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a Seagate Backup Plus external hard drive. The included software only does file backups not system images. Using the Windows utility I created a system image (a folder on the Seagate called WindowsImageBackup).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I opened the case and swapped out the hard drives. It booted up fine but it reverted back to Windows 8, build 9200. I thought I would just upgrade to the latest Windows 10 version and do a restore but for some reason the Network Adapter does not seem
 to work and cannot connect to my wifi. (Just to see if I messed something up I replaced the old hard drive and the wifi works fine.) Instead of messing with the wifi I thought I'd just use the recover feature in Windows 8 and use the image I have saved on
 the Seagate. The new system should just over write the old.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just can't figure out how to recover the system image I have saved. I've tried going to PC settings but do not see the "Recovery" option I was expecting. I tried the Windows 7 method by going to Control Panel\System and Security\File History and clicking
 on Recovery in the lower left corner to get two options "Open System Restore" and "Configure System Restore". But, neither of these allows me to choose the WindowsImageBackup that I created. I only see the option to chose a restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please advise me on how I can restore a Windows 10 image on top of a system running Windows 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>

<h3> jalex3  say:</h3>
<h2>            systray icons stay in  notification area icon list after being deleted, how i can i delete them&#63; seems only through regedit.  </h2>
                    hey,<br />
<br />
I need some help the remove&nbsp; icons from this list "control panel&gt;all control panel items&gt;notification area icons".<br />
PCSsuite.exe (official nokia phone program) remains in this list even after i uninstalled it, i cant find any way to uninstall it other than this. Is this safe to do?&nbsp; will it work or is there another way?
<br />
<br />
thanks Jim<br />

<strong>Remove Obsolete Notification Icons in Windows 7</strong> <br />
<br />
Start -&gt; Run -&gt; type regedit in box click OK.<br />
<br />
Navigate to:<br />
<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion \TrayNotify<br />
<br />
From the main window, delete both IconStreams and PastedIconsStream by right click and delete<br />
<br />
Now hit Ctrl + Shift + Esc to open Task Manager and click explorer.exe, then click End Process.<br />
Once done, still in Task Manager, go to File ~ New Task (Run), enter explorer.exe and hit Enter, this will start explorer.exe again.<br />
Now click the Up Arrow in the system tray and click Customize. You will see that all unused past icons have now been removed.&nbsp;

    <title>Inkware app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scburgan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inkware app</h2>
                    <p>I am a teacher. I recently purchased a Surface Pro 3 for its on-screen ink writing feature.&nbsp; We use Smart Boards in the classroom, but I wanted something that was&nbsp;more mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The on-screen ink writing application and stylus that came with the Surface Pro 3 works well in Microsoft products but does not work at all when I use other software applications such as Adobe, Mind Manager, Picasa, etc.&nbsp; Can anyone recommend another ink
 writing application that I can use on my Surface Pro 3?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, the ink writing software does not work on a protected MS Excel worksheet.</p>

    <title>Keyboard Input Lag - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stupendous_gaming  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard Input Lag</h2>
                    Hello Microsoft, I have a Keyboard input lag issue on my laptop. I've searched for the issue but it didn't fix the issue that i'm experiencing right now. I wish you can help me with this issue. When I press the W key for 5 seconds and I unpressed it, it
 keeps going for like 5 seconds also. When I press F (go out of the car), the WASD keys aren't working for a while; I play PUBG Mobile on an android emulator. This issue applies all around my laptop. Even in Notepad. Thanks for the concern about my issue.

    <title>Windows 10 update printer issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larryshirk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update printer issue</h2>
                    <p>My printer was operating well until the latest Windows 10 update. &nbsp;Now I am unable to print through the wireless network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many time to uninstall and reinstall the HP 6225 printer to my wireless network, and it always connects with good signal strength. &nbsp; I disconnected the Samsung laptop PC from the network and reconnected with good signal strength. &nbsp;The networks
 have the same name (SSID) and URL. &nbsp;The firewall is set to allow any HP apps to pass. &nbsp;Microsoft troubleshooter and HP troubleshooter can not locate the wireless printer on the network, and can not locate a solution to the issue. &nbsp;I ran the HP setup wizard
 to reconnect to the same wireless network. &nbsp;the printer is awake and connected, and I can print from a Mac wirelessly, but not from the PC. &nbsp;There are no printer updates available, I have the latest drivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I connected the printer to the PC with a USB cable and the printer appears on the control panel ready to print. &nbsp;It does in fact print through the USB cable. &nbsp;The PC will not print wirelessly with the Wireless Direct on or off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the HP network setup app on the HP disk that came with the printer. &nbsp;It indicates the printer with the correct serial number is already connected to the same wireless network. &nbsp;I have tried to add a printer through the control panel with and without
 the USB wire attached. &nbsp;The PC Network Printer installer is unable to find the HP printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disconnected the Anti Virus program, and that did not change anything either. &nbsp;The Add a Printer or Add a Device program could not find the wireless printer. &nbsp;I reattached the USB cable and the printer was located and installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many hours over 5 days, I am frustrated with this issue, apparently caused by the Windows 10 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the PC to recognize my HP printer on the wireless network, so I can disconnect the USB wire?</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Franchives,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. What exactly do you mean by “added to my tasks”? Are you referring to the presence of explorer.exe in the task manager, by chance?
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Explorer.exe is a part of Microsoft Windows Operating System. The explorer.exe file is a Windows graphical user interface (GUI) shell that
 is usually called Windows Explorer. Its graphical user interface lets you see your hard drives, folders, and files.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></span><span><span> The explorer.exe file
 should be in the <strong>C:\Windows</strong> folder. If you find it anywhere else, then explorer.exe could be a virus, trojan, worm, or spyware!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Use an effective anti-virus and anti-spyware program to get rid of virus and spyware on your computer, if any.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you do not have an anti-virus program, you may download and install Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) from the link below:</span></span></p>

            Hello swaltrip7,
<br />
<br />My name is Brad and I am an Independent Advisor and I will do my best to assist you with the trouble you are having.
<br />
<br />I can understand how that could be frustrating on a daily basis. However, there is currently no way to set a default mail account to open when you launch the Windows 10 Mail app. The only way to have it automatically default to one specifically is to be logged into the account using that email as a Microsoft account.
<br />
<br />However, we can work around it by creating a new shortcut to the Mail app which opens that email first anytime you click on it. You can do this by right-clicking the name of the account MSN1 or  MSN2 on the left column and selecting "Pin to Start". This will create a new icon on the start menu that when clicked will open directly to the inbox of the desired Mailbox. Please see my example for a visual representation.
<br />
<br />If you want this feature to be added please consider leaving feedback about the Mail App by clicking the gear icon inside the App at the bottom of the screen and then select "Feedback" from the right side of the screen. 
<br />
<br />Please let me know if I can assist you further!
<br />
<br />Brad<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4e9f43f5-329d-4225-a057-306826a63be5?upload=true" />

<br />
Well, I've discovered what "general" thing was causing the problem. It was my seperate graphics card (nvidia 9800gtx+). I called Asus tech support and the guy suggested I try using the onboard graphics to see if that helps... and it did. I haven't gotten the
 high cpu usage or driver interrupts at all! Only problem is, on board graphics suck and I want to use my own card!! Now that we're one step closer, any idea what could cause a graphics card to cause the high usage or what would it even have to do with the
 drivers it was causing to have issues with )like ndis.sys, ataport.sys?)&nbsp;</span>

    <title>How to make games faster - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to make games faster</h2>
                    I currently have an HP Pavilion S5310f desktop computer with Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit. It has 4 GB of RAM (3.75 usable), a 640 GB hard drive, two AMD Athlon II 3 GHz processors, and an NVIDIA GeForce 6100 SE graphics card with 256 MB dedicated memory
 and CUDA technology. My question is this: how can I dedicate more system memory, say 1 GB instead of 1/4 GB, to the graphics card so that I can play some games better than before. My computer isn't a gaming computer but I can still play some recent games,
 but the quality has to be put down to low and there is lag. If it's not possible, should I just by another graphics card? How much do those go for? And will it conflict with the current one (can you have more than one graphics card?)

            <p>I'm no gaming expert but I think there is little to choose between ATI/AMD (AMD now owns ATI) and NV cards, as long as they are matched spec wise (see the charts).</p>
<p>Pick what best meets your needs for the best cost, rather than the make.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Quickly looking at the specs for the games you mention, and looking at the recommended spec NOT the minimum spec (min spec will usually get a game running at a playable rate (just) with everything turned to low), the highest card required was a NV 8800GT,
 so anything level with or above that should do what you require.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Again from the charts, something like an ATI HD5670 or HD5770 should suffice I would say for around £60-£70 ish or £80-£100 ish respectively. It depends on what you want to spend.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>GPUs you purchase will have memory on board. Get at least 512M min and hopefully 1G and if there is a choice the faster memory the better, i.e. DDR5 not DDR3.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The other thing you will need to consider, is spare space to actually fit the card (some cards are bigger than others) and the new cards power consumption, some cards take a lot more than others.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Personally, with the CPU you have, I doubt there will be much point in aiming too high wrt the GPU, as for really modern games your CPU will possibly become the next bottleneck and you will have spent more money on the GPU than your system can really use.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hopefully a top-notch gamer will 'chip in' soon and confirm or deny, but I reckon something in the HD 5670 (or just above AMD or NV card) should meet your needs.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not sure about tweaking windows to allocate more memory, but even if you did I doubt it would make that much difference with the GPU you currently have,</p>
<p><br />

                    <p>Trying to play Bulletstorm through Origin. But the Games for Windows Lives (GFWL) software pops up first and requires an online verification which fails for lack of finding the service. I have installed the newest (but defunct, I understand) version of GFWL
 but the game only accesses the GFWL version it came with and will not use the newest version. Yes, I have reinstalled the game, both before and after installing the newer GFWL. Yes, I have looked in other forums to no avail. Yes, I have logged in to my Xbox

            You aren't going to believe this, but it worked for me just now. When the Zero Day protection window comes up asking to check, DO NOT CLICK CONTINUE. Just press enter. It worked like a charm and my jaw hit the floor. Lol. Hope this helps!

Check if the recovery drive exists under disk management. If yes, check if it has a drive letter assigned. If not, then assign a drive letter to see if you can get back the recovery partition back under the windows explorer.<br />

 the wireless part. Plus when it did print I did get some sort of error. PLEASE HELP!! The instructions are doing nothing for me!</p>

            I have tried the installation disk. Everything works until I try to set it up wirelessly on the network. Its says the printer is offline. I am able to print as long as my laptop is hooked up to the printer. My goal is to be completely wireless

<p><span>Hello, Katdog10</span></p>
<p><span>Did you setup the printer to connect to your wireless network?<br />
Is it connecting to the wireless correctly?</span></p>
<p><span>There should be a diagnostics page that you can print from the menu on the printer, it should show the network information.</span></p>
<p><span>If the wireless is not setup or not connecting, you may also have a look at the Network Setup Troubleshooting guide on the Canon website:<a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/printers_multifunction/office_all_in_one_inkjet_printers/pixma_mx340?selectedName=BrochuresAndManuals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/printers_multifunction/office_all_in_one_inkjet_printers/pixma_mx340?selectedName=BrochuresAndManuals</a></span></p>

Your information is incorrect.&nbsp;&nbsp;Right click the&nbsp;My Documents folder under your User on the C: drive, select Properties and go to the Location tab.&nbsp; You can change the location there.&nbsp; I believe it will ask if you want to move all the files, which you should
 do.<br />

            Please explain the rationale for taking away the ability to move Library folders such as the Documents folder.<br />
<br />
Windows is and has always been buggy, requiring users to eventually wipe the C: drive and reinstall the OS.&nbsp; The ability to move these folders to a different drive made this much safer and easier to do.&nbsp; Please bring this feature back!<br />

            I found this topic because I had the same question- however, your answer does not 'fix' my problem.&nbsp; I know very well how to copy folders.&nbsp; The PROBLEM is that the convenience of having my own folder on the desktop with pictures, documents, etc, is completely
 NEGATED when I cannot use it!&nbsp; I, too, have a SSD (solid state drive) as my main drive, so I seek to keep the amount of data down and use my 3 TB drive for storage of things like pictures, music, etc.&nbsp; By not enabling me to change the primary storage location
 of this folder to a different disk than my windows installation, you are shooting windows in the foot.&nbsp; It seems absurd that you haven't given users an easy and convenient option here.<br />
<br />
Microsoft had better get used to complaints- because now, having a primary SSD and then secondary larger drive is becoming a pretty standard thing (especially for those who custom build, or have their computer built for them- which, when you know what you are
 doing, is a very reasonable option).&nbsp; I foresee MANY users wanting this option.&nbsp; And I want it.&nbsp; Now that there are other, reasonable OS alternatives both for PCs and outside them, Microsoft should take simple but important things like this more seriously.

            <p>Here is a detailed explanation I found (I originally had looked here, and the primary answer given here is NOT what I think you wanted/were looking for, nor what I wanted- I already know how to 'copy' folders!&nbsp; Bleh).&nbsp; Fortunately, Microsoft is not stupid
 enough to not give us an option here.&nbsp; I certainly hope the person who answered your question is not their tech support staff- if it is, then I need to get a job there, because I seem to know more than they do... and when I do not, I seem to be able to find
 the answer better ;)&nbsp; Or maybe I am just less lazy?<br />
<br />
1)&nbsp; Secondary-click (right-click) your start menu button and select "file explorer".</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Scroll down and find your primary disk where Windows is installed (we will assume "drive C" here).&nbsp; Double click it.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; If it is the correct drive, it should have a folder named "Users", open it and then find your username.&nbsp; Open it.</p>
<p>4)&nbsp; Now you should see your various important user folders- "music" or "pictures", "video", etc.&nbsp; Each one you want stored on your other hard disk.&nbsp; You will have to move them one folder at a time.</p>
<p>5)&nbsp; Secondary-click the folder you want to move, then choose "Properties".</p>
<p>6)&nbsp; Select the "Location" tab.</p>
<p>7)&nbsp; In the folder location box, where you have something like "C:\Users\LittleRedBrush\Downloads", simply change the drive from "C" to the letter of the drive you desire, then click the "Apply" button in the lower right corner of the box. (LittleRedBrush
 is a random example, and just happens to be the .com location of my spouse's brilliant animal artwork- *wink wink, nudge nudge*)<br />
8)&nbsp; If the location does not already exist, it will ask your permission to create it, and then it will ask you if you want to move everything there.&nbsp; Click yes to do so.<br />
<br />
Whala- there you go.&nbsp; Microsoft, I'd love to work for you and I'd gladly move to Washington state to do it.&nbsp; Feel free to offer me a job anytime ;)</p>

            When I do this it changes the location of ALL the library folders to the same location.&nbsp; I want to have a separate folder for Downloads, Documents, Music, Videos and Pictures.&nbsp; But when I change where one is pointed, I change the location of ALL of the
