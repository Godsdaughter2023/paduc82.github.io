    <title>Windows Media Center for Windows 8 Professional - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Media Center for Windows 8 Professional</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read all of the previous threads. At this point I don't care if WMC is no longer available to purchase from MS, I just need the software to install.</p>
<p>The WMC software will continue to be supported in Windows 8 Pro for at least as long as there is Windows 8 support, which, according to what I have read, will run until 2023. Does anyone have any suggestions where I can access the WMC install file? It looks
 like if you order the Windows 8 Pro Pack DVD from a 3rd party reseller, the WMC install file is available, but you need a license in order to install WMC, so it all comes back to MS. At the very least, if there are a certain amount of Pro pack DVD's available
 from third party resellers, there should at least be one license available for every feature on the DVD that requires a license in order for it to be installed. These Pro packs are not cheap, either. Anyway, I am not here to appeal to common sense, I just
 want to know if there is a way to access the WMC install file via some third party or after market source. I am willing to pay, provided it is reasonably priced. When the software was available prior to its discontinuation in 2013, the price of the license
 ranged from $10-$20. If this software is available through some legitimate third party/after market means, it shouldn't cost any more than that. Does anyone here have any ideas? Thank you</p>

<p>There are still some copies available of the Pro Pack in at least one 3rd party reseller site. So am I basically wasting my money, or will this pro pack give me what I need? If so, I already have Windows 8 Pro installed, I just care about and need the WMC
 software. If the pro pack will give me what I need, can I just install the WMC software only? Does it have a separate install file without having to install the entire DVD? I would not want to reinstall windows 8 pro if I already have it installed.</p>
<p>

<p>Yeah. The install disc requires 8gb of space. So it wouldn't be able to install on the 4gb. You would need either a hard drive or a flash drive.</p>

<p>If you have the game installed (and it says successfully) on a flash drive or some other hardware, and you try playing it and the game doesn't start with the 2nd disc (play disc) in the drive, there may be a glitch or problem with the game (or possibly your
 console). If it is the game, I believe Rockstar has a patch coming out soon to fix a lot of game release problems. You may have to wait until then, but not necessarily.

<p>I have a sugestion</p>
<p>First delete all GTA instalation in your hard drive, the 4gb flash memory in your 360 (because is impossible that be completed because of the space you need between 7,5 a 8 gb of space...)</p>
<p>To "fix" that you need to use a USB memory device (a sandisc model whif 16 GB or 32 GB is prety recomended and remember when you format that for Xbox 360, never, EVER, use that device in PC).</p>
<p>After go to Settings&gt;memory&gt; press Y and chose format the USB device.</p>
<p>Now you can install GTA 5 disc one in your 360 by your memory USB (and install ONLY the disc 1, because we have many posts about problems caused by install disc 2 too, in case of doubt...follow "literely" what discs says = disc 1 install, disc 2 play ).</p>
<p>I hope that will solve your problem.</p>
<p>I hope if i helped you and forgive my bad english, it´s self learnerd.</p>

<p>As you will all know GTA V has a mandatory install disc which requires 8 GB of free space.</p>
<p>As soon as you launch this disc you will be prompted to install the file. If for any reason the install does not work you can manually install to you hard drive by following this link:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-360/audio-video-setup-and-use/install-play-delete-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../install-play-delete-game</a></p>
<p>The second disc is a play disc which Rockstar have already recommended isn’t installed to your hard drive as this can cause texture issues. This wont be a problem for some people but others prefer the quiet running of games installed on hard dives etc.</p>
<p>A way round this is to install the play disc to a USB flash drive which can be done as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-360/accessories/usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../usb-flash-drive</a></p>
<p>Alternatively if you don’t have a big enough hard drive for the main install you can store that on a flash drive as above instead (play disc will then need to be used every time as can not have both installed on same device)</p>
<p>Hope this helps!!!</p>
<p>They say installing on USB may reduce performance (hasn’t done for me)</p>

<p>Regardless of what II M0Z II has experienced, Rockstar states on its own website to not install the play disc at all. &nbsp;Hard drive or USB does not matter. &nbsp;The people who made the game say to not install the play disc.</p>
<p>"For optimal performance, we recommend only installing the Install Disc, and not also installing the Play Disc to the Xbox 360 Hard Drive or USB drive via Xbox Home (dashboard). &nbsp;You will be prompted to install the Install Disc the first time you boot the
 game. "</p>

                    <p>* Original Title: Something happened and your purchase can’t be completed. Error Code: 0x8000ffff</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started receiving the following error any time I try to purchase any app or game from the&nbsp;Windows Store:
</p>
<p><span><strong>Something happened and your purchase can’t be completed. Error Code: 0x8000ffff</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My last successful purchase was on April the 7th. I receive the error on every Windows 8.1 device on which I have tried to purchase an app on: two desktops, a Surface Pro and a Dell Laptop. I have tried every troubleshooting step I could possibly find
 online from WSreset.exe to a complete fresh Windows 8.1 reinstall on one of the desktops. I have tried 3 different Microsoft accounts. I have tried 2 different credit cards and have even tried linking my Microsoft account to my Paypal account and NOTHING has
 worked. to this day I still receive the same error. I have spoken with two different techs and been through nearly 8 hours total of remote session with them to pinpoint the issue. I have spoken with my bank to make sure they aren't, for some reason, blocking
 purchases to the Windows Store. I have spoken with two different billing/account reps with the Windows store and no one can find any reason for this error. Despite all this effort, I still get the same error on every device. I can download any free app of
 game with no issues. I can even download previously purchased apps and games with no issue. I have a Windows Phone (Lumia 925) and can purchase apps and games with no issues using the same Microsoft account I use on my 8.1 desktops tablets and PCs.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try these steps in order to resolve the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First open up the Command Prompt as an Administrator:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-01-00-71/5287.2664_5F00_Project2.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fblogs.technet.com%2fresized-image.ashx%2f__size%2f550x0%2f__key%2fcommunityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles%2f00-00-01-00-71%2f5287.2664_5F00_Project2.jpg" height="370" width="615" /></a></p>
<p>At the Command Prompt type the following commands one at a time:</p>
<p><strong>'net stop wuauserv'</strong> hit enter</p>
<p><strong>'net stop bits'</strong> hit enter</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-01-00-71/8357.Command-Net-Stop.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fblogs.technet.com%2fresized-image.ashx%2f__size%2f550x0%2f__key%2fcommunityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles%2f00-00-01-00-71%2f8357.Command-Net-Stop.JPG" height="367" width="606" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now browse to the C:\Windows\Software Distribution folder and delete all the files and folders inside.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-01-00-71/6433.Capture.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fblogs.technet.com%2fresized-image.ashx%2f__size%2f550x0%2f__key%2fcommunityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles%2f00-00-01-00-71%2f6433.Capture.JPG" height="257" width="596" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;You may be told files are in use, if so, restart your device, and run the commands above again,</p>
<p>but this time make sure the Windows Store app isn't open.</p>
<p>Now back to the Command Prompt and type the following commands one at a time:</p>
<p><strong>'net start wuauserv'</strong> hit enter</p>
<p><strong>'net start bits'</strong> hit enter</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-01-00-71/2844.command-net-start.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fblogs.technet.com%2fresized-image.ashx%2f__size%2f550x0%2f__key%2fcommunityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles%2f00-00-01-00-71%2f2844.command-net-start.JPG" height="361" width="589" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now try to purchase a App using Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know the results.</p>

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is pretty much the answer I expected however I wouldn't be doing my due diligence if I didn't follow up exactly what Microsoft had suggested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hardware which the customer was running has died, so I have used VMWare to create an image of the workstation. The image is fine. We have supplied a new PC which has Windows 10 installed and activated and have installed VMWare Workstation to run this
 VM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as mentioned - when accessed the Windows XP installation advises that this needs to be activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I appreciate that different licenses may be necessary to move from machine to machine, it's a rather moot point as one cannot purchase Windows XP licensing (as far as I am aware).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that Microsoft are not really giving me any legitimate ways to get this up and running, but if you can think of anything I would be more than happy to go through the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

<p>We are mainly volunteers here who give free advice in our own free time.</p>

</p><p>You do not tell us what type of License you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Laptop/Computer came with the Windows Operating System preinstalled (Dell, HP, Acer, etc) , that Product Key that came with the Laptop/Computer is for the preinstalled OEM License and is non-transferable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OEM License/Product Key&nbsp;(preinstalled Operating Systems&nbsp;on Dell, HP, etc&nbsp;machines)&nbsp;is tied to the first machine it is installed on and dies when that machine dies.</p>

</p><p>The above&nbsp;rule also applies to OEM System Builders Licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Retail Operating System&nbsp;License, that you buy and install yourself, are allowed to be transferred to another machine.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;Retail Licenses can also only be installed on one machine at any particular time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was a Retail License and not installed anywhere else, you can install it in a VM, but you need that License to install even in a VM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If OEM Preinstalled (Dell, HP, etc.) or a System Builders license, you can't transfer it.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade from home to pro - Store button not available - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spottyseagull  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade from home to pro - Store button not available</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a new laptop with Windows 10 Home and I was interested in looking at the additional features of Windows 10 Pro. I followed this article (http://betanews.com/2015/12/21/upgrade-from-windows-10-home-to-pro-using-this-product-key/) which
 gives instructions on using a default product key to upgrade to Pro. Having done this I was satisfied that I wanted to upgrade to Pro, and so needed to purchase an upgrade to Pro product key in order to activate Windows. However the 'Go to store' option is
 no longer showing for me and so I'm unable to purchase the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I want to either revert back to Home version and upgrade from there or be able to upgrade to Pro by going through the store upgrade option. Any help much appreciated.</p>
<p />

</p>
<p>I have noted that my SUrface Pro 2, doesn't rotate the screen after that it goes on stand-by, the rotate-screen function works only when I start the tablet from zero, then if it goes in stand-by mode if I wake-up it, the screen doesn't rotate anymore, I
 have to fully reboot the system to have it working again. I'm on Windows 10...any idea?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 2 wifi slows down when using Bluetooth</h2>
                    <p>I have bluetooth wireless audio receiver from logitech which used to work great with my viao&nbsp;laptop, but when using it on my new surface the wifi connection goes&nbsp;really really&nbsp;slow (seems to me it's not transmitting or receiving anything)!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm very happy with my new Surface Pro 2 but since I have all my music on my Surface I find this a very annoying problem! Hopefully I gets fixed soon! Also some feedback whether this isssue is being investigated would be nice!</p>

            If you get a dual band dongle and use the 5GHz channel (you need a dual band router obviously) you will not have interference.

<h3> geddyme  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dawnguard shout glitch - Spoilers</h2>
                    
<p>I believe I have found two of the word walls for the "Drain Vitality"" shout added in DG. The first when Serana is dug up, the second where the two dragons bust through the ice in Forgotten Vale, yet only have the first word of the shout, with no option
 to unlock the second despite having 109 dragon souls lined up and ready to go. I'm going to make sure I actually read both walls tonight, and if so I guess I'm glitched... Anyone else encounter this?</p>
<p>Far too late to revert to an earlier save for this toon.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance folks.</p>

<p>ok got it for you, Arcwind point is south west of ivarstead and autumnwatch tower is due south. You have to go past honeystrand and the rift imperial camp to see them on your hud map. Pretty sure Arcwind point had the drain vatlity because i got stamina
 from that trip and freeing the vamp chick i got drain magic. if you have both of those then i guess you will get health. heads up, both had leveled dragons for me. hope this helps you mate</p>

<p>I will check those locales Scotty, I'm still puzzled by having just one of the words even though I found two walls, unless that wall in Forgotten Vale (where the two dragons attack) is not related to "drain vitality". I did not go back yet and double check
 that I actually read them both... &nbsp;I will try that tonight.</p>
<p>I'll also check and see if I have duplicate shouts NH, thanks for the tips gents.</p>

            <p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license
 you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key. </p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to enter a product key, click 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later'</p>

<h2>            For those who are excited for Zoo Tycoon</h2>
                    So I watched this vid on Zoo Tycoon http://m.ign.com/videos/2013/11/18/review-in-progress-zoo-tycoon and now I'm not so sure I want to get it. I thought it would be a nice "different" game to go along with my other day 1 games which are AC4, DR3, &amp; BF4.
 I'm having second thought and thinking of maybe getting ryse son of Rome instead. Any suggestion, thoughts, or ideas? And don't say "get both!" I can't afford it or I would!! 😱

<p>Zoo tycoon looks good to me. Seems you can't pat the animals and voice commands a bit iffy. But they didn't review multiplayer cuz that won't be available until November 22. And there is lots of menus and reading. I would go for it have played the PC version
 of Zoo Tycoon 2. It's the first time Zoo Tycoon has ever been put onto a console and so far the only console versions the game will be on is for Xbox One and Xbox 360. The graphics for the game ARE better than Zoo Tycoon 2 for PC. It may get a bit irritating
 when "building" your zoo, but playing after having done most of your building. and multiplayer should make the game fun. If your more into simulation games, you should consider it.

Same happened with the Dead Rising 3 reviews. One reviewer said it got frustrating and he unplugged it, 2 other reviews I read said it worked really well. Like you said, very strange!<br />

<p>Give it some slack. The game launches the same day XB1 launches, and since Zoo Tycoon hasn't been put onto a console before, they did a good job. Remember it will be a while before game developers fully understand the hardware capabilities of Xbox One. I'm
 sure there will be future Xbox Live Updates for the game to help improve it. </p>

<p>This was originally on the Xbox website as part of their FAQ; however, I cannot find the source for it: &nbsp;</p>
<p>"Q: Do I need to have a specific cable or satellite TV provider to watch live TV on Xbox? &nbsp;</p>
<p>A: Our goal is to enable live TV through Xbox One in every way that it is delivered throughout the world, whether that’s television service providers, over the air or over the Internet, or HDMI-in via a set top box (as is the case with many providers in
 the US). The delivery of TV is complex and we are working through the many technologies and policies around the world to make live TV available where Xbox One is available." &nbsp;</p>
<p>You may want to consider picking up a converter box with an HDMI output like the "iView 3500STB DTV Converter Box" on Amazon. &nbsp;If the Xbox One does not allow custom channels to be used for the built-in IR blaster, then you would still need to use the converter
 box's TV remote; however, this would still give you the option to watch Live TV through your Xbox One. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Wish I could have clarified further, perhaps a support representative can clarify further in the morning.</p>

<p>My apologies for the double posting; however, I did some additional digging and came across this information:</p>
<p>To use the OneGuide with your TV and Xbox One, you need the following:</p>
<p>A cable or satellite set-top box with HDMI output</p>
<p>A connection to Xbox Live to download channel lineup information for the OneGuide</p>
<p>An Xbox Live Gold membership</p>
<p>Source: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/live-tv/set-up-live-tv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../set-up-live-tv</a></p>
<p>Keep in mind that you are still able to use a converter box to watch Live TV through the Xbox One the only thing is that you would not be able to use the OneGuide to change the channels. &nbsp;So keep your remote nearby for optimal viewing.</p>

<p>ArsTechnica in their review yesterday used a digital over the air tuner with an HDMI output and it worked. &nbsp;So the support page isn't quite correct.</p>

<p>OTA will work, but there's a few things to do:</p>
<p>1) You need some type of receiver to carry &nbsp;the OTA signal to your One's HDMI in port</p>
<p>2) Select "broadcast" from the provider list in setup</p>
<p>3) Recognize that some of the OTA receivers might not work especially well</p>

<p>I'd really like an OTA solution here. I've got a SiliconDust HD Homerun tuner which I've hooked up to a Dell PC with Windows Media Center as my DVR. The PC is connected through the HDMI pass through so I can still control the PC with the Mouse.</p>
<p>I'm wondering if I got an IR receiver for the PC, would it work? (one of the drop-down selections is Dell Media Center PC). And would I then be able to control the WMC through the XB1?</p>

<p>I am using the iview 3500stb as listed above in the thread. &nbsp;It works exactly like he stated. &nbsp;I get live TV through my xbox, however I still have to use the remote that it came with to change channels...for now. &nbsp;Supposedly, a user in another forum contacted
 iview support and they advised him that they are reaching out to MS to find a solution...Time will tell, lets hope.</p>

<p>I also have the iView 3500, you can simply install the Homeworx 150PVT firmware on the iView 3500 in order to get Kinect to speak with it. You can find the Homeworx firmware V10 here:
<a href="http://www.avsforum.com/attachments/71915" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.avsforum.com/.../71915</a> </p>
<p>and use these instructions to apply the firmware update: <a href="http://forum.mediasonic.ca/viewtopic.php?f=44&amp;t=1616&amp;sid=f5c5d9a27c94555379c6a8e8566f02a1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forum.mediasonic.ca/viewtopic.php</a></p>
<p>NOTE: your iView remote will no longer work, as the iView box will only work with the new set of IR codes (that Kinect recognizes) included in the firmware update. Also note, Kinect/Xbox One seems to have issue going to digital channels below 10. It can't
 go to 5.1 or 4.2, it instead will take you to 51 or 42, however channels like 13.1 work just fine :/</p>

<p>Thanks for the info. &nbsp;After I install the firmware do I have to put in "mediasonic" as my satellite/cable provider? &nbsp;And if so, what is the model number of the box? &nbsp;Will the xbox one controller be able to select channels on the one guide by doing this?
 &nbsp;Thanks for your help, its much appreciated.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the problem I am having is I extract a video file (.mkv, .avi, etc.) in a folder then I go to drag and drop it onto my desktop (where I keep all my movies) and it does not move. Well it dissapears from the folder I am in so it looks like it moves but
 then when you refresh the folder it is still in it and has not moved. &nbsp;I try to rename other movie files that are on my desktop from before I had these problems and it says&nbsp;the file or folder does not exist. At first I thought it was to do with encryption
 so I disabled it but still had the problems. It used to take 1 second and then it started taking 2 minutes to transfer a file (beleived to be because of windows encryption)&nbsp;and now it doesnt even move and I get the file or folder does not exist error when
 I try to rename movie files on my desktop. The way I get files onto my desktop now is I extract file to folder and then move the folder to the desktop, that works but it does not for the pure .avi .mkv etc. file. Looked into this problem a lot does not seem
 like anyone has every had it that I could find.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pressing the ESC button does not work either.</p>
<p>I can drag and drop just does not move .mkv and .avi files. Think it has to do with encryption.</p>
<p>Move file to desktop, dissapears then refresh folder and it reppears and does not move to desktop.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One sent for repair but sent back as tampered</h2>
                    <p>Wonder if anyone can give me some guidance.</p><p>My wife bough an Xbox One S from Argos for my daughter's birthday about 8 weeks ago. Her birthday isn't until this Saturday so we gave her about a fortnight after purchase. Just over a fortnight ago it developed a fault where it would switch on and immediately switch off again.</p><p>Xbox customer support said to send it to them under warranty which we did.</p><p>I had an email yesterday from UPS saying that the console was due for delivery back to me today.</p><p><br /></p><p>It has come back with a letter saying it has been tampered with so no repair has been made.</p><p>Well it absolutely hasn't been tampered with by me or my daughter so I am absolutely fuming. Even worse there is now what sounds like a screw loose which is rattling around so if I take it back to Argos they are now going to accuse me of opening it up.</p><p><br /></p><p>Do I have any right of reply to Microsoft?</p>

            <p>Why didn't you go back to Argos in the first place?</p><p><br /></p><p>I mean you get one years warranty from them, it is the sellers responsibility to replace or repair the console, not yours.</p><p><br /></p><p>I would only ever go back to Microsoft if the console was out of warranty and I was trying to get it repaired by them.</p><p><br /></p><p>Also, I wouldn't worry to much about Argos, they wont inspect it too closely, they will try and switch it on and even if there is a rattle inside, its their responsibility to prove it was your fault that this rattle was caused by you.&nbsp; you just need to tell them that you never noticed it before because you don't move the console, you placed it on the TV unit and left it there.&nbsp; As long as the console looks like it hasn't been opened then you should be fine.</p>

            hope this helps.30 Day right to reject<p><br /></p><p>This right is limited to 30 days from the date you take ownership of your product. After 30 days, you will not be legally entitled to a full refund if your item develops a fault, although some sellers may offer you an extended refund period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This right to a refund doesn't apply to products you've bought as downloads, though - such as music, games or apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can, however, ask for a digital product to be repaired or replaced if it develops a fault.&nbsp;And if this isn't possible, or is unsuccessful, you have the right to receive a price reduction.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>Repair or replace
<p>If you are outside the 30-day right to reject, you have to give the retailer one opportunity to repair or replace any goods or digital content which are of unsatisfactory quality, unfit for purpose or not as described.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can state your preference, but the retailer can normally choose whichever would be cheapest or easier for it to do.</p>
<p>If the attempt at a repair or replacement is unsuccessful, you can then claim a refund or a price reduction if you wish to keep the product.</p>
<p>You're entitled to a full or partial refund instead of a repair or replacement if any of the following are true:</p>
<ul><li>the cost of the repair or replacement is disproportionate to the value of the goods or digital content</li><li>a repair or replacement is impossible</li><li>a repair or replacement would cause you significant inconvenience</li><li>the repair would take an unreasonably long amount of time.</li></ul>
<p>If a repair or replacement is not possible, or the attempt at repair fails, or the first replacement also turns out to be defective, you have a further right to receive a refund of up to 100% of the price you paid, or to reject the goods for a full refund.</p>
<p>If you don't want a refund and still want your product repaired or replaced, you have the right to request that the retailer makes further attempts at a repair or replacement.</p><p><br /></p>The first six months
<p>If you discover the fault within the first six months of having the product, it is presumed to have been there since the time you took ownership of it - unless the retailer can prove otherwise.</p>
<p>During this time, it's up to the retailer to prove that the fault wasn't there when you bought it - it's not up to you to prove that it was.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If an attempt at repair or replacement has failed, you have the right to reject the goods for a full refund, or price reduction if you wish to keep the product.</p>
<p>The retailer can't make any deductions from your refund in the first six months following an unsuccessful attempt at repair or replacement.</p>
<p>The only exception to this rule is motor vehicles, where the retailer may make a reasonable reduction for the use you've already had of the vehicle after the first 30 days.</p>
<p>If you'd prefer to keep the goods in question, you can request an appropriate price reduction.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>Six months or more
<p>If a fault develops after the first six months, the burden is on you to prove that the product was faulty at the time you took ownership of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In practice, this may require some form of expert report, opinion or evidence of similar problems across the product range.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
<br />Right click the clock on your Taskbar, choose 'Adjust Date Time'
<br />
<br />Click Change Date and Time Formats
<br />
<br />Set the Short and long times to the values with a small h
<br />
<br />Large H = 24 hour clock, small h = AM/PM

<h2>            Touch Screen Not Working After Windows 7 Installation</h2>
                    I am using HP Pavilion tx2500 Notebook PC 64 bit. I upgraded from Vista Home Prem to Windows 7&nbsp;Home Prem&nbsp;and now my pen and touch input is not working. I can use the pen, but not my fingers to touch the screen. I have already updated the Synaptics Driver.
 How can I use my touch screen with my fingers again?

            Hi James,
<br />
<br />Windows 10 includes 1 components you might need to look at . . .
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Updates uses peer to peer technology, basically you download updates from lots of PC's on the web and in turn updates are uploaded in packets from your PC to other PC's on the web even after your Update has been applied - it is a very economical model for Microsoft to spread updates around the world . . .
<br />
<br />Go to Settings - Update and Security - Windows Update
<br />
<br />Go to Advanced options - Choose how updates are Delivered
<br />
<br />The other component is Windows Telemetry, that is a component that is constantly sending information about your hardware, app usage . . . etc. back to Microsoft       
        </p>

            Ciao jamesschultz2, 
<br />
<br />I'm Ugo, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers. 
<br />
<br />Regarding your question, to give a complete answer it would be necessary to read the logs and understand which logs are we talking about.
<br />
<br />Anyway, generally speaking, other than "browser" logs you will find:
<br />
<br />- Windows Update Traffic
<br />- Office Update Traffic
<br />- Traffic if you enabled to send anonymous data to Microsoft
<br />- Traffic for periodic product activation (Windows/Office)
<br />-...
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helped somehow. 
<br />
<br />Ciao 
<br />Ugo

<h2>            Touch pad problems.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading to Windows 10 my touch pad no longer works. I have read that other people are experiencing similar difficulties. My touch pad no longer works at all. The left and right buttons are not working either.&nbsp;Everything on my laptop functioned fine
 before the update. I have tried several suggestions to fix my problem, and nothing is working.&nbsp;I have been trying to find a support number so that I can call a real live person to ask my questions and I can't find any. I am beginning to get very frustrated.
 I have a lot of work I need to get done, and I don't know if I can do much without the use of my touchpad.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, please, please, if someone knows what I can do to fix this I would greatly appreciate it! Or if there isn't anything I can do to fix this problem, then is there a way to go back to windows 8.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Jackie</p>

            <p>Hi Jackie,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What is the make and model no. of your system?</span></p>
<p>I understand that the touchpad is not working in your laptop.<span> The issue could be if the drivers are either not updated or get corrupted. So, I would suggest you to update the touchpad drivers and check if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue could also arise due to outdated drivers that might not be compatible with Windows 10</span><span>. So, I would suggest you to keep checking your Windows updates not only important one but optional too. If any available try to install them
 and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First, try to install all of the&nbsp;Windows updates available and if issue persists, try to update the touchpad drivers by following the steps provided in the article mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><em><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">How to: Install and Update drivers
 in Windows 10</span></span></a></strong></em><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue still persists, then install the drivers for Windows 8/8.1 from the manufacturer's website in compatibility mode and check if that works.<br />
<br />
