    <title>Wireless Mouse and Keyboard will not wake computer from sleep windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lobar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless Mouse and Keyboard will not wake computer from sleep windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My wireless mouse and keyboard&nbsp; will not wake the computer from sleep mode.&nbsp; <span>
I was forced to do a factory reset on my dell computer.&nbsp; </span>The wireless receiver lights for my Microsoft keyboard go out when computer goes to sleep, indicating usb power has been removed.&nbsp; My logitech wireless mouse has a receiver plugged directly into
 a usb port. &nbsp;&nbsp; I have been unable to wake either of them so that they will wake up the computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have gone to "Human Interface Devices" in device manager and set ALL items to "Allow this device to wake the computer," likewise "keyboards," and "Mice and other pointing and devices."</p>
<p>I have tried Advanced Settings in "power and sleep"&nbsp; I have disabled usb selective suspend.</p>
<p>Until I did the factory reset everything was working normally.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks Lobar</p>

<h2>            Interesting observation &#40;And a forewarning for thieves&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>During the quest for initiation into the Thieves guild, the one where you have to steal a ring and reverse pickpocket it onto a dark elf, I went on a stealing spree in that small market. Opening every lock I could and taking everything that wasn't nailed
 down. Later, as I'm fulfilling a contract for the Dark Brotherhood, bow drawn, poisoned to strike, a 3 man squad of "Hired Thugs" attack me from behind. I was able to kill them, but upon examining their bodies I grabbed a contract and read it. Apparently they'd
 been paid by Grelka, the armor merchant in that market from earlier, to kill me.<br />
<br />
I wasn't caught when I stole this stuff either. I was able to talk to and barter with every merchant in the market with no issues whatsoever. But apparently somehow she found out. Just a warning to potential thieves, keep your wits about you.</p>

<p>I had a hit put on me as well by Alvor, the blacksmith in Riverwood. &nbsp;I think it would have been a nice touch if that person treated you differently in the future. &nbsp;It appears that the citzens of Skyrim are, however, are fairly forgiving =)</p>

            <p>This is a ridiculous suggestion from the MS tech -- it's as though she didn't even read the post.&nbsp; This does not have to do with an 8.1 machine, but one running W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guest accounts seem to have been eliminated from W10 for everyone, a serious problem for anyone sharing a&nbsp;PC with ....guests.&nbsp; Stupid omission by MS and should be fixed pronto.&nbsp; Shouldn't have to run tools or hacks to 'fix' W10 RTM.&nbsp; The option is either
 there or it isn't.&nbsp; (It isn't).</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the possible solutions given on net to activate the guest account in Windows 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p>But when I clicked on the Manage Other Account and on the UI, I cannot see the guest account, all I can see is my own account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no Guest Account available (or not visible) under Manage Other Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly help ASAP.</p>

<p>I activated the in-built Guest account August 01, 2015, by&nbsp; following the <a href="http://www.howto-connect.com/windows-10-tips-enable-administrator-guest-account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</em>from an elevated command prompt (right-click Start/Windows button and select Command Prompt (Admin)).&nbsp; Guest then appeared in the list of available accounts on the lock screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have, in the past couple of days, activated the Guest account on two more Win 10 PCs.&nbsp; The command line echoed that this had succeeded, and Guest appears, as one of the alternatives,&nbsp;when I click on my account name at the top of the Start Menu, but when
 I select it, instead of switching to the Guest account which is not password protected, it takes me to the lock screen, where Guest is no longer shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft appear to be suppressing the Guest account, for reasons that I/we do not know.&nbsp; We should be told.</p>

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p><br />
The concensus of opinion in this forum is that it is impossible to recreate in Win 10 the Guest account of previous versions of Windows.</p>
<p><br />
The workaround is to create a local user account (you may have to Google (or Bing) how to do that), which, by definition, is not a Microsoft Account, and doesn't require an e-mail adddress, or other identity details.&nbsp; You may also have to Google/Bing how to
 retrieve any docments in your previous version of Windows Guest account, which disappeared when you upgraded to Win 10.</p>
<p><br />
Name this new local user account Visitor, and create it as a Standard user, not Administrator, and you will have as close as you are going to get to the old Guest account.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you.</p>

<h2>            Content can&#96;t be viewed.</h2>
                    Recently, I cannot share any game-clips from my activity feed to my friends, Or rather, I can share it but when they open the attachment, it says Content not available. This applies even to clips that were taken a few days ago, so it's not like they didn't
 finish uploading or anything. Could this be some form of unnotified enforcement action? Or hopefully just a privacy setting issue. Thoughts?<br />

</p><p>I tried all the pages that you sent me to, but to no avail.</p>
<p>I'm not under any enforcement action, I can view all clips that are uploaded to xbox live, and I made sure that in settings, my content is available to view for everyone, but still whenever I try to send a clip as a message, my friends can't view the content.
 It only applies to content recorded by me, because I can send other people's content to them no problem. I unfortunately don't know how to fix this, but I could use some more help if you can. I'll look through the forums, but I'd appreciate it if someone could
 get back to me on this post.<br />

    <title>100 Percent Disk Usage When Connecting Via Wifi to Wifi router - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fishwithadeagle  say:</h3>
<h2>            100 Percent Disk Usage When Connecting Via Wifi to Wifi router connected as a shared network</h2>
                    I recently upgraded to Windows 10 and have been having some issues with my desktop. I have an ethernet cord running to a nic, and then a second nic card outputting to a router to run a second network. I then proceed to to connect with the wifi on my computer
 to that secondary network that I can view all devices connected to that network. It is a little convoluted, but trust me, this is how I have to have it set up.<br />
The issue is that this creates a "loop" of sorts. Even though there isn't any large amounts of data being transferred between the second nic and the wifi connection, the "system" program in task manager and wifi.etl in resource monitor are using the maximum
 amount of disk usage and writing 75 mb/s to my ssd. I already unknowingly killed a solid state in this process and I have no idea why the wifi.etl would be writing so much to the drive.<br />
The specs are: Windows 10 Education Edition Asus z87 pro (intel nic and provides wifi) core i5 4690k A realtek nic None of the other specs should be relevant. This only started happening after the windows anniversary update, and because my ssd died, this is
 a clean installation on a new ssd and the problem is still happening.

    <title>Controlling which monitor displays which content by default &#40;why - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elliander  say:</h3>
<h2>            Controlling which monitor displays which content by default &#40;why isn&#39;t it a setting&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a multi monitor workstation setup. I have encountered a series of problems that I was hoping either Microsoft had a solution for, or is something a solution can be developed for.<br />
<br />
The first problem I encountered is that the vast majority of programs with a full screen mode will only open full screen on the "main display". So no matter where you put the window it will always be stuck in just the one. This is, to the best of my knowledge,
 a setting controlled by the program developer, but I don't see why Microsoft can't have an option of their own as to where to open it by default. (As a side note, I'd love to know where this setting is because as a developer I've never found a way to control
 that, although I'm relatively new to multi monitor environments)<br />
<br />
To work around this problem I decided to set up the monitors to extended displays, made the "main display" the monitor I always want to use for full screen applications and then dragged all of my icons and windows over to the other monitors.<br />
<br />
The problem now is that programs open pieces of themselves seemingly at random spread across all the monitors. If I drag one over to the monitor I want it to open it next time it will eventually learn which one I want it to open it, but then if I use "Microsoft
 Remote Desktop" with Android to control the computer it collapses everything into one monitor and won't go back to the way it was when I am back in my office. I have to manually configure everything each and every time. It's tedious and stupid. Turning off
 a monitor produces the same result.<br />
<br />
[Using Microsoft Remote Desktop also temporarily displays keyboard shortcuts to move the windows that normally can be moved that way]<br />
<br />
The notification area is also not setup to ever use multiple monitors. They will ALWAYS be in the "primary display" with no way to drag them around or even duplicating them across extended displays. Obviously if the monitors are side by side this is less of
 a concern, but not every work environment does this. When we consider that many programs are set to minimize to the notification area this increases the difficulty in controlling the behavior of the work environment. Quite a few programs simply cannot be set
 to function outside of the primary display.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why Windows 10 doesn't have a setting as to what behavior to use depending on how many monitors are in current use. If I turn off a monitor, or if I use a remote desktop, I do expect that it will combine the screens. However, how difficult
 would it have been for Microsoft to have Windows "remember" what to do when the monitor is available again? Shouldn't it go back to how it was? Shouldn't there be a "Monitor Profile" system where I can control the list of programs using which monitor when
 a given combination of monitors is detected? Where instead of just merging everything when the combination changes, to refer to these settings if available. It seems like this really should be a user controlled setting, rather than an issue of default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find a work around to some degree: If I install Windows 10 inside a virtual machine I can control the monitors that way, but to really do that at full speed with each monitor using it's own instance of windows I would need to use Linux as the primary
 OS. This is an annoying work around though, because it would mean I would have to treat my office computer as a personal computer lab rather than a multi monitor work environment. It would prevent me from changing my mind about which monitor to launch what.
 It would also require considerable time to move everything to virtual machines. Plus, I doubt Microsoft really wants to encourage people to moving away from windows entirely as the primary OS. If I don't find an alternative though I'd be better off taking
 the time to do this rather than having to change all the behaviors each and every day multiple times a day.<br />

            Display drivers are up to date and has absolutely nothing to do with the problem. If you actually read the problem you would know the issue is related to a lack of proper settings in Windows itself. This is all normal behavior for the average user and
 that makes it even more of a problem that there is no setting for it. <br />
<br />
Nvidia control panel can do quite a bit, but it can't control the appearance of windows dialog boxes, where a program appears when it opens, or the location of the notification bar, or override programs set to only go full screen in the main display. That's
 the job of the operating system.<br />

<h2>            How to install a network adapter driver or other possible solutions</h2>
                    I can not fix a yellow exclamation mark in device manager next to Broadcom 802.11g Network Adapter - tried to reinstall driver no help; checked loopback address at&nbsp; ping 127.0.0.1 and&nbsp; is good but can not ping router.&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting error in device manager
 "device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. (Code 31)&nbsp; Microsoft thinks may need to update driver.&nbsp; Any other possible solutions.&nbsp; Was able to get online until computer charger cord was accidentally pulled
 out in safe mode.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry for so much detail;&nbsp; any suggestions would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.&nbsp; I am not certain the best answer is to update the driver.&nbsp; Also if this helps my wireless network connections disappeared and I am unable to set up a connection
 in the Wireless Network Setup Wizard.<br />
<br />
Hi,<br />
<br />
What is the make and model number of the computer?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer of the computer or access manufacturer’s website and download / install the latest driver for their particular network card.<br />
<br />
You may refer the links below for better assistance on the issue: Code 31: This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725584(WS.10).aspx<br />
<br />
Explanation of error codes generated by Device Manager in Windows XP Professional: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310123<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestion:<br />
<br />
The computer is a Gateway 3040GZ Notebook.&nbsp; I found the manufacturers website and downloaded the driver to a jumpdrive.&nbsp; The file is a .exe file.&nbsp; I know I can not just go into the WINDOWS\system32 folder&nbsp; and drop the file in.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am a little worried that
 I could install the driver and find out that was not the problem and make it worse.&nbsp; I was hoping you could tell me how to back up the existing network adapter driver so I could roll back to it if necessary and also how to install the driver without Internet
 on that computer.&nbsp; I asked Gateway support and they wanted me to pay for it and have a support person work on my computer remotely.&nbsp; Thanks for your previous responses they were great - I am still working on this one.

<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s follow these methods &amp; check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Method 1</b></span></p>
<p><span>You may try to roll back the network adapter drivers &amp; check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/283657" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to Use the Roll Back Driver Feature in Windows XP</a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<b><br />
Method 2</b></span></p>
<p><span>a) Since you don’t have internet, you may either copy the drivers in a CD then manually update the driver (as an administrator).</span></p>
<p><span>b) You may also contact the manufacturer to obtain the driver disc.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope the information helps.<br />

<h2>            Cover art missing in my games&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>The cover art for Bomberman Battlefest, Speedball 2, Strania, Fez and X-Men is missing in my games.</p>
<p>I have tried clearing the cache, re-DL'ing the games and checking my network connection.</p>
<p>Is there anyway to fix this, it's really annoying.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hiya! Is this where I can report missing box art for arcade games then?</p>
<p>I too am missing box art for (in alphabetical order) Alien Breed 2: Assault, Fez, Iron Brigade, Speedball 2, Strania, and the X-men arcade game. I'm guessing that Speedball 2 might not have a cover pic, since they stopped selling it a while ago? Some of
 the indie games i've purchased are also missing box art, but again I figured it was because they weren't being sold anymore.</p>

<p>Hey cool, the Fez box art is appearing fine now for me. The others I and the OP mentioned are still missing though, so alien breed 2:assault, iron brigade, speedball 2, Strania, and x-men could still do with a little attention. Thanks. :)</p>

    <title>Audio being reduced by programs that windows detects communication - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Audio being reduced by programs that windows detects communication activity from</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
So this is a pretty common problem with me; I have a game I like to play (Warframe), and it dims the sound of every other program that plays sound when i open up its matchmaking feature.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
By that i mean, if a program is playing sound already when matchmaking is opened, that sound WON'T be dimmed, but when that program, lets say groove music, changes song plays the next one, or takes any break in audio, that sound will be dimmed. any NEW instances
 of audio are dimmed</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Ive been looking this up on google, and what i think the issue is, is that windows detects that im using communication software (which is correct, voice chat is a part of warframe) and tunes down the audio. to fix this, like many others i went to audio settings,
 hit "do nothing" in the communications tab (When windows detects communication activity: do nothing) and disabling sound effects in the audio tabs, and unchecking the "allow exclusive control by applications" box in the audio tabs.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
to my dismay, this hasnt solved the problem. does anyone whos had this issue have a solution to it, to really force windows to do nothing when communications activity is detected? it sucks when i want to have background music playing</p>
<p>
</p><p>This ISNT just a windows 10 issue, this also happened in windows 8.</p>
<p>I have the "Realtek" audio driver installed as well</p>

<p>Porbably better getting a branded FreeSAT box, as the channels are pre-programmed (which matches OneGuide).</p>
<p>Personally I bought a SKYBOX FS5 on eBay for £40. &nbsp;The problem came when matching channels, so it ended up I manually moved channels to match OneGuide's listings. &nbsp;Xbox controls the box functions fully (the smartglass app for Windows PC/Phone has a digital
 remote)... Xbox On swithces on everything, kinect commands and gestures all work very well.. liek watch BBC1 no problem.</p>
<p><br />
There are a few issues for me with Kinect commands for some channels, probably due to accent, but they've an app n development to personally configure kinect so I imagine this issue will be resolved at some point.</p>
<p>It's awesome I havn't touched any remote since, and been snapping every World Cup match... oh and the best thing NO MORE ADVERTS lol, you just switch to something else.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Credentials Manager - unable to permanently delete cached credentials</h2>
                    <p>A bizarre problem for you all!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have several cached credentials in the credential manager (accessible via the Control Panel or run prompt:&nbsp;rundll32.exe keymgr.dll, KRShowKeyMgr) in Windows 8.1 Professional x64. This is for an account linked to a Live ID, however the problem persisted after
 disconnecting to a local account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to delete stored windows credentials. I hover over them, click individually, remove. I get the list of credentials to appear as I'd like, all is well. I then restart.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>.... guess what returned!?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to change or save new credentials. It's a bit of an oddity, and I've attempted the registry setting of WinLogon cachedCredentials = 0 that google recommends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?!?!</p>
<p>

            <p>Babu,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thanks for the response. The issue was actually caused by the computer being a member of the Homegroup. Apparently homegroup credentials for a machine supercede that of an installed credential. Moreover, they cannot be removed while the PC is a member
 of that Homegroup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed the computer from the homegroup, removed the credentials, added the ones I wanted, and lo and behold it worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it interesting that even if you create a new user, even a standard user, if the computer is a member of the homegroup the credentials persist. That's a bit of a security hole to me, but at least I've found it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Followed directions from this and other postings and tried the following with various variations..don't know whether I am having all this fun as punishment for 64-bit operating system or using the latest (current?) in ASUS hardware but here's what I've
 done so far:
<div>- downloaded and installed latest driver from asus &amp; rebooted; no change in message so.</div>
<div>- scanned for hardware changes... no change so&nbsp;<br />
<div>- uninstalled device drive; rebooted</div>
<div>- argued intensively with (*)#$#()$ Windows automatic installer which insisted on trying to install an audio driver about a dozen times (loop see loop was my sense), failing each time with unknown device but taking TIME to do it</div>
<div>- eventually uninstalled driver from device manager and deleted driver this time; rebooted again</div>
<div>- installed latest device driver from ASUS; rebooted</div>
<div>- scanned for hardware changes</div>
<div><br />
<div>Using &nbsp;device manager properties - it says I have a High definition audio device and "This device is working properly." &nbsp; The driver date is 11/19/2010, version 6.1.7601.17514.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sound still doesn't work... though I now have a different message.. as the little popup over the sound icon with the red X says, "No speakers or headphones are plugged in." which is pretty funny since I didn't remove the speakers in the laptop...I am NOT
 a hardware person... but... I thought I"d play along and plugged in some headphones, and, of course, the message didn't change.</div>

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; No Windows Media Player and not able to playback Blu-Ray ISOs</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having the above problems.</p>
<p>I have Windows Pro 10 N, and I have installed the Media Feature Pack. However, Windows Media Player is not on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I am not able to play back Blu-ray ISO files using PowerDVD- and lastly, I have installed TotalMedia Theatre 6, but it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May main issue is that I'm not able to play back Blu-ray ISOs.</p>
<p>Somehow, I suspect these three issues to corelate, however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help to this issue.</p>

            <p>Hi again</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Whenever I try to play back a Blu-ray ISO file in PowerDVD, I receive the error message</p>
<p>
</p><p>Code: 80040111</p>
<p>ClassFactory cannot supply requested class</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect it is because of a missing codec.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. This is the only format I have come across that I have not been able to play back properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I say "properly" above, as I can play it with MPC-HC - but the audio doesn't register properly through that application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried to follow your little guide, but I can't find Windows Media Player Library troubleshooter. Doesn't Windows Media Player have to be installed for that to be there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

<p>Apparently, I installed an obsolete version of the Media Feature Pack (KB3010081).</p>
<p>I found out that I instead had to install KB3099229.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t Sign in &#43; other issues &#40;Internet is Working&#41; &#91;Pa.&#93;</h2>
                    


<p>I have multiple Xbox's/Devices in my home.&nbsp; Me and my brothers play on them/use them all of the time for the past years with no problems.<br />
<br />
I have been non-stop playing my Xbox One ever since Christmas time with no problems connecting to Xbox Live other than the few times when Xbox Live is down.</p>
<p>Now some type of connection issue has been happening since yesterday and I cannot figure out what is causing it.&nbsp; My internet is perfectly working because I can browse the internet on my laptop and TV with no problems.&nbsp; My download speed is also the same
 because I checked it on my laptop.&nbsp; I have touched nothing in my house that, I have not changed any settings and I have not made any changes to anything regarding my modem/router or xbox one.</p>
<p>Yesterday I tried wanted the game "Smite" so I logged into my account.&nbsp; However when I logged into my account I noticed I couldn't send messages or anything even though it was showing all of my friends online and what games they were playing.&nbsp; I kept getting
 an error code and when I would try to play a game like smite it would give me an error message.</p>
<p>My brother on his xbox 360 was also having trouble connecting to games like call of duty black ops 3 and so on.<br />
<br />
<br />
So today I ran many test.</p>
<p>I already went through the processes of unplugging my modem and router, and I have already turned off my Xbox One and all other devices MULTIPLE times today trying to see what is happening.<br />
<br />
I turned on my Xbox One today and ran through the "test network connection" test and it passed.</p>
<p>I then tried to test the "Test multiplayer connection" and this is where I got problems.</p>
<p>It keeps saying "100% packet loss" then twice it randomly said "Everything is all good" but when I went to sign in I still had problems and then when I went back to re-check the multiplayer connection it went back to saying "100% packet loss"
<br />
<br />
When I check "detailed network statistics" I get 100% packet loss and I have NEVER had my Xbox One tell me that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every time I check the statistics there is a black space in one of the topics.&nbsp; Before it was showing everything but "Latency" now I am checking
 it and its showing everything but "Download Speed".&nbsp; Its as if my Xbox itself does not even know what is going on.</p>
<p><br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Then I even FACTORY RESET MY XBOX</strong> ONE</span></p>
<p><br />
I did this as a last resort thinking it would fix something.</p>
<p><br />
So it asked me to add my account which got deleted from factory resetting.</p>
<p><br />
So I click on add new and type my email and password to my account that got deleted from the factory reset and I get an error code trying to sign in.<br />
<br />
I tried to log into the account with the correct email and password and both times it gave me an error code saying "Sorry, looks like our service isn't working right now"<br />
<br />
But on the XBOX LIVE website it DOES NOT have an ALERT saying anything is wrong on Xbox One?</p>
<p><br />
Now I cannot do anything on my Xbox One, I cannot sign into my account because it keeps giving me that error and when I run multiplayer test sometimes it will say everything is good then it will say 100% packet loss.<br />
<br />
Even while typing this I managed to log into my account for a split second thinking it was about to work, but as I was setting up the xbox settings for the account (since I factory reset everything its asking me about privacy settings) It then kicked me back
 off giving me the same message saying "sorry, looks like our service isn't working right now"</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><br />
</strong></span>- My internet is working properly on phones, tv's and laptops</p>
<p>- Prior to yesterday and today everyone in my house has had no problems playing Xbox Live for over a year</p>
<p>- We changed NOTHING</p>
<p>- Basically I woke up and my Xbox is saying "I have decided to not work now and give you error messages" and this is also happening on the 360's in my house as well too.</p>

<p>I cannot tell if Xbox Live is messed up or if it is my ISP.&nbsp; But my Internet is working so I don't think it would be the ISP.</p>

<p>I live in Pennsylvania if that matters.&nbsp; This website has a DOT near the area of which I live and claims those are the areas where Xbox Live or people have problems.&nbsp; Not sure how true this website is.
<a href="http://downdetector.com/status/xbox-live/map/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://downdetector.com/status/xbox-live/map/</a></p>

<p>NOTE: I finally got to sign in while typing this, however the dash board is all messed up, my profile icon is not appearing and there is are white blank lines where words should be when you click on your own player icon.&nbsp; I can see friends online but can't
 send messages or anything.<br />
<br />
This makes no sense.</p>

<p>Same issue started when downloaded and installed new dashboard. &nbsp;Connected to Internet with iPad and Xbox one connection test but will not connect to Xbox live or give network details. &nbsp;Login and dashboard says " no one is logged in" but when go to manage
 it shows I'm logged in. Spent over 1 hour with support who needed me to contact my ISP for packet loss and connection info which is all good. &nbsp;Support had me delete my account on Xbox console and because it will not connect I van not recreate it so can't play
 anything! &nbsp;Very frustrating! &nbsp;Support to call me back after sending them info from ISP but over 1 hour with no callback.</p>

<p>I've had this issue since the new update (3-4 days ago). I was connected to the internet but my xbox said i wasn't so I contacting support and tried everything until they decided I had to do a factory reset and even then it made matter worse. I cant even
 sign into my main account because the "please input password" doesn't even pop up now.</p>

<p>UPDATE: [FIXDED]: &nbsp;Everything is working fine now. &nbsp;I did not call my ISP or contact Xbox Support. &nbsp;Everything started working yesterday morning. &nbsp;I can sign in perfectly fine and everything is back to normal.</p>
<p>So its obvious it was either Microsoft aka Xbox Live or my ISP. &nbsp;However I am assuming its Xbox Live that had the problem. &nbsp;The least they could do is put an Alert saying Xbox Live is not working in some areas, because their Alert page is deceit full saying
 everything is fully working when its clearly NOT.</p>
<p>Everything is back to working and I did not touch a thing. &nbsp;I just waited 3-4 days and then it finally let me sign in and play games.</p>
<p>So most likely Microsoft had an issue with something.</p>

<p>Been having the same problems since the update, 100% packet loss wired or not, party chat gets blocked sometimes. I can play for a few minutes and then it kicks me out of games. Did the reset on everything and it let me play for a while yesterday. Try to
 play today, I could only complete one Iron Banana match, kicked me out of the other ones. I have to keep restarting my console so I can play for a few minutes until it kicks me out again. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have an Acer Aspire V3-574G laptop with 4GB DDR3L RAM, Intel Core i3-5005U processor, 1TB HDD and NVIDIA GeForce 940M 2GB GPU, running Windows 10 64-bit Version 1703 Build 15063.13 (Creators Update). I tried to run GTA San Andreas on the laptop, but it
 gives the following error-- "Grand Theft Auto SA cannot find audio card installed" (attached screenshot). The sound driver in my laptop is the Realtek High Definition Audio driver. What should I do? Please help!! That game is very important to me!!!</p>

            Hi XJY10 
<br />
<br />Do you actually use Dell Backup and Recovery, or was that just the pre-installed bloatware that came with your Dell 15.
<br />
<br />Most Dell users never ever use that software, so if you do not use it, you should uninstall it . . .
<br />
<br />If you do actually use that software, your best option is to uninstall that, then go to the support page for your Dell 15 and download the latest version of that and install it . . .

I recommend using SFC <br />
Press the Start key and type the word CMD, right click on the command prompt and select Run as administrator, enter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key:
<br />
•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth <br />
•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth <br />
•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup <br />
•- sfc /scannow <br />

But isn't this the same as running the full scan? I can run the full scan, but it takes too long, that's why I want to try the offline scan

<p>FYI....</p>
<p>"<strong>Windows Defender Offline</strong> is an antimalware scanning tool that lets you boot and run a scan from a trusted environment. The
<strong>scan runs from outside the normal Windows kernel</strong> so it can target malware that attempts to bypass the Windows shell, such as viruses and rootkits that infect or overwrite the master boot record (MBR)."
