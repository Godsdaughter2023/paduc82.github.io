<h2>            Windows 7 Reboot Loop</h2>
                    <p>I am experiencing a Windows 7 reboot loop, meaning that Windows isn't able to fully boot, and will reboot before reaching the log in step (hence it doesn't go further than the 'Preparing Windows' phase). During the boot, it says "Windows failed to start.
 A recent hardware or software change might be the cause." and then asks if i want to start the startup repair or just start normally. If i chose a normal startup, i experience a incomplete boot. If i chose the startup repair, it launches correctly but it finds
 no problem automatically (i also am unable to use my keyboard or my mouse during this).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an idea of what the hardware or software change that could have caused this is : the OS was trying to restore the RAID on my disks (i use 2 SSD in mirror, windows being on it, and 2 HDD in mirror for most data), and then crashed before completing
 it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked into some solution for windows 7 reboot loop solutions, but so far none have worked. I have tried :<br />
- to launch the startup repair using F8. Contrary to the one launched after they prompt me on a normal startup, i am able to use my keyboard and mouse there. However, the system repair says it doesn't find any problem.</p>
<p>- to launch Safe mode. I experience the same reboot problem</p>
<p>- to enable boot logging and then access the log using the F8's startup repair into command prompt mode. The log doesn't get updated after unsuccessful boots, so it probably reboots before reaching the point where the file is written.</p>
<p>- to launch the startup repair from a windows 7 installation disk. However it doesn't see any OS to repair (and i don't have access to the driver's disk for the next few days). I tried continuing without selecting any OS, and the repair seems to indicate
 it did something, but i still experience the same problem as before when trying to boot afterwards.</p>
<p>- to copy the content of the RegBack folder in Windows\system32\config as suggested at http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/139576-startup-repair-infinite-loop-recovery.html (after doing a backup folder with the previous files). I noticed that i didn't have
 the same byte sizes as the ones shown on the website i linked, however they were not empty (they were bigger in fact).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 7 Professional 64bit, and i had no problems with it for the last few years. Any idea of what i could try to fix this?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p><span>1. Start your computer by inserting the Windows startup disc or the Windows installation disc if your computer can start from the CD drive.<br />
2. When the Welcome to Setup screen appears, press R to select the repair option.<br />
3. If you have a dual-boot or multiple-boot computer, select the Windows installation that you want to access from the Recovery Console.<br />
4. Type the administrator password when you are prompted to do this. If no administrator password exists, press ENTER.<br />
5. At the command prompt, on the drive where Windows is installed, type chkdsk /r, and then press ENTER.<br />
6. At the command prompt, type exit, and then press ENTER to restart your computer.<br />
7. After you repair the volume, check your hardware to isolate the cause of the file system damage.<br />
<br />
If this procedure does not work, repeat it, but type fixboot instead of chkdsk /r in step 5.<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT: Running Chkdsk /r can cause you to lose data. Back up your data first. If the above methods don't work, then your hard drive or motherboard may have failed and hardware troubleshooting is in order.<br />

<p><span>If you have not got a recent backup of your data, I would be proactive and retrieve the data FIRST before doing any of the above troubleshooting. You can use one of the following methods to do this:</span></p>
<p>1. Pull the drive and put it in a USB drive enclosure or use a USB drive adapter. Attach this to a computer running a working install of XP/Vista/Windows7. Use the working Windows Explorer to copy the data to the rescue system's hard drive and then burn
 the data to cd or dvd or copy it to an external hard drive. I prefer not to do this if I know the drive is infected because there is a chance of infecting the host system. In these cases, I use #2 below.<br />
<br />
2. You can boot the target computer with a Bart's PE (XP only) or a Linux Live CD such as Knoppix or Ubuntu and retrieve the data that way. This has the additional advantage of telling you whether the problems you're having are hardware or software-related
 because if the computer behaves perfectly under Linux you know that Windows (software) is the culprit. Conversely, if the computer misbehaves under Linux you will know that there is a hardware problem. Here is general information on using Knoppix for data
 retrieval when you can't get into Windows:<br />
<br />
You will need a computer with two cd drives, one of which is a CD/DVD burner <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> a USB thumb drive with enough capacity to hold your data <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> an external USB hard drive. Download the Knoppix .iso and create your bootable CD*. If you are doing this in an older operating system (XP or Vista), you'll need third-party burning software like Nero, Roxio, or the free<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ImgBurn</a>
 (Windows 7 can burn .isos natively). Burn as an image, not as data. Then boot with the CD you created and the Windows files will be visible in Linux. If you want to burn CD/DVDs, there will be a Linux burning program to use.<br />
<br />
*If your computer only has one optical drive and you want to use that drive to burn data or need to test the drive, you can create a bootable USB thumb drive running Linux instead of a bootable CD. This website will show you how to do that -<a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pendrivelinux.com</a>

    <title>How can I set a default Windows explorer search view &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> multipled  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I set a default Windows explorer search view &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm posting this message because I've tried many solutions.<br />
I have Windows 10. When searching in the explorer windows, or from the "see more" in the windows bar search, the view (icon size, sort by and group by) is not as I would like it to be, and I can't change it.<br />
Until now, if I changed it many times, it would eventually set this view as the default view for search results. But it reset without any apparent reason, I can't find a way to get it back.<br />
<br />
I tried changing the view of one search, and then closing and restarting explorer. I saved a search with the view I wanted.These solutions worked only for 2/3 searches at best.<br />
I can't go to options, and then "apply to all folders", because the button is grayed out. I can only "apply to all folders" in a regular folder, not a search results list, but this won't do because regular folders don't have the "group by" option, which I need
 the most.<br />
<br />
I tried to follow this site : https://appuals.com/customize-default-search-views-windows-10/<br />
But the last key I got is 4999 or something like that and it wasn't even called “{7FDE1A1E-8B31-49A5-93B8-6BE14CFA4943}”. Maybe the registry is restricted to 50000 keys, and the last one was the one with the wrong setup ? This is only an hypothesis.<br />
<br />
Sorry, this problem is really annoying, so if anyone has a solution it would be much appreciated !<br />
Thank you in advance !</p>

<p>I found the answer here, with Ramesh Srinivasan's answer : https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/how-do-i-change-the-default-view-for-windows-10/869630ca-0b3c-4f8e-95d4-b6797b607b19</p>
<p>I cleared the folder view settings and I can edit it again now.</p>
<p>It seems my guess of the 5000 folder limitation was somehow correct</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t download apps. Can&#39;t download app updates. Can only sometimes open the Windows Store</h2>
                    For the past week, I have been unable to download any apps from the Windows Store.&nbsp; I have had 1 app update pending for about a week, which I cannot download either.&nbsp; On top of that, when I attempt to open the Windows Store app, it is hit or miss whether
 it even opens.&nbsp; About half the time, it just spins and never opens and requires multiple attempts of opening, waiting, closing it, and re-opening it before it actually loads.&nbsp; Any advice?&nbsp; Again, this has all been within the past week.&nbsp; I have not changed
 any computer settings since the last time the Store was working.&nbsp; I have cleared the Store cache as well, which did nothing.

<h2>            Changing thd default font and size in the Windows Mail App in Windows 10</h2>
                    the windows 10 mail app seems to have a default for Calibri 11 when writing an email.&nbsp; I don't care a lot about the font style but would like to change the size of the font to 14 so it is easier to read what I have written before I send it out.&nbsp; I can
 change it for each email but it is a pain and annoying.&nbsp; I have gone into settings and can see no where to change that default which seems quite odd.&nbsp; I care more about that the design and picture on screen.&nbsp; Any help??

            Thanks. I am very disappointed that even a year after release that nothing has been done to correct the functionality of your Mail app. &nbsp;I would have thought giving options to make it functional would be be more important than making it pretty. &nbsp;I appreciate
 the response but am honestly surprised with the 100's of updates this has not been included.&nbsp;

There are many people who run the App on a Surface laptop and it becomes difficult on older eyes to read the small Fonts while typing. Each time a new email is composed, having to set up the Font settings is a bother. &nbsp;Please fix this issue immediately!! It
 should be a very elementary fix for any beginning level programmer.<br />

Photos recognizes Facebook and Skydrive, but it says my 4.3 GB of photos in the Photos library don't exist.<br />

            1. The problem has occurred since I upgraded to Windows 8 (2 or 3 weeks now)<br />
2. The only security software I run besides Windows Defender right now is Malwarebytes.<br />
3. I have not seen any error messages.<br />
4. No changes have been made, aside from upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 8.<br />
<br />
I ran the app troubleshooter, but the only result was that my display drivers might be out of date (I checked HP's website and it says I have the current drivers).<br />
<br />
sfc/scannow found no integrity errors.<br />
<br />
I checked/unchecked the Picture Library option in settings, but it appears to have had no effect.<br />

            Same thing happened to me.&nbsp; In my case, I&nbsp;had relocated&nbsp;my pictures folder to my secondary (hard) drive to save&nbsp;space on my primary (solid state) drive for the system and programs.&nbsp; Uninstalling and reinstalling the photos app had no effect for me either.&nbsp;
 I guessed the photos app had somehow lost track of that pictures folder even though it was still included in the pictures library, so I relocated that folder back to the default location on the primary&nbsp;drive, and then the app recognized it.&nbsp; It&nbsp;kept track
 of it when I relocated&nbsp;it back to the secondary&nbsp;drive again.

<div>2) Changing permissions to "everyone" with full control</div>
<div>3) Uninstall/reinstall of photo app</div>
<div>4) Removing and adding directories to photo library</div>

<div>7) Ran the windows store app checker and got some errors. It repaired them, I rebooted and my photos, music and videos still don't show up. The music and video apps are both able to see the libraries when I go to open files but they don't automatically
 add things.</div>
<div><br />
<div>WMP and MCE both see it just fine. The photo importing app writes to it just fine but the photo app itself still sees nothing there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This library contains some photos in C... public and the rest in F...users/me/pictures. The photo app cannot see any of it. All libraries are on permanently connected internal drives.</div>

<div>I have the same problem with the video and music apps as well. Essentially all three are blind to the libraries I have setup.</div>

            Hi Barb- I tried your suggestion and when I setup a new account with Admin privileges, it works fine there. It also fails in my other local accounts I had from before the upgrade (non-admin) so it's just a problem with accounts that existed through the
 upgrade.
<div><br />
<div>I would rather not re-create my other accounts and reconfigure all of my apps, re-install things, etc. so hopefully the fact that it works on a new account is a strong debugging signal on what else I can change to make it work in the "old" accounts. Hopefully
 it's just a regkey or settings to blow away or something.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I suspect this is a bug in the upgrade install of the OS. FWIW, my machine was originally Vista, then Win 7, now Win 8.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the help.</div>

<h2>            pc mover express</h2>
                    do i need a special cable to connect two computers to use pc mover express thats offered free by microsoft. to purchase the cable thru the vendor is about as expensive as buying the complete package thru the mfg. also would like hear from others that haved
 used this service i am going to use this to trans from one windows pc recently upgraded from 7 to 10 to a new windows 10 pc. i see they use an eithernet cable or usb. are they special. it appears that wify is also an option. i quess this would eliminate the
 need for any cable? does any one have any experience with this transfer?&nbsp;

<p>Hey there General!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to sign in. </p>
<p>I believe this could be stemming from the problems that caused the Xbox Live Service Alert we currently are being affected by.
</p>
<p>I would suggest going to our <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Service Status </a>page and trying to sign into your account normally after our issues have been resolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience while Xbox works on this problem but let us know if you're still experiencing issue after the alert has been fixed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            connection problem with xbox live.</h2>
                    
<p>I can't connect to xbox live. I followed the steps to get some live action, but it is not working. I upgraded my membership to gold member, but that didn't work either.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I once played a pirated game on my xbox on live, is it possible that it is the issue. I think I got banned at the time I played the pirated game, but it is like 3 years ago. Could this still be the issue, and if it is, is it possible to get unbanned ?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My xbox is connected through cable through my router, and there is connection to the network and from network to internet, but not from internet to xbox live.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope someone can help me</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>I get no status codes. But I do get af message that says: "can't connect to &nbsp;xbox live. Select test connection to troubleshoot, or try recovering your profile"</p>
<p>It is the same xbox as 3 years ago, so it is probably a ban problem. Is there any way to reverse that ?

            If its spam its probably best not to click unsubscribe as it can just confirm that "this is a valid email address". If its from a reputable company they should have unsubscribed you though.
<div><br />
<div>Depending upon your email client, and the format of the received emails, it should be possible to make up a set of 'mail rules' to automatically delete the emails you do not want. For example, if they are always sent from the same name/account then use
 a ( from ) rule that checks who the email is from and if it matches delete it. If they always have the same title words then use a ( subject line ) rule that matches and deletes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Windows Live Mail 2011 - &lt;folders&gt; &lt;message rules&gt;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are not certain then make a new test folder called 'test spam' (or whatever) and just apply a rule to move the selected mail into it rather than delete them. You can then either empty that folder every so often, or once you are happy that you are
 only catching the emails you want to, then change the rule to delete.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Basically, just make sure your rules only get rid of the emails you don't want.</div>

            <p>You probably can't avoid them and some you can't ever avoid, but you can filter them out using message rules and such to divert messages to trash&nbsp;depending upon your mail program, which you don't stipulate.&nbsp;

 the CPU "gathered information" then rebooted. i thought nothing of it until today when its done it 2-3 times, at random times(could be 20 minutes or a few hours between blue screens). Ive checked the event viewer and under windows logs&gt;systems tab, their are
 6 critical Kernal-Power errors all saying:</p>

            <p>So I did the Driver Verifier test, and my PC crashed with the message DRIVER_VERIFIER_DETECTED_VIOLATION(aswVmm.sys) which is what it was supposed to do (according to the wiki). the problem now is it wont stop crashing before it shows the log in screen and
 i cant get into safe mode for whatever reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>i can get into boot mode(ESC), Diagnostics(F9) and Set up(F10) but i cant get to the System Recovery(F11) option to access the restore point i created before doing this...and no, i didnt create a boot able disk of the restore point&nbsp;(Because the wiki didnt
 say i should do that nor did i think of it) and i dont have bootable disk with windows 10 (Windows 10 came pre-installed)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did i just Brick my main CPU or is there a way to fix this?</p>

    <title>unable to view log file in windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maraquet  say:</h3>
<h2>            unable to view log file in windows 7</h2>
                    hi all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>for anyone familiar with text-based gaming, i've been using gMUD client to play a certain game. gMUD is able to log the activity as a document that is readable by microsoft notepad.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>so one night i was playing and logged my activity where the client was located, i.e. c:\program files (x86)\gmud</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>after finishing the logging session, when i went to that directory, the log was gone! in fact, there were 2 logs, lets call them document1.log and document2.log</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i've done some troubleshooting since:</div>
<div>1. when prompted for a location to save a log, when i choose my desktop, the log appears and i can read it just fine using notepad. this means that there is nothing wrong with the client's ability to write and save logs.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2. when prompted for a location to save a log, when i choose the directory where my mud client is located, and give a name, say document3, i can see that document1 and document2 are there. i can proceed logging document3. but similar to the previous 2
 logs, when i open up the directory in windows explorer, it is just not there. this means the issue is consistent and i can replicate it., and also that the logs are there, but i just cannot visually see it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>3. tried setting the folder options from the control panel to show all hidden files, but the documents still do not show in windows explorer.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>4. tried opening the document via dos prompt but the documents cannot be located.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>5. tried running notepad and navigating to that particular directory but there are no .log files or .txt files.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>some other info:</div>
<div>running windows 7</div>
<div>was using AVG at the time</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>my last suspicion is that writing any flies in a 'program files' folder is somehow restricted (not hidden) and there should be a way to access document1, document2 and document3. can someone please show me how?</div>
                </div>

    <title>Rugged Cases for Surface Pro 3 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Rugged Cases for Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>Hello community!<br />
<br />
I am looking for advise and reviews from anyone I can get it from.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am looking for a rugged case for a Surface Pro 3. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Required features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compatible with the Type Cover</li><li>Hand Strap Included (or purchased as an add-on)</li><li>Kick Stand (either built-in to the case or using the Kickstand on the Surface Pro 3)</li></ul>
<p class="contentHeader2">Desired features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Options for attachable neck strap</li><li>Mil-spec rated (or high impact and drop test rating)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I found <a href="https://www.ruggedtabletpc.com/products/rugged-case-surface-pro-4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
these</a> which are GREAT, but the manufacturer only builds for the Surface 3 (not pro!!!) and the Surface Pro 4.&nbsp;<br />
I actually bought one for the Pro 4 and discovered it will not work perfectly with the Pro 3 as the display and usb ports are in different positions, and the volume button is on the side of the Pro 3 where the Pro 4 has them on the top.&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a customer who is using Outlook 2013 who is experiencing exactly the same problem, I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user forwards or replies to an email and the new email that is created has all of the content of the original email in it, but when you go back and look at the original email (after sending the forward or reply) the content is either deleted or hidden.
 &nbsp;Is this what you are experiencing?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't want to hijack the thread, but this is very similar to the issue I have. I am using Windows Live Mail Version 2011 (Build 15.4.3555.0308) rather than Outlook 2013, but the symptoms are identical to those described in Doug's post. The major problem
 for me is that any attachments on the original message disappear with the message (whether accessed through WLM or Outlook.com).<br />

<p>

<p>
</p><p>There is no way that these problems can be related. Outlook and Windows Live Mail are completely different programs with completely different ways of displaying and storing messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>... any attachments on the original message disappear with the message (whether accessed through WLM or Outlook.com).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can't think of any way that replying to or forwarding a message can have any effect whatsoever on the message being replied to or forwarded. Each message is stored as a file; this file is created as the message arrives and remains unaltered until it's
 deleted. What you're experiencing is almost certainly a display anomaly; whether this is the result of a minor corruption in the message database or of something else is difficult to say without a more detailed problem description.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the first instance, though, please check your <em>View</em> settings. If <em>
Conversations</em> is <em>On</em>, turn it <em>Off</em>. You might also select <em>
Message list &gt; One-line view </em>so that you have more control over the data being displayed. These data are taken from the message database; the message contents are retrieved for display from the underlying file after the message is selected in the message
 list. </p>

            <p>Thanks Noel. Whatever the issue is, my wife seems to be seeing the same effect (she accesses her Hotmail account by logging in from the internet not through WLM).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify the problem I see:</p>
<ul>
<li>I received an email with a .pdf document attached.</li><li>After printing the attachment, I replied to the incoming email with the original text attached.</li><li>Several days later, I needed to print a second copy of the attachment, but could not find the incoming message.</li><li>At the time, the "Conversations" option was set to "On"</li><li>In my sent box, I can see the original message and the subsequent exchanges. The filename of the .pdf attachment appears at the end of the original messsage text in the format &lt;.....pdf &gt;.</li><li>I have changed "Conversations" to "Off" and "Message List" to "One-line view" but this does not resolve the problem.</li><li>I'm not sure what the effect should be, but changing the "Conversation" setting does not split up the conversation into its constituent messages. None of the incoming messages that contribute to the conversation now appear in my inbox, only showing as part
 of the text of the final outgoing message.</li><li>If I log on to my email account through Outlook.com rather than WLM, the original message is still not visible.</li></ul>
<p>I've only noticed the problem since upgrading to a later version of WLM a short while ago, but the fact that my wife seems to be seeing the same effect (accessing her email by a different route and her own laptop) seems to indicate that it may not be a WLM
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any suggestions about how to resolve this, I'd be grateful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>The attachment will not be included in the reply to a message with an attachment - there is no point in sending a file back to where it came from. So you would not find either the original message or the attachment in your
<em>Sent items </em>folder. The message with attachment will normally be in the inbox, unless you moved it or a rule is in place to move it. When the Conversations feature is enabled, messages with the same subject will be grouped together, so in one-line view
 only the oldest of them is visible unless the conversation is expanded. In two-line view, it's the newest that is visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't quite understand the sentence <em>None of the incoming messages that contribute to the conversation now appear in my inbox, only showing as part of the text of the final outgoing message.
</em>If messages that were in the inbox aren't there any longer, they have either been deleted or moved. Another possibility is that they're hidden - on the
<em>View </em>tab, check that <em>Hide read messages </em>isn't selected. This is a per-folder setting. Any
<em>outgoing message</em> will normally be in the <em>Sent items </em>folder, not the inbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say this is an outlook.com account. Please check that you don't have a rule at outlook.com like
<em>Keep the latest message (and delete the rest) if sender's address is &lt;email address&gt;.</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry my post must not have been obvious. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is happening is this: A user is either forwarding or replying to a message. &nbsp;After that has been completed, he then opens the message (in the Inbox) that was forwarded or replied to and the content of the message is gone/missing/invisible. &nbsp;This has
 nothing to do with attachments, or the outgoing message. &nbsp;Somehow the original message in the Inbox, or the users view of it, is being modified.</p>

            <p>Doug, you're still way off base. The forum you're posting in deals only with the program
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-nz/windows-live/essentials-other#essentials=mailother" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Live Mail</a>, while you say that your problem is with Outlook 2013. These two programs are so dissimilar that they have almost nothing in common.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from that, you have managed to hijack another thread that was created because the one the OP originally posted in had been hijacked twice - once by you and once by him. All that comes out of this is confusion and frustration for all concerned. Everyone
 subscribed to either thread will be receiving notifications about someone else's problem, adding irritation to the confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be much better all round if you used the <em>Ask a question </em>option on the
<em>Participate </em>menu to start your own thread in the appropriate Office Outlook 2013 forum, where I'm sure the experts will have plenty of good advice.

<p>This thread is exactly where it was created. It started out dealing with a problem in Windows Live Mail 2011 with similar symptoms to those experienced by another user. There is no way that the problem described by Mike RJB can be the same as that described
 by Doug Thomson, because the programs they're using are fundamentally dissimilar.

    <title>ALPS Touchpad problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lakir  say:</h3>
<h2>            ALPS Touchpad problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent the best part of today trying to solve this problem and I'm having absolutely no luck so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically the touchpad on my Toshiba Portege Z30-A has started malfunctioning since windows did an update last night. The cursor keeps drifting up to the top right hand corner of the screen. When I restart my computer it stops for a few minutes but then
 starts to drift, getting steadily faster in its drift until I can no longer pull the cursor down from its corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have tried installing a new version of the driver. I've tried installing an old version of the driver. I've uninstalled the update from last night. I've wiped and reset my whole system. I've spent hours trawling various forums and help pages, the
 Toshiba site, and the ALPS site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I've managed to do to regain control of my cursor is to enable the setting that disables the touchpad when a usb mouse is connected. This is fine -ish- for now but I'm a freelancer who is often out and about and relies heavily on the portability
 of my laptop and therefore use the touchpad a LOT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the actual touchpad kaput?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help me? I'm not a tech pro when it comes to these kind of things but I can follow detailed instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />This could be a hardware issue with your touchpad detecting movement where there is none, but let's assume it's a Windows issue and try to fix it.
<br />
<br />Firstly, try changing your pointer speed to see if it stops the random movement:
<br />- Click Start and type Mouse
<br />- Click Mouse Settings
<br />- Click Additional mouse options
<br />- Choose the Pointer tab and change your pointer speed
<br />- Press OK
<br />
<br />If this doesn't resolve the issue, try the below steps:
<br />Perform a clean boot:

<br />Boot into Safe Mode to see if the problem persists:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/...</a>
<br />Run the System File Checker tool:

<br />
<br />If the problem doesn't happen in Safe Mode, I'd suggest it's a background service or app causing the cursor to move. Let me know how you go! Thanks!

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur if there is a problem with built in graphics card drivers. Built-in card provides lower performance unless a updated drivers are installed or iconcache.db file may be corrupted which is responsible&nbsp;for desktop icons.</p>
<div>You may try the following steps to rebuild the iconcache.db file:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>start</strong> screen</li><li>Type<strong> Control Panel </strong>in search box </li><li>Open <strong>Control Panel</strong>-&gt;Click on <strong>Folder Options-&gt;</strong>When the Folder Options window is displayed,
</li><li>select the <strong>View tab </strong>and enable the <strong>"Show hidden files, folders, and drives"
</strong>option: While you are changing the folder options, you may also want to clear the option<strong> "Hide extensions for known file types":</strong> seeing the file extensions should make it easier to recognize the files that we will encounter along the
 way. Don't worry, if you don't like these changes, you can always change them back when you are done.
</li><li>Then goto<strong> C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Local,</strong> where [User] must be replaced with the actual login name of your user account. While in the AppData\Local folder, double-click on Microsoft, then on Windows, and finally on Explorer, to navigate
 to the following folder:</li></ol>
<div>
<p><strong>C:\Users\[User]\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer </strong>You will find Iconcache.db files -&gt;To force Windows to rebuild its icon cache, you need to delete all the iconcache files that appear in this folder, and that should repair any damaged
 icons that you see on your Windows 8/8.1 <br />
desktop.</p>
<div>
<p>Also, I would suggest you to update the latest graphic drivers from manufacturer website.</p>
<div><strong>Download and install drivers</strong></div>

</p><p>Hope this resolves the issue. If issue persists, you can write back to us and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>

                    <p>This question may be out of bounds for this site but as it is MS I thought I would give it a shot. lol</p>
<p>I have been trying for some time to use a flash drive to upload mods and expansion packs to my games on my 360. However, I cannot get it to work. According to the XBOX 360 site, it can be done but after following the directions I have had no luck.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody have any ideas here? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS&nbsp; My cable company does not offer a wireless modem right now to install XBOX Live.

<h3> dakid6945  say:</h3>
<h2>            How Do I File A Complaint Regarding Customer Service &#38; Windows 8.1 Pro Installation</h2>
                    <p>I would like to file a formal complaint regarding a purchase I made and how I have been treated during this process.&nbsp; I purchased Windows 8.1 Pro Student &amp; Office 365 University.&nbsp; I asked to have Tech Support complete the install.&nbsp; It is now Day 3 and neither
 product has been installed.&nbsp; Two of the Tech Support Customer Service Representatives hung up on me and did not call back.&nbsp; I called back each time and still got the run around.&nbsp; After the second disconnect, I requested to speak to a supervisor.&nbsp; I had to
 go through two different Sales Representatives to get to a supervisor.&nbsp; The first Sales Representative also hung up on me because I requested a supervisor and told me that there was nothing that a supervisor could do.&nbsp; The second Sales Representative reluctantly
 got a supervisor for me.&nbsp; The supervisor said that no one would be able to assist me because after the second disconnection, the department had closed,&nbsp;but ensured that I would get a call back the next day.&nbsp; I wish I had the badge number from that supervisor
 as that call never came.&nbsp; I had to call back myself on the second day.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>On Day Two, I spoke to a Tech Support Customer Service Representative who was about to get off work for the day.&nbsp; While I understand her desire to get off work, I also did not want to have to be delayed any further to use the products I purchased.&nbsp; The representative
 told me that I would have to have a call back on a third day and I became furious.&nbsp; I requested a supervisor and she did not want to get the supervisor.&nbsp; After I told her that I would not get off the phone until I spoke to the supervisor, it still took her
 over 30 minutes to bring a supervisor to the line.&nbsp; In speaking with the supervisor, I explained my issue and as a way to apologize for my inconvenience, he offered me a free virus removal.&nbsp; I advised him that the offer was of no use to me and that I would
 prefer to have part of my money refunded to me as I only use my PC for schoolwork and watching movies.&nbsp; He offered the same program to me again and I once again declined.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, Friday, April 18, 2014, makes Day 3.&nbsp; I work M-F 7am - 4pm and am also in school online.&nbsp; Because I have not been able to use my computer for two days, I have to go to the library to get my schoolwork done.&nbsp; I have to once again inconvenience myself,
 my schoolwork, and my time to attempt installation for the 4th time.&nbsp; I have 4 ticket numbers from this transaction and it is still unresolved.&nbsp; I need to get this issue resolved as soon as possible.</p>

            <p>Registering Microsoft operating systems doesn't tie the key to the registration and never did. You say that you "just lost the key", but that is your proof of ownership. The key plus the technology on the DVD is what costs the $$$, not the DVD itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are going to have to suck this one up, and next time ensure that you keep the keep the key like you life depends upon it.. :-)</p>

            Microsoft doesn't have&nbsp;a tool that has your product key. what we have is a tool that will validate if you have a product key. so it is not Microsoft's fault if you lost it. it is no longer Microsoft's scope of support.

            what you have is a hp computer with a blocked retail product key.
<div>Your computer did not ship from hp this way.<br />
<div><br />
<div>For what version and edition of windows is on your COA?. do not state the product key.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hopefully the activation rep can tell you why the product key is blocked.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You could also try WGA support. they may be able to tell you why it is&nbsp;blocked.</div>
