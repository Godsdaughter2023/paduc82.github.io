            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
</span><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.</span><span><br />
<br />
You cannot install Windows on a FAT32 partition. Additionally, you must correctly configure dynamic disks for use with Windows.<br />
I would suggest you to see the following link for more information:<br />
<br />
You cannot select or format a hard disk partition when you try to install Windows Vista, Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008 R2<br />

<h2>            Why is Skype app still in the Windows Store for Windows Phone 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    Why is Skype app still in the Windows Store for Windows Phone 8.1 while it is not working for more than half year? It makes many people try to download it and try to connect only to find out it is not working anymore. It made all of my friends switch to
 Whatsapp and start thinking about Microsoft bad, because there are many types of Windows phones, including high end, that are still working but can't be upgraded to Windows 10. It leaves people who own the phones with no other means of text/picture communication
 but Whatsapp. Was it done to deliberately harm Microsoft in the personal goods market? I can't understand.

<p>
</p><p><span><span>We appreciate your feedback. However, please understand that t</span></span>he availability of Skype does not depend on the user's device<span><span>since Skype website and Windows store is a generic source for everyone who would like to download&nbsp;Skype

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
I can understand the inconvenience which you are facing. We will work together to try and resolve this issue.</div>
<div><br />
I would like to gather certain information in context of this issue related to apps:<br />
1) Did you make any changes on the computer related to apps on the Start screen?<br />
2) Do you have a different user account on the computer?</div>
<div><br />
This issue could occur due to corrupt user accounts. It may also happen due to some infected files or some other non-Microsoft application on the computer. You can follow the methods to troubleshoot the issue:</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to&nbsp;place the computer in clean boot state and check if you face the same issue while working with different application. You can refer to the link to place the computer in clean boot:</div>
<div>
<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Note</strong>: To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot."
 A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</font></p>
<div>
<div><strong>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</a></div>
<div>
<p><font color="#000000"><strong>Note:</strong> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
I would also suggest you to run Microsoft Safety scanner and if there are any infected files on the computer that may be leading to this issue.</div>
<div>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.<br />
<div>You can refer to the link to download and run the scanner:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a>
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />
<strong>Important: </strong>While scanning the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, the scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on that might be lost.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to check if you face the same issue on different user account. If you don’t have one, you can create an account by referring to the link:<br />
Refer to the section “<strong>To create a local account</strong>”.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/create-user-account</a>

<p>I have now solved it. It took a lot of patience but I got there.</p>
<p>I took the computer back to windows 8 twice. The second time &nbsp;I added in a mouse through usb. Reloaded windows 10 and it works fine now. &nbsp; I did have to run windows update a couple of times to check it had all it needed. It was worth the effort.&nbsp;I am pleased

            Hello SANDSTARK,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Sorry you are having a problem with this!&nbsp; I went to Palm's website forums and show that you will need Bluetooth or IR Beaming to sync with your computer.&nbsp; I have added a link below to a forum with other users having same issue.&nbsp; I also included the main support
 page for Palm.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />
<br />

Your only options with the E2 are Bluetooth or IR beaming.&nbsp; There are a number of threads in this Windows Hotsync board which discuss the issue extensively.&nbsp; I suggest you read through some of the posts in

    <title>Fall Creator&#39;s Update missing desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darbylight  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fall Creator&#39;s Update missing desktop</h2>
                    <p>I spent two hours updating to the Fall Creator's update. 1709. And when it finished most of my settings were reset, Edge was my default browser again, my mouse sensitivity was set real low, and everything on my Desktop prior has been removed and/or deleted.
 My programs in Program Files and x86 are untouched but no longer pinned to my taskbar. I had some important pictures and music on my desktop and it's all gone now. So is everything in the Downloads, Music, and Pictures folders. Why is this? All I did was update
 to the Fall Creator's Update through the settings app. Clicked Check for Updates and let it go. Now half my content is gone or hidden. How do I fix this?</p>

Since Windows 10 Fall Creators Update is a major update of Microsoft, there's a possibility that the settings will be reset to default.

Who was the BONEHEAD who released an update the erases a desktop, erases all appdata files, makes all desktop.ini files unusable and actually erases years of setup for folders kept on external drives.&nbsp; That person needs to be fired!&nbsp; Also, why are we force
 fed this junk?&nbsp; We should have the option to download an update or not to.&nbsp; JUST Fix it!&nbsp; This is a really bad thing you have done!

            Fall update 1709 is not just an update.&nbsp; I lost files, I was able to find them stored in&nbsp;old documents. The real problem is where are all of my PICTURES!!!!&nbsp; And if you tell me they are permanently deleted, well someone should be FIRED for releasing this
 mandatory update. The reason I use that term (MANDATORY) it kept bugging me to update!!!!

    <title>Displeased with Forced Updates in Windows 10 Home - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> losaru  say:</h3>
<h2>            Displeased with Forced Updates in Windows 10 Home</h2>
                    <p>While researching about Windows 10, I read on this very website that Windows 10 Home users will not have an option to turn off automatic updates. I find this very frustrating for a few reasons:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like with any version of Windows, not all updates are the same. Some can end up ruining features and come with errors. What if a user hears about a certain update and wants to avoid it and wait for a newer update? You cannot gaurentee me that all updates
 for Windows 10 will be perfect. I understand that things can be rolled back, but avoiding bad updates would be beneficial as well.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Having to pay extra for the priviledge of configuring what should be a standard option seems very shady to me. That would like if we had to pay extra for the return of the start menu. Personally, this does not sit well with me.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>In the same vein as for paying extra, not having this feature also seems prejudice in the way that it insults users that know how to use our control panel and configure Windows. I am not the most tech-savvy person, but I do know how to use the control panel
 and turn features on and off.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For these reasons, and other factors, I am considering not using the free upgrade as my version will most likely update to Windows 10 Home. When this option is available to home users, and I have considered the other pros and cons I may consider it then
 if I am still in the available time frame. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This thread is more for sharing my opinions on this feature, or should I say, lack there of.

            <p>Also very unhappy with this, as in my view, it amounts to a form of BLACKMAIL ! ... otherwise,&nbsp;coercion at its finest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, all my current machines will stay on Windows 7, and when I need to replace them, I'll move across to a Linux distro. - probably "Mint" with "Wine" combination.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't be forced into upgrading from Win 10 Home to Pro, if there's no GOOD reason FOR ME to do so .. and especially if they force updates automatically, without any form of control.</p>

            <p>"Shady" is an understatement. </p>
<p>Won't bother with the so called upgrade if it is forcefully accompanied with the total loss of control about the os.. Not that you would have any real personal control anymore anyway but one would definitely need to be pretty naive to just accept this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, no can do, this is not socially acceptable for me. Maybe it is time for Linux after all.</p>

            <p>Agreed. Forced updating is stupid and I would go as far as unrespectful to the users. Treating them as they are too stupid to handle updates. Have it on by default without asking instead what they want to do, and leave the option open for advanced users
 to manage it IF THEY WANT TO by finding it in the control panel themselves after an installation - then naive users can be naive, but you wont force advanced users to be as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to manage my system, not have it manage me. But I guess the obvious and annoying argument from MS then is "Well go buy Pro then".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose it just means Home is free for a reason.</p>

            <p>I'll be postponing my windows 10 upgrade unless Microsoft plans to alter their "automatic forced update" stance ... I'm on a metered connection of 15gb a month, and currently only download during my late night free period... I just can't afford to waste
 my bandwidth on random updates that can at times be quite costly in terms of usage % ... but what I'm wondering is what happens when an update is incompatible with a certain device? Is there no way to bypass it? How about I&nbsp; get specific....
</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB2903939<br />
KB2883200<br />
KB2887595</p>
<p>
</p><p>one of if not all 3 of those windows updates will turn the Dell Venue 8 pro into a useless paperweight. A lot of people returned them thinking they were broken, which probably pushed a good bit of people into apple and androids hands. I had the same thing
 happen but luckily i investigated and learned those 3 updates were at fault, i was able to access the bios by holding the right combination of buttons and from there was able to factory restore the device. Once restored I chose to "Check for updates, but LET
 ME CHOOSE whether to download and install them" and found the 3 pesky updates and hid them, allowing me to enjoy my tablet from then on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So.... with this incident probably not being the only one like it , how is this eventual train wreck going to work when it happens? surely Microsoft wont be able to troubleshoot every single update on every device. Ugh and that reminds me, In my house there
 are now 8 windows devices, sharing 15 GB a month of bandwidth. 1 big windows update and ill be exceeded just from updates alone. Honestly I can't believe this forced stuff is true, surely the backlash of people not wanting it for various reasons would far
 outweigh the potential pros of implementing such a ridiculous required process. I'm not forking over 100 bux for each device to upgrade to Pro, I'll just stick with my windows 7 that I adore, and my windows 8.1 that I endure.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When people start finding ways to alter windows 10 home to bypass forced updates, start pirating win10pro, decide to just not upgrade (like I am for now) or switch to IOS, Linux and Unbunto<em> -&nbsp;</em> I wonder if then Microsoft will then ponder what the
 ramifications of forcing its faithful customers stuff they don't want and can't deal with. Maybe then Microsoft will decide to change their stance... or what do I know, maybe they just don't care. Obviously I'm a Microsoft fan, I personally have 5 windows
 devices and a xbox one (these are just the devices i currently have, lost track of my lifetime amount) So i really hope they listen to reason and change this so I can continue to be a Microsoft consumer in the future.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS - Don't even think about getting rid of the control panel. </p>

            <p>From a technical support point of view, Windows Update is one of the most important aspects of a new operating system that should be tested in the Windows 10 technical preview, however it appears that what we see in the technical preview is a version of
 Windows Update that is functionally lacking. Forcing all updates during testing has in many cases broken the drivers on our test computers and when we replace the offending drivers with known versions that work, Windows Update goes ahead and reinstalled the
 broken drivers. For a support perspective this is going to be support hell for customers if Microsoft continues to move towards forced updates with no ability to block bad updates by the user or support team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is NOT about the ability to delay updates but it IS about the ability for the end user to decide which updates must be installed and which cause problems with their hardware or software. It also is offensive that Microsoft is clearly separating into
 two main customer streams in Windows 10, Home and Business, while these areas may be different it is important that our commerce is by volume made up of 80% Small Businesses and 20% Big Business. Small Business and Home based IT enterprises are equal to other
 large business in terms of version of Windows and functionality requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is clear that Microsoft wants Windows Home to be the poor mans version of Windows, however it will be delivered as default on new PC's, I can't see the benefits of delivering a scaled back version of Windows surely Microsoft would\should be more interested
 in delivering the best possible Windows version to all customers, if they need the features then they can use the so called premium features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In going with the ONE operating system concept,&nbsp; Microsoft should be delivering one version of Windows to all customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moving back to topic - What we see in the current delivery of Windows Update is a serious showstopper for migration to Windows 10 we once again see Microsoft damaging a Windows feature that has previously been one of the highlights of Windows that made Windows
 7 great. Non-enterprise customers are the losers of this Windows offering and we suggest that Microsoft take a serious look at what impacts these changes will have to the future of your Windows customer base.</p>

            <p>I couldn't agree more, TechnicaOne1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted elsewhere on these microsoft forums a question about forced driver installs, and basically echoed the same concerns you have - if drivers are forced upon us, then drivers that cause issues we will have no choice but to accept.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like microsoft, at the very least, to make driver updates an optional component, and this does not affect the desire of microsoft to have uniform OS states - everyone will have different hardware, so not making driver updates mandatory does not impact
 this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am quite prepared to accept that all other types of updates are forced, no issue with security updates and even app updates. I just don't wish to have no control over the driver state of my computers with Windows 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Everyone predicted that Adobe CS would not survive when it moved to subscription based cloud service- and lots and lots of people were ticked about it- but like MS- Adobe could not care any less about what it's customer base wanted- they were moving to cloud
 based monthly fee and that was that-</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Uninstall the Win10 program/app and clean reg ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Change to Manual Updates in current system ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not upgrade any Win Home product until this issue is&nbsp;fully resolved ...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not upgrade any Win Pro product until it's clear a "final release" version restores user control ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; And <strong>do not buy </strong>any Win 10 machine as long as&nbsp;the OS&nbsp;lacks&nbsp;owner/manager control of updates ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My history goes back to Win Runtime 2.0 (1980) ... and 30 years of helping others is going down the drain if we're stuck with this&nbsp; -- and MS knows there's ALWAYS problems with "updates" ....</p>

            <p>Even just days out from the public release there are a number of critical issues and bugs that are showstoppers for Windows 10 and we see no resolution before 29th July.&nbsp; To us this means that testing will have to continue past 29th July or until pre-production
 tests are successful on all devices. If Windows Update does not change then I am afraid Windows 10 failed. We continue to have real world examples of how Windows 10 Forced Updates are breaking our use of our test devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the concept of Forced Windows Update is reasonable in practice this is fatal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have already removed three computers from the Insider Program as they continue to be problematic as a result of a number of bugs (on the latest build) and Windows Update replacing known good drivers. One Laptop remains on the technical preview but we
 have reduced our effort in testing until we see the final Windows 10 .1</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would at this late stage not consider 29th July as a move to production date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do however expect Microsoft to comment on the impacts that many of us testers have reported to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because we have identified issues does not mean that we are unsupportive of Windows 10.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 issues with 3G &#38; VPN connectivity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billmcguire_nmmu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 issues with 3G &#38; VPN connectivity</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>Since I updated to 10 from Win7, I cannot access the internet via a 3G stick. The device connects, Windows says it is connected and that internet access is available. This I can verify using ping in the cmd window, but none of the applications recognise
 this connection and use it. I can only get onto the web by plugging the 3G into a 3G Wi-Fi router and using Wi-Fi connectivity?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other issue I just experienced, when in the above configuration, Wi-Fi connectivity, if I open a VPN connection Windows now displays that the VPN has internet access, but the primary connection does not. Access to the web does continue for a period but
 is dropped. Under Win 7, both of the connections identified that they had internet access in opposed to now only the one. So, I cannot maintain a VPN connection!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Bill</p>

            <p>Hi Harshavardhan</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your response and suggestions. I will post the VPN wuery as recommended and regarding the 3G. I have uninstalled the ISP and hardware application using IOBit to completely remove and have reinstalled.</p>
<p>I am afraid I am still having the same problem, the ISP software says I have a connection, and Windows also, but the non of the explorers will access the net.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time around however I am unable to ping out and windows is cycling its status ie it says connected with internet access or sees the connection but with no internet access and finally shows no connection at all?
</p>
<p>According to the ISP software, data is being downloaded &amp; uploaded but small eg 608kb downloaded</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further assistance would be greatly appreciated as I have a second laptop that is now ready to update, but I am stopping it due to this issue.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Bill</p>

            Dear TyrantQiao
<br />
<br />I don't think this applies to the Surface Go.
<br />
<br />According to the official Drawboard FAQ (<a href="https://www.drawboard.com/pdf/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.drawboard.com/pdf/support</a>) - Drawboard PDF came preinstalled on all pre-2017 Surface 3, Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book devices.
<br />
<br />You will have to purchase Drawboard from the store if you get a Surface Go.

    <title>Why does Media Center now create two scheduled tasks mcupdate AND - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does Media Center now create two scheduled tasks mcupdate AND mcupdate_scheduled&#63;</h2>
                    I have noticed since switching on Windows Media Center for the first time in a long time on a clean install of Windows 7, it now creates an additional task in scheduler called mcupdate AND mcupdate_scheduled.&nbsp; Mcupdate_scheduled is always set to wake the
 computer at 3:31 am everyday.&nbsp; Now in the past to stop Media Center switching on the computer during the night and then leaving it on, I would go into media center automatic update options, and switch them off.&nbsp; These options now no longer effect Mcupdate
 or Mcupdate_scheduled and the only way to prevent media center switching on automatically is to disable Mcupdate_scheduled in Task Scheduler.&nbsp; Any idea why this strange setup is in place?&nbsp; Why is Media Player so determined its going to switch itself on in
 the night by going to the extent of creating additional tasks AND prevent you from switching them off within Media Player itself?&nbsp; Any insights on this?

    <title>Feedback Lab - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulharder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Feedback Lab</h2>
                    <p>I recently received an invitation, purportedly from Microsoft, to join the Windows Feedback Lab. I completed an online survey, and then I received another email inviting me to download and install the Feedback Lab application. But the email did not come
 from Microsoft. It had a bunch of Microsoft stuff that anybody can copy and paste into an email message. The link to install the application is hosted at windows.net, which is owned by Microsoft, but going to that address in Internet Explorer runs a program
 from an unrecognized source, so I disallowed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not managed to find any Microsoft website that makes it clear that Microsoft supports this Feedback Lab in any way -- except for a single response on this message board, from somebody who purports to be a Microsoft employee and who confirms it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, I find it more than a little suspicious that the email said I had to use Internet Explorer to install the application. If this lab is to explore the future of Windows, then anybody who legitimately can engage in that discussion almost certainly
 has Microsoft Edge. Use of IE strongly suggests that this is an exploit aimed at placing malware on my computer. Malware is so rampant nowadays that I will NEVER install this application unless it is both hosted on microsoft.com AND an easily findable webpage
 ON microsoft.com assures me that it is legitimately a Microsoft tool. And the installer MUST be recognized by Windows as Microsoft, not an unrecognized source.</p>

            I received the same e-mail this morning (August 31st) with a deadline of August 31st stated in the message. As a thank you for my participation the message said I would be entered into a sweepstakes for a $100 Amazon gift card. I'd like to participate

<p>Hi Charles?<br />
It is now 9/12/2017. I just received this "invitation" this morning. I would like to join the "Feedback Lab" - if it is a real thing and not a phishing expedition. I have always been told ( on this forum by microsoft employees) &nbsp;that if a microsoft email is
 genuine, there will be a green shield in the address bar next to the email address. I do not see that?&nbsp;<br />

I'm interested. Saving the email.<br />

<p>I think more to the point of this - even if it is Microsoft supported - why are we installing an app? That is not our feedback, that is an invasion of our privacy and an automated assessment of our behaviors and opinions based on a machine's interpretation
 of how we use our computers. Does it use key logging? Is it any safer than any of the other databases around the world that have been hacked? Does it access our hardware such as cameras? How deeply will it integrate itself into the machine whereas programs
 like "Cortana", that even after taking extreme measures to disable the intrusiveness, still read our emails through a 3rd party browser, interpret the info, and respond to us on our computers?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a responsibility issue and Microsoft is blatantly attempting to buy off those folks who have a lack of experience, knowledge, or basic understanding of the electronic era and vulnerability, and is no different than a stranger trying to coerce a child
 with candy. I think this is abusive an inappropriate. I actively participate in several opinion groups through formal survey programs and all of them are secured through secure websites, are reputable, provide no intrusiveness, and do not require the installation
 of additional software on my computer. This is beyond suspicious. If Microsoft truly is responsible for this, then this should be a violation of net neutrality and cyber-security that borderlines national defense issues with the intrusiveness on individual
 computers, opening up personal data, emails, contacts, and other information that can be hacked, stolen, sold, and misused (and already is), at a time when there are several countries faced with potential conflict and this email obviously goes out world-wide
 as it asks for our location (including China and the U.S.). </p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft is not responsible, then the company should have the accountability to escalate this matter to the FBI for investigation and a warning issued to the general public. Data theft and privacy invasion for the purposes of harming the general public
 (and individuals at random) is no longer a "conspiracy". It is a real issue and everyone now has to spend a good portion of their time on line just fending off the mass of attacks. If this were installed on a company's computer, who knows the extensive level
 of damage that could be done? Internet Explorer already exists. The settings are already set to track a LOT of data. Cortana is already an automated system giving live feedback to Microsoft for purposes other than "user friendliness". And, the universal log-in
 for Microsoft is a well-known tool that provides behavioral analytic functions for their marketing - and that is worth money to them even though our permission is not given in the truest sense. So, another level of software installation is beyond reprehensible.
 You may think I am excessive about this matter, but as an I.T. professional, I watch hundreds of innocent people every year - from the elderly who are alone and trying just to talk to their grand-kids, to families trying to protect their children - being hacked,
 losing valuable information, and dealing with a LOT of problems caused by Microsoft's need to have so many vulnerabilities in the Windows OS. So, excessive or not, I will stand behind these concerns with conviction as my 20+ years in the I.T. industry give
 me a LOT of insight. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft can offer no better answer here, on THEIR forum, then I would recommend posting this, spreading it around, and telling everyone you know not to participate. This is not an attack on Microsoft; this is a path toward safe and stable computer usage
 and defense of personal information. Good luck to all.<br />

            In the most urgent cases of graphical driver errors and/or corruptions, a good way of potentially resolving this issue is to download Display Driver Uninstaller and run it in Safe Mode. This will erase and clean all traces of the Nvidia graphics driver,
 allowing you to reinstall the latest driver again. Before starting this process however, I would recommend creating a custom restore point on your local disk, just in case something goes wrong.

<p>Is there some reason you did not include with your topic the error code associated with the failed update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you mean you are seeing something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/357f7bd2-8031-4f8a-aafc-da8ea26b2498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/357f7bd2-8031-4f8a-aafc-da8ea26b2498" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That message is telling you that the driver update offered from Windows Update is an older or lesser version than the currently installed driver or has a lower compatibility rating than the installed driver.&nbsp; That means you probably don't want that update
 and you should be glad the installation is failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is generally not a good idea to accept hardware driver updates (video, audio, network, printer) offered by Windows Update and if you ever see them it is best to hide them so you never see them again.&nbsp; Only get hardware driver updates from your hardware
 manufacturers WWW site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just because Microsoft offers you a driver update does not mean you have an out of date or afflicted driver and it certainly doesn't mean you have to install the driver updates MS offers - it is generally best NOT to install hardware driver updates offered
 by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Accepting hardware driver updates from Microsoft is one reason there are so many topics in the community that start with "Windows update broke my computer...".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me assure you with 100% certainty that these ideas for things to try that are usually suggested by the Microsoft engaged alleged "experts" will not help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe Mode</p>
<p>Clean Boot</p>
<p>DISM</p>
<p>SFC&nbsp; (System File Checker)</p>
<p>Windows update Troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p>One rule of thumb (especially for hardware drivers) is "if it ain't broke don't fix it" so if you are not having a problem with hardware devices (video, audio, network, printer) don't accept or install those driver updates offered from Microsoft.&nbsp; If you
 are having a problem like that you should only get driver updates from the hardware manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see and can recognize those hardware driver updates offered you should right click and hide them:</p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac1f86e4-1fca-471b-a37b-14ae2736c025" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Pretty soon you might have quite a few hidden hardware updates:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5f3b09b-cddc-49aa-8381-d29660edc24a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5f3b09b-cddc-49aa-8381-d29660edc24a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has a way built in to not allow these kinds of updates and I'm not 100% sure it works as advertised but this is a safe adjustment that may prevent a whoops event in the future and how you might undo them if they happen:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 has built in ways to disable driver updates from Windows Update that you can read about here:</p>

<p>If you need some help figuring out what you have and what NVIDIA says you need do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your system make and model or is it something assembled from separately purchased components?<br />
<br />
If the system is a Dell what is the Service Tag Number?<br />
If the system is an HP what is the serial number?<br />
If the system is an Toshiba what is the serial number?<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For video device and driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />

<p>They are Fifa points. It says on the hard drive that the code has been successfully loaded but no points have shown up. The leaflet with the game says the redemption of the code will be granted when you next log on to your fifa 13 ultimate team but this
 has not happened even when we switch everything off and on again. What can we try next?</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>Varken FIFA15 eller GTA går inte att köra online, meddelande <strong>Din spelarprofil har inte rätt tillstånd för att komma åt denna funktion</strong>. Nätverkstester funkar. Har guld meddlemsskap. Rätt ålder. Origin konto ok. Kan köpa spelare på FUT men
 inte starta online spel. Blir väldigt trött på denna maskin nu....</p>

<p>Om det är med profilen, "BalmierBowl2603" som du försöker spela FIFA15, eller GTA online, så saknas behörighet i form av ett guld medlemskap. Din profil är inte knuten till ett sådant medlemskap.</p>

<p>I have solved my problem by buing another Xbox Live Gold, I had one when checking in my Microsoft account but it wasn't connected to my player profile.</p>
<p>I find this very confusing for a beginner with Xbox. Different accounts(Microsoft/Xbox) but still connected to each other??</p>

<h2>            How to export my photos from Windows 10 Photo App</h2>
                    I am trying to back up from photos from Windows 10 Photo App to a external hard drive but everytime I try to select and copy, it freezes and shuts down. There are different pictures from the Photo App that are not included in My Pictures file. I don't
 know what to do or how to save my photos from it. Any suggestions?

            As of today July the 3th 2017 I'm having the same problem, no easy way to batch transfer easily your pictures from this app to an external drive. I have the strong belief that MS is trying to force us to buy extra storage on OneDrive, money greedy people,
 I thought it was just Apple. Anyway if anybody find a way, please let me know. Thanks.

            Normally you would use Explorer to copy/paste (drag/drop) the files but you can use Photos' Copy for the first part.&nbsp; Just use Explorer to click on your external drive and select Paste.&nbsp;
