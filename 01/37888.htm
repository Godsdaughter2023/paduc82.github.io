    <title>laptop keyboard sensitivity - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            laptop keyboard sensitivity</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I was wondering if there is any way to make my keyboard more sensitive? &nbsp; I have had to use an unnecessary amount of force when typing, especially when typing, making papers take 3 times as long when I'm typing on another computer. &nbsp; I also have to
 type extremely slowly, or else it doesn't register 3-5 letters, and especially with spaces and repeated letters, like the "pp" in "happening". &nbsp; I am also on a laptop, so I can't really replace the keyboard.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Jacob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can change the keyboard's sensitivity, also known as the keyboard's repeat rate through Keyboard properties.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open<strong> Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Go to<strong> Ease of Access Center</strong>.</li><li>Under<strong> Explore all settings</strong>, click on <strong>Make the keyboard easier to use</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>See </strong><strong>also</strong>, click on <strong>Keyboard settings</strong> to open
<strong>Keyboard Properties</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Speed </strong>tab, under <strong>Character </strong><strong>repeat</strong>, adjust the<strong> Repeat delay</strong> and
<strong>Repeat rate</strong> to your preference. There is a text box available so you can test out the changes you've made.<br />
<br />

<p><span>It is possible to save it elsewhere, but the ASR wizard will look on the HDD if you want to recover the data. The ASR is a very basic tool, which
 works well if you have serious problems with Windows but the HDD is still ok. It will not prevent you against data loss by a defective HDD because it is very likely that the ASR data could not be restored then as well</span></p>

<p>The issue is this - just in case someone has run into this before - I upgraded our Document Management system along with a couple other third-party software packages and now we are unable to use Office 2010 File | Save and Send | Send as Attachment on some
 of our forms.&nbsp; The attachment is striped out of the email or any information that was input into the form is stripped.</p>

<h2>            Used Yahoo&#47;att.net account to set up Microsoft account and cannot add my yahoo account to the mail app.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Using same email for two accounts ​</p>
<p>I just purchased my new hp laptop with Windows 8 pre-loaded.&nbsp; So far so good except for my email account.&nbsp; I read suggestions before setting up this laptop, that you should definitely set up a Microsoft Account when first setting up Windows 8.&nbsp; When I saw
 the screen to do this, it said I could use any email address I have--didn't have to be outlook.&nbsp; I only have one personal address--my yahoo/att.net account.&nbsp; So, I used it and chose a new password to go with it (didn't use my yahoo password)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently, this was not what I should have done, and it makes sense now why, but how do I fix it?&nbsp; Because I used my att.net email for my Microsoft account, I cannot add my yahoo account to the mail app.&nbsp; This means none of my contacts/people are loaded.&nbsp;
 Do I have to manually add everyone?&nbsp; Or do I just need to change my Microsoft Account address?&nbsp; To do so, I will need to sign up for an additional email account--Is there an account that is safer than others?&nbsp; I've heard NOT to use gmail or Hotmail.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks so much!&nbsp; Loving Windows 8 except for my mistake!</p>

<h3> vivsiim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Troubleshoot options missing&#58; Windows 10 Anniversary</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows10.&nbsp; I used Windows 10 for several months, but it wasn't a great performer, so I upgraded again to&nbsp;Windows 10 Anniversary, hoping for big improvements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now experiencing black screen on login, and slow performance once I get passed that.</p>
<p>Microsoft advice for the first problem is to reinstall my display adapter driver in safe mode.</p>
<p>However, I'm unable to reach safe mode.</p>
<p>I should be able to enter safe mode as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Shift/power button</p>
<p>2) Restart</p>
<p>3) Troubleshoot</p>
<p>4) Advanced Options</p>
<p>5) Startup Settings</p>
<p>6) Restart</p>
<p>7) 5 or F5 for Safe Mode with Networking</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, when I click on 'Troubleshoot',&nbsp;I get a screen that has <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
only</span>&nbsp;the words, 'Advanced Options', at the top, and&nbsp;a button entitled 'UEFI Firmware Settings'.&nbsp; When I click on the button, the next screen has a 'Restart' button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There should be several options along with 'UEFI Firmware Settings', including&nbsp;'Startup Settings', but they aren't there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?&nbsp; Is it possible that the Anniversary installation is corrupted?&nbsp; Is there a 'repair Windows 10 anniversary' option somewhere?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Microsoft technician took over my PC today, but he didn't seem to know what he was doing, and nothing changed.</p>

<p>Hi Vivsiim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize the inconvenience you are experiencing on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to <span>start your PC in Safe Mode using installation media. To do so, try below steps:</span></p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>1. </strong>On a working PC, go to the </span><strong><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=615943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>Microsoft
 software download website</span></span></span></span></a></strong><span><span>&nbsp;and create Windows 10 installation media.</span></span></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. </strong>Insert the installation media you created, and then restart your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3. </strong>On the Install Windows screen, select <strong>Repair your computer</strong>. (If you’re not seeing this screen, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's website for info on how to boot from media,
 and then try again.) </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4. </strong>On the <strong>Choose an option </strong>screen, select <strong>
Troubleshoot</strong>. From there, you can use Safe Mode. Select <strong>Advanced Options
</strong>&gt; <strong>Startup Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Restart</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>5. </strong>After your PC restarts, select 5 or F5 to restart you PC in
<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>. If your PC won’t start in Safe Mode with Networking, try steps 2-4 again, and then, after your PC restarts, select 3 or F3 to
<strong>Enable low-resolution video</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>6. </strong>Once your PC is in Safe Mode, open <strong>Device Manager </strong>
by typing <strong>device manager </strong>in the search box on the taskbar, select
<strong>Device Manager</strong>, and select the arrow to expand <strong>Display adapters</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong>If you see two items under <strong>Display adapters</strong>:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Right-click the added display adapter (for example, Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200), and then select
<strong>Disable</strong> &gt; <strong>Yes</strong>. To see if that worked, shut down your PC, disconnect your installation media, and then turn your PC back on.<br />
</li><li>If that doesn’t work, restart your PC in Safe Mode (see steps 2-5), return to the
<strong>Display adapter </strong>section in Device Manager, enable the display adapter, and then disable the other display adapter.</li></ul>
<p><strong>2. </strong>If you see one item under <strong>Display adapters</strong>, roll back the driver or uninstall the display adapter.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>To roll back the driver, open Device Manager and select the arrow to expand <strong>
Display adapters</strong>. Under <strong>Display adapters</strong>, right-click the item and select
<strong>Properties</strong>. Select the <strong>Driver</strong> tab, and then select
<strong>Roll Back Driver </strong>&gt; <strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>To uninstall the display adapter, open Device Manager and select the arrow to expand
<strong>Display adapters</strong>. Under <strong>Display adapters</strong>, right-click the item and select

            <p>Hi Vinodh_Kumar V,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help.&nbsp; It is very much appreciated.</p>
<p>I hope you won't mind holding my hand a little&nbsp;more, as I'm a bit stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1st issue:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my Windows info:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edition: Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>Version 1607</p>
<p>OS Build 14393.105</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I downloaded the Windows 10 Installation media to USB, I was presented with a screen to select language, Edition and Architecture.&nbsp; It had a check mark against 'Use the recommended option for this PC', and the Edition shown was Windows 10.&nbsp; When I removed
 the check mark, the options were Windows 10, Windows 10 Home Single Language, and Windows 10 N.</p>
<p>I went with the recommended option (Windows 10), but am wondering if I made the right choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2nd Issue:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I rebooted my PC from the installation media USB, a panel with the following message came up:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Setup</p>
<p>It looks like you started an upgrade and booted from installation media.</p>
<p>If you want to continue with the upgrade, removed the media from your PC and click Yes.&nbsp; If you want to perform a clean installation instead, click No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been expecting a screen with a 'Repair your computer' option so, being chicken, I clicked on Yes (which didn't seem to do anything other than allow me to log on).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really appreciate it if you'd advise me on how to proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>To research basic questions like "what is a pagefile and what is ReadyBoost" use a search engine such as Bing or Google.&nbsp; Plenty of good information out there.&nbsp; To answer your other question, no you cannot move the pagefile to a removable device.</p>

                    <p>This just started happening yesterday on my work machine (A Dell Optiplex).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like I have lost keyboard input into Windows (note: the keyboard works in the BIOS just fine).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot get it to accept the CTRL+ALT+DEL so I can't even get the ease of access or power icon to appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried removing all USB devices and then plugging in the keyboard after it gets to the sign in screen.</p>
<p>This failed to produce any results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I re-install windows, are there any other suggestions?</p>

            Hi  froggystyle_82
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot with the keyboard working . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Then open Device Manager 
<br />Expand the Keyboards section 
<br />Right click your keyboard and choose 'Uninstall' 
<br />Then restart your PC
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            Hi,
<br />first of all - did you try double-pressing  CTRL+ALT+DEL?
<br />Can you use restore environment to roll back few das before the problem occurred? 
<br />Can you try another keyboard in another USB port?

<p>I have tried 4 keyboards, in every USB port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even the num lock won't work.&nbsp; &nbsp;That is if you press num lock, the LED indicator isn't changing state.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure Windows has bricked the keyboard driver or something similar.</p>

<p>Okay so the first attempt to go through startup repair - it failed to repair it's problems.</p>
<p>I tried forcing it to boot into safe mode but this is also failing to detect the keyboard input (can't get passed the ctrL+alt+del)</p>
<p>

</p><p>I can't do a system restore because the previous employee at this desk seems to have disabled it.</p>

    <title>Fresco logic usb 3.0 pci card not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vanquishedangel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fresco logic usb 3.0 pci card not working</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I was an early adopter of the usb 3.0 card from fresco logic. This card works flawlessly under Linux so I know the card works. The card is labeled fl1000g and plugs in to a standard pci port and has one usb port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP elite 8200</p>
<p>Windows 7 professional 64bit</p>
<p>Cpu: intel i7 2600</p>
<p>Ram: 12 gigs (upgrading to 32)</p>
<p>Power color ATI Radeon HD 7750</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver windows assigns to it is "PCI standard PCI to PCI bridge (Matrox filtered)" I have tried downloading the drivers from Fresco Logic, searching windows updates, help options, deleting the faulty driver, and much more to no success. I have tried
 many drivers, no matter what I do windows keeps assigning the same wrong driver. The drivers from fresco logic keep saying that "there is no fresco logic usb 3.0 controller found". I am believing that since this card once worked in windows but now does not,
 the device id was removed from windows device or hardware list?! The hardware id is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>PCI\VEN_10B5&amp;DEV_8112&amp;SUBSYS_00000000&amp;REV_AA<br />
PCI\VEN_10B5&amp;DEV_8112&amp;SUBSYS_00000000<br />

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time.</p>

            <p>Sorry to necro-post, but this is the only thread I found to mention this particular fix with Intel Rapid Storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This actually worked! Honestly not sure my Dell ever had the Rapid Storage driver installed in the first place, but installing it fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had the same situation as some others. Upgraded my HDD to a larger one (via cloning software). then Windows kept insisting that my system was not genuine, despite being properly activated. (Even deactivated and successfully reactivated.) And of course, Windows
 Update would constantly insist that the service was not started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried a couple automated FixIt solutions (even an aggressive one), and followed some manual fixing instructions from TechNet. Nothing worked except to install the latest Rapid Storage driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI:<br />
Dell Optiplex 960 with Windows 7 SP1 x64.</p>
<p>On-board storage controller set to RAID (by OEM), but no logical drive defined, only 1 HDD installed.</p>
<p>Upgraded from 160GB to 1TB, both SATA II HDD (not SSD).</p>

<p>Support is the only way to remove the GT email association &nbsp;- Since you have access to the Email you can get the password to the account - Then change the password and you will then have ownership of the account.

<h2>            skype for business versions</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>

<p>Could someone confirm if the Skype For business you can download from Office 365 is the same version as the one you get when you upgrade from Lync 2013 to Skype for Business.</p>
<p>I've heard the one in Office 365 is a cut down on demand version but the version numbers are the same.&nbsp; The only exception is the one that is upgraded from Lync has Part of Microsoft Office Professional Plus 2013 in the about bit.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I also have a setupskypeforbusinessentryretail.x86.en-us file (Skype for business 2016, can I install this on any client or does it have to be licensed for office 2016.</p>
<p>We are on the Education licensing but not E3.</p>
<p>thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Ian,</p>
<p>I’d like to explain the following two points:<br />
1. You can upgrade Lync 2013 to Skype for Business 2015&nbsp;but its version will not be the same as the one downloaded from the portal.
<br />
2. The <strong>setupskypeforbusinessentryretail.x86.en-us</strong> file means Skype for Business 2016, if you want to use it, you need to be assigned the Skype for Business online license.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feel free to let me know.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Sky</p>

<p>Hi Lan,</p>
<p>Generally, in terms of Skype for Business features, the MSI version will be aligned with the click-to-run version.</p>
<p>Currently the up-to-date version is 15.0.4763.1001. If you want to install the MSI version, I suggest you download it from

<p>Thanks,<br />

<p><strong>I’m getting “region” errors</strong><br />
In order to have the best experience on the marketplace, make sure that your account region and physical location match. Your account region was set when you first set up your Gamertag and can be checked by going to
<a href="https://billing.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://billing.microsoft.com</a> and clicking on “Personal Information”.<br />
<br />
If you currently live in one of the newly added LIVE enabled regions, you can perform a one-time
<a href="https://live.xbox.com/BillingMigration/SelectRegion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">region transfer</a> on your account.
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> This region transfer is permanent and irreversible. Please make sure you pick the appropriate region and read all instructions before finalizing this transfer.
<br />
<br />
If your account region no longer matches your physical location and your country is not one of the newly added regions, you would have to create a new account to reflect your location. If you don’t currently live in a
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/live/countries" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LIVE supported region</a> then you may continue to experience issues with purchasing or downloading from the marketplace.<br />
<br />
<strong>I really shouldn’t be getting these errors.</strong> <br />
Are you sure? Positive? 100% certain that you don’t fall into any of the scenarios listed above?<br />
<br />
<strong>Yes!</strong><br />
Alright, please create or find a thread in this forum that describes your specific issue. Please include the following information:<br />
<br />
Account region.<br />

There is a small shiny coin cell battery in your computer.&nbsp; It is almost always the standard 2032 .&nbsp; This battery is recharged by your computer but has a life of about 5 to 8 years.&nbsp; This battery keeps constant power to the memory that contains today’s date
 &amp; time as well as a lot of the features in your system.&nbsp; When it starts to fail, it commonly will start asking you to re-enter the date each time you startup.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
For Notebook PCs it is likely going to be difficult to find the battery and will require a special part,&nbsp;</p>

For Desktop computers, this is an easy change:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Unplug the power to your computer</li><li>
Hold the ON button in for 7 seconds</li><li>
Lay the computer on its side with the side where the wires are, down</li><li>
Remove the side panel</li><li>
Peer in there and you will see a shiny silver battery about 1/2″ in diameter.&nbsp; It looks like a quarter. &nbsp;That’s the battery</li><li>
Go to just about any store and buy a 2032 coin cell battery.&nbsp; They cost less than $5</li><li>
Find a very tiny flat bladed screw driver (like one used for your eyeglasses)</li><li>
Very carefully pry the battery loose.&nbsp; It will pop up so be prepared to catch it.</li><li>
Press the new battery in with the embossed markings on the up-side facing you.</li><li>
Close the side panel</li><li>

Start up the computer</li></ol>

</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Your computer&nbsp;will now need to have the date and time set but only once more — at least for this 5 years.&nbsp; You need to enter the BIOS, which you do by pressing F2 &nbsp;immediately on startup&nbsp;&nbsp;in most systems to get to the place where the date and time is stored.&nbsp;
 Put in current time and date.&nbsp; Close this the way it tells you to save what you did.&nbsp; You may hear more whirring and chugging while some of the stuff is again set up.</p>

<h2>            changing keyboard layout from Administrator account on other account</h2>
                    I have a corporation terminal (computer with Windows 7) and two accounts on it:<br />
1) Administrator<br />
2) User account, which is very restricted<br />
<br />
I need to permanently change default keyboard layout on User account, but Language bar is disabled on this account, so I cannot finish the proces described here: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/258824/en-us (Step 9 for Windows 7 process).<br />
<br />
I have access to Administrator account, but I don't know how to permanently change default keyboard layout for User account from Administrator's account.<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated.<br />

            If the language bar is disabled then this is because there is some policy setting in your domain that prevents users from switching keyboard layouts.

</p><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. I'm glad to have the opportunity to help. I'm sorry to hear about your experience&nbsp;with Surface Pro 3. I understand that your Surface battery&nbsp;is&nbsp;rapidly &nbsp;draining on&nbsp;WiFi (Sleep Mode), and &nbsp;you're unable to run
 it even when connected to the AC Power.&nbsp; Surface turns On for a few, then turns off again. I can only imagine the frustration over this situation. Let see if I can help with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, let me gather some more details on that:</p>
<ol>
<li>When did you first notice that?</li><li>Do you have all updates for Windows and Surface installed?</li><li>Is this a random or pertinent issue?

<p>I am a technical person. I've been in IT my entire adult life and tinkered in my childhood. &nbsp;Honestly, I've done the refresh/reinstalls updates, reboots, this is basically always required and asked. The fact that I have to spend so much time in what let's
 see 2 months with multiple issues is very upsetting. My surface pro 1 had his problems too and that was a dilemma on its own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can go through all 8 of your questions and give you answers, but think about how much time and troubleshooting that would cost me? To disable my wifi but the device to sleep wait 3-5 hours wake it up read the logs?</p>
<p>I don't get paid for this! I have my own job to do.</p>
<p>A brand new device I buy should work and that's it. It was released June 20th when I gotten it and it has had issues since and it isn't only my device, which if it were then I could understand.</p>
<p>According to other posts, they have been returned and results are the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I apologize for this stern response, but it is getting absurd.</p>

            I put the device in airplane mode and put it to sleep at 1038.&nbsp; As you can see at 12:00pm noon it had some errors. I woke it up at 4:29pm.&nbsp; I turned off airplane mode. Wifi worked and there was no major battery loss. So what are these Embedded Controller
 errors all about? I never seen it until i used the Airplane mode?<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3bf60ccf-8c66-4fbc-b709-4dff492eaad6" /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a6465ae-f653-4366-8ea0-a61f9d7fa7ac" />

<h2>            Is there a way to auto-delete old backups in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I just want to confirm that there is no way to automate old backups getting deleted when your backup drive runs out of room.&nbsp;
<div><br />
I just transitioned my mom from a MacBook to an ASUS laptop and am trying to get her all squared away. Time Machine would auto-delete old backups when you ran out of room, and I just want her to be able to plug-in at 7pm on Sundays and not have to worry about
 deleting old backups if she runs out of space.</div>

</span></strong><span><span>thephilbert<strong><span>,</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you create your first backup, Windows Backup will only add new or changed information to your subsequent backups.
<br />
In case of system images, by default, Windows automatically saves as many system images as it has space for without taking up more than 30 percent of space on the backup disk. Once the disk starts running out of room, Windows deletes older system images. You
 can set Windows to retain as many system images as it has space for on the backup disk or to only keep the most recent system image.</span></span></p>

<h3> i kid morbid i  say:</h3>
<h2>            0 Download Speed&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So I bought my Xbox1 last monday. It's the Advanced Warfare edition. &nbsp;I've yet to even download the game or do anything on my console besides log in, which at first I even had trouble with. After configuring my router a bit to be able to sign in and actually
 show a connection to live, it now shows in my diagnostic test that I have a download speed of 0 but my upload, ping, mtu, are all what they should be.</p>

<p>I have a 360 that I've never had issues with, as well as other devices on my network. I get the same results on wifi or wired. After calling xbox multiple times the only thing they tell me is that xbox one requires a faster Internet connection and that nothing
 I change besides my Internet plan will fix it. I refuse to believe that my 360 works fine yet a one will not even load the dashboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My isp plan is 3mbps down and .30mbps up. Yes that sucks but it's worked. I am just wondering what could cause my Xbox one to receive no download speed but have upload just fine? I've tried changing dns to a couple thIngs but I don't know a ton about dns.</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated. I really don't wanot to return this console and not be able to upgrade to xbox one because my Internet speed isn't good enough. It should at least load the dashboard and play games.</p>

            <p>Hey there !</p>
<p>Sorry to hear your Xbox One is showing 0 download speed. It looks like your upload is under our minimum requirements, but I would follow each step on <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/slow-performance-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this article here</a> to see if we can try to get you up and running. Could you provide us the make and model of both your router and modem if the troubleshooter doesn't help? That info will help us attempt to help you get up and running with the speeds you have.</p>

<p>Requirements? If I read right it was "recommended minimum". I've already went through all troubleshooting steps with 2 different people.
</p>
<p>If my speed isn't fast enough to even load pictures on the dashboard, I'd LOVE to find out what the "minimum" is for the 360 and explain to me why someone else on the same speed can play?</p>

<p>I have a gateway (router+modem). It's a Netgear DGN2200V4.</p>
<p>I'd really like a reason as to why my speed isn't fast enough IF that's truly the problem. My thing is I should at least show my download speed coming through to the console at 2-3mbps and then it tell me it's too slow.</p>

<p>How exactly am I suppose to troubleshoot my problem in my network settings if every time I open them it automatically tries updating, and when it fails, I choose check my connection, and it pulls up the networking page, then before I can do anything, tries
 to update all over again. What is the point of having the option to troubleshoot your network when an update fails if it won't let you even do anything??</p>
<p>Microsoft is about to lose me as a customer. I've had my live acount for 10 years now and never planned to buy anything paystation after a PS2. Now however considering a One is not backwards compatible, I have nothing stopping me from just going to a PS4
 for next gen. Microsoft support has been a joke, whether you call 5 times, post on the forums, or chat online with them, all they do is simply go through the same troubleshooting that I have done 10 times on the website.
</p>
<p>I am coming to support because none of that has worked for me, so if all I am going to receive in reply when nothing in the troubleshooting works is a pass off to either my isp or more of the same troubleshooting, then what is the *** point of having a support
 department? My 360 has worked fine for years and when my original red ringed, it was replaced fast and without question. Now I can't even have a support agent tell me accurate information about the system they are trying to support. What a joke.</p>

            <p>I'm truly sorry for any frustration this may have caused. I started with the basic troubleshooting because we don't know which troubleshooting you have already tried unless you tell us. The Xbox One requires a heavier internet load than the Xbox 360 because of the OS. Looking up your gateway, it seems there are known issues when it comes to multiple console support. You can refer to this forum post for more information.</p>
<p>Since your gateway prioritizes ports to the first Xbox console that has been connected, which would be your Xbox 360 console, any Xbox console connected after will experience connection issues and even download speed issues. Let's start with unplugging both your Xbox 360 and your Xbox One consoles from the web as well as powering both Xbox consoles off, and then power cycle your gateway. To power cycle, simply unplug power from the gateway and let it sit for 5 minutes. After the 5 minutes are up, plug in your gateway and only connect your Xbox One to your network. Making sure your Xbox One connects before any other Xbox console is key!</p>
<p>Try that out and let us know if that helps so we can continue to help you get this sorted! :)</p>

<p>Thanks for replying and I apologize for the multiple posts. This is just very aggravating having a brand new system and not being able to play it. I do understand the One is a network hog compared to the 360, but so far all I've been told is that my speed
 isn't fast enough. The thing is though.. I can connect my One to a Wifi hotspot made by my phone which is using 4g speeds (Which is not very fast here). Even at the low speeds of .30Mbps down and up, my One would work just fine on that besides just be slow.
 When connected to my home network I get 0. I am sorry for explaining that again but it seems everyone has had trouble completely understanding what is going on here.</p>
<p>As far as the multiple consoles go, even if my 360 is not on, it will still interfere with my One? If it is not connected to the network while I load up the One, I am not sure how it would be a problem seeing as &nbsp;how the router does not have 2 consoles to
 send information to at the same time. I will try this, but I am doubting it will work.</p>
<p>I am currently trying to use an older gateway I have before I bought my Netgear to see if that would work, and if I can't, I am going to try buying a different brand to test it before trying my ISP. After the router, the ISP shouldn't effect anything on
 your network.</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying! This is definitely an odd issue now, but my next recommendation is to try that older gateway and post back if it helps or if the issue still continues.</p>
<p>To answer your question, having your Xbox 360 off will still affect the connection because the gateway is prioritizing the ports for the first Xbox that is connected to it. The Xbox One and the Xbox 360 share the same ports, so the gateway is always going to be looking for whichever is connected first. The gateway remembers which IP address it assigned the ports to, even if it is off.</p>
<p>I hope that answers your question, please post back and let us know if the older gateway gives you improvements! &nbsp;</p>
