            Audrey, do you sign in to your Surface with a Microsoft account or a local account, and if a Microsoft account, are you using the same one you used when you set up your Surface?

            They are both the same. I am using my phone to log into microsoft to retrieve the key for accessing my computer. And why does it prompt me to do this anyway?

            If your recovery key is not in <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/devices/recoverykey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/devices/recoverykey</a> and you are certain you setup your Surface with the same Microsoft ID you used to login to the recovery key page, I honestly don't know why it isn't listed there. If you initially set up as a local account and then switched to a MS account, I don't believe it would be listed.
<br />
<br />I can't tell you for sure why you are getting prompted for the bitlocker recovery key. 
<br />
<br />What was the last thing you did before the Surface asked for a bitlocker key?

    <title>No Video output after every restart in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> troberts80  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Video output after every restart in Windows 10</h2>
                    I have an HP P621Y desktop computer. &nbsp;I recently upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;It seemed to work fine but every time I restart my computer there is no output from the video card. &nbsp;I'm able to get other PCs to show up on the monitors so I know they are not the
 problem. &nbsp;Oddly enough after several reboots the PC starts displaying on the monitors. &nbsp;Then it says I need to reboot to install updates. &nbsp;When I reboot I go through the same issue. &nbsp;It normally takes me 30-45 minutes of sitting around and rebooting and then
 it just shows up on the monitors again. &nbsp;I've tried to enter the bios and safe mode but nothing shows up on the display. &nbsp;I tried the USB boot, all that did is mess up the computer I created that on. &nbsp;Is there something I'm missing. &nbsp;Any help would be greatly
 appreciated.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with AVG Support, their on-line documentation, and ask in their forums about<br />
any known issues.<br />
<br />
======================================================<br />
<br />
Disk issues can get serious very quickly so I would thoroughly check the drive<br />
now and be sure to keep redundant backups of your important data (use several <br />
methods).<br />
<br />
Inside Windows - Regular or Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot).<br />
<br />
Run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way <br />
out then restart.<br />
<br />

<br />
These are much more efficient methods to check the disk. <strong>&lt;- Advanced <br />
Methods.</strong><br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the Recovery Console (if you have one) or <br />
from a Vista disk - if you do not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friend's <br />
(it needs to be same 32 or 64 bit and they are not copy protected) or make one. <br />
Also your System maker will sell the physical disks cheap since you already <br />
own Windows.<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />

<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi, Ranpc,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sometimes Windows is installed on bad sectors and when sealed off, these&nbsp;cause problems like CHKDSK freezing<span><br />
<br />
</span>Another issue that can cause CHKDSK to stop working is by running programs while CHKDSK is scanning.&nbsp; Ensure all programs are shutdown before beginning a scan.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Finally, If CHKDSK stops when it's halfway done, it could be a sign of total hard drive failure.&nbsp; Be sure to backup all important files on a regular basis.<span><br />
</span><br />
</p>
<p>To complete the scan, follow the directions given by Waseemulla Shariff in this
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-performance/chkdsk-stops-working-at-44-of-stage-five/1c787fa2-a425-4334-a475-2e571c164a5d">

<p><span>Do you get this error as soon as you start your computer or when you open Internet Explorer?</span></p>
<p><span>This might be an issue with a dell application.</span></p>
<p><span>Perform a clean boot to and check which is the program that is causing the issue and try to uninstall and reinstall it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows 7:</span></strong></p>

<h2>            cd drive wont read discs</h2>
                    
<p>This started happening a few months ago where the cd drive wouldn't read my discs every time so i would just eject the disc and try again and after a few tries it would work. Then last week i realized it has been taking longer and longer to read the discs
 and now can take up to 20 minutes. So i decided to buy a new cd-drive and put it in &nbsp;to fix the problem. Today i put it in, but the problem persists. I have the original 20 gb white xbox 360. Any ideas on whats wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If it's happening with all discs, the normal suggestion would be to send it in for repair. However, since you've swapped the drives yourself you void any warranty you may have had and Microsoft won't touch it.</p>

<h2>            HP Officejet Pro 6835 Printer Not Working</h2>
                    <p>My HP Officejet Pro 6835 just stopped printing.</p>
<p>I have Windows 10 installed and the printer has been working for months until now.</p>
<p>The printer has been checked, have done all the diagnostics available for the printer and all is well and it is working and connected to the router as well.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if the Firewall has changed it's settings to keep the PC from sending info to the printer or not and really don't know how to check that.</p>
<p>Any help would greatly be appreciated.</p>

<h3> bradpriddle  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBox 360 Controller Is &#34;Unspecified&#34;</h2>
                    I have been trying to use my Xbox controller as the main source of computer control. It has been working for video game emulator use, but isn't recognized when i try to use
<b>XPadder</b> to map commands for basic mouse and keyboard functions. (Lists Xbox controller as
<i>Unspecified</i>)<br />
<br />
I don't know complete computer specs but here is the info I have:<br />
-Win 7 64bit OS<br />
-Dell Precision M6300 laptop<br />
-Intel duo Core<br />
<br />
Connecting using the plug and play USB cord, which I had assumed was only for charging but it has been working for playing emulated games (as previously stated).<br />
<br />
All drivers up to date, power ring on controller always flashing (all 4 sectors).<br />
<br />
Any information would be helpful, thanks.<br />

<p><strong><em>tried connecting a HDMI cable and the TV response is No Signal </em>
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a common problem. &nbsp; Try some keyboard workarounds.&nbsp; Win+Ctrl+Shift+B (more than once if necessary). &nbsp; Also, the Project dialog can be used&nbsp; to make a change in configuration and that would allow the video system to be refreshed. &nbsp; E.g. if you are currently
 set up as Extend you could try using Win+P, CursorUp, Enter to switch to Duplicate.&nbsp; Alternatively, you could try going down to Second Screen Only.&nbsp; Note that if you do that there would be a prompt about it which you might need to respond to without actually
 seeing it because it is ridiculously short lived.&nbsp; Then waiting briefly and pressing Tab Enter after requesting the change would deal with that.&nbsp; Also note that you could activate Narrator to find out what was going on even if you couldn't see anything at

<h2>            Game restriction</h2>
                    <p>My son has been restricted on Density 2. We can't find out how long this restriction will last or why it has been put in place. No one else in his clan has been restricted. There is no way of contacting Bungie which I find rather odd when we are the paying customer. Does anyone have any advice?</p>

</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to performing a system restore I did the following:</p>
<p>Checked Internet Explorer 11, and was unable to read the Adobe files.</p>
<p>Uninstalled &amp; Reinstalled Adobe Reader. </p>
<p>Performed a sfc/scannow &amp; the result was "no missing or corrupted files"</p>
<p>I frequently use CCleaner to clear files etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing the System Restore prior to the Windows Updates on September 10th, I noticed that the automatic updates downloaded again for update on September 12th. The automatic updates installed on the morning of September 12th &amp; when I checked the
 adobe files in my documents everything was back in order. </p>
<p>I also checked another new one via a website and this was okay as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Why would the Windows Updates NOT install properly or not configure properly within Windows.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I will keep the instructions for future, but this is appears to be a very cumbersome task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Since the MS Answers forum does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, we know absolutely nothing about your system.&nbsp; This makes giving
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
You can create a bootable XP Recovery Console CD (no XP media required) and boot into the XP Recovery Console.<br />
<br />
Chances are pretty good that there is a copy of the NTLDR file on your system in another location so you can replace the missing file.<br />
<br />
The file is supposed to be in the root c:\ folder as c:\ntldr (note there is no file extension for the ntldr file) but of course yours seems to have come up missing.<br />
<br />
If your system came preinstalled with XP there is probably a c:\i386 folder on your system and there should be a copy of the NTLDR file in the c:\i386 folder.<br />
<br />
If you installed Service Pack 3 from an Internet download via the Wide Wide World of Web, there will be a copy of the NTLDR file in this folder:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\servicepackfiles\i386<br />
<br />
Once you get booted to the Recovery Console and have run chkdsk /r, I would see if these commands will work for you to replace the missing file:<br />
<br />
copy c:\i386\ntldr&nbsp;&nbsp; c:\<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
copy c:\windows\servicepackfiles\i386\ntldr &nbsp; c:\<br />
<br />
Here is how to make a bootable XP Recovery Console CD and I would run the chkdsk /r FIRST to be sure your file system is not corrupted.<br />
<br />
<p>Boot into the Windows Recovery Console using a bootable XP installation CD.</p>
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure.</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install the Ask toolbar.<br />
</p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear
 to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>

                    I'm a developer who's bought a reconditioned Samsung NC110 x64 netbook to mess around on. I have upgraded&nbsp;the OS&nbsp;from windows 7 starter edition to windows 10 Home. I have installed VS2015 Community Edition without problems. Why can't I install SQL Server
 2016 Express Edition, especially when the OS prerequisites suggest that Home Edition is allowed?

</p><p>Try uninstalling and reinstalling your Skype application. Also, update your IE version to the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you encounter the same issue, you can download and use the UWP version of Skype for Windows 10 from the Microsoft store.</p>

<p>The situation gets more peculiar. I first took your suggestion to upgrade IE to the latest version. From what I could find there seems to be no way to update IE. Apparently Win10 does it automatically with Windows Update is all I could find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK. So then I went to Control Panel and uninstalled Skype. Then I went to download Skype, but the site told me Skype was already on my computer. Duhh! How is it there when I uninstalled it? So I typed in Skype and a different version of Skype came up and
 ran fine. Bizarre!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose that if MS had tried purposely to make something convoluted they couldn't have done a better job. Makes no sense at all. But at least its working now, and your suggestion to uninstall it seems to have done the trick, though why no reinstall was
 necessary is still puzzling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done a lot of programming, so I know MS doesn't have to put out stuff this shoddy. It's just not that hard to make things intuitive if you really want to. That's my rant against MS. But&nbsp; to the point, I thank you for your suggestion.</p>

<h2>            Win 7 - Shutdown button shows updates to be processed but no updates ever get processed on &#39;power off&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Running latest version of windows 7</p>
<p>Windows update is working correctly in the sense that any updates outstanding are processed and updated correctly.&nbsp; But 3 or 4 weeks ago I noticed the Power off button displaying the exclamation symbol and when I "hovered" on the button it displayed the
 following message - "Installs updates and then shuts down your computer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shut down but no updates were processed.&nbsp; I powered on again and checked manually for any updates but there were none outstanding.&nbsp; I few days later a bunch of updates were processed when I was powered on (all updated successfully), but I still got the
 message on the power off button which indicated updates to be processed when I powered off.&nbsp; When I powered off no updates were processed.&nbsp; Other than an annoying message on the power off button there appears to be nothing wrong with my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In an attempt to remedy the issue I ran the Windows update troubleshooter program from the Microsoft site.&nbsp; It indicated that it found a problem ("service registration is missing or corrupt") and said that it was fixed.&nbsp; However the Power Off button continues
 to indicate that updates will be processed when I power off, but shuts down quickly without any updates ever getting processed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't a big issue for me but just plain annoying.&nbsp; Can anyone help</p>

            Windows update is behaving correctly and does install updates when they become available.&nbsp; The only annoying issue is that ever time I would go to power off the system would tell me that updates would be installed when I powered off.&nbsp; But there were never
 any updates to be processed and the system would power off after a very small delay.&nbsp; So on advice of Microsoft I changed the Windows update settings to "manual" and checked every so often for updates and the issue has been "resolved".

<h2>            Failure to update windows update &#40;for windows 8&#41; and reverting your changes error</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>Above mentioned problem appeared when I tried to update my newly installed w8. Exact message was as statement of my question. No reason was given. How can I rectify this so as to be able to install my updates. I used windows 7 home premium for 2 years
 prior to this and no us problem came up. Hope there is solution.<br />
<br />
This is statement of question I asked last time<br />
I was given 2 solutions:-<br />
1. Use windows update troubleshooter (with detail procedure that I followed).<br />
2. Performing clean boot of windows 8 (I disabled all non-microsoft items from service tabs and disabled all startup program and restarted computer and installed updates. Again after restarting same problem persisted.)<br />
</div>
<div><br />
In short both methods didn't work. Please give some insight. Also what to view or check in event viewer?<br />
<br />
Now for the new batch of solutions? Please, working ones this time around. <br />

            <p>Hi PratikPatil,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you are not able to update the newly installed Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer the questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<div>What is the exact KB number of the update which failed to install?</div>
</li><li>
<div>What is the make and model of the Computer?</div>

</li><li>
<div>Are all the drivers of the hardware devices up to date?</div>
</li><li>
<div>What’s the exact error code/error message that is displayed in Windows Update history?
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please follow the steps given to check for the complete error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In Windows update Window, select View update history.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Here you have list updates failed, right click on any failed update and select view details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now provide the complete error details from the Windows update window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to follow the methods given below and check if it persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disable any third party antivirus software installed in your Windows 8 computer and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note.<b> :</b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't
 disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable
 to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Run a system file checker scan</span></b><span> and check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the following steps to run SFC scan:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Move the mouse pointer to bottom left of the screen where you see preview of start menu and Right-click to bring up a list of Windows settings.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click on ‘Command Prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated command prompt. Note: Click ‘Yes’ if it prompts for permission.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>In the command prompt type in the following command: ‘<b>sfc /scannow’</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.
 Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Method 3:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To fix errors that occur when you use Windows Update, install and run the System Update Readiness Tool. The tool scans for inconsistencies
 on your computer and fixes them as it is being installed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
Let me first say that I was able to install updates based on suggestion given by user on similar question.<br />
Suggestion was that instead of installing all available updates <b>together</b> automatically , I install them
<b>manually, </b>grouping similar updates together.<br />
For e.g. I installed all w8 security updates at one time and restarted computer.<br />
then I installed w8-64x system updates and restarted again<br />
then installed remaining update of .NET security updates and restarted PC again.<br />
They got installed w/o any problem. Though earlier when I tried to install them together I always got error. Those who had similar problems please note this. (Though I have no idea why that happens.)<br />
<br />
Now as reply to questions you have asked of me:-<br />
I am using Dell Studio-15 PP39L model. I am not using any antivirus (<b>Is it absolutely necessary to have one for w8?</b>). I checked my update history, and surprisingly I didn't have any. (Though I failed installing 4 times.) Following are kb codes of updates
 I was trying to install:-<br />
KB2729462<br />
KB2737084<br />
KB2725728<br />
KB2761226<br />
KB2770041<br />
KB2712101<br />
KB2751352<br />
KB2768703<br />
KB2769034<br />
KB2769165<br />
KB2777294<br />
<br />
It would be nice to be able to install all update at once so please revert back. Also if you can give definite answer about my antivirus query that would be nicer.<br />
<br />
Regards <br />

<p>I've figured the problem out but for future reference: This was the first time that I had seen this code but what fixed it for me was logging out of windows and then back in and retrying the install. This resolved the issue!</p>

                    I appear to have two Skype addresses but am unable to access the second address, although others can but&nbsp;when they do it goes nowhere. Meanwhile, the address I think is mine does not allow me to view those who are Skyping me.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>If you sign in to Skype using an email address that is not linked to a Skype account, it will create a new profile due to Microsoft migration and the option to sign in to Skype using Microsoft credential.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, based on your description, it seems that you might've signed in using a different credential which cause for you to missed some call. To rectify this, sign out from the Skype app on your desktop then use the username you usually use to sign in to Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please provide the exact Skype version that is installed on your desktop? So that I can provide you the exact steps on how to sign out.</p>

<p>I'm still seeing two accounts but they both have the same email, 
o********@************l.com. I really need the older Skype I use on my phone. &nbsp;I added the other one on my computer just this last week and it turned out to be different than the one on my phone. &nbsp;Of course they both have the same email address and phone
 number! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to keep the account that I use on my phone. That Skype name is *******************. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try again with that name and see if I can get it.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Account Security Code</h2>
                    Hi, since last month, I received two text message on my cell phone, from the same user/phone number telling me: ''Use * * * * * * * as Microsoft account security code''.<br />
<br />
I believe someone or something is trying to hack into my account? What should I do? How can I prevent such thing to happen in the future?<br />
<br />
Thank you and have a great day!

<h3> malcolmfrost  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost sound</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 10 system has run OK for at least one year, with the sound working.</p>
<p>Some days ago. the sound icon showed a red cross, and the sound had stopped working with the error message: "No audio device is installed".</p>
<p>Using the inbuilt diagnostic, the system corrected the fault.</p>
<p>The next day the sound again stopped working, with the same error message, but the inbuilt diagnostics did not correct the fault.</p>
<p>I understand that Windows 10 updates, sometimes affect devices.</p>
<p>Please advise how I can recover my sound.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />Please try the following procedures:
<br />
<br />1. Check your speaker settings:
<br />Right-click the sound icon at the bottom right corner of your desktop and click Playback devices.
<br />In the Playback tab, ensure there’s a green tick on Speakers. This indicates that your speakers are the default playback device. 
<br />If your Speakers are NOT already set as the default, this is doubtless your problem. To fix, just click them, click Set Default, then click OK and test whether you have sound.
<br />If your Speakers are set as the default playback device, and you’re still not hearing any sound, you should to do this &gt;&gt; click Speakers then Properties &gt;&gt; Go to the Advanced tab, and in the Default Format section, select a different sample rate and bit depth, then click Test. Repeat this process until you find a format that works, then click OK. 
<br />
<br />2, If the step above didn't work, I suggest to Uninstall your audio driver.
<br />On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key  and X (at the same time) to invoke the quick-access menu, then  Click Device Manager.
<br />In Device Manager, expand Sound, video and game controllers,
<br />right-click on your sound card, and click Uninstall.
<br />Restart your computer and check to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />3. If these steps didn't fix the issue, I suggest to Up Date the driver from the manufacture web site.
<br />
<br />Also, You can try the following procedures in the links below:

<br /> 
<br />Please let me know if this helped and works.

<p><span>hey... i´m having an issue when downloading the game NFS MW2012 to my Xbox 360 250GB Slim... i´ve got 175GB of free space in my hard disk, and the game stops downloading at 79%. My internet connection is pretty slow, because i live in Brazil, and here,
 if you have a 20MB download speed, you´re Bill Gates... so i´ve got a medium one, a 10mb. i already tried cleaning the system cache, already tried connecting the console directly to the modem, and still, the download stops at 79%, ould you please help me,
 it´s the first time &nbsp;i´ve ever seen a problem with my xbox... thank you people so much for your help. I created another thread, but i think it´s locked now, because i thought it had something to do with the beta, but it doesn´t. and i´m sure my xbox and account
 regions match, and i already tried deleting the&nbsp;</span><span>marketplace system data file, with no results.<br />
<br />
WHY DO YOU PEOPLE KEEP LOCKING MY THREAD????<br />
YOU JUST LOCK MY THREAD AND THEN TELL ME NOT TO CREATE ANYMORE... OF COURSE I WILL CREATE MORE THREADS... AT LEAST UNTIL THE PROBLEM GETS FIXED. I PAID FOR A GAME AND I WANT TO HAVE THIS GAME... I PAY FOR GOLD AND PAID FOR THE GAME TO, JUST TO RECEIVE THIS
 MEDIOCRE SERVICE... I ALREADY TRIED EVERYTHING... I CALLED MICROSOFT, TRIED TALKING IN THAT **** CHATAND THE GUY JUST SAID HE DIDN´T KNOW WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM... I TRIED TALKING TO YOU NICELY BUT YOU SERVICE IS EXTREMELY BAD... SO I WANT MY GAME AS SOON AS
 POSSIBLE... YOUR JOB IS TO FIX MY PROBLEM... JUST DO YOUR JOB...</span></p>

<p>Actually, he isn't just trying to stall you. If you are part of the beta and are having issues, those issues could very likely be a result of participating in the beta. This means that all issues you have as a participant in the beta
<strong><em>must</em></strong> be dealt with <strong><em>in</em></strong> the beta forums.

            <p>Hey there tavaresjpc!<br /><br />I truly am sorry to hear about the issues downloading games that you paid for. Honestly, if I had a solution that would instantly fix any issues I would give it to you immediately. We genuinely want to help everyone because you're gamers (like us) and if the tables were turned I would want help just the same as you.<br /><br />However, I will be locking this thread and referring you to the <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/beta-2013/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Beta Forums</a> (like others above me have done). As you are part of the Beta program, it is in violation of your NDA to discuss anything like this outside of the Beta Forums.<br /><br />Please refrain from making more threads in the public forums and instead feel encouraged to make a thread in the <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/beta-2013/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Beta Forums</a> where we can give you the help you need.<br /><
        </p>
