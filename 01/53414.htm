    <title>VX-6000 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            VX-6000</h2>
                    <p>I realise that the VX-6000 webcam is somewhat old (I think I bought it to celebrate the birth of Bill), but just the same it's the only one I got and I don't appreciate it that Microsoft seemingly stopped supporting it without bothering to offer a workable
 suggestion for replacement drivers/software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried pretty much all the suggestions I found on the web including removing the driver &amp; rebooting but that only left me without a paddle up the proverbial creek with no way to install a Microsoft driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know others are in the same situation, hopefully someone has found a sensible solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Robert</p>

<h2>            WINDOWS 10 REMAINS A HUGE PROBLEM-EVERYONE HATES IT</h2>
                    <p>Truly, Windows 10 is a piece of Garbage in comparison to XP.&nbsp; NEVER before with a NEW computer have I seen the Slowness, Lockups, "Word is Not Responding", typing slowly while characters are not appearing, all kinds of strange error messages, etc.&nbsp; My new
 EpsonPerfection V600 (had to buy because of Windows 10) software resulted in Word, Excel, and Powerpoint Not Opening.&nbsp; Had to pay MS $150 plus tax to get one of their techs to repeatedly fix SOME of these problems.&nbsp; I think that Microsoft needs to take a Hard
 Look back at XP and Decide If they want to Remain in Business, or Go Down selling such Garbage as Windows 10 and Office 2016.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EVERY Time I open this one 500 page word file it takes at least 30 seconds to open, with the error message "Word is not responding".&nbsp; Then I try to do a search for a word or phrase, and have to wait another 30 seconds while getting "Word is not responding"
 again.&nbsp; This was a 500 page Doc that opened INSTANTLY with XP and MS Office 97.&nbsp; I even converted the doc to docx, BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last time I sought help in diagnosing and fixing the SLOWNESS Problem and the FACT that my Acrobat Reader DC won't work, I got someone who Obviously did not know what they were doing.&nbsp; I downloaded the exe file multiple times and he never could get me

            <p>Along the way, during the almost two months of having a new computer with the latest MS software, Word and Excel files are Terribly Slow in opening.&nbsp; Opening a blank/new file is also Slow.&nbsp; True, one Word doc file is almost 600 pages, but while it used to
 open within 1 second, now it requires 15 seconds.&nbsp; While typing a few characters (and I am a Slow Typist!), quite often those characters don't appear on the monitor and I see the message "Word not responding".&nbsp; So I wait and finally the characters appear.&nbsp;
 Then I save my little additional 100 characters, and again the program hangs up and the message "Word not responding" again appears.&nbsp; In disgust just last night I saved that same document as a docx.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, with that 600 page doc now converted to docx, I have NOTHING GOOD TO REPORT.&nbsp; The file size went from 41 to 20 KB.&nbsp; The LOCK-UPS and SLOWNESS CONTINUE-and this is Disgusting to say theLeast.&nbsp; NOTHING WAS GAINED BY CONVERTING TO the MS docx format.</p>
<p>
I have concluded at least two things from my own experiences: (1) Window XP was a Far Better more Stable and Faster operating system, and (2) The MS designers need to take a hard look at Windows 10 and Office 2016 to determine why XP with Office 97 was so much
 better and faster - and less problematic.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I now have concluded that MS Windows 10 was somehow causing/allowing this "yahoo settings popup".&nbsp; Getting nowhere otherwise, I paid the $150 for MS support.&nbsp; The MS technician was allowed to look into my computer to fix two other issues, and this annoying
 yahoo popup has disappeared.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Because Windows 10 would not support my older Epson Perfection scanner as did XP, I had to buy a new $200 scanner.&nbsp; The first issue happened after loading all recommended software for my new Epson Perfection V600 scanner.&nbsp; The result was that I could no
 longer open Word or Excel.&nbsp; The MS tech made some repairs to resolve that issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><strong>Eight months ago I downloaded Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, but it wouldn't work.&nbsp;
</strong>A built-in Adobe diagnosis claimed that some drivers were missing.&nbsp; <strong>
But now I call for Microsoft Support (what I paid $150 for), and The Philippines Answers, and Nothing Gets Analyzed and Repaired Any Longer.&nbsp; In fact, they ask me to fix it.&nbsp; Just last week came some updates from MS, and now
</strong><strong>Adobe Acrobat Reader DC works.&nbsp; It only required Waiting Eight Bloody Months!!!</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it was noticed that now another popup became the new nuisance: "Your outlook account settings are out of date".&nbsp; I never use Outlook.&nbsp; So the same tech came back, and after looking into my computer, was able to repair that issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All along the way, during the almost two months of having a new computer with the latest MS software, Word and Excel files are
<strong>Terribly Slow in opening</strong>.&nbsp; Opening a blank/new file is also <strong>
Slow</strong>.&nbsp; True, one Word doc file is almost 600 pages, but while it used to open within 1 second using XP, now it requires 30 seconds.&nbsp; While typing a few characters (and I am a Slow Typist!), quite often those characters don't appear on the monitor and
 I see the message "<strong>Word not responding</strong>".&nbsp; So I wait and finally the characters appear.&nbsp; Then I save my little additional 100 characters, and again the program hangs up and the message "<strong>Word not responding</strong>" again appears.&nbsp;
 In disgust I tried saving that same document as a docx, but there was NO improvement in performance.&nbsp; It still is
<strong>horribly slow</strong> to open, then I do a word search, and the thing locks up "<strong>Word not responding</strong>".&nbsp; Then when finally saving, the progress bar at bottom takes at least 30 seconds!!&nbsp; Then if I have lost all patience and try to close
 out Word, it asks "Do you want to save"???&nbsp; <strong>At that point I am using "colorful" language that No One Should Hear!!
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have concluded at least two things from my own experiences: (1) Window <strong>
XP was a Far Better more Stable and Faster</strong> operating system, and (2) The
<strong>MS designers need to take a hard look</strong> at Windows 10 and Office 2016 to
<strong>determine why XP with Office 97 was so much better and faster.</strong>&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I predict that MicroSoft will lose a huge market share over this Windows 10 disaster, as the message boards are full of expressions of disgust, and even great anger.&nbsp; All well-deserved by a Greedy, Inconsiderate company that has Betrayed its Own
 Employees (moved to the Philippines), and has now Established a Horrible Customer Relationship.&nbsp; Folks, now it's All About Money, not a Quality Product, and Not what The Customer Wants/Needs.&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will someone PLEASE offer an XP-Quality OS again, because after Struggling for 10 months, I want to Dump Microsoft!!!&nbsp;

<p>What have you done to confirm the quality of your install which means everything in Windows 10?&nbsp; There is a reason that tech enthusiasts won't even run a Factory or Upgrade install (is this both?) because they'd expect them to have endless issues.&nbsp; You want
 an install like the one compiled here in&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">

Replace the defective drive.&nbsp; Install the OS, your applications, etc and restore from your last known good backup.

I don't know in this particular case.&nbsp; I didn't do that or ask anyone to do that.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I can say that in some cases I have seen when accessing a system with some ATI video cards (and/or perhaps certain driver releases) I have had to use the command line "shutdown -r -t 120" command to make sure that immediately after that I had time to log off
 because if I was still using Remote Desktop when it started to actually restart - the ATI video driver would cause a bluescreen and it would not be possible to remote back into the machine without physical interaction (or some hardware based remote access)
 - which sucked when you were trying to fix something overnight...<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Good question.</p>

Well, if you can repair a hard drive - then you have access to a clean room and all sorts of other things that may be necessary to do so and obtaining a new drive probably wouldn't be a problem for you.&nbsp; ;-)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
If the drive is bad - it's bad.&nbsp; Replacement is the only viable option.&nbsp; Unfortunately a quick search for the drive you mentioned came back with several horror stories about the drive dying and about how common the spindle in Toshiba drives starts giving way
 or a circuit board causes intermittent failures.&nbsp; A normal person (even an exceptional person) is not likely to fix such a drive in any way that they would be able to trust it.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Basically that is a 500GB drive at 5400RPMs, 2.5", SATA 3.0Gb/s...&nbsp; Looks like a replacement for it, non-Toshiba with a 2+ year warranty (new) would cost right about 75 USD shipped from what I can find.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Having said that - if you can back everything up on the drive - you might try and use the
<a href="http://storage.toshiba.com/storage-services-support/warranty-support/software-utilities" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Toshiba utilities</a> to fully test (comprehensive/extended) the drive and maybe check on the
<a href="http://storage.toshiba.com/storage-services-support/warranty-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">warranty of the drive itself</a> (although OEM drives are usually warrantied with the systems.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
A complete format (low-level - also called zero-write or zero-fill) might re-align something *if* this is some internal software (firmware) issue - but the diagnostics will tell you that for sure and would tell you after a zero-fill if the drive reported back
 'okay' or not.

<br />
Well, you will either be attempting the methods I gave (toshiba utilities, low level format, reinstall the OS) and verifying (using the toshiba utilities) that the drive is good or replacing the drive beforehand or selling the system 'as is' - letting the buyer
 know the drive is likely dying.

Still don't see how typing in a command is easier than three clicks to shut down.

<h2>            Windows 10 updates freezing at 87&#37; - Continually fails</h2>
                    <p>Can someone assist me with a step by step resolution to the above problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My&nbsp;Laptop, an&nbsp;HP Pavilion DV6&nbsp;was upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 as part of the free upgrade offer. Since then it has worked fine ironing out a lot of little niggles I had with Windows 7.&nbsp;In the last few weeks Windows 10 has attempted to install updates
 on a number of occasions. Each time the process freezes at 87%. I have held off a re-start&nbsp;for an hour or so, but nothing happens. Each time I have to force a shut down. Following this the restart restores the previous version of Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any one can help I would be very grateful....</p>

</p><p>Thanks for your guidance... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Carried out your instructions. Checked out list of updates and found an HP Printer driver file had failed to download&nbsp;on a number of occasions. Run the fix for this making a note of the error code. Checked this out on line and found that this was caused
 by a second unknown printer&nbsp;showing as installed on Device Manager. Deleted this and all seems OK.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I note that Microsoft have now issued a new release of Windows 10 anniversary edition. Don't know whether to chance installing it yet. Now everything else has settled down.

<p>Hey Ma5terWolfe1,<br />
<br />
What does your NAT say when you load the game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3? I understand that this game has an in-game NAT detection that will tell you if it's Open, Moderate, or Strict.<br />
<br />
Having a moderate/strict NAT will prevent you from finding games with others in some games.<br />
<br />
Let us know :)&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can try to reset all your network connections and even rebooting both modem and wireless router. Given your Xbox and fresh network connection might be the key you need to find matches online. Also, you can try to see other lobby-type games such as Halo,
 Black-Ops, etc. to see if you get the same results.</p>

<p>Hi there Ma5terWolfe1, can you please tell me whether you have recently downloaded the new free-map "Terminal"? If so, did the problems occur after this? Is there any sort of error message that appears when you try to play online?</p>
<p>Personally I would follow R327's advice, on trying to see if other online games allow you to join similar styled 'pre-game lobbies'. Then report back to this thread so you can be further helped.</p>
<p>However, if other online (lobby-like) games work then it might be worth going to MW3 support chat and asking them if there are any problems on their end. (<a href="http://support.activision.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.activision.com</a>)</p>
<p>Also, for future reference, here is the link to the MW3 servers status. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.callofduty.com/mw3/status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.callofduty.com/.../status</a></p>

<p>Hi there Ma5terWolfe1.</p>
<p>After having you follow all of the above advice,. Considering your Nat type is "Open", and all of the other games have the equivalent problems to Modern Warfare 3, not being able to find a game, I suggest calling your internet provider, to send a new router.
 After you have described the problems you are facing, they should then send you a new router, for free (depending on who your internet provider is).

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the <span style="font-weight: bold">Control Panel</span> go to the "<span style="font-weight: bold">General</span>" section, at the bottom you can re-install W8 (Don't need the disk, but will need the serial number but you can get that here: http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/iso
 it's right below the download ISO option.). I had to do the option to remove all of my files and start fresh,. I haven't tried it yet.</p>

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<span>From your description I understand that </span><span>you are receiving error message</span><span>0xc00d1198 ( 0xc00d1126) while signing into a metro app.</span>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the methods mentioned:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run “</span>Windows 8 UI<span> App Troubleshooter” to diagnose the exact issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following link to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>You may also temporarily disable security software and check if the issue persists. Make sure to enable that security software on the computer after checking.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3:</span></b></p>
<p><b>What to do if you have problems with an app</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Follow the steps to run SFC scan.</span></b></p>
<p><span>a)<span> </span>Move the mouse pointer to bottom left of the screen where you see preview of start menu and Right-click to bring up a list of Windows settings.</span></p>
<p><span>b)<span> </span>Click on ‘Command Prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated command prompt. Note: Click ‘Yes’ if it prompts for permission.</span></p>
<p><span>c)<span> </span>In the command prompt type in the following command: ‘sfc /scannow’.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5:</span></b></p>
<p><span>You need at least <b>1024X768 resolution </b>for Metro apps to work.</span></p>
<p><span>Confirm if the issue reproduces with all user accounts. Metro apps <b>aren’t supported if you are running with a built-in administrator account</b> (happens mostly when upgrading).</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Check Screen Resolution:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I):</span></strong><span> Do a right-click on Desktop and select<strong><span>Screen Resolution</span></strong> option to open Screen Resolution window.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>II):</span></strong> You will see the current screen resolution next the Resolution box. If the resolution is lower than 1024 x 768 pixels, you can set a higher resolution, if your PC supports. To change the current resolution, click
 on Resolution box and select a higher resolution.</span></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p><span>Perform a Clean Boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘</span><b><span>Windows + R</span></b><span>’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘</span><b><span>Run</span></b><span>’ windows type ’</span><b><span>MSCONFIG</span></b><span>’ and click ‘</span><b><span>Ok</span></b><span>’.<br />
c) Click the ‘</span><b><span>Boot</span></b><span>’ tab and uncheck ‘</span><b><span>Safe Boot</span></b><span>’ option.<br />
d) On the ‘</span><b><span>General</span></b><span>’ tab, click to select the option ‘</span><b><span>Selective startup</span></b><span>’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.<br />
e) On the ‘</span><b><span>Services</span></b><span>’ tab, click to select the ‘</span><b><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span></b><span>’ check box, and then click ‘</span><b><span>Disable all</span></b><span>’.<br />
f) On the ‘</span><b><span>StartUp’</span></b><span> tab, click ‘</span><b><span>Open Task Manager</span></b><span>’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘</span><b><span>Disable</span></b><span>’.<br />
g) Click ‘</span><b><span>OK</span></b><span>’, and then click </span><b><span>Restart</span></b><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><b><span>Step 2: </span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p><span>a. Follow steps </span><b><span>1a</span></b><span> and </span><b><span>1b</span></b><span> to start the</span><b><span>System Configuration utility</span></b><span>.<br />
b. Click the </span><b><span>Services</span></b><span> tab, and then click to select the</span><b><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span></b><span> check box.<br />
c. Click to select </span><b><span>half of the check boxes in the Service list</span></b><span>.<br />
d. Click </span><b><span>OK</span></b><span>, and then click </span><b><span>Restart</span></b><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><b><span>Step 3: </span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><b><span>Step 4: </span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Enable half of the Startup items </span></b></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either
 step.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><b><span>Step 5: </span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><b><span>Step 6: </span></b></p>
<p><span>Resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the
 problem item.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><b><span>Step 7: </span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a) Press the ‘</span><b><span>Windows + R’</span></b><span> key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’</span><b><span>MSCONFIG</span></b><span>’ and click ‘</span><b><span>Ok</span></b><span>’.<br />
c) On the ‘</span><b><span>General</span></b><span>’ tab, click the ‘</span><b><span>Normal Startup</span></b><span>’ option, and then click ‘</span><b><span>OK</span></b><span>’.<br />

<p>I bought the Bourne legacy on Xbox video&nbsp;last year and now when we try to play it, Xbox just freezes. The loading spiral thing just stops and the buttons on the controller do not work, we waited for 10-20 minutes for something to happen but nothing. The
 only thing we can do is turn off the Xbox and try again with the same result.</p>

Solutions
<div>
<div>
Buying movies or TV shows
<div>
<p>When you buy a movie or TV show, you can download it up to five times. These downloads can be split between your computer and Xbox 360 console by using Xbox Video. After you've downloaded the TV show or movie to your computer, you can sync it with your Windows
 Phone 7 or download it to your console.</p>
<div>
Renting movies
<div>
<p>When you rent a movie through Xbox Video, it's available to you for 14 days. This 14-day countdown starts when you make the purchase. When you start playing the movie, another clock starts ticking: you have a 24-hour period of time during which you can watch
 the movie as many times as you want.</p>
<p>Let's say you rent a movie at 3:00 P.M. on May 1. If you start watching the movie at 8:00 P.M. on May 5, your rental period expires at 8:00 P.M. on May 6.</p>
<p><b>Note&nbsp;</b>Unlike a movie that you buy, a movie that you rent must be viewed on the device it was rented for (Xbox 360, computer, Windows Phone 7.</p>
<div>
How to buy or rent a video
<div>
<ol>
<li>Start the Xbox Video app. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<b>movie store</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>television store</b>. </li><li>If you've selected a movie, click&nbsp;<b>Buy</b>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<b>Rent</b>, and then follow the on-screen instructions.
<p>If you've selected a TV show, click&nbsp;<b>Buy</b>, and then follow the instructions.</p>
</li><li>If you want to buy a season pass to the TV show you've selected, click&nbsp;<b>Season pass</b>, and then follow the rest of the instructions.
</li></ol>
<div>
Streaming and downloading
<div>
<p>When you buy or rent a video from Xbox Video, you may have to decide whether to stream or download it.</p>
<p><b>Stream to watch now</b></p>
<p>Streaming is a great option if you have a fast network and Internet connection and you want to watch the video immediately. Although any Internet connection will support downloading a video, a broadband Internet connection (cable, DSL, or LAN) is recommended
 for Xbox Video, especially if you want to stream videos.</p>
<p>If you don't know if your connection is fast enough for streaming, that's okay—there's a connection test that runs before you stream a video to make sure that streaming is practical for you. Because network speeds can vary with network activity (including
 background downloads), this test is performed each time you stream.</p>
<p>If your network isn't fast enough to stream the video, you'll be notified before you confirm payment. If your network is too slow for HD streaming, you might be able to stream the SD version or simply download the title instead.</p>
<p><b>Downloading to watch later</b></p>
<p>Downloading works well when you have a slower Internet connection, when you want to make sure you get the best possible video quality from start to finish, or when your computer or device will be offline when you watch the video.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether a network is wired or wireless, download speeds vary by region, Internet service provider, and individual network. To optimize your download speed, use a broadband Internet connection and a wired (instead of wireless) connection for
 Xbox Video.</p>
<div>
Watching TV shows or movies
<div>
<p>When you buy a TV show or movie from Xbox Video, you can watch it on an SD TV or monitor, an HD TV or monitor, a computer screen, or a Windows Phone 7. The same choices usually exist when you rent, except that you can only watch the video on the device it
 was rented for (Xbox 360, computer, or Windows Phone 7).</p>
<p><b>Note</b>&nbsp;Several factors affect the resolution of the video, including the image quality of the video itself (HD or SD), the capabilities of the player, the cables that transmit the video signal from the device to the screen, and the capabilities of your
 screen. Most importantly, to watch an HD video in HD quality on an HD TV or monitor, you must play and view the HD video on HD-capable hardware using HD transmission (HDMI, component, or VGA video cables).</p>
<p><b>TV or monitor</b></p>
<p>To watch HD videos in HD quality on an HD TV or monitor, you must play them on HD-capable hardware using HD transmission (using HDMI, component, or VGA video cables).</p>
<p>There are two easy ways to watch an HD video that you've purchased or rented from Xbox Video on a compatible HD TV:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Connected to an Xbox 360 console</b>
<p>Download and play the HD video directly from your Xbox 360 console to your HD TV using an HDMI cable, the Xbox 360 Component HD AV Cable, or the Xbox 360 VGA HD AV Cable. Full 1080p resolution is available only with Xbox 360 and requires a 1080p-capable
 HD TV that is HDCP-enabled, plus an HDMI cable or the Xbox 360 VGA HD AV Cable.</p>
<p>If your home network is fast enough, you can also stream videos. With the Xbox 360 console's HDMI connection or the Xbox 360 VGA HD AV Cable, you can view resolutions of up to 1080p. With the Xbox 360 Component HD AV Cable, you can view resolutions of up
 to 720p or 1080i.</p>
<p>You can also watch SD (480p) videos on most TVs by using one of the following: Xbox 360 Component HD AV Cable, Xbox 360 VGA HD AV Cable, Xbox 360 Composite AV Cable, or Xbox 360 S-Video AV Cable. The cable you must use depends on the AV input on your TV.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><b>Computer screen</b></p>
<p>Buy or rent videos using the Xbox Video software. You can choose the version for viewing on a computer (SD format) or for a supported device (SD or HD format, depending on the title).</p>
<p><b>Windows Phone 7</b></p>
<p>Using the Zune software, buy or rent videos and choose the version for viewing on Windows Phone 7. Download the video, then sync it to your phone.</p>
<div>
Watching free TV shows on Xbox LIVE
<div>
<p>Xbox Video provides you with a great selection of the latest free TV shows in our catalog. You can choose from 100 episodes to watch for free. And they're yours to keep if you want to download them.</p>
<p><b>To re-download free TV shows to your computer</b></p>
<ol>
<li>Start the Xbox Video software and sign in. </li><li>Go to&nbsp;<b>Settings</b>&nbsp;and then&nbsp;<b>Account</b>. </li><li>Go to&nbsp;<b>Purchase History</b>, and then click&nbsp;<b>TV shows</b>&nbsp;to list all the TV shows you've purchased or acquired for free.
</li><li>Click&nbsp;<b>Download</b>&nbsp;next to the TV show you want to re-download. </li></ol>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Microphone goes robotic mid-call</h2>
                    <p>I updated to windows 10 recently and have found that my mic quality drops significantly mid-call now. After a little while it turns incredibly robotic and hard to understand. If I exit and rejoin the call it's instantly fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My soundcard is a Sound Blaster X-Fi Surround 5.1 Pro (current drivers)</p>
<p>Seems to happen in both Skype and Hangouts (although Hangouts is much worse)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't suppose anyone has any ideas before I downgrade again?</p>

<p>we are building large VIdeowall, that will run on Windows 10, but we are not sure what is the maximum desktop resolution for multi display setup. I think it was 32k x 32k (with 128 mil maximum pixel count) in Win 7, but how this case looks in Windows 10?</p>

<h2>            Local Users and Groups stuck in Portuguese</h2>
                    <p>I've loaded a Windows 7 x64 Ent. image to a laptop using SCCM. &nbsp;The option to change languages halfway through imaging process was set in the task sequence. &nbsp;I chose Portuguese (Brazil) as the language but decided to switch back to English US after the imaging
 process was complete. &nbsp;The first thing that I noticed is the local administrator account was
<em>Administrador</em>, not Administrator. &nbsp;Upon further review I notice all the Local Groups (Computer Management &gt; Local Users and Groups) were stuck in Portuguese.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an idea how to change this back or would re-imaging just be faster?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp; understand the importance for you to recover your account, but I regret to inform you that the account cannot be recovered anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were to recover your account, the system will send the code or verification to the primary email address only&nbsp;and since it has already been deleted, it will not be possible to retrieve the code.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that your account is logged in to your mobile phone, you can still use the account if it's currently signed in but if you will receive a prompt to update Skype, it will sign you out and since you cannot reset the password for that account,
 the system will delete it due to inactivity.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You would probably be better off using your Lexmark installation CD..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should be able to get it to work by setting the Compatibility Mode of "SETUP" on the Lexmark installation CD to Win 7 or possibly XP SP2 or 3 depending on how new the model is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>It probably has more features than anything you will download...mine turned out that way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>To find setup on the CD, select Open or Explore instead of just running it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Then right click on SETUP and select Properties...Compatibility Tab is at the top.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Part way down is a Compatibility Mode check box and a drop down option list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>I used XP SP3 with a X5340 and it worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>IMPORTANT...</p>
<p>If you have previously tried to install the printer, REMOVE it from your system in Devices and Printers before uninstalling and reinstalling the software.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 not detecting Nvidia Graphics Card - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 not detecting Nvidia Graphics Card</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Laptop) Specs:</p>
<p>Asus R558UF-XO044T</p>
<p>Intel i5-6200U, Intel HD Graphics + Nvidia GT930M, 8GB RAM.</p>
<p>Windows 10 Home Single Language (Version: 1703; Build: 15063.608)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So a few months ago I switched from Windows 10 to Ubuntu. I wasn't using Nvidia drivers while I was using Ubuntu. So I (fresh) installed Windows 10 tonight (not dual-boot; also ran updates after install) but for some reason my Nvidia card is not showing
 up in the Display Adapters section of Device Manager. And Nvidia Driver installer says "This graphics driver could not find compatible graphics hardware". The last time I used Windows I never encountered this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Relevant Screenshots:</p>

<p>
</p><p>What I've tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>Attempt to install latest Nvidia drivers.</li><li>&nbsp;Attempt to install Nvidia drivers available from Asus' website</li><li>&nbsp;Attempt to install latest Nvidia drivers in safe mode.</li><li>&nbsp;Attempt to install latest Nvidia drivers after "bcdedit /set pciexpress forcedisable" (<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/cannot-detect-my-graphics-card-after-windows-10/78dfbb5d-c9f9-41c3-b314-60d093076aea">Source</a>)</li><li>&nbsp;Attempt to install latest Nvidia drivers after installing (same/most recent available) BIOS.</li></ol>
<p>I've been getting the same error message, so the installation does not proceed any further. I can't think of anything else. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Hi, I'll try to help you with this.

Do you have switchable graphics which was working previously in Windows 10 and also Ubuntu?  Is this enabled in the BIOS or UEFI firmware presently?  That it isn't appearing in Device Manager may mean it's disabled or not being detected.  You may need to reseat the card to get it detected.  

Did you obtain the Nvidia (which often governs switching when installed last, adding controls for this in its software) from the Asus Support Downloads webpage for your precise model or serial number?  Double check again.  You always want the latest one posted so driver disks are often outdated.  

Did Windows Update offer any Nvidia driver?  

Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying. The switchable graphics worked properly the previous time when I installed Windows. I'm fairly certain that (during the previous Windows installation) I installed the latest available Nvidia drivers straight from Nvidia's website. And
 Ubuntu doesn't really have a (proper) mechanism for switchable graphics. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not entirely sure what you mean by "enabled in the BIOS or UEFI firmware", as my laptop's BIOS interface is pretty bare-bone and it doesn't seem to have any settings for the Graphic Card except the Graphic Card memory size which most probably is concerned
 with the Intel shareable graphics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I have tried to install the most recent Nvidia Driver Installer on Asus' support website for my specific model but that too gives me the same error. Also Windows Update (log) does not mention anything about the Nvidia driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try to boot into BIOS again and try to find anything related to the Nvidia Graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:</p>
<p>In the "Graphics Configuration" section in the BIOS there is only one option, DVMT which I'm assuming is for allocating memory for the Intel Shareable graphics. I don't remember it being any different even when the Nvidia Graphics card was running.&nbsp;<br />

<p>So I just reinstalled Windows (Build 1703) after running Diskpart clean, it's using GPT partition of course but the system is still unable to detect the Nvidia graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Nvidia driver installer is still giving me the same error as before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now going to try and install an older Windows 10 (1607) ISO that I have. Let's see if it makes any difference.</p>

    <title>Video Visibility issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phaseseven  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video Visibility issue</h2>
                    <p>Ever since updating Skype to the latest version, I have had issue seeing my friend's video.&nbsp; When clicked out of the Skype window, I can see his video in the mini window.&nbsp; However, when I click&nbsp;<em>into</em> the Skype window, his video no longer appears.&nbsp;
 It is just his profile picture -- no video.&nbsp; But I know he has webcam on because it shows in the mini window (so that's not the issue).&nbsp; I have tried clicking his profile picture or the screen in general to make it to appear, but nothing.&nbsp; Sometimes he is
 forced to turn video off and on again multiple times, which can be annoying to do every time I want to see him on the big screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to toggle his video in the Skype window on?&nbsp; How do I avoid this issue from continuing to happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            Hi  PhaseSeven, 
<br />
<br />The new Skype is a work in progress, it does have bugs and lacks functionality. 
<br />
<br />Until Microsoft resolve this, you should uninstall that version and reinstall the classic version of Skype. Hopefully before support for the Classic version ends, Microsoft may fix these bugs and lack of functionality . .. 
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic, which most users prefer to the new app:

<p>Hi Nancy,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows 10 periodically checks for updates so you don’t have to. When an update is available, it’s automatically downloaded and installed, to keep your device up to date with the latest features. Also, it's created by design that after an update was
 installed it will load the default configuration of Windows. Being said that, you can simply reconfigure or change the display scaling after the update. As for your reference to change the size text in Window 10, we recommend that you follow the steps in this
 article: <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028566/windows-10-change-the-size-of-text" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change the size of text in Windows 10.</a></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please post back if you have other questions.</span></p>

            I tried all you said to do and nothing works. NOTHING. It doesn't increase the text what so ever. I have tried for days and still can't increase the size of the text in the icon boxes on my desktop. It was good for awhile until the Windows update was applied.
 I am fed up with this whole computer thing. UGH

<p>We appreciate the information that you've provided. Since the issue persists, we recommend running<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>DISM<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>and<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>SFC<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>commands in a normal mode. It is a utility in Windows that
 allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and repair missing or corrupted files. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open an elevated <strong>Command</strong> <strong>Prompt</strong>.</li><li>Type the following commands one after another:<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong><br />
<strong>sfc /scannow<br />
Note:<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>It might take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.</li><li>Close Command Prompt, then run the Windows Update again.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once done and the issue is still the same, we recommend that you create a local user or administrator account in Windows. This will help us check if your user profile is corrupted. Follow the steps provided in this article:<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create

            The&nbsp;<span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span><br />
<span>sfc /scannow didn't work so we tried setting a new microsoft account. It said that it was not possible as the problem was on your end. I don't know about all this. My husband, my son and I all tried
 it. We all got the same message. We all followed your instructions to the tee. Still not working. Am disgusted with everything.&nbsp;</span>

            I have a webpage that can't be published because of Windows 10 they say. What am I suppose to do? Get a new computer? For two cents I would get an Apple so I don't have to deal with all the problems of Windows from the downloads to the updates to the program
 itself.&nbsp;
