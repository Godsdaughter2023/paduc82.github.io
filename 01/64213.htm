            Hi catboco
<br />This is Vijay, an Independent advisor. Try following one by one and check after each
<br />
<br />A. Reset - Try to reset your Onedrive (Please note that no data will be lost because of below step) 
<br />
<br />Windows Key+R &gt; Copy the below and paste and Enter
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset
<br />
<br />After few minutes start Onedrive again. if this doesn't appear, copy the below and paste into Run and Enter
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe
<br />
<br />B. Unlink - If reset doesn't work -Right click on your Onedrive &gt; Settings &gt; Unlink this PC 
<br />Wait for few minutes 
<br />Link it again and then synch. 
<br />(This will synch all files again, hence will take time)
<br />
<br />C. Reinstall - If even Unlink doesn't work - Uninstall Onedrive and install latest version -
<br /> 
<br />Let's try to completely uninstall OneDrive: 
<br />
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin). 
<br />
<br />Copy the below line, paste into Powershell and Enter 
<br />taskkill /f /im OneDrive.exe
<br />This will terminate any OneDrive processe 
<br />
<br />Copy the below, paste into Powershell and Enter  
<br />
<br />if you’re using 32-bit Windows 10
<br />%SystemRoot%\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall
<br />if you’re using 64-bit Windows 10
<br />%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall
<br />
<br />(Note - It is recommended that you create a backup of your registry before modifying registry as suggested below so that if you commit some mistake, you will be able to restore - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756...</a>)
<br />
<br />Now Windows Key+R &gt; Type Regedit and Enter
<br />Go to this path
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive 
<br />You can remove all folders that include OneDrive numeric version (example - 18.172.0826.0010 folder)
<br />and from the Accounts folder, remove all the folders inside 
<br />
<br />After that restart computer and install One Drive latest version from this link: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=860984</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi,  catboco
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to uninstall OneDrive and go back when you install it, it might be corrupt
<br />
<br />1. Open Command Prompt in Administrator mode: Right-click on the Windows icon in the taskbar and select Command Prompt (Admin). 
<br />2. Type in taskkill /f /im OneDrive.exe to terminate any OneDrive processes and hit Enter. 
<br />Then type in either %SystemRoot%\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 32-bit Windows 10 or %SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall if you’re using 64-bit Windows 10 and hit Enter. 
<br />
<br />After that restart the pc and install One Drive latest version from this link:

                    <p>I was playing gta online yesterday and a message at the bottom of the screen said "xbox live just sent you a message". &nbsp;I went to the xbox live message center to check but there were no new messages. &nbsp;I assumed it was a message for my mystery gift for completing the december xbox quest challenge that I have yet to receive. &nbsp;If this is true, can you send the message again or send it to my email?</p>

    <title>Why does Windows 10 Photos App duplicate photos from OneDrive and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr. zarian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Windows 10 Photos App duplicate photos from OneDrive and iCloud Photos&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I need some help with this confusing problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried various sites for suggestions&nbsp;and couldn't find an reason or answer to my problem. So I've decided to ask the Microsoft Community about this issue..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive is setup by default on my Windows 10 laptop, and I also have the OneDrive app on my iPhone 6 to backup photos, I use iCloud aswell. When syncing my photos from OneDrive to the Photos App on Windows 10, everything&nbsp;flows smooth since my photos are
 in OneDrive but for iCloud they sync the same photos to the photos app aswell, but their duplicates now.&nbsp;Their the same photo but with different names like,
<strong>20170113_223726060_iOS.jpg</strong> and the other is <strong>IMG_3999.JPG</strong>. Is there anyway to merge the same two&nbsp;photos just to one photo? or I have to delete something else? I don't want to uninstall an program or anything but would like to
 know what's the best way to organize my photos in the Photos App in Windows 10 using either iCloud or OneDrive in one folder. I would also&nbsp;like to save space by deleting the duplicated photos aswell without them appearing back.</p>

            <p>Hi Zarina, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With regard to your concern, merging photos from two cloud storage apps is a feature that is not available for the Photos app. We suggest that you unlink one of the storage app to avoid getting duplicate photos.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like this feature added, please use the Windows Feedback hub to send a feature request.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance. </p>

<p>Last night I deleted&nbsp;2100 duplicates but they are back again.&nbsp; So.. I have windows 10 and iPhone 6S.&nbsp; I&nbsp;think I understand&nbsp;from your message&nbsp;&nbsp;that&nbsp;One Drive is automatic on my PC and it stores photos in the cloud.&nbsp; If I understand correctly, duplicates are
 appearing because I must be saving them in icloud as well.&nbsp; Back up in one place&nbsp;would be&nbsp;fine with me.&nbsp;
<strong>How do I know if I have icloud and how do I delete it?&nbsp; </strong>Thank you</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply but I am sorry I do not agree. I strongly object to windows determining whether I can install software. By all means give me a warning but I should have the right to override that warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the first problem I have had with windows 10. I was unable to install Office 365 despite trying every work around I could find. Microsoft need to get their act or they will lose customers. If I was braver I would switch to Linux.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have raised a case with D-Link but I am not confident of a good outcome.</p>

            Unfortunately Microsoft disagrees.&nbsp; They are preventing unsigned drivers in win 10.&nbsp; The problem originates with D-Link releasing unsigned drivers.&nbsp; All other mfrs managed to get theirs signed but users of D-Link routers, camera's etc are suffering.&nbsp; Good
 Luck

<h3> shawnbryson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Legacy Cakewalk installer failes with Direct X versions higher than 8.1 installed - Fixaction Windows 32&#92;64 bit OS - 8.1, 8, 7, 7SP1, XP XPSP3</h2>
                    <p>Hope this helps anyone that can't install legacy Roland\Cakewalk products because of Direct X 8.1 installer issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reported this inability to install Cakewalk application build on Direct X 8.1&nbsp;for years.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I was always told that the Microsoft direct X or the OS was the cause of the issue.
</em></li><li><em>The below music products by Roland's\Cakewalk...now Gibson\Cakewalk.&nbsp;</em></li><li><em>Have been affected since 2004\2005 </em></li></ul>
<p>All affected products below were finally reported to not be Microsoft OS, version&nbsp;compatibility or Microsoft DirectX updates however, another&nbsp;Roland driver installer issue with a product everyone loves...but they would not support the update development
 with newer OS versions.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><em>While, I know these, apps are&nbsp;now 13+ years old, however&nbsp;most legacy Roland equipment driver's\software that can not be&nbsp;installed with Microsoft compatibility mode.</em></li><li><em>Is left with Installing XP mode which is does not support Virtual\XP mode USB port play\device driver connections.&nbsp;</em></li></ul>
<p><em>Some of Us&nbsp;still have to&nbsp;use these legacy software's just...so&nbsp;legacy Roland's&nbsp;MIDI instrument's, can work with Microsoft's newer OS's.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Think about copyright for electronic music, you might have created with legacy instrument's.</li><li>If you could still use it you can prove the validity of you copyright if&nbsp;it happens&nbsp;that someone&nbsp;report's&nbsp;a clam on social media sites like Youtube, where they are the owner\creator.</li><li>I have music hardware 20+&nbsp;that&nbsp;work's perfect, looks great&nbsp;and has no issues,&nbsp;other than&nbsp;the ability to use it on newer Microsoft OS product suites. Because of Driver installer issue like the one reported here</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Reported DirectX 9 Installation Problems:</strong><em> 2004\2005</em></p>
<p>https://www.cakewalk.com/Support/Knowledge-Base/2007013224/DirectX-9-Installation-Problems</p>
<ul>
<li><em>I found Direct X&nbsp;v10 &amp; 11 both had same install issue, reported updated in 2011</em></li></ul>
<p><strong>Fix:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;http://static.cakewalk.com/support/knowledge-base/files/DirectXUtility.zip</p>
<ul>
<li>I have added this, here because Microsoft supported XP for 12+ years, &amp; 2000 for almost 14+.
</li><li>Plus this article, I found during the early win 7 update day's was not easy to locate, on the cakewalk site these day's.</li></ul>

                    <p>I'm developing a smartcard readers and i use the windows driver "WudfUsbccidDrv.dll"</p>
<p>I test the machine on an updated windows 7 and 10 (both 64 bit)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The level of transmission between PC and Reader is "Short APDU"</p>
<p>When i send T=0 apdu it work well but when i send an T=1 apdu sometimes PCSC return an empty array</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no&nbsp; error in event viewer</p>

<p>This ^^^^^^^^^RAPDU is not available in PCSC</p>
<p>Next T=1 apdu works but the card just send status words</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit : I tested, RAPDU bigger than 3 bytes it make PCSC return an empty array of data but no error is returned</p>
<p>So i can only return one data and the status word(2byte)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 2: I tryed with TPDU level exchange but the WudfUsbccidDrv driver reject the RAPDU with this error

<h2>            Running Windows 10 Inspiron 11, Store will not launch.</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron 11 3000 series and I just got it and I attempt to open the Store to download apps, the app pop ups and then says, we have stumbled upon some trouble and closes. I have been trying to make it work and even have recovered the computer.
 I have also looked into trying to correct it through the administrative powershell. Either I did it incorrectly or I may not be even looking in the correct area. So how do I correct my system and launch the Store?

<p>
</p><p>1) Have you turned on Wi-Fi in the phone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, disable Wi-Fi connectivity and then turn on cellular data.</p>

 in any problem situation.</span></span></p>

<p>I'm running Windows 7 on an Acer Aspire One. &nbsp;I've ripped a number of CDs and want to edit the album titles and artists' names, but when I right click on them, the edit command is grayed out. &nbsp;There are no error messages. &nbsp;I am also unable to drag items
 to playlists - when I drag, the icon has a small red circle with a diagonal line across it attached to it's bottom right corner. &nbsp;I have tried editing items on items in the computer and on an SD card with the same result. &nbsp;Help, please.</p>

            <p>Found the split screen feature woohoo :)</p>
<p>To split the screen, swipe from the top of the screen like if you want to close an app in win 8 or 8.1 and when your finger's around halfway through the screen, move it to the left (or right). You should see that it splits just like a normal win 10 desktop,
 but i haven't found any way to split it in quarters like the normal desktop</p>
<p>Also, i can't split the screen into thirds like what 8.1 could.. it would be awesome if microsoft re-add that feature</p>

<p>My son cannot use Forge in Halo 5 Guardians and this mode is by far his favorite in previous titles.</p>
<p>Since we downloaded the update in December that gave us Forge Mode, this is the error that he receives when trying to access it.</p>
<p>"Attention- A fireteam member's online safety settings do not allow them to view this content."</p>
<p>First, he is NOT in a fireteam to begin with. Second, I have gone over and over his safety settings trying to find what may be blocking this content access and I can not find anything to change that would allow him access...&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my account I have full access without any problems... Also, the account he plays on is registered to me with my birthday so it is listed as an adult account and not a childs.</p>
<p><span>Also, This profile that i am using to post this is the account that he uses to play xbox.. my account is LINKINx6369.</span></p>
<p>I have already deleted the game and redownloaded it as well.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help if any.</p>

<h2>            Updates failed in Windows 7--KB954430 and KB973688</h2>
                    The two updates try to install every time I start the computer, and they always fail.&nbsp; I have tried the following suggestions from other postings:<br />
<br />
1. Ran the "Fix It" to reset Windows Upate in both normal and agressive mode<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;Downloaded KB973688 to the desktop and ran using the administrator account.<br />
<br />
The last step always leads to "an error occured during the installation of assembly component {7B2B4EA5-1028-B7E6-A06B-D6B9ABF34537},<br />

            In a world dominated by the "Blind Leading the Blind" and "Forum Gadflies", the answer I found here was correct plus some tweaks that worked for me.<br />
<br />
Manually downloaded KB954430 &amp; KB973688&nbsp; (Both appeared in the "Add or Remove Programs" but were not recognized as installed from a previous attempt to download and install them using&nbsp;Microsoft Update)<br />
<br />
Using Add or Remove, I removed KB954430.<br />
<br />
Renamed installed MSXML4.DLL&nbsp;"OLD" and ran KB954430 - Msxml4 Version 4.20.9870.0 was installed.<br />
<br />
Using Add or Remove, I removed KB973788.<br />
<br />
Renamed MSXML4.DLL version 4.20.9870.0&nbsp;"OLD2" and ran KB973788 - Msxml4 Version 4.20.9876.0 was installed.<br />
<br />
Deleted the "OLD" versions -&nbsp;Microsoft Update no longer showed these two "Fixes" as needing to be installed.<br />
<br />
I am back computing and waiting for the next&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">irritation</span></strong> from MS...<br />
<br />
...hope this helps - again - it worked for me. &nbsp;OS: XP Pro, IE 8 and Office 2007.<br />

I've been reading many threads about Skype for Desktop and how Skype Classic is being retired in favor of Skype 8. Many users of Skype are obviously very unhappy with the fact that Skype classic is being retired. There are many reasons for this. Some simply
 aren't happy with the layout of Skype 8. Some need or want compact view, which Skype 8 doesn't have. Other features are either missing or broken.<br />
<br />
Time and time again, I see the same responses when users express their dislike for the new Skype. "We'll forward your feedback to the developer team." "We're aware that this feature hasn't been added. We hope to have it added soon." "Your feedback helps." Even
 after users have been expressing their disgust and concerns about this so-called best version of Skype for months, the Skype team are bent on forcing everyone to upgrade to it anyway, pushing something on users when they've made it clear they don't want it.
 There was even a response a few months ago that said that most people prefer the classic version over the new one.<br />
<br />
I think part of the problem is a serious disconnect when it comes to users and developers. Developers obviously can't read every single bit of feedback that comes in through the moderators or the feedback app, and I'm sure a lot gets lost when it's full of
 rather destructive criticism. I also imagine the team probably has this huge plan that they have outlined, and no matter how loud users get, it's going through because the developers are already in too deep to go back now. Writing software like this isn't
 cheap. Users are probably extremely frustrated because they don't understand why things are changing so drastically when they were working fine before, and being forced to use something you don't want to use is pretty irritating. So here's what I suggest:<br />
<br />
First, I think we, the users, need more information about why certain things are being done. Ignorance breeds fear and hatred, and none of that helps anyone. For one thing, we need to know why it's necessary to entirely overhaul Skype's interface to the point
 where it looks and feels nothing like the Skype we've known and loved. We need to know why it needs to be an Electron app instead of a normal desktop app that we've used for years. We need to know why something that's obviously feature incomplete and inferior
 is being pushed, and why something that works fine is being dropped.<br />
<br />
Second, developers should maybe stop pushing this mobile/tablet experience on desktop users. I get that the Skype team wants everyone to have the same experience, or at least as close to the same experience as possible on every device without having to maintain
 separate large bits of code. There's also the whole cloud based thing. Electron apps seem to be the answer to that issue. However, not everyone who uses a desktop wants the same experience people get on a tablet or phone. It's probably safe to assume that
 in most cases, people who use a desktop or even a laptop want a normal PC experience. If they want a tablet or phone experience, they'll use a tablet or phone. One size doesn't really fit all in this instance.<br />
<br />
Third, the team seriously should cease the false advertizing. Skype 8 and even Skype for Windows 10 are advertized as having the same look and feel and having all the features we love. Anyone with half a brain can plainly see that this isn't the case. It's
 not the same, and anyone who says it's the same is likely lying to you to make you feel better about upgrading. That's marketing for you, I suppose. It just isn't smart marketing, because in the end you just end up insulting the intelligence of your user base.
 Not all of us are sheep who blindly install whatever we're told to use and just deal with whatever happens.<br />
<br />
Lastly, users should really think about the language they use when submitting feedback. I've seem some pretty harsh criticism here. A lot of it is directed at the moderators. I realize that it's frustrating to get the same responses over and over, but I'm pretty
 certain that this is what the moderators are trained to say. Someone can correct me if i'm wrong. Having skype turned inside out is frustrating, but that doesn't give anyone the right to be a jerk. Being a jerk is probably just going to result in feedback
 not being read. We also have to remember that whether we're speaking to developers or moderators, they're people too.<br />
<br />
All that said, let's discuss it. I'd love to hear from users, moderators, and even developers if at all possible. Let's fix this so we can all help make Skype be the best it can be.<br />

<p>I think that is one of the most frustrating thing for most of us is the lack of replies from MS on this.&nbsp; &nbsp; Maybe it is because they have their people scattered and no one knows if MS is listening anywhere.&nbsp; &nbsp;For some reason they have us posting on TWITTER
 (WTF? this would be a better place for an emotionally compromised teenage girl to post- OMG Becky's not even hot!), here, in our skype, through agents etc.&nbsp; &nbsp; Perhaps if MS had ONE place and even ONE thread where they said post here it wouldn't seem like MS
 never wants any feedback and often responded.&nbsp; &nbsp;It only compounds the issue of them ignoring us when they created the atrocity that is the new skype.&nbsp; &nbsp;It would like Verizon telling me that they were discontinuing support on the Samsung Galaxy and insisted
 I switch over to a couple of dixie cups with some string in between and called it an upgrade.</p>

<p>Skype was simply perfect before Microsoft.</p>
Any attempt to improve something perfect can lead to very disappointing results… this is the story of an historical product used by million of users (me too) and now abandoned for using WhatsApp and other IM software.<br />
Skype Android don't notify new chat on Android.<br />
Skype don't assure you can user automatic systems because they are present dtmf problems.<br />
Skype losts a lot of contacts in the past confusing them with Outlook contacts (months of work to restore the contact list).<br />
Skype give less options to control how behave in many circumnstance.<br />
Skype Occupy 50% of screen.<br />
Skype have problems when sharing my desktop to other users (black screeen).<br />
Skype voice quality for calls have some lags.<br />
Skype make unusable all skype phones after the new login system unified with Microsoft accounts.<br />
Skype is terrifyingly.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand your concern. I will do my best to fix the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try simple steps and check if this helps. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Open the photo folder location, right click on the photo and select Copy from the drop down.
</p>
</li><li>Now go to the folder location where you wanted to paste the photo, right click on the on the blank space and Select paste from the drop down.
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Hop this helps let us know the result. </p>

            <p>Billion,</p>
<p>This works in File Manager on the desktop, but not in the Microsoft Photos app. &nbsp;In the app you get the copy option when you right click the photo but after you click copy and then leave that folder for the one you where you want to move the photo, there
 is no paste option. &nbsp;In fact, when you right click the blank space in the folder, you do not get a drop down menu of any kind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could do as you suggest in Windows 8 and it worked, but since I downloaded Windows 10, it no longer works.</p>
