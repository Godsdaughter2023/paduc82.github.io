<h2>            Cannot conect to Internet AT ALL</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Have had no problems for months, but after a lockup and reboot I cannot connect to the Internet at all.&nbsp; I am using a cable modem with a Linksys router.&nbsp; Two other PCs on the router have NO trouble connecting so it is NOT a modem or router problem.&nbsp; I am
 set for autodetec IP and my currenh IP is 169.254.88.3 so I know it is a poroblem with TCP/IP or DHCS on my PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Vista SP 2.</p>
<p>I tried</p>
<p>netsh winsock reset catalog <br />
<br />
and tried resetting the TCP/IP Stack with&nbsp;</p>
<p>netsh int <a href="http://ask-leo.com/comments_003090.php?page=3#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>ip</span></span></a> reset
<span><span>ip</span></span></a> reset
 resetlog.txt</p>
<p>but nothing worked and no logfile (resetlog.txt)&nbsp;was created.&nbsp; I tried reseting the DHCP service with no luck.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

Hi<br />
<br />
Part of a Wireless Cable/DSL Router is a DHCP Server.<br />
<br />
The server assigns IP address to the Network computers that are configured to Auto Obtain IP address.<br />
<br />
If for some reason the computer cannot connect to the Router, it cannot obtain an IP and Windows assign a default IP 169.xxx.xxxx.xxx. This IP is Not functional IP for regular internet and network purpose.<br />
<br />
What to look for.<br />
<br />
Make sure that there is a good cable between the computer and the Router, and that the cable is plugged well all the way in.<br />
<br />
---------------------------<br />
<br />
Make sure that the computer has a valid Network card and the TCP/IP is configured correctly.<br />
<br />
Check the Device Manager for valid Wire card entry.<br />
<br />
http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg<br />
<br />
If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wire card's Drivers.<br />
<br />
Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Local Area Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.<br />
<br />
http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg<br />
<br />
Log to the Router's menu from a working computer and make sure that the DHCP is On and it is configured to assign IPs that can cover the number of computer that are connected (few more will be even better).<br />
<br />
If you made any changes, Switch Off the computers and the Router, Reboot the Router, and the computers.<br />
<br />
Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.<br />
<br />
<strong>-----------------------------</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>Software Firewall application that is Not configured to allow local traffic (between the computer and the Router is a possible issue too.<br />
some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd party software is
 uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is On .</strong><br />

<p>Hi<br />
<br />
It is Not a "blame game" you do not have to do anything in order to things to change.<br />
<br />
Many of us do not realize that Computers are Dynamic machines (you know one day in the future day they suppose to take over the World from us) (^_^) - (*_*).<br />
<br />
Changes occur even more with Broadband Internet connection. The interaction with the Internet is fast, sites that we visit deposit Codes and Scripts that that end up on our system and affecting it whether we like it or not.<br />
I.e., during the passage of time something was changed in the Network related software, or and its configuration,&nbsp; re-installing solved the problem. \(^_^)/<br />
<br />
&nbsp;So check the system as mention above and find out the braking point.</p>
<p>You think it is too much. No shame, head up to your shopping center computer repair store.</p>

<p>It is foolish to check my network card and cable.&nbsp; Yet just because I know people will say "do it anyway" I switched cables and looked at the Device Manager.&nbsp; Card is fine, cable did not help.&nbsp; I checked my settings, they are fine.&nbsp; I did all of the obvious
 things&nbsp; before I posted here.</p>
<p>I need a more subtle solution.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Yeah, I feel for you, it is a common issue, people get upset because they get suggestions to do what they already did.</p>
<p>In my defense I have a personal problem, I lost my X-ray capacity to see through the Internet what other people know and what they already did.</p>
<p>Since I am an adventurer guy, I will take the risk to add something that you probably know, and hope that you are not getting offeded.</p>
<p>Try to assign a static IP that is out of the Router's DHCP to the computer. Use for DNS gateway etc. you Router's core IP.</p>
<p>TCP/IP and its variables typically look like this.</p>
<p>Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.</p>
<p>Typical TCP/IP status looks like this.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/status-nic.jpg</a></p>
<p>Description is the card manufacturing data.</p>
<p>Physical address is the card's MAC number.</p>
<p>The xx should be a number from 0 to 255 (all xx same number).</p>
<p>yy should be from 0 to 255</p>
<p>zz should be from 0 to 255 (all zz the same number.</p>
<p>The lease date should be valid to the current time.</p>
<p>*Note 1. IP that starts with 169.xxx.xxx.xxx is not valid functional IP.</p>
<p>*Note 2. There might be an IPv6 entries too. However, they are not functional for Internet traffic or LAN. They are needed for Win 7 special HomeGroup configuration.</p>

<p>Tried Safemode with networking, had nothing runnng, even disabled the Windows Firewall (have no 3rd part Firewall) and still could not connect.</p>
<p>Only error messages I get are "could not connect" messages.&nbsp; My network sharing center has my connection listed as unidentified network, local only.&nbsp; It is labelled as a public network, and if I try to change it to a private network it always reverts back
 to public.&nbsp; Is that a problem?</p>

I undertand.&nbsp; I had hoped that the technical detail in my original post would get people to think I already tried the obvious, but I can see how that would not work.&nbsp; I prefer figuring things out myself so before posting here I scoured the net for any suggestions,
 tried them all, and when nothing worked finally asked for help here.&nbsp; As you said, the frustration got to me.

<p><span>Hi darkdemon923,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers!</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> In spite of disabling
 the hardware acceleration, <strong>move the Hardware Acceleration notch to none</strong>
<strong>(the Basic acceleration setting</strong>) and check if the issue is resolved, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start, type Display Settings in the Start Search box, and then click Display Settings in the Programs list.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Settings tab, and then click Advanced.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Troubleshooting tab, and then move the Hardware Acceleration slider notch to none (the Basic acceleration setting).</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click OK, and then click Close.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you are prompted to restart the computer, click yes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists,
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Update the graphic card driver and check
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Go to your graphic card (video card) manufacturer's website and download the newest driver.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively,</span></p>
<p><span>Check the link to manually re-install the drivers
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The next best step (after the driver update) is to go to the makers of the software you are installing and see if they have recommended
 steps to make the <strong>software work if you can't disable the acceleration.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>If you disable your hardware acceleration, you may experience considerable performance degradation.</span></p>

    <title>USB devices do not work on Windows 7. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thetahna  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB devices do not work on Windows 7.</h2>
                    <p>I did a clean installation of Win7 a month ago, and everything went fine and was perfectly functional. Then one day, with no warning, two of my USB devices decide not to work. One of them has a little blinking light which indicates activity, and it reacts
 like it should, so I doubt the problem is with the devices themselves or the cables (considering that the two started malfunctioning at the same time, with different devices and different cables). The closest thing I can think of that could have anything to
 do with the problem was uninstalling my old graphics card drivers and switching to a new one, and even that seems so unbelievably far-fetched, it's not even funny. I've yet to find anything I could use to test if the computer's actually receiving the signal.
 All (and I do mean ALL) USB drivers have been uninstalled and reinstalled, I've tried different ports and even system restore didn't affect the problem. I'm completely stumped, and wouldn't want to do another clean install before asking for help, since I just
 got my computer the way I like it.</p>
<p>Any help and ideas will be more than appreciated.<br />

            <p><span>Hi TheTahna,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p><span>Apart from the issue, how are you doing today?</span></p>
<p><span>You have an issue with the USB devices not working on the computer.
</span><span>This can be really frustrating for you and I appreciate the efforts that you have put in. Let us work together as a team and try to get this issue fixed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us start with few questions-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What exactly happens when you connect the USB device?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error message or error code?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do the USB devices work on a different computer (running the same Operating System)?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model number of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>I would like more information regarding the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>You can simply try unplugging the power from the computer (after switching the computer off) and then plug it back in
 after sometime. This has worked for many community users. Hopefully, you find it helpful as well.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1-</span></p>
<p><span>You could try connecting the USB device to different USB ports and vice versa. Sometimes, the USB
 ports themselves might be faulty.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2-</span></p>
<p><span>I would have you run the fixits –</span></p>
<p><b><span>Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows</span></b></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Method 3-</span></p>
<p><span>I would have you install the latest Windows Updates.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the steps-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<b>Start </b>button, type <b>Windows Update</b> in the Search box, then click <b>
Windows Update</b> in the results pane.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click

<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the check box next to the updates, and then click
<b>Install updates</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If prompted, review the license agreement, and then click
<b>I Accept</b>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Follow the onscreen instructions to download and install the updates.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If prompted, reboot your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 4-</span></p>
<p><span>I would have you download and install the latest Chipset (for the motherboard) as well the USB drivers
 from the manufacturer’s website. You can ask the manufacturer for assistance as well.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Installing the chipset drivers are to be performed at your own risk. And also, make sure you
 install the chipset drivers and then the USB drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be happy to help. We, at Microsoft strive towards excellence.</span></p>

    <title>Skype Accounts all mixed up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joanna_m_01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Accounts all mixed up</h2>
                    <p>Years ago, I set up my skype account. It has been logged into my tablet on that account for years with no problems. Then I decided to download skype onto my phone. However, I can't remember my password. So I am unable to sign in. It lets me try and use my
 Microsoft account - but when I sign in with this, it sets up a whole new skype account. I realised that my skype account was linked to my old email address. On my tablet - which Skype signs in on fine, I set it up to link with my gmail account - the same one
 that my Microsoft account is linked to. It now shows on the tablet as being linked. I then did a password reset. However, this just seems to have changed my Microsoft account password, and not my skype password. I still can't sign into my Skype account on
 any other device. If I try to sign in with my microsoft account, it still takes me to the other Skype account and not my actual one I have used for years. Can anyone help with how to sort this out?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to find a customer support email or phone number - but this was the only option I had. So I have posted here in the hope that someone in this community may know more than me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can link your email to old Skype account however, you cannot use it to reset the password for the old Skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need to do is to go to the reset password link, enter your old Skype account Name/Username (not your email if it is an old Skype account)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the link on where to reset your password: <a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset?cobrandid=90010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/password/reset?cobrandid=90010</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the link is open, choose "<strong>I forgot my password</strong>" then <strong>
Next</strong>.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, please make sure to enter the<strong> Skype Name</strong> and not your email when resetting the password.</p>
<p>Follow the rest of the instructions to proceed with the password reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know what the outcome is.</p>

<p>Hi Mark,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the link. I have tried this option - but unfortunately it still wants to send a verification email to the old email address and not the one it is now linked with. The old email address no longer exists - so I try to 'recover my account' but I
 don't know enough information to do this - so it keeps getting rejected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you know if there are any other options available?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Mark,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes - I have tried that a couple of times. However - unfortunately I am apparently not giving them the correct information to recover the account so it has been rejected both times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if it is because this email address was shut down about six years ago - so perhaps Microsoft doesn't still have the records?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it help if I went into the Microsoft store in the city to let someone see my devices and the problems I am having?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help on this! </p>

<p>
</p><p>We have no visibility to the account recovery details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless the information you have provided to recover the account matched the information on your Skype account then it will not be successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft physical store will only refer you to the account recovery page as this is done automatically by the system once you submit your information. You may try again until it is verified. Although, if the account information fails to verify then
 I'm afraid the only option is to create a new account using an email that you have access to and make sure that you save all information you will register moving forward.</p>

    <title>Microphone keeps shutting down in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> -vrd-  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microphone keeps shutting down in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Good Morning:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with Windows 10 and conferencing, regarding the microphone. &nbsp;PLEASE, PLEASE, note that I have tried all the common fixes over a period of days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what happens. &nbsp;When I use either Skype or Zoom Conference, my microphone just shuts down in mid sentence...usually after about 10 seconds of talking. &nbsp;Sometimes I can turn it back on in the Sound area of the Control panel and sometimes it won't un-mute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have restarted</p>
<p>I have searched-for and updated drivers.</p>
<p>I have removed the drivers and re-installed them.</p>
<p>I have gone to a auxiliary USB camera with Microphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My job absolutely requires me to teleconference a couple times per week and right now I am crippled by this problem. &nbsp;I simply can't do it. &nbsp;I know this is an issue as there are plenty of posts about it. &nbsp;I have tried every fix that I can find on-line....not
 to mention the fact that I bought a very high-end laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any input, in advance.</p>
<p>Vince</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>2. Click on <em>
<strong>Hardware and Sound</strong></em>, then click on <em><strong>Sound</strong></em>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>3. </span></span></span><span><span><span>Go to

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>4. Select <strong>

</span></span></span></span></p>
<span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">6. </span></span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>Reboot your computer.<br />
</span></span></span></span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to perform the suggested workaround from <strong>CarlZinn</strong> on this

<p>This problem has clearly been around for a long time. If it involves a Trojan, why isn't Windows Defender on top of it?<br />
<br />
Method 1 above did not help.<br />
BTW, on my Windows 10 system, the path to this area was as follows:<br />
<br />
1) Start/settings (settings is an icon that looks like a gear positioned just above "Power" icon (for shutting down) and below "File Explorer" icon, these come up on the left edge of the screen.<br />
</p>
<p>2) in settings, I do a search for "audio devices" an a choice "Manage audio devices" appears. Selecting this brings up a popup "Sound" which the Task Manager sees as "Windows host process (Rundll32)"<br />
<br />
3) At this point rejoin the above instructions...go to the "recording" tab, etc.<br />
<br />
The point of this issue is that even after making these changes, "something" is moving the level back to 0 and selecting the "Mute" option.<br />
<br />
The question is, what is that "Something" and how do we get rid of it or reconfigure it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to an answer that doesn't involve downloading additional software!</p>

<p>Hi Phil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be caused by a conflict on your system. We suggest that you start your Windows in safe mode. In safe mode, Windows will be in a basic state and will only use limited set of files and drivers. This can help us identify the cause of the issue.
 To know more about safe mode, please click on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>

<br />
Am satisfied with the answer I got there. I think that it is due to some sort of rootkit malware. Malwarebytes found several on my system, and kiboshing them ended the problem.<br />
<br />
I didn't go so far as "safe mode" but I did try the suggestion of only opening Windows system files and the problem persisted.</p>

The same fix worked for me, back when I wrote the post.&nbsp; I actually tried several anti-virus and anti-malware tools.&nbsp; None of them worked except Malwarebytes, which handled the issue immediately.&nbsp; Like you, I wish I had found it first.

            Hi Abd,
<br />
<br />Boot into BIOS (Usually F2 or Del on the Manufacturers logo screen when your system starts 
<br />
<br />Turn off Secure Boot in BIOS (UEFI) settings 
<br />
<br />Check to see if this resolves this issue, if not turn Secure Boot back on . . .

                    <div>I'm using a desktop computer, and all my other devices have been detected by my pc, even other SE phones except for the W595. I need to update it's firmware because it's constantly restarting
 when I use it. I think I just need to tweak the driver settings but I already downloaded many drivers that supposedly are for the W595 and it still won't get recognized. I use Windows 7 64-bit by the way. Can anyone help me solve my problem? I have the SE
 Update Service and PC Suite. The PC companion requires you to have 2 GB RAM, so I can't use it because I only have 1 GB RAM. I'm not required to use the PC Companion though, the PC Suite and the Update Service is enough already for me to be able to update
 my firmware.</div>

<p>Hello, my newer phones can be detected and the memory card and phone memory can be read by the PC. As for my W880i only the memory card appears in the "my computer" window but the phone can be detected by the PC Companion. The SE W595 which is the one that
 I wrote about was never able to be read by the pc at all ever since. I bought this as a 2nd hand phone. I haven't tested it out yet on another pc but I will go to a cafe to check. I tried to run the troubleshooter but it gave me this error code:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Package ID: Device Diagnostic</p>
<p>Path: C:\Windows\diagnostics\system\device</p>
<p>Error code:&nbsp;0x800706BB</p>
<p>Source: Engine</p>
<p>Context: Elevated</p>
<p>
</p><p>So can that be the problem? I have Google Chrome open as I try to run it but I don't think it affected the process as to why the test can be performed.</p>

<p>I use the same cable for 4 of my SE phones so I don't think the cable is faulty..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now guessing the problem is with the phone's software itself, because the radio and camera won't work, and it constantly refreshes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, &nbsp;I tried to run the cmd command, and I got this error: "You must be an administrator running a console session in order to use the sfc utility"</p>

Just like entering the beta though, it can take a day or two before the Xbox Store knows to download the older version as opposed to the beta. They don't need to leave the Insider program in order to stop using the beta, they just need to opt back out from the Insider Hub on the console.</p><p><br /></p><p>_______________________________________________________</p>

    <title>How can I undo a dedication to readyboost&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peopleof man  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I undo a dedication to readyboost&#63;</h2>
                    I have an 8gb flashdrive that I decided to try readyboost on - after all, why not? Everything from microsoft said it would be reversible.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyways, I was trying to use that drive today, and found it write-protected. I'd like to undo this. But, for whatever reason, the computer is dead-set against it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I cannot uncheck the box to kill readyboost - that tab just tells me that the device is unsuitable for readyboost, as it is write protected.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There is no security tab from which I can toggle write protect.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>DiskPart fails because, again, the drive is write protected.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't care at all about what is on there right now, I just want to be able to use it as a flashdrive.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>To undo the ReadyBoost designation, instead of unchecking the Use this device box, check the box for Do not&nbsp;use this device. Alternatively, and as long as you don't care what's on the drive, have you tried just pulling it out from the port its plugged into?
 That should break the stranglehold on it, allowing you to re-plug it in and format it anew.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last option is a freeware program EaseUS Partition Master, which might be able to reformat the drive for you. You can download it from here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://download.cnet.com/Easeus-Partition-Master-Free-Edition/3000-2248_4-10863346.html?tag=mncol;1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Let me know if any of these approaches fixes the issue for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Neither of the first two options works, unfortunately. I don't even see any of the check boxes anymore, I'm just told that the flashdrive is unsuitable because it's write-protected.
<div><br />
<div>I tried the EaseUS, and that's having problems too. If I try to delete or format the drive, I'm told that "the operation failed because the media is write-protected."</div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>To be honest, I've never heard of losing the check boxes before - reluctant to release the drive yes, but losing the checkboxes altogether, no. Try this, go to Control Panel, Device Manager, and click on USB devices. Look for yellow triangles with an exclamation
 point in them. When you find one, right-click on it and select Properties. What information is being displayed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then when you've gotten the information, pull the flash drive out and try reloading it in a different port. What results? Then, if you have another spare flash drive, plug it into the original port. What results? What I'm trying to understand here is whether
 its a drive problem, a port problem, or a Windows software issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know when you have the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            I know, it's really weird. I haven't found anyone else with the problem, either.
<div><br />
<div>Anyways, it doesn't show up under USB devices. Instead, it's viewed as a drive.</div>
<div>Under properties, there's not much special, but it isn't flagged as usable for write caching. And, of course, if I try to do so, it gives me an error because it's write-protected.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Under the "Volumes" tab, though, all fields (Disk, Type, Status, etc.) are all " - ".</div>

<p>Pardon the delay in responding, my email was out of commission for a couple of days and I'm just catching up with the backlog!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where you got to on "Volumes" - you need to click the "Populate" button to get Windows to fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what happens when you pull the drive? What does Device Manager show? Also, do you have another drive you can try on that port. If so, what are the specific results that you get?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried uninstalling the problem drive? If so, what specific results have you gotten?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please post your replies here.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi centimani,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I would suggest you to refer to the below article and check for the reporting of the memory allocation changes according
 to the operating system installed -</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://asus.com/product.aspx?P_ID=ZWrNVPXEbNNTjJZg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://asus.com/product.aspx?P_ID<span>=ZWrNVPXEbNNTjJZg</span></span></span></span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Also the BIOS settings change the allocation of the memory according to requirement. You may check with the manufacturer
 to change the settings in the BIOS as some laptops do support the changes in the BIOS for memory allocation for graphics.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.<br />

            Thank you for the answer, but it didn't help me. I downloaded&nbsp;drivers for windows 7 64bit but it still shows only 32mb of video memory. Maybe there is something else I can do?

<p>You have a 3rd party firewall-mcafee it may have turned windows firewall off.</p>
<p>The issues is that microsoft has made windows update, apps and features&nbsp;</p>
<p>not download or install most updates unless the data is piped through their network
</p>
<p>servers,</p>
<p>What you may have to do is temporarily &nbsp;turn off&nbsp;mcafee firewall to get updates.</p>
<p>If windows firewall is off this will not work, but it can be turned on then off again after the updates are completed.</p>
<p>I prefer 3rd party antivirus-firewalls as opposed to MS products.</p>
<p>Two firewalls running at the same time can cause issues I see with frequent browser timeouts within a few sec.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not know how&nbsp;mcafee&nbsp;firewall &nbsp;is set to work with windows firewall, but bullguard told me in a chat that the "new their new firewall only works if windows 10 firewall is running.</p>
<p>Have had so many issues with this for the last few months as BG never communicated with its customers ,</p>
<p>about this change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4 &nbsp;months of dissecting the pc, uninstalling drivers, software, microsoft store could not download or update and this was the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would chat with mcafee first and see what they recommend.</p>
<p>Microsoft needs to stop hijacking how we protect our devices, make a gui exe and configurable to, run&nbsp;</p>
<p>when the os needs it for maintenance, when completed at the end of the selected task, shut it down,</p>
<p>(task scheduler) let the user schedule these updates when best times can be used, not anytime.</p>
<p>Then shutdown the firewall.&nbsp;<br />

<p>This could be an issue caused by several things.</p>
<p>The store cash could be corrupted on the pc,&nbsp;</p>
<p>microsoft servers are not able to get the flag that the&nbsp;</p>
<p>update was installed by another method, so the update server&nbsp;</p>
<p>continues to place it in que, so it fails again.</p>
<p>I possible, turn off automatic updates for the os and store.</p>
<p>This way it may look for updates, but not download.</p>
<p>Question, is an ssd or sshd installed ? </p>
<p>Lastly, turning off <span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;Mcafee&nbsp;firewall and turn&nbsp;windows firewall to back on.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After the updates get fixed, you can turn windows&nbsp;firewall back off again</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Right now I have widows and bullguard running and have seen only&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Can not say you would get the same results, I would check with mcafee on that,</span></span></p>

<p>Getting the updates the normal way and fails, download the standalone package for that version&nbsp;</p>
<p>of your system.</p>
<p>Install the standalone update most times will be 100% completed, sometimes a restart of the device is needed.</p>
<p>Microsoft updates will show success on the installation, but windows update wants to download and install it again anyway.</p>
<p>Some say it may be a modified kb "newer or fixed version" but looks more like windows update can not tell&nbsp;what is installed on the local device, be it a microsoft account or local account.</p>
<p>Also check to see if vpn is enabled through settings and device manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason I have determined is that most issues on win10 updates, os, store etc. are all due to microsoft&nbsp;</p>
<p>running updates only if the windows firewall is turned on.</p>
<p>This is also relevant if another firewall is running on the device from a 3rd party vendor.</p>
<p>I use bullguard premium protection and had noticed something different &nbsp; in their firewall application'</p>
<p>not showing any networks or the mac addresses.</p>
<p>Having the same issues as most here, I was uninstalling windows app's and programs even had gone as far
</p>
<p>as clearing the store cash.</p>
<p>After finding a solution on the feedback app, &nbsp; how to reset the store, &nbsp;the output showed one error&nbsp;</p>
<p>consistently, the windows firewall was not running, when back on no issue.</p>
<p>Safemode, sfc/scannow, Dsp online cleanup, nothing worked.</p>
<p>This is no short of hijacking updates so the device has to use windows firewall even though it is the worst
</p>
<p>of all firewalls.</p>
<p>Because it is being done behind the scene with little to no public awareness, users think it is an issue&nbsp;</p>
<p>with their systems.</p>
<p>Microsoft will send you through the same old garbage &nbsp;to hide the fact of this forced implementation and</p>
<p>to squeeze out 3rd party products because windows updates and apps have less issues' especially UNP apps.</p>
<p>If windows firewall is turned of from the program itself, wate &nbsp;about 5sec. it will turn back on.</p>

                    <p>I want to setup my Surface RT to start certain programs when it boots into Windows 8.1. I've tried including a Key String of the program *.exe file in Registry Editor location: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run; as I&nbsp;have done
 in my desktop version of Windows 8.1 Pro but it doesn't run when it boots up.</p>

    <title>Cannot Remap Audio Jacks in Win 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tugadaq1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot Remap Audio Jacks in Win 7</h2>
                    I recently loaded win 7 and the IDT Audio Control Panel no longer shows the ability to remap audio jacks. The function was available with XP. The audio drives for both XP and Windows came with the motherboard which is an Elite A740GM-M. Is there another
 driver that I could use? Could I manually enter the registry entries that appear to change the jack map? Or is Win 7 significantly different in how it handles audio? I will also note that the XP version had the ability to change a large number items and the
 number of registry entries is greatly larger than in XP. I can see the registry entries that change when I remap a jack.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any insight or help.

            <p>Troubleshooting does not help. That is expected because there is valid functioning driver installed. The problem is that it has more limited functionality than the XP driver (both off&nbsp;the same manufactures CD).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Latest driver from motherboard manufacturer (which is probably the same) gives the same limited functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing in XP compatibility mode results in an install with the message that&nbsp;the driver is incompatible with the hardware.&nbsp; Since the hardware is the same, I interpret this to mean in is incompatible with Win 7 API changes from XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Asking Win 7 to update driver results in driver found, but unable to install. There a lot IDT Win 7 drivers out there. The question is would any of them likely work with my motherboard.

<div>It appears that your print server is more than 7 years old as I can't find anything on Hawking's web site that is newer.&nbsp; Be fortunate that it works with Vista and it should also work in Win 7 once the proper drives for the printer is
 installed.</div>

    <title>How do I make command prompt stay open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kjmr80  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I make command prompt stay open</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
<br />
I would like to know if there is any way I can make the command prompt window remain open when I double click on a program. I am learning to use Ruby and I have created my first little sample program that is supposed to ask the user questions. However, when
 I open the program I created with Ruby, a command prompt window flashes on and disappears within a second and I can't see what it says. Is there any way I can stop this from happening? Stop the command prompt window from instantly closing the second it opens?
 I have had this issue with other .exe programs too that run through command prompt and I would really like to not have to open the command prompt and manually go to the file to run it, as that seems more time consuming than it needs to be.<br />
<br />
Any help would be great.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
Krista<br />

    <title>Windows 8.1 blue screen at boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> exsharaen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 blue screen at boot</h2>
                    So I managed to install Windows 8.1 Pro from Windows 8 Pro, unaware of potential problems like blue screens at installation. It did failed at the very first reboot, my laptop just stuck at Asus logo (it's N43SL by the way), but after forced shutdown the
 installation continued and finally completed after 2 hours without further errors. Windows worked fine without issues.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Up until I started up my laptop after a normal shutdown and it didn't recognize any USB devices (mouse, headset). This occasionally (but rarely) happens on Windows 8 and is easily cured by restarting my laptop, so I did that. Suddenly, when the blue Windows
 8 logo appeared, I was presented with a blue screen, which I didn't manage to see the error message and code since it happens very quickly, and my laptop restarted. The blue screen appeared again, and after restarting I was presented with a recovery screen.
 Restarting didn't help; the pattern reoccured, so now I'm trying to perform a startup recovery. After checking disk, I was offered the option to use System Restore. At the time I'm writing this, it's still running for about 30 minutes, with no text at all
 in my screen and no loading circle.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Oh, and it just failed. Safe mode also failed to boot, following the same pattern.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I regret myself of not creating the recovery disk for Win 8.1 immediately (I do have the Win 8 recovery disk), so what any other options left before I must perform a Refresh? Will Refresh revert my Windows back to 8.1 or 8?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Update:</div>
<div>It seems Windows 8.1 refuses to perform a Refresh using Windows 8 installation disk or recovery disk, so I'm left with the option to reinstall Windows 8 from scratch...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Update:</div>
<div>I managed to use Windows 8 installation disk to reach Refresh option, but it says "The drive is locked, unlock it first." I can't figure out how to unlock it after searching here for similar problems. Any suggestions?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm obtaining a Windows 8.1 ISO from Dreamsparks, maybe it will work.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Update:</div>
<div>I can finally run Refresh, but only at 2% it was stopped immediately, with no reason of failure. Guess the only way out of this is a clean install...&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            Hi Praseetha,
<div><br />
<div>I've done that, but the Command Prompt gave me this result (I forgot the exact sentence):</div>
<div>Detected Windows installation: 0.</div>
<div>I also noticed that during my sessions in Command Prompt, my main drive's letter (which Windows was residing) was swapped with 100 MB partition. It was no longer C but was E (I had one more partition within the disk, which was still correctly identified
 as D). Is this normal?</div>
<div><br />
<div>After some more blue screens, I finally was able to take a glimpse to the error message: it was
<b>INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE</b> (I couldn't spot the exact error code though). I tried something similar to the suggested solution
<a href="http://www.itechlounge.net/2013/03/windows-bsod-0x0000007b-inaccessible-boot-device/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>, but it failed too at the last step (my Windows installation was not recognized). In this condition, a Refresh from Windows 8 DVD couldn't be started with locked drive error, and a Refresh from Windows 8.1 DVD (which I got from my Dreamspark) failed
 too with no apparent reason.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think I read somewhere that Win 8 DVD/repair disk can't be used to repair Win 8.1 and vice versa (aside from the fact that I can't find out how to create a repair disk in Win 8.1, only a USB repair disk)...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks,</div>
        </p>

            <p>I can find no reference on any type of search for the blue screen I get on booting.</p>
<p>I have tried the steps mentioned here anyway with no success.</p>
<p>I can only boot from a USB with the boot info on it.</p>
<p>I have done the disk check routine and have no look. I think I have a bad spot on the disk at the boot record point, but nothing detects of fixes it. I restored in windows 7 and had the same thing, I then ordered an Copy &amp; license for win 8.1. I have installed
 it twice and have the same problem.</p>
<p>I have used the repair function from the Cd with no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>what I get when booting is the following as best as I can remember.</p>
<p>3 choices that go to further steps</p>
<p>
</p><p>1-&nbsp; continue on to Windows 8.1&nbsp;&nbsp; .........&nbsp;&nbsp; This just take you to a reboot unless you boot from USB</p>
<p>2-&nbsp; Restore or or what ever the term for writing over every thing. can not grasp all the new terms</p>
<p>3- Troubleshoot</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a-&nbsp; I'll not try to remember all of them as I'm 79 and they don't change a thing anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can not get this fixed, I find no purpose in doing the windows 10 upgrade that went smoothly on my laptop yesterday. If I find nothing by August 4th, I am assuming a bad drive and retuning it as it has a Square D policy.

            <p>I have used those steps and more. still have the problem 9 times out of 10 and have to boot from a USB.
</p>
<p>I have done a fresh install twice and after a few boots, it is back. I was scheduled to upgrade to 10 today, but if I do, I may not be able to boot and have to refresh or whatever and loose the 10. I don't know if I can get it a second time.</p>
<p>I am going to look through a Windows 8 tutorial disk from WordStart and check with YouTube (if I can get an American that I can understand) in hopes of finding something MS has failed to tell us.</p>
<p>The windows 10 has feed back, that should stop some of these ministries on Win 10.</p>

            <p>Hello.</p>
<p>Most of the problems are related to incorrect drivers.</p>
<p>It could be also due to new software or hardware installed.</p>
<p>You can look at this article for a detailed explanation.</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>If Your system can't load the startup (or login screen) Try press F12 Before the system is starting up (my system is run with f12 to safe mode) If those tips aren't works , -Try Format your driver and install another windows version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Try Upgrade all of your driver to latest version (included bios) to meet the windows installation requirements.</p>
<p>-Get some helps from websites if your error code is in common level. (My one is rare)</p>
<p>- Change A New PC (That's the easiest way XD)</p>

<p>I saw ur update #3 (Currently Latest)</p>
<p>Q: Did U run refresh with Any installation disc? And Are u sure that the System isn't contain any virus?</p>
<p>Ur Refresh is in 2% and stopped without any reason. The causes are:</p>
<p>-maybe ur system got any problem like missing or corrupted system file and make ur any actions having problem include shut down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-maybe ur drivers version can't meet up the system requirements.</p>
<p>-maybe ur device settings (BIOS) make ur system can't startup. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Steven.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can roll back Fall Creators Update Version 1709 to the older version until it matures:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstall-windows-10-creators-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstal...</a>
<br />
<br />Then hide the Update using the Hide Update Tool so it doesn't try to force itself:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>
<br />
<br /> If you want to try to reform it first go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
