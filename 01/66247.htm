<p>
</p><p><span>If you cannot go to Safe mode normally then boot to Safe mode Using Windows 10 bootable DVD or USB drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>If you don’t have the bootable DVD or USB drive, please refer to the steps in the article given below to create one and then follow the steps given below.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail hijacked my internet comcast.net inbox</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
Error when synchronizing account in Windows Live Mail

<div><b>Please provide your impacted Email address : </b></div>
<div>*** Email address is removed for privacy ***</div>
<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Mail are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Other</div>
<div><b>Did you receive an error code or message? </b></div>
<div>No</div>
<div><b>Please enter the error code or message you received </b></div>
<div>none</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
When I opened windows live mail for the first time (today) from the "show all programs" menu, Windows Live moved all of my inbox e-mail from comcast.net to windows Live, which I assume is located on my computer. How do I get all of my e-mail back to comcast.net?
 Windows Live has popped up when I am trying to reply to a craigslist listing and I use it to e-mail . I never gave windows live permisssion to download my e-mail from comcast.net.&nbsp; I do not know the version of Windows Live Mail (WLM) because if I open WLM
 it will again remove my mail from Comcast.net. It is the version supplied by HP (along with Windows 7)&nbsp;when I bought this laptop in Feb 2011.&nbsp; Previous computer based e-mail programs have asked if you want the program to download (remove) your incomming&nbsp;mail
 from your internet based program (comcast.net) or only view the e-mails that are in that internet account.&nbsp; It still allowed you to send&nbsp;outbound mail from the computer based e-mail program.&nbsp;I want to restore all e-mails now in WLM to my internet (comcast.net)
 account so I can see them from my other (XP and 7) computers.&nbsp; I also need to make WLM to never download the mail to this computer.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; P.S. where do I get instructions for using WLM without opening WLM?</p>

Click on the General tab, you can uncheck Include this account when receiving mail or synchronizing, although if Leave a copy .... is checked, your email will still be on the comcast server.

            1.&nbsp; Ok, thank you for the directions on how to keep WLMail from downloading&nbsp;future e-mail to this computer and erasing it from my on-line account.&nbsp; Now, is there any way to move the 200 or so e-mails that WLM downloaded and erased from on-line account
 as a group back to on-line account?&nbsp; Some are designs that my wife purchased and needs to use on another computer, as well as e-mail that I need to access from computer at work.&nbsp; These are on other networks, so "share" is not an option.&nbsp; Do I have to individually
 e-mail each one back to our on-line account?<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Since WLMail was on this computer when purchased, I assume it is included as part of the Windows 7 OEM installation.&nbsp; Is there any "WLMail 4 Dummies" that pops up before you first give WLM your e-mail address saying that WLM will download all mail from
 your on-line account unless you do the "Properties, Advanced Tab, Leave a copy, etc"? There are a lot of us who use an online account because we work from numerous computers.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Is there a master&nbsp;file that I somehow missed that comes with Windows 7 OEM installations that gives a quick overview of the programs that are included, such as WLMail, Silverlight, SQL Server, Portable devices, Defender, etc.?&nbsp;&nbsp;A link with a text file giving
 basic steps on how each works and how to set it up or run as-is would be very, very&nbsp;helpful.&nbsp; Text file should be in the first subdirectory of any programs installed (Windows Explorer/Program Files/Windows Mail/!Overview and Instructions.txt)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; Thank you for your time and effort.&nbsp; Just wish this wasn't in a FORUM so everyone can see how dumb some of us oldtimers are.

<br />
No. You cannot move the email messages from your computer to your email account. We regret to inform you that you can send the email individually to return them to your online account.<br />

<br />
You can&nbsp;search for other instructions that&nbsp;will provide more information about Windows&nbsp;Live Mail client.&nbsp;You may have to manually configure your email client as&nbsp;the settings&nbsp;can be easily configured.<br />

<br />
You can view the list of programs installed in your computer through the&nbsp;control panel.
<br />
You can view them by pressing <strong>Window key &gt; Control panel &gt; Programs &gt; Programs and features</strong> to view installed programs in your computer.<br />

            WLMail is not part of Windows 7.&nbsp; It is included on some computers by the computer maker.<br />
<br />
Pop3 accounts added to WLMail have Leave a copy ....... checked by default.&nbsp; I don't not understand why Leave a copy ....&nbsp;was not checked for your comcast account.<br />
<br />
You can send the emails to yourself.&nbsp; The date sent will be the new date and the emails will be from you.<br />
<br />
You could get a Hotmail or Gmail account and move the emails to Hotmail or Gmail because those email servers can be accessed with http or imap which allows syncing emails between your computer and the email server.

<h2>            Surface Headphones Cutting out when using Multiple Pairing</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Having a few issues with my surface headphones after a few day so of use. One is something similar to what is being discussed in this thread, with my issue described in the comments</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/all/surface-headphones-making-a-static-sound/b478f8d7-ad5b-403c-99f5-bd742598af66</p>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The second issue and point of this question is an issue that happens when I am paired with both my phone ( Galaxy S7) and my laptop (New thinkpad). If I am paired with both, have music playing on my laptop, and begin to scroll through Instagram or Twitter,
 this causes the audio in the headphones to chop a bunch (multiple times a minute). I would describe it as the audio pausing for a fraction of a second then continuing. This issue was not exclusive to when I had a video or something playing on either app either,
 it would also chop while pulling up pictures on twitter or just scrolling through normally.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>With more testing it also happened when I took a picture in the messages app on my phone and chopped audio that was playing from my laptop. Both this and the previous chopping happened while the laptop was playing music off youtube/pandora chrome player.</div>

<div>I tried to replicate the issue with my roommates iPhone 6 and could not seem to get the issue to occur again, at least not as frequently. With a couple of minutes scrolling through twitter on his phone I only had the audio chop once.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did not change any settings on the headphones and just paired them with my phone and laptop through the normal bluetooth setup. I have factory reset the headphones and repaired them to both devices and experienced the audio chopping again under the same
 case. How would I go about trying to fix this issue or has anyone else found a fix when having a similar issue?</div>

<h2>            PCIe SB X-fi Xtreme Audio &#40;frustration&#41; HD and Win 7&#58; A match made in ____.__</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Allow me to begin by saying that I've already gotten the latest drivers. I've already tried them, and the betas, and even some modified drivers. I vented my frustration on another forum already so I'll paste the important part of that here:</strong></p>
<p><em>-=-=-=-BEGIN pasted content-=-=-=-</em></p>
<p>I have found posts all over the place regarding issues with x-fi and win 7. Most of them seem to revolve around volume control, mute, unmute. An example: Using an audio production app, attempting to apply real-time effects to an audio track. I've spent the
 last three days in every single audio application I could find (Acid, Ableton, fruity loops, soundforge, audition (cool edit)...etc.) and in each application the problem presents itself a little differently. In acid I am unable to hear any mic input at all.
 In ableton I can apply a vst (drumagog) to the mic and hear its output but I also hear the mic input audio. If I go into<span><span><span>windows</span></span></span></p>
<div><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
</a></div>
vol controls, ie., recording devices, I can see that the microphone's "listen to this device" box is NOT checked, yet I hear the mic through my speakers.<br />
The idea with drumagog is that I want to pipe live mic input through it and have it output drum sounds in place of the sounds it hears through the mic. (see "invisible drum set, drumagog" on You-tube)<br />
If I go and tick the "listen to this device"(LttD, lets call it.) box, then the mic plays through the speakers louder. Unticked, and it still plays but not as loudly. so... there's problem #1<br />
<br />
#1 unticking the LttD box does not really work.<br />
<br />
I press on for a workaround... I decide to go into "playback devices", "<span><span><span>Speakers</span></span></span><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>
<div><br />
</div>
</span></a>", "properties", "levels", "Microphone" and mute the mic for playback. Hey! I don't hear the raw mic anymore! BUT the<span><span><span>audio</span></span></span>application
 can no longer hear the mic either so there's no output from drumagog. A quick check of the "Recording devices" from the windows volume tab shows that the mic levels are responding to input (graphically) and that the microphone is not muted for recording. So
 we've discovered problem #2: At some point in the bizarre and convoluted hierarchy (or lack thereof) of sound mixers and controls and tools and ____ the system is interpreting the "mute-ON" state in the playback devices section as a global "mute-ON" for audio
 applications.<br />
To make matters worse, they have to include some moronic imaginary device called "What U Hear" in the windows stack. Which, if enabled, [EDIT]seems to actually reverse some of the other results of mute settings on other ports or devices, although I haven't
 explored this aspect yet and I could be wrong. I know it's damn confusing to have devices that don't exist, though... anyway, one day I'll mute the mic, the other automatically unmutes, and vice versa... the next day both will mute yet both channels are picking
 up input from the same microphone, and it's all audible despite the un-ticked LttDs.&nbsp; SOOOoooo ahhhh...<br />
<br />
Why in the world can't any given audio application completely bypass windows volume controls and take total control of the device(s) as the option for "Allow applications to take exclusive control" would suggest to any reasonably intelligent person.?
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why in the world does creative include a mixer when there is already one in windows?</p>
<p>Why in the world do audio apps include their mixers on top on all the other mixers?</p>
<p>Why in the world do VST apps inside the host audio apps also include mixers? lol</p>
<p>If ONE of the damn mixers worked, then I'd be happy. It's not too much to ask... is it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>-=-=-=END of pasted content-=-=-=</em></p>
<p><strong>Ok, to simplify, I would like to take 4 microphones, plug them into L and R Mic in, and L and R Aux Line-In, each mic as MONO on it's own channel (L or R, aux or mic=4).&nbsp; I would like to use any host application that is capable (name it, I have it)&nbsp;
 of taking the four mic inputs and running them through a real time effects processor (Drumagog or a vocoder or whatever) and playing the output through the speakers WITHOUT hearing the unaffected (LIVE, preprocessed) audio mixed in.&nbsp; "listen to this device"
 is not involved, "what you hear" is disabled, recording devices has the mic and aux unmuted and turned up, BUT if I go into Playback/Speakers/levels and mute the mic and aux then the audio apps cannot hear the mic and aux inputs despite the fact that the level
 meter is bouncing up and down (indicating that windows mixer hears the input but is not passing into the audio app.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there a registry tweak to fix this?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>BTW what the ____ is "WhatUHear" anyway?</strong></p>

<p>Hi 0per,</p>
<p>"What U Hear" is the Creative Labs version of the Windows "Stereo Mix" function, which is the output from the "out" on the sound card if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p>Here's some info on that:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/20595-what-u-hear-recording-enable.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/20595-what-u-hear-recording-enable.html</a></p>
<p><em>"I can see that the microphone's "listen to this device" box is NOT checked, yet I hear the mic through my speakers."</em></p>
<p>That's because whatever your output&nbsp;(mics, music, etc.) is not muted in the Speaker (output) Properties window:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fq82pka.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pJwW9eshpBz3RgvUfvz5rGnLr1e2RlDo-bUp76YeL7SWEJlJwAKKhAZpH5QxZLdgF9G-JN3C9ACdaIRyNDupQlnC1QqjCsBB6%2fspeaker_properties.PNG%3fpsid%3d1" /></p>
<p>If you click on the speaker inside the red circle, you will not hear the playback of that source through the headphones/speakers unless the&nbsp;"listen to this device" box is checked:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fq82pka.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pTyYWjgRu32Aeg0N-I2fyQKgkGckZg_9Fv9jWzpDnbZ_gMWUR44FdDVVbAXctyGi5dIp59sfeTIzJOAFFBeGgpN7misnZSeRn%2flisten_to_this_device.PNG%3fpsid%3d1" /></p>
<p>The Stereo Mix combines whatever sounds are routed through the speakers, and uses them as a single input.</p>
<p>For example, this computer has a mic input on the front panel and a rear input on the back of the PC.</p>
<p>It also has the Stereo Mix that it can record from:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fq82pka.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1p65LoQSllL4Pyp4YFmbzVbhBdYpDMSUTqTmMw2IjIZE4YpZxzaX7y6xDqDbZiGSXfTcF3FxYIQxxHl7FG-z8Qat2Xz-NkDZdm%2frecording_input.PNG%3fpsid%3d1" />&nbsp;</p>
<p>While using the Stereo Mix, I can record from the Microphone input and the Rear Input at the same time.</p>
<p>I can also select the Microphone as the default device and record just from that input, or just from the Rear Input by selecting that as the default device.</p>
<p>My advice would be to use the Stereo Mix to record from by selecting it as the default device.</p>
<p>You can leave the input levels un-muted in the Speaker Properties in the Playback window to have the signal to record and listen to.</p>
<p>Since&nbsp;you are recording what is being played through the mixer, you will not be able to mute the signal coming from the inputs on the sound card.</p>
<p>That should give you the output you can pass to your effects and recording apps.</p>
<p>At least that how it is on my setup.</p>
<p>I see that the jacks are labeled as output on the sound card you're using, so you might not be able to use all of them as inputs.</p>

            Hi SarojSubedi15,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Hi!
<br />
<br />Welcome to our community.
<br />This is Leocadia, independent community expert, and I am glad to assist you today.
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear about this inconvenience. We would like to help you promptly.
<br />If you could please follow the steps below: 
<br />
<br />Method 01:
<br />
<br />
<br />Check if you are able to boot to the computer in safemode. You can follow the steps:
<br /> 
<br />a) Click on Power option at the lower right corner of the log-in screen.
<br />b) Hold Shift and Click on Restart.
<br />c) Click on Troubleshoot.
<br />d) Click on Advance options.
<br />e) Click on Startup options.
<br />f) Click on Restart.
<br />
<br />g) Select safe mode by selecting the appropriate number from the options onscreen.
<br />
<br />go into your account settings and see if it has been locked or change your account from microsoft to local. I then removed password from my local account.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Reseting Windows 10 Password Online  (if you have a access to another computer/device)
<br />
<br />Changing password online is the most suitable way to set things right, but you need to have your MS account password lock enabled in your Windows 10 PC before you lost your access to it. There are several services online and offline both which are run by Microsoft modules, thus resetting the password of any of those services can automatically sync the change to your lock down computer as well.
<br />
<br />
<br />But first you need to visit the official MS live Webpage: <a href="https://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com/password/reset</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If you see the "I Forgot My Password" option, click on it. Cite the mode of receiving an OTP, either via mobile or recovery email ID. Upon receiving the OTP, enter it on the webpage; you will be prompted to reset your password. Do it twice to confirm the character combination and access your locked out machine again with the newly created password.
<br />
<br />Method 03: Use the Local Account
<br />
<br />This is another temporary solution, until we determine the exact cause of the problem. Here’s what you need to do to switch from your Microsoft Account to your Local Account:
<br />
<br />    Open the Settings app.
<br />    Go to the Accounts section. Now navigate to the Your info tab.
<br />    Click  Sign in with a local account instead.Windows 10 can't login with Microsoft Account
<br />    Enter your password and click Next.
<br />    Now enter a username for your local account and click Next.
<br />    After doing that, click the Sign out and finish button.
<br />    Now log into Windows 10 with your local account.

                    <p>Like the subject says, many of the Thumbnails/Icons "Trusted Microsoft Store Apps" (Edge, Settings, Store, Sticky Notes, One Note, ect) are missing on my user profile and replaced by the default white thumbnail w/ blue picture (<a href="http://windows.intowindows.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Thumbnails-now-showing-in-Windows-10-file-explorer.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">example</a>).
 If I make a second user profile on my computer, all the icons show up normally. This has been persisting for quite some time (6+ months).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10, my computer is completely up to date, and I have run the Windows Apps/Update troubleshooter with no errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This user had a similar issue, and I followed everything recommended by Likhitha V.</p>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>What happened to me is that when I installed windows 8 on my computer it deleted all the samsung softwares so i just needed to re-install SW Update (<span style="color: rgba(88, 88, 88, 1)">Samsung Windows 8 Software &amp; Drivers)&nbsp;</span>and there
 were a driver there for the touchpad which needed to be installed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since I've done that, i've got back scrolling, zooming,...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is the link to download SW Update (link in point 3.) &nbsp;<a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/support/win8upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.samsung.com/us/support/win8upgrade/</a></div>

            Touchpad gestures are supported with the accompanying software (with the driver). Without the suitable software, gestures will not work. As you can see from the above posts, kindly install the touchpad software for the&nbsp;features&nbsp;to work.
<div><br />
<div>Note that installing the driver alone will not solve the issue. Installing the software will only solve the issue, as driver will just make the touchpad work with Windows, rather supporting extra features.</div>

    <title>Windows 10 Black Screen Blinking Underscore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skwiot12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Black Screen Blinking Underscore</h2>
                    <p>About a week ago, I went to use my PC that was on sleep mode.&nbsp; When it "woke up" it showed nothing but a black screen with a blinking underscore.&nbsp; I tried restarting the computer, when I did, I was able to access bios, but after, it would immediately go
 back to the black screen with the underscore.&nbsp; I tried reinstalling windows, but that would require a reboot to start windows normally to put media creation tool in.&nbsp; I tried the repair windows tool, but that didn't work either.&nbsp; I tried a rescue .iso file,

    <title>Metro Exodus invisible hand bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> puff a scooby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Metro Exodus invisible hand bug</h2>
                    Playing Metro Exodus on my One X. Almost finished with the Caspian level when my character glitched out and my player model is invisible. My character is now invincible to everything but fall damage. Restarting checkpoints dont work, and restarting the
 game didn't work I&nbsp; decided to finish the&nbsp; level and when the next level started my hands were still gone. Restarting chapters didn't work either! I've only seen one other thread about this glitch, so it's been happening to a bit of people but at this point
 the only solution is restarting the entire game from the beginning. I'm already like 18 hours in, and do not want to start over. Any help would be greatly appreciated.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39ba4041-2d7d-4b3a-abcd-1428a5686db9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/39ba4041-2d7d-4b3a-abcd-1428a5686db9?upload=true" /></a>

<p>This is no longer a new game as a few months have passed. I have downloaded the game on my One X via Game Pass and after throwing a Molotov, I was presented with the same glitch. I am now at the Yamantau level and the glitch/bug seems to carry over. I have
 restarted the game, then the level, tried previous save games and still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why it's taking so long for a patch to be released and fix this. The game is really good and it's a shame for this bug to ruin the experience.</p>

    <title>ALL my drives have been relabeled so I can&#39;t Boot into the OS&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wingclip  say:</h3>
<h2>            ALL my drives have been relabeled so I can&#39;t Boot into the OS&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Folks,<br />
Two days ago, I had to replace my motherboard and CPU. I've been at it w/o stopping since! I have 4 installed SSD's and the C drive contained my OS and a few Adobe products, (essentially, the C-drive was dedicated to the OS). The "K drive" became the support
 for the various OS software much like a partition if you were to install the OS and all programs that followed over the years, onto the same drive. It's like a support partition to the dedicated OS, C-Drive.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I found out that the 4 drives were identified with different labels than they were before the switch and even the System Reserve partition, (about 78mb out of 99mb), was now labeled. (it never used to have a label like most Sys Res partitions are).
 I noted the drive labels and then switched my original Asrock mobo and CPU back into the case.<br />
<br />
I was sure it would be straightened out but instead, the drives were still labeled wrong! In fact, they weren't even labeled the same as the previous motherboard installation's labels. I removed all but the OS drive and the system now sees it as yet a different
 label than earlier and now shows the System Reserve partition as a "F drive"! It's a mess and I'm trying to avoid reinstalling the OS because it'll reformat the drive/s and "puff" all kinds of programs will be lost, (not to mention my important files).<br />
<br />
I plan to copy those files as soon as I can but I need to get into windows at least in a Safe Mode so I can do that. I suppose I can tr5y to connect my drives to a USB 3.0 port on my other desktop, (this one), but is there a way I can relabel the drives with
 a command prompt? The info I found on line doesn’t work when I tried it. Things like "diskmgmt.msc" or "label F:K", (for example), are not recognized commands in Windows 7, (or, at least that's what it replies when I tried).<br />
<br />
I've built about 6 or 7 high-performance desktop systems over the last 5 or 6 years. I've upgraded hardware on many computers but I've never upgraded a motherboard and CPU out of one chipset to a completely different chipset.<br />
<br />
In short, I changed my Asrock Z77 mobo and I7-2600K (both of the "Sandybridge persuasion"), to an MSI Z97 and i7-4790K, (the 4th-gen Haswell/Devils canyon). At one point after I completed the installation process and set the UEFI minimums for a simple boot
 to the OS, I did see a screen that resembles the screen when you press F8 so you can select a boot option, (such as Safe Mode).<br />
<br />
However, I was trying to boot from my DVD disc which was the Windows 7 64bit disc I purchased a few years ago so I restarted and was successful in getting the Disc that time. I then followed the instructions in an article I read, (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/repairing-windows-after-motherboard-change/ebcb379b-a7b4-433a-b872-475a934d6b04),
 which I thought was best in order to try and keep the system from getting screwed up in the startup process.<br />
<br />
Well, I think I actually caused the problem when I followed the instructions that involved a command prompt process within the procedure. I'm dead tired and I don't think the mobo is bad... yet. Does anyone see a way to get into my OS without running the "Install"
 option from my Windows Disk? I've been selecting "Repair My Computer" and in that selection, there's a "Load Drivers" option.<br />
<br />
When I clicked on that, I was able to select my computer and that's when I saw the SSD's were all relabeled. It seems like I should be able to do something from that approach into the system, (like maybe drag and drop folders so I can accomplish a limited backup).
 I don't know... I'm tired I guess because this isn't even making sense to me.<br />
Thanks,<br />
Rich<br />

</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1: Try to go into System recovery options </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The system recovery options menu contains several tools, such as Startup Repair, that can help you recover windows from a serious error.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>I would suggest you to go into recovery option using your windows 7 disk and try startup repair. For that you can refer to the link below and go to startup repair section</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>1. Insert the Windows 7 installation disc into the disc drive, and then start the computer.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …". appears.</span></span></p>

            <p>Thank you Ashish! Yes, I actually did exactly that in the two days I worked on it. However, it's apparent that I've screwed something up and even a "Successful" system restore operation, (to a restore point that was 7 days previous), would not fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your help and frankly, I've had to face facts and accept that I must do a clean reinstalltion on the OS, (and probably have to buy the key again). It's the only way to be certain of a number of factors. One is that I've yet to boot to an OS
 with the new mobo and CPU. I don't know if the mobo is good or bad. </p>

</p><p>Before I can call the manufacturer, I must attempt a clean OS install and if the installation fails to boot afterwards, then I can call and maybe RMA the board. I avoided the clean install because it will cause the loss of several high-dollar programs. When
 I reinstall them, I may no longer have an acceptable access key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please consider the topic closed because I have far too many variables that may have caused this problem and that I haven't noted in my initial post, (it would have been a long, long story).</p>
<p>Thanks again,</p>

<h2>            Unable to boot - STOP&#58; 0x0000007E  Vista Business</h2>
                    
<p>original title: STOP: 0x0000007E (0xC0000005, 0x8627F872, 0xA1E38A68, 0xA1E38764) Vista Business</p>
<p>Hi, I keep getting the STOP Error Bluescreen every time I try to boot up. It shuts down even in SafeMode and when I try to use System Recovery is tells me no save points exist which can't be the case. I have tried Hardware Memory Check and Repair Computer
 options. None have worked.</p>
<p>Alcohol 120% is the culprit but I cannot see a way of getting out of this cycle of partial boot and restart.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair from the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do<br />
not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friends (they are not copy protected) or make one. Also<br />
your System maker will sell the physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span></a><br />
<br />
Try StartUp Repair from Recovery Options and/or a Vista disk.<br />

<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Vista disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you can try System Restore from the Recovery or Vista disk.<br />

<h2>            Is Windows and Microsoft really going out of business&#63;</h2>
                    I was reading the news on Yahoo that Windows might go out of business is this really true? If so what will happen to Skydrive and Bing? I heard about Bing burning money from Microsoft and will Microsoft lose business as well? I need to know please because
 I saved lots of my files on Skydrive and I would hate to lose them if the Company goes out of business and lose some other good services from Microsoft as well.
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also if Windows and Microsoft go out of business will that affect Rare too? I was a big fan of Banjo Kazooie and I was having hopes for another Banjo game for Xbox 360 according to Wikipedia about the new Banjo game planned.</div>

            Funny there isn't one reply....Microsoft is on top and doesn't care what people think. I want to see another Company give Microsoft some real Competition. I would drop Microsoft so fast

                    <p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>Soy un cliente que pasó de Windows 7 profesional a 10.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Tuve las torpezas que más o menos todo el mundo tenía por diferentes errores del nuevo sistema.
</span><span>Ahora bien, progresivamente cada vez que iba más rápido terminaba colgando obligando un reinicio bruscamente, a través de la fuente de alimentación.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Finalmente instalar el sistema operativo en el modo conservar documentos y reinstalar solo los programas más esenciales para mi trabajo.
</span><span>Empezó a funcionar bien, pero progresivamente en los días siguientes volvía a ser cada vez más lento y volver a colgar.
</span><span>En Julio se instaló el último paquete que salió en Abril del 2008, comenzó a reconocer las tarjetas gráficas, ni de intel ni a nvidia, ahora las reconoce pero sigue yendo muy muy lento y terminando colgando.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Descartar la alternativa de hacer una nueva instalación que ya me haya resultado muy complicado y engorrososo,
 que no me permita perder el lujo de uno solo, lo que implicaría que lo revisara muy bien y el hijo casi 500 gb de trabajo.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Urge a la manera de detectar qué es lo que causa esta lentitud y repararla.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
