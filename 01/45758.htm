    <title>More than Two Gender Option - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            More than Two Gender Option</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an expression of a desired change in the Skype profile settings and not a strict question. Can we please have more than two binary "Gender" options for those who identify as non-binary, genderqueer, bigender, agender, and other forms of gender variance?
 It is 2018 and most major websites and companies now allow for users to identify as more than just "Male" and "Female"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your consideration would be most appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jyoni</p>

    <title>Recorded TV unwatchable in Media Center due to stuttering playback - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rldled  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recorded TV unwatchable in Media Center due to stuttering playback</h2>
                    I think I have figured out the problem.&nbsp; I just don't know how to fix it.<br />
<br />
Symptoms: Recorded TV unwatchable in Media Center due to stuttering playback (every few seconds) and eventual freeze.<br />
<br />
<br />
The facts are these:<br />
<br />
I found out that the shows work perfectly well in Media <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Player</span>.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I then found out that NEWLY recorded shows work without problem.&nbsp; The shows that cause problems were held over from Media Center in XP -- before my install of Windows 7.&nbsp; (They were on my external drive.)<br />
<br />
They are dvr-ms files instead of the newer WTV.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I'm not sure why they won't play in Media Center, though.&nbsp; Might it be a 64bit versus 32 bit problem?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Actually, I think I have solved it!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I tried this with one file last night and 15-20 minutes of viewing I had no stutter.&nbsp; I will try with others tonight.<br />
<br />
It's actually a really stupid and simple solution.&nbsp; Frankly, I have no idea why it WOULD work.<br />
<br />
What I did was: I changed the file extention of the dvr-ms tv files to wtv.&nbsp; THEN, I right-clicked the file and told windows to "Convert to dvr-ms".<br />
<br />
Seems like it might have actually worked.&nbsp; I'll post again after viewing the others.

<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required update, right click, uninstall.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What I would do is wait for the release of the Spring Creators Update any day now, install the Media Creation tool and choose to Upgrade This PC Now to use the most stable method to get to the latest version, which also solves most problems since it reinstalls Windows while keeping your files, programs and most settings in place.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />There's a lot of turmoil with Windows Updates right now, with problematic Updates being withdrawn and rewritten while a half billion PC's are being rescanned constantly to sort them all out.  So unless it's interfering with performance I'd give it a few weeks to sort itself out. 
<br />
<br />If it is interfering or you don't want to wait then there is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can try installing Updates manually from Microsoft Update catalog by searching for them here:   <a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=Windows%2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search....</a>
<br />
<br />If Updates cause problems you can find out which one by checking at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History and uninstall them there.  
<br />
<br />You can block Windows Updates and Version Updates:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3241241/microsoft-windows/its-time-make-sure-windows-auto-update-is-turned-off.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3241241/m...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also install this tool to tell you exactly your level of protection needed for the CPU threat that has lately caused some disruption, how it may affect performance, and what you can do about it:  <a href="https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm</a>
<br />
<br />You can get more control over Windows Updates with some new features in the last two versions at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update under Restart Options and set Active Hours when you don't' want to be bothered.
<br />
<br />As a last resort, you can set a Metered Connection or disable Windows Update service and only install the Version Updates twice a year when you are ready via the most stable method - which isn't Windows Update anyway, but by running it from Media Creation Tool or the media it creates:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  All previous Updates are rolled up in the Version Update.
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>Okay, so ever since the update, my console has been constantly disconnecting from Xbox live at random times. When I finally get it to reconnect it only stays connected for an hour tops, then. I have to wait until the next day for it to start working again. When I go to the Set Up Network tab I settings it says there are no wifi options available, and when I go to test network connection it tells me to restart the consoles wireless hardware, but tha doesn't do anything when I do. I know it's not my internet fault because everything else in my house connects fine. Please help&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Video Instability Issues with Tallonsoft&#39;s &#34;Age of Sail II&#34; and &#34;Privateer&#39;s Bounty&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do bear in mind I am 68 years old, have Rheumatoid Arthritis and that I did not have computers from grades 1 through my B.A. in History.&nbsp; What little I know about computers I have had to learn by rote, because computer language
<em>IS</em> a foreign language to me.&nbsp; Many instructions I get for doing downloads and upgrades are gibberish to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been a wargamer since 1950 when I was five.&nbsp; That's a full decade before metal-cast, historically accurate, military miniatures were available in the U.S.A.; coming mostly from the U.K., but now from everywhere!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Along comes computer technology and&nbsp;quickly RTS military strategy and tactical games are available as&nbsp;CDs and downloads.&nbsp; I've been gaming "Age of Sail II" and "Age of Sail II: Privateer's Bounty" by Global Star Software and Talonsoft, the American marketers,&nbsp;and
 Akella, the Russian company&nbsp;that created the games around 2000-2003.&nbsp; I have always had video stability issues trying to use these games with my Windows XP system (Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005, Home Edition, Version 2002, Service Pack 3.&nbsp; I'm also
 using an Intel (R) Core (TM) 2 Duo CPU, E 7300 @ 2.66 GHz and with 2.67 GHz, 1.99 GB of Ram).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do I enjoy naval games about the Age of Sail?&nbsp; I know more about the nomenclature and my way around a sailing vessel than I do about automobiles!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been the winchman of a yacht racing crew, because I had the fastest hands.&nbsp; Now I have R.A., and have to write slow to be legable and have to be extra careful cooking, shaving and driving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to fix the video stability issues I have with these two programs in particular, since I enjoy them the most.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As much as I have enjoyed all the Age of Empires games by Microsoft, none of the naval vessels in these programs move like real sailing ships under real sailing conditions with realistic sailing crews like these Russian made ones.&nbsp; There really isn't any
 excuse for this.&nbsp; Microsoft should at least be able to duplicate any Russian achievement in anything, if not surpass it.&nbsp; This oversight might just be a way of Microsoft&nbsp;condescending to the intelligence of their American customers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I challenge Microsoft
 to surpass these Russian made beauties, ie, allow me more latitude in the creation of a hypothetical sailing combat squadron and include the performance characteristics of Polynesian catamarans and the ability of schooners and fore and aft rigged vessels to
 sail closer to the eye of the wind that square riggers could and allow for square rigged ships to "lock in irons" much of the time, if they're dumb enough to try to tack instead of wear around or gybe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am an old salt of the U.S. Navy, having served aboard the <u>USS Charles F. Adams (DDG-2</u>), that gave its name to the entire class of DDG Missile Destroyers.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Adams is also about to leave the mothball fleet in Philadelphia and be made into a floating
 museum in Jacksonville, Florida.&nbsp; The Hollywood movie, "The Bedford Incident" was shot using one of these DDGs as the Bedford.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had the honor to be part of a "crack" crew aboard the Adams and we raised the bar on anti-aircraft fire and shore bombardment
 standards.&nbsp; I was almost in a Bedford-style incident with a Russian nuclear sub in the Mediterranean in 1967.&nbsp; We armed ASROCs (Anti-submarine Rocket&nbsp;Launcher) for nuclear. &nbsp;The Russians undoubtedly armed their homing torpedos for nuclear.&nbsp; After the President
 and the Premier hung up their red phones,&nbsp; the Russians backed off or there would no longer be an Algiers, Palma, Majorca, or Marseilles, France and the rest of&nbsp;you would all be living in the conditions of the 19th Century, if not the Stone Age after WWIII
 was finished!&nbsp; I would not be here; having been vaporized by one of two nuclear explosions!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried to download Windows XP 9, but I don't even know how to see if it worked, but, for openers, I need the XP's best upgrade.&nbsp; Then, with your help, we can address these video stability issuses I'm having gaming the Age of Sail.&nbsp; A more recent source
 tells me Windows XP 9 is too much for my computer.&nbsp; What is the truth here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm told that there are some patches available made&nbsp;by Talonsoft for these games that will help with some of their video stability&nbsp;problems, but I'm beside myself as to where to find them.&nbsp; The "Privateer's Bounty" sequel to AOS2 won't even go past the briefing
 phase of the game&nbsp;and open a senerio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your attention and help,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael England</p>

            To resolve this problem, follow these steps, as required:
<ol>
<li>Install the latest update for your game. Visit the game publisher's Web support page to determine whether an update is available. If the game is a Microsoft product, visit the following Microsoft Web site for help:
<div><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?pr=gms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?pr=gms</a>
<div>(http://support.microsoft.com/?pr=gms) </div>
</li><li>The <strong>Minimal Power Management</strong> power scheme may cause issues for some games on some systems. Therefore, you may be able to resolve the issue by using a different power management scheme. Click
<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type
<span>powercfg.cpl</span>, and then click <strong>
OK</strong>. Select a power scheme other than <strong>Minimal Power Management</strong> in the
<strong>Power schemes</strong> box.</li><li>If the issue still occurs, install the latest drivers for your processor. To contact AMD for driver information, visit the following AMD Web site:
<div><a href="http://www.amd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.amd.com</a>
<div>(http://www.amd.com) </div>
To contact Intel, visit the following Intel Web site:
<div><a href="http://www.intel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com</a>
<div>(http://www.intel.com) </div>
Microsoft provides third-party contact information to help you find technical support. This contact information may change without notice. Microsoft does not guarantee the accuracy of this third-party contact information.</li><li>If the issue still occurs, install the latest drivers for your motherboard. </li><li>If the issue still occurs, upgrade the computer's BIOS. For more information about how to upgrade the BIOS, contact the manufacturer of your computer's motherboard.<br />
<br />
<b>Warning</b> If you incorrectly update, or flash, the computer BIOS, you may make the computer inoperable.
</li></ol>
<p>If the issue still occurs after you complete these steps, visit the game publisher's Web support page for help.</p>
<p>Your hardware manufacturer provides technical support and assistance for x64-based versions of Windows. Your hardware manufacturer provides support because an x64-based version of Windows was included with your hardware. Your hardware manufacturer might
 have customized the installation of Windows with unique components. Unique components might include specific device drivers or might include optional settings to maximize the performance of the hardware. Microsoft will provide reasonable-effort assistance
 if you need technical help with your x64-based version of Windows. However, you might have to contact your manufacturer directly. Your manufacturer is best qualified to support the software that your manufacturer installed on the hardware.

            <p>The game publisher seems to be defunct.&nbsp; Game Stop has some patches for "Age of Sail II," but I can not access them, even though I can see them on my screen.&nbsp; They just won't open.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have two versions of "Age of Sail II: Privateer's Bounty."&nbsp; Version 1.0 and Version 1.03.145 recently purchased from amazon.com.&nbsp; This game was released in 2003-4.&nbsp; When I play a campaign game, even after I have destroyed or especially captured the enemy
 ships; in which case they will supposedly be incorporated into my squadron&nbsp;for the next senerio,&nbsp;the game will not end and the enemy still has more victory points than me, even if I have no ships lost or surrendered.&nbsp; I see no way to move on to the next senerio.&nbsp;
 I have read that there is supposed to be an update to this game ...somewhere.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An Age of Sail III was in preparation when the manufacturer went out of business.&nbsp; Matrix Games in Michigan supposedly gained the rights to these games, but will not acknowledge they have them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anybody know anything more about this?</p>

    <title>Central Notification Center for Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haaklong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Central Notification Center for Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Before April 3rd <strong>Microsoft's Outlook.com</strong> was called <strong>Microsoft Hotmail</strong> and when a user signed-</p>
<p>in they had a service called <strong>Windows Live Home</strong>, which acted as a
<em>central notification centre</em> for</p>
<p>your Microsoft-account and gave you the latest updates from your Facebook, My___, Twitter and</p>
<p>various other social networking trafic, it updated you on Microsoft's latest services and the most</p>
<p>noteworthy new e-mails in your Microsoft Hotmail inbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many have complained that Windows Phone 8 lacks a central notification centre similar to Google's</p>
<p>Androids and Apple's iO.S.', these complaints are perfectly reasonable, and since I'm both a Windows</p>
<p>Phone- and an Android-user I'd say that it's a feature I most dearly miss. Microsoft has some experience</p>
<p>with central notification centres so I wanted to suggest to Microsoft to include a future central notification</p>
<p>area for Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, the Xbox One and Windows R.T. based on Windows Live Home,</p>
<p>to make it both ''truly Microsoft'' and <em>unique</em> on its own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apple's O.S. X Mountain Lion has recently ported many iO.S. features (the iO.S.ification of O.S. X) in a
</p>
<p>similar fashion to Windows Phone does to Windows for the destop (the Windows Phone'ification of</p>
<p>Windows?), there are many of (THE FORMER-)Windwos Live's features that are beautifully integrated</p>
<p>in Windows 8, and I wish to thank Microsoft for these features.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A central notification centre would be both a useful and a ''simplifying'' feature for a future version of</p>
<p>Windows (8).</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Activation after BIOS update</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Dell XPS 15 L502x(Sandy Bridge). I successfully upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7. After that i did a fresh install and windows got activated automatically .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, for playing high end games i need to upgrade my RAM and to make higher RAM working i must update my BIOS first. Last night i reverted back to windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is if i update BIOS and install new RAM and after that do a fresh Windows 10 install, what will be the status of my windows? Will it activate automatically or not? and if it will not activate, what are the possible ways to activate it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Nabila,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to be an error with Visual Basic which runs on your startup. It could mean that there are corrupted system files associated with the program. If you recently installed it, uninstall the program from Control Panel and restart your device. Then,
 locate the setup file for Visual Basic to reinstall it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            Hi all;
<div><br />
<div>After adjusting many, many settings on the computer, I have finally found the solution that worked for me:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Reset the settings on the monitor itself. I am using a "Philips 230E" monitor, and as soon as I went into the settings and "reset", all the white "shadows" disappeared!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

 Basics</b>[/quote]<br />
<b><u>Introduction:</u></b> We are the <a href="http://dropshock.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Dropshock Brigade</a>. We are the best the UNSC has to offer. We are the protectors of earth and all of her colonies. We are the fastest, strongest, and craziest in the universe. We are an all volunteer outfit.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Motto:</u></b> <i>"I am an Orbital Drop Shock Trooper. Those words may be used often but we are unique. We are the best trained, best equipped, and craziest outfit in this collection of colonies we call the UNSC. I will defend her to my last breath and
 give my enemies the death that can only be provided under the tread of my black combat boots. I am no normal marine. I push my mind, body, and soul further than most human beings ever will. I instill fear in my enemies as I drop from the heavens like the wrathful
 gods of Greek lore. I show no mercy. I show no fear. I am a UNSC Helljumper and I go feet first."<br />
<br />
"Feet First Into Hell"</i>.<br />
<br />
[quote]<b>II. Enlistment</b>[/quote]<br />
<br />
<b><u>Enlisting:</u></b> There are 3 easy steps into getting into the Brigade.<br />
<br />
<b>1.</b> <a href="http://dropshock.net/register.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Register</a> on the site. Please use your gamertag or something similar to it as your username.<br />
<br />
<b>2.</b> After registering on the site, please fill out the <a href="http://dropshock.net/enlistment.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Enlistment Form</a> and then click submit. Make sure to fill everything out and read the page following the form.<br />
<br />
<b>3.</b> Attain the minimum merit requirement(varies by age). The merit system is a type of points system in which you are rewarded for posting in our forums. You must attain 100 merit before taking boot camp.<br />
<br />
<b><u>Merit Earnings</u></b><br />
<br />
+3 merit per new thread<br />
+2 merit per reply<br />
+1 merit per shoutbox post<br />
<br />
Failure to heed to a warning will result in loss of merit or overall denial of your enlistment request.<br />
<br />
[quote]<b>III. What We Have To Offer</b>[/quote]<br />
<b>Ribbons</b>- In the Brigade, a ribbon signifies a soldier who has achieved a certain requirement and has been rewarded a ribbon for it. These ribbons are shown on your site profile. You may see yours and other ODST's ribbons on the side of each post. To
 receive these awards is a very great honor.<br />
<br />
<b>Promotions</b>- Promotions in the <a href="http://dropshock.net/news.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Dropshock Brigade</a> are given upon either the completion of a training, or the achievement of a quota. Be active, loyal, show leadership, achieve merit, etc and you may just receive a promotion. Do NOT ask for a promotion. Doing so will most likely result
 in a demotion or loss of merit.<br />
<br />
<b>Organization</b>- We are a well organized clan with a <a href="http://dropshock.net/zwar.php?page=members" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Roster</a>. Personnel are organized into divisions based upon where they live, and what timezone they are in. We have a wide variety of forums to discuss different things with other members.<br />
<br />
<b>Gaming</b>- Unlike a lot of clans, we do actually play games with members. We play Matchmaking a lot, the playlist varying on how many members are on. If we begin to get 7-8 or more we switch over to custom games and have fun. We have game nights usually
 around weekends at nights(EST time) and play whatever.<br />

As you can see, we are a very organized clan, and have been around for a while now. It's a great place to meet new friends, learn how to play better, play competitively, or a place to call home. We are the best around, and "We Go Feet First!"<br />

See you on the battlefield.</span></span></span></span></p>

    <title>Folders open up twice in different windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maciekwiecha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folders open up twice in different windows</h2>
                    <p>So I noticed a problem some time ago. It is annoying and I've been looking for a solution but I didn't find it.</p>
<p>I usually open folders through file manager on my taskbar. Then I open up a folder in a quick acces menu on the left.</p>
<p>This folder opens in the same window. But after digging into the last folder, it opens in the new window and even twice!</p>
<p>No, I don't have a 'one-click to open a folder' option turned on. No, I don't have a double-click reaction set too slow. And No, I don't have 'open in separate window' option set - as I tell you, this happens only with the last folder.</p>
<p>I don't know what to do! Nobody on the Internet doesn't have the same issue as I do. I can't do a format because my computer is a sort of a workstation.</p>
<p>All my files on disk C would be gone and overall this is too much work to deal with if I had to do this goddamn format.</p>
<p>Does anybody know how to fix this annoying thing?</p>

<p>Hi Maciek,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could have happened due to the corrupted Windows component. To resolve your issue, we suggest that you run SFC and DISM. You can follow the steps provided by

<p>Hi Maciek,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know more information since the issue still exist after doing SFC and DISM. Please answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you have tried clicking <strong>Restore Defaults</strong> in <strong>Folder Options</strong> under
<strong>General tab</strong>? </li><li>Have you tried moving the affected folder to a different location and check if it will do the same thing?</li></ul>

<p>Restore Defaults didn't help and changing the location of the folder don't make any sense because it happens to every folders in quick acces tab.</p>

<p>Since using Restore Defaults in File Explorer Options did not fix the issue. We suggest that you check and install the latest Windows updates by going to
<strong>Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates.</strong></p>

<h2>            Halo 2 permission problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. I have already seen A post like this here but it didn't help, so I am asking again.</p>
<p>I have a problem with halo 2 vista where, after rebooting my computer, the game no longer appears in the 'Games' part of the taskbar, and when I go to where halo 2 is installed (D:\Halo2, in this case), all the files say I do not have permission to access
 them. Yes, I've tried 'Run as administrator'. It didn't help. Whenever I click the Play button from the startup program in the disc, it says 'Failed to launch selected application, you do not have permission to access this file'. Yes, reinstalling fixes the
 problem but when I reboot it comes back, and I don't want to reinstall too many times because I have heard halo 2 has an install limit. What should I do? Thanks.</p>

<h2>            can the user profile account folder be renamed instead of creating a whole new user account</h2>
                    I've seen this question posted everywhere none of which got the answer the person posting was seeking.&nbsp; The question basically is "Can the user profile account folder be renamed?"....&nbsp; I have the same problem.&nbsp; I sent a PC in for repair.&nbsp; They reloaded
 operating system and created new user account test.&nbsp; Instead of just creating a new user account I renamed the test user account NAME.&nbsp; I couldn't help but notice later that the user account folder name stayed the same "TEST".&nbsp; That's why you have people asking
 the question "can the user profile account folder be renamed instead of creating a whole new user account.&nbsp; That is a easy fix but doesn't answer the question.

            It isn't usually. If you have an IT person, why not just have him/her take care of it for you instead of fretting over it yourself? ;-)<br />
<br />
Try this instead if you really need to do this yourself:<br />
<br />
1. Create a new administrative account. Call it "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like. You definitely want to have an administrative user account like this set up that you will not use except for emergencies. You will use it to elevate privileges in your daily
 account - which will be a Standard account - but will not need to log into CompAdmin after this copying business unless Something Goes Terribly Wrong. ;-)<br />
<br />
2. Create a new Standard user account for your daily work. Call this something that makes you happy. I don't know your real name, so I'll just call it "HDXer". Log into HDXer to create the profile files/folders.<br />
<br />
3. Log into CompAdmin and:<br />
<br />
a. Control Panel&gt;All Control Panel Items&gt;Folder Options<br />
<br />
b. Click the View tab, click Show hidden files and folders, clear the Hide protected operating system files check box, and then click OK. Now you can see Everything.<br />
<br />
c. Using Windows Explorer ("Computer"), locate the C:\Users\Test folder.<br />
<br />
d. Select all of the files and folders in this folder, except the following files: Ntuser.dat, Ntuser.dat.log, and Ntuser.ini.<br />
<br />
e. Click the Edit menu, and then click Copy. If you don't see the Edit menu, press ALT.<br />
<br />
f. Locate the C:\Users\HDXer folder.<br />
<br />
g. Click the Edit menu, and then click Paste. If you don't see the Edit menu, press ALT.<br />
<br />
Log off, and then log back on as HDXer. All your stuff should be there. You will need to set up your icons and Desktop wallpaper (Control Panel&gt;Personalize) and a few preferences won't have been carried over, but really except for the email all your data, favorites,
 etc. should now be in HDXer.<br />
<br />
If you have e-mail messages in an e-mail program, such as Windows Live Mail or Thunderbird or Outlook, you must import your e-mail messages and addresses to the new user profile before you delete the old profile. Since I don't know what you were using for email,
 I can't give you specifics about that. If everything is working properly, you can delete the old Test profile using the User Accounts applet in Control Panel. It will not hurt anything for you to leave Test on the system for a while, or even forever.<br />

    <title>HDMI handshake issue. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gamer3 8  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDMI handshake issue.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Sony KDL-40S4100 and the Xbox 360 Slim. &nbsp;The kind that did not come with a HDD, just the 4 GB internal memory and I added in the 250 GB HDD. &nbsp;When I use an HDMI cable, it used to work fine, but now it does not want to send an audio or video signal.
 &nbsp;My TV is set to only let me select inputs if there is a signal there. &nbsp;When I select the input that my 360 is plugged into, I change to the input, but there is no audio or video. &nbsp;I've tried all 4 HDMI ports on the TV with the same problem. &nbsp;My laptop connects
 just fine to the TV with the same cable. &nbsp;The component cables work just fine, 1080i displays fine on the TV. &nbsp;This leads me to believe that there is a handshake issue. &nbsp;I've tried turning everything off and back on, having the TV on, then turning the 360
 on then plugging the HDMI cable back into the 360 to no avail. &nbsp;Had both devices on, unplugging and plugging the HDMI cable back in to the TV to, but to no avail. &nbsp;Anyone have any ideas on what I could do to resolve this issue aside from just using the component
 cables?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gamer.</p>

<p>Here are some steps you can try. &nbsp;Hopefully this will solve the issue. &nbsp;I've had this problem myself with my xbox and my Wii but was able to correct then with the following steps</p>
<p>Situation</p>
<p>If you experience sudden unexpected complete, (not partial), loss of audio &amp; video, video only or audio only the cause may be an HDMI hand shake problem.
</p>
<p>Possible causation</p>
<p>With the advent of super fast powering up media (source) devices such as a cable box or satellite receiver data can arrive at an AVR and or HDTV too fast. Think of it this way. You have a garden hose with an attached nozzle. When the water is turned on before
 triggering the nozzle the water in the hose is backed up. Once the nozzle is opened the backed up water rushes out at an above normal force. This is what happens when a source device using an HDMI cable powers up before the AVR and or TV. The data backs up
 in the HDMI cable. Once the AVR and or TV are completely powered up the oncoming rush of data may cause a disruption, i.e. HDMI hand shake issue.</p>
<p>Correcting a hand shake problem</p>
<p>Disconnect the source devices HDMI cable from the AVR and from the AVR to the HDTV. If the HDMI cable is routed from the source device directly to the HDTV disconnect the HDMI cable from the HDTV. Wait 10 to 20 minutes then reconnect the HDMI cables. IMPORTANT!
 Power up the AVR and HDTV completely before the source device. In most instances this should resolve the hand shake issue.</p>
<p>Preventing a hand shake issue from re-occurring</p>
<p>To prevent future hand shake issues ensure the AVR is fully powered up before the source device (sat recvr, cable box, etc.). If the HDMI cable is routed directly from the source device to the HDTV ensure the HDTV is fully powered up.</p>
<p>Better yet power up your AV devices in the following sequence - HDTV, AVR then cable box or satellite receiver. This process is very simple if powering up manually. When using a remote you can achieve the same result by programing in power up time delay
 for the source device.</p>
<p>You may need to consult the maker of your AVR, HDTV, source device and remote control for brand specific information.</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer, but I've already done this. &nbsp;I'm no stranger to HDMI issues, I work with HDMI stuff at my job. &nbsp;HDMI over Cat6E and Coax and other baluns. &nbsp;You know, the fun stuff. &nbsp;I'll give it another shot, but my 360 is plugged directly into my
 TV. &nbsp;It used to work no problem. &nbsp;Now it's just the HDMI out that doesn't work on my 360, the component works fine. &nbsp;My laptop sends out a HDMI signal using the same cable and on the same input on the TV. &nbsp;It's the fact that when my 360 is on and connected
 to the TV through HDMI, my TV detects a signal of some kind, as I am able to select the input (my TV does not allow you to select an input port that does not have a signal inbound), but there is no audio or video at all. &nbsp;This leads me to believe that there
 is an HDMI handshake issue or the HDMI port is going out all together.</p>

            <p>Hey Gamer3 8! Thanks for the detail in your post! It sounds like it may be a faulty HDMI port, but just to be sure - are you able to try your console with a new TV? If it doesn't work, then it would be time for a repair. You'd be able to get the ball rolling on that by going here: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/repair/repair-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/repair/repair-process</a>&nbsp;Either way, we'd love to hear what the result was!&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Sleep option has disappeared from the power icon on the Start menu - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sleep option has disappeared from the power icon on the Start menu</h2>
                    The Sleep option on the Power icon on the Start menu has disappeared. How do I get it back? Also the option for setting how long (in minutes) the computer should remain idle before entering Sleep mode is gone as well. Where did that go?

<p>Since the sleep options are tied to the Video adapter drivers, open Device Management and check what you show for the type of Display Adapter.&nbsp; If it shows a Basic Microsoft Adapter you need to update that driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Device Manager can be opened by right clicking the Start button.</p>
</blockquote>
You nailed it. It was the display adapter driver. Thank you. Genuinely appreciate you help with this problem.
