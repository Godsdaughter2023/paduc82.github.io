<h2>            &#34;Failure when attempting to copy boot files&#34;</h2>
                    <p>So it all started with my laptop getting the "An operating system wasn't found" error when trying to boot up Windows. I'm using instructions from here: https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/kb/3103656</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got to this part: "<strong>bcdboot C:\Windows /S C:</strong>" but when I enter that into command prompt, I get the&nbsp;"Failure when attempting to copy boot files" error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Bought it once, now they want me to buy it again... Why should I buy anything else from the Marketplace ever again&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Just got off the phone after 40 minutes of trying to re-unlock a game I purchased in April 2010. I played this game on my gamertag, I have unlocked achievements that show on my tag/profile, and I have a saved game in memory. I played it when I bought it
 and then didn't come back to until Dec. 2012. In the interim, I bought a newer slim Xbox to replace my old Elite, which was working fine when I traded it in. Everything else that I've bought since 2005 transferred fine ( as far as I can tell ) but for some
 reason this one game only wants to let me play the Trial version, ignoring the fact I have a saved game stored on hard drive. &nbsp;And somehow there is no record of me ever having downloaded it before, demo or full purchase in my Download history. I did everything
 the support site suggested, and did it all again with the support guy on the phone, even waiting on the phone with him while it redownloaded. I still only have access to the Trial version, and he says I'll have to pay for it again to be able to play the full
 game. THIS is one of many reasons I and others I know are very dubious when it comes to downloading a game. For all of the supposed convenience of filling precious space on my hard drive with a game that I wanted at night when the stores are closed or that
 is only available on the Marketplace, the idea that I can be locked out of something I purchased is ridiculous. It's bad enough that if my Internet Connection is down all my DL'd games and worse, DLC for my physical games becomes unusable, but now I'm being
 told to spend the money again for something I already own. This is not right, and it makes me feel like a sucker for ever having bought anything from Xbox's Marketplace to begin with, and extremely hesitant to do so ever again. I shudder to think what the
 case would be like if I lived in an area with poor to none at all Internet service. I'm officially complaining because according to the support guy, other than repurchase this game and waste money I really don't have at the moment, this is my only other recourse.
 So PLEASE, get this digital rights management crap sorted out, and if anyone that can actually help me reads this, please contact me to restore a game that I bought so I don't have to waste money on a game that I already bought, and make me feel safe in further
 purchases, which I would otherwise gladly do.</p>

<p>I just ran into this problem and solved it by doing this:</p>
<p>1. Go to the SETTINGS tab on your xbox live home screen</p>
<p>2.Go into the ACCOUNT option</p>
<p>3. Go to DOWNLOAD HISTORY</p>
<p>4. Find your game you purchased (I had to go back quite some time) and find the game in question, click it and it should bring you to a screen that has the option to download again.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>Scorpio Ed. Xbox One X Shutting Off Automatically - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Scorpio Ed. Xbox One X Shutting Off Automatically</h2>
                    <p>Is something wrong with my console? Are there any known issues with overheating auto shut off protection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My console sits out in the open, using the vertical stand that came with the Scorpio Edition.&nbsp; I have about 4 1/2 inches of distance between where the air vents out of the console to a wall.&nbsp; The inside air temperature ranges from 71 to 76 degrees.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fans in the console work, and while I have heard them kick into a higher setting, the last two times my device has shut off and given me the overheat warning upon start up: The fans were not operating at this higher setting.&nbsp; Before I restarted my console
 I felt the outside of the case and while it was warm... It did not appear to be running "hot."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I play Destiny 2, and the people I play with are all through Xbox Live.&nbsp; Most have the X version.&nbsp; There is only one other person on my friends list that seems to have this problem.&nbsp; While it does not happen frequently, it tends to happen at the same points
 in the game play.&nbsp; Unfortunately, these are multiplayer situations and hard to reproduce on my own.&nbsp; Solo play has given me no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, the two places I recall, are also not the most graphically intense or hard processing encounters...&nbsp; Spire of Stars Damage Phase and The room opening the portal into the Dreaming City have given me issues.&nbsp; I have had no problem during Escalation
 Protocol leveling or other more graphically intense processing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done a soft reboot.&nbsp; I have used my Blue Ray player occasionally. It is directly plugged into a wall outlet.&nbsp; I never had an issue with my old Xbox One.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like the X overall, but this aspect has been frustrating.&nbsp; If others I have played with have experienced this, I might shrug it off.&nbsp; I'd like to know if there is something (like after market usb fans) or something I could do? Is this hardware? or software?&nbsp;
 All I know is that it shuts off... black out.</p>

<p>Hi Austin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After thoroughly reading your post I do have one question I would like to clarify.</p>
<p>Since it tends to happen during game play, would your game Destiny 2 be a digital or disc game?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when you mention doing the 'soft reboot' do you mean the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Soft Factory Reset</a>? Which means resetting your Xbox One X to factory defaults but keeping your games and apps?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon to resolve this asap :)</p>
        </p>

<p>I purchased and use the Digital Copy of the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was about a month ago, so I can't promise that was the exact process, but the steps on the link for Soft Factory Reset look correct.&nbsp; I did not reinstall any games or apps, but it was reset not just powered off and on.</p>

<p>Hiya, Austin!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from Xbox Forums Team here to assist, after reading all of the information provided I have a quick question that just needs to be verified. After the soft factory reset is the console still shutting off unexpectedly? If so I recommend doing a Full factory
 reset where you uninstall all the games and apps. Please keep us updated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Gaming!</p>

<p>Hi Austin, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did want to ask, aside from Destiny 2, was there any other games that have caused the console to "overheat" and shut down?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it can be frustrating when the console does not perform the way it should. I would recommend checking out how to

 A year or a day from now, I've yet to meet anyone that games daily who gets by unscathed.&nbsp; It's just hard to swallow 2nds on the main course...</p>

<p>Hello Austin, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you have a local official Microsoft Store in your area, You could always just take your Xbox in person&nbsp;to get checked on, repaired
</p>
<p>
</p><p>or replaced. That's definitely quicker than sending it in especially if you're still under manufacturer warranty.

    <title>Mouse Clicking Issues Persist&#59; Why&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kimisland  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse Clicking Issues Persist&#59; Why&#63;</h2>
                    For the past 4 to 5 months my mouse functions have declined significantly. When I click my mouse in FB or can be in any other page on the internet, instead of it working where I click it, it clicks on something totally different, an icon or graphic in
 the background or something I haven't even chosen. Until I updated Win10, Edge, i.e., over the past several months, my Dell PC system was working perfectly, but as the updates gradually were added, my mouse no longer works properly. It clicks many times even
 when I am searching for or saving documents, it will jump to another folder or save in a name when I wasn't done putting in the actual name of the file. When I click to close pictures/photos, or another program, it closes all my Edge windows that are open.
 It clicks all over the place. I have uninstalled and re-installed my mouse, and unplugged and plugged it back in to no avail. I just need a fix to cure all. The techs really need to get on board because this situation is escalating.

            Hi Kim.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Change the batteries if wireless, try another USB port, reset mouse from button on bottom if available.
<br />
<br />Try the mouse in another PC to isolate if it's the mouse or Windows causing this.
<br />
<br />Try another mouse in this PC to confirm if Windows is the problem.
<br />
<br />Access the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Mouse, then Driver tab. First try Update this Driver &gt; Automatically, then Roll Back if available. If not choose Uninstall button, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Is there mouse software installed in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features? Uninstall it to see if the problem stops. This is unneeded bloatware.
<br />
<br />Adjust the mouse settings in Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Mouse, checking all settings including the Additonal Mouse Options box - check Settings on all tabs.
<br />
<br />Report back all results for possible other things to try.
<br />
<br />To check if Windows is causing this you can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-fresh-start-feature-in-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I looked through the forums and youtubes and every "fix" failed</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far:</p>
<p><strong>Startup Type: Automatic.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Start Status: Running.</strong></p>
<p>Thats not the issue.. I also tried downloading RealTek again but it failed to find the "device" Under playback the only option I have is HDMI even the earjack does not work!</p>

<h2>            Microphone not picking sound in Skype for Business.</h2>
                    Our built-in microphone does not work in a Skype for Business calls, no audio is detected. Windows still indicates the system is receiving audio input. The mic works with other applications. The Dell laptop is a Latitude 7480 is running Windows 10 1803,
 Office 2013 and the Realtek High Definition Audio Driver version 6.0.1.8351 or newer is installed, including the latest driver on Dell support site 6.0.1.8403. We have also updated to the latest bios 1.12.2. Downgrading the Realtek High Definition Audio Driver
 to version 6.0.1.9237 (Dell A09, 12 Oct 2017) fixes the issue. The issue can be replicated on multiple Latitude 7480 machines, and also 7280 machines. Realtek haven't release a driver since April. Is there a solution other than avoiding the driver from being
 updated?&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi Peter,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for your details. Based on your description, the Skype for Business client works well with&nbsp;</span>an external microphone which means there is no problems for Skype for Business client to&nbsp;picking sound.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as you mentioned this issue is occurring on multiply devices with the same driver. So, to confirm if this issue is caused by some background programs conflict with the Lync client or because the Lync client is not compatible with your computer's microphone,
 you can<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> perform a clean boot in Windoes</a> to see if there is any difference.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, here is a reference article for you to do more troubleshoot about this issue:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/troubleshoot-lync-audio-68d84cf2-5d8c-4c91-bda6-69755f3fa165#bkmk_lync_doesnt_recognize" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot
 Lync audio</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, since the&nbsp;support for Lync 2011 already ended, therefore, we might not be able to provide any further official support. We highly recommend you to use Skype for Business 2016 to get better user experience and you will always receive bug fixes and
 security updates in the latest version of Office products. For your reference:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/install-skype-for-business-8a0d4da8-9d58-44f9-9759-5c8f340cb3fb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Install Skype for Business</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding.</p>
<p>

                    <p>I've tried the several options to kick in the Windows 10 upgrade, but so far no success.I've tried the /updatenow thing and tried running the media creation tool (MCT), but nothing seems to happen. No message. No process to kill. Nada.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for the heck of it I've unpacked the MCT and after running it I found a Source folder in which there was a Panther folder with some log files stating:</p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">When I tried reinstalling Acronis True Home, some time ago, I also had the 8007005 code in the error message, when it fails to install. With some searching the only thing that I could distill from all of it was possibly corrupted

</p><p class="contentStandard">Although I prefer to resolve <em>this</em> and be able to upgrade from my current setup with all my applications and games than a fresh installation, one last final solution could be reinstalling Windows 7, from scratch, and then

            <p>Interesting thing with the Samsung SSD, as I have an 840 Pro, but the the theory is kinda shattered by the fact that the other PC I tried it on with success, has the same 840 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the other person didn't get further than blue screens and error messages, I had like nothing at all. The fact I dug up some error messages was because I extracted the MCT and ran it like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more I think about it, the more I'm considering the final ultimate solution I had, which is what the person in the linked thread also did, which is a format with a fresh install. Interesting thing he mentioned was that he HAD to run the updates until
 that added the "Get Windows 10" application, in order to be eligible for the online Windows 10 activation when you upgrade. Not looking forward to sitting a whole day doing a new installation, then update after update, then the upgrade and THEN reinstalling
 all the applications again.</p>

            I've decided for a complete new reinstallation of 7 and an immediate upgrade from there, so basically a "clean" installation. And that worked.

            I have a solution. Just delete everything in that panther folder and make sure you have an internet connection then try to run the media creation tool. In my case it worked.

<br />Unfortunately, this would be outside the scope of a Windows issue, even though it is related to gaming. Have kept communication with the game developer to investigate and diagnose why you are not seeing the gems and coins?

    <title>Can I install Windows 7 64-bit on external eSATA SSD hard drive as my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff_elucidate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I install Windows 7 64-bit on external eSATA SSD hard drive as my boot OS&#63;</h2>
                    I would like to install on internal, but I also need to run RAID for my data drives for redundancy.&nbsp; I want to us SSD for my OS drive for obvious reasons (speed).&nbsp; But the TRIM command to clean up SSD's is not functional through RAID controllers.&nbsp; I'm
 wondering if Windows 7 will install and operate from a eSATA drive?&nbsp; My BIOS will let me select the eSATA as a boot drive, but I've seen posts that mention Windows OS will not allow you to install on external drives.&nbsp; I also understand the eSATA is 3Gb/s but
 I'm wondering if there are any differences in external enclosure bandwidths?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Or maybe the native Windows 7 ATA-TRIM command does work through RAID controllers?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Alternatively, I could have all drives setup for IDE, then use Windows software RAID controller, but I have to believe that would significantly slow down my data drives, which is less than ideal too.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Any clarity on this would be appreciated.&nbsp; I don't want to go down a $700 path and lots of time if the result is no good.

<p><span><span>Hi
<span><span>Jeff_Elucidate,</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can install Windows 7 on ESATA external drive. Plugin the drive to your computer, go to BIOS and make sure that ESATA drive is set as the default device to boot.
 And during installation of Windows 7 install the required drivers and you must have your Windows 7 installed on ESATA drive.<br />

<h2>            WER files</h2>
                    <p>I have been plagued with WIN7 WER (Windows Error Reports) which appear to be generated by two programs—<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">IntelBCAsvc
</span>and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">CompatTelRunner</span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I can erase the WERs but that’s a nuisance given their volume (about 4 or 5 a day).<span>&nbsp;
</span>I thought I could solve the problem by changing the name of the generating programs but when I tried I got an error message:<span>&nbsp;

<h3> mperut1  say:</h3>
<h2>            My laptop auto updates every time I turn it on but that update fails constantly</h2>
                    As I've said, my laptop says there's an update waiting all the time and when I click on update, it starts the process but then automatically says update failed, restoring previous updates. And that happens every time I try turning it on, sometimes it takes
 3-4 mins to turn it on because of the updates, and sometimes it just doesn't want to turn on and keeps opening the boot menu. My problem is that I can't obviously update it, but I also can't roll back the update since it's been longer than 10 days, so is there
 any way to fix this without reinstalling Windows?

<br />
<br />3. If this is a normal KB update -
<br />You can download the updates from Microsoft Catalog and update manually. Switch off your internet before you start updating. Disable any third party antivirus which you should enable after the update. Search for relevant KB in the Catalog.

            What error code do you get?
<br />The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:

<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

    <title>Fluctuating Time Zone Setting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leonbray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fluctuating Time Zone Setting</h2>
                    <p>My time zone setting is fluctuating regularly. It had been set to my local time zone, but has fluctated to a range of adjacent time zones over the last two weeks</p>
<p>
</p><p>These have all been verified by checking Outlook Calendar entries</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original time zone was Brisbane</p>
<p>it then changed to Sydney, Melbourne</p>
<p>about a week later it changed to Vladivostok</p>
<p>and today it changed to Darwin</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not made any changes to settings in this time (I picked up the issue from Outlook Calendar entries)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have changed the setting to Brisbane and turned off set time automatically</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any suggestions</p>
                </div>

            The only way it stops changing the time zone is to have "set time automatically" set to off. If I set it to on, it will change the time zone from Brisbane to either Darwin or one of the other UTC +10 time zones

    <title>Recieved a replacement console and forgot my game disc in the console - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Recieved a replacement console and forgot my game disc in the console that i sent back</h2>
                    
<p>I recently had the problem of my xbox one making a squealing/cricket noise. I recieved a replacement console in the mail and sent my old one back, but to my dismay I realized that
i left my new far cry 4 game in the console. I called xbox support the same day and the person i spoke to assured me that once they recieved the console and found the disc inside of it that they would send it back
 to me. Now a few days ago i recieved the email conformation that they have my old console back. I called support again and spoke to a representative and a manager who both told me that getting my disc back is not an option and that it is my own fault. Now
 when they recieve the console they will refurbish it and send it back as a new console after checking it out initially, but they are unwilling to send me my disc back or make any effort to. They also said that they wont send me a download of it or credit for
 it. This is total crap that a billion dollar company cant help a person out that forgot a disc or accessory when they send it in. Ive always been a playstation person since 2 of my xbox 360 consoles crapped out and my origional ps3 is still going to this day
 but i figured i would give it another shot with the xbox one and it turns out that&nbsp; its the same story with problems with the console and thier beyond poor support.</p>
<p><br />
Sorry for the long story but is there anyone who knows how i can get them send me my game back so I dont have to buy another $70 game?</p>

<p>Sad that they wont send back your gamedisc. </p>
<p>As for all digital. Digital games can be confiscated (stolen) digitally for a number of reasons, &nbsp;while physical discs repersent 9/10 of the law and therefore cannot be confiscated quite so easily.</p>
<p>Physical ownership of media discs is the^ ONLY way to go. Just dont leave them inside your console when you exchange/sale the console.

<p>The ONLY way digital games can be "stolen" as far as I know is if someone steals your entire account, which is incredibly difficult to do without getting their email and password information first and anyone who gives that away probably deserves to have
 their info stolen due to their sheer ignorance or stupidity.</p>

<p>Considering the instructions on how to send back are VERY clear to remove everything including a disc then it all falls on you. They provide you with a sheet that tells you what to do if there is one stuck. There is no one to blame but you.</p>
<p>And GG all digital also means if you have 10 - 15 games then you have to re d/l them all if you dont have a external drive. That could be well over 250 GB for some people.</p>

<p>fyerball, I do agree it falls with the person sending it in. &nbsp;But, I would like to see MS have something in place for something like this. &nbsp;I do not think that if my console broke I would have this problem but I have had times where I was trying to get so
 much done I overlooked something accidently. &nbsp;And the cost to send the disc back would be very low. &nbsp;Not to mention if the console was being sent in under warranty. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Really it would be simple for them to check the drive when they hook it up. &nbsp;Just a simple check. &nbsp;Not saying it is the repair center responsibility at all but this would be something they should consider doing at least. &nbsp;The sender did realize his mistake
 and called in immediately so they could have contacted repair.</p>

<p>Guerrero &nbsp;MS does have something in place.. it is called simple instructions.. CHECK YOUR CONSOLE before you send. If you left a disc in it after you read or did not read the instructions, it is not MS's fault for a lack of reading comprehension.

<p>@Guerrero &nbsp;I do understand your point. On the flip side how does support know he really had that game? I could have said I had a game when mine went in and it's their word against mine. If you have dealt with warranty repair on a One then you know how big
 of a pain it is. You get an email saying your replacement went out. What they dont tell you is it might still take 20 days after the email before you see it, You really think they will take time to look for a disc?</p>

<p>those delays in shipments are due to the shipping (usually Fedex) email notifications. Once they print a label, it registers on the Fedex site that your package is ready to go as "shipped" even though the label is still in the printer... maybe they send
 it off as ready before it is... by the time the console is checked, tested, repackaged &nbsp;and the label gets placed on the package, it could be a 3 business day (spanning a weekend making it 5-6 days) then 4-5 days to ship..</p>
<p>Trust me I know... I deal with this for a living</p>

    <title>Win8 won&#39;t open PDF files. Says screen resolution is too low and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> whitepawn_23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win8 won&#39;t open PDF files.  Says screen resolution is too low and claims a resolution different than what is displayed.</h2>
                    My understanding is that this is a tablet issue, except, I'm not using a tablet.&nbsp; I don't even have a tablet so one has never been plugged into this machine.&nbsp; I'm using a Dell Desktop.&nbsp; Monitor is 1920x1080.&nbsp; Graphics nVidia650 series.&nbsp; All drivers are
 up to date.<br />
<br />
The fix sends me to display which tells me I'm NOT on my Dell monitor but on a Generic Non-PnP Monitor 640x480.&nbsp; The monitor graphics remain unchanged, however, and I can tell by the visual that in reality I am still sitting at 1920x1080, which is the recommended
 setting for this monitor.<br />
<br />
I attempt to change resolution.&nbsp; Nothing "sticks" such that the app will load.&nbsp; Whatever I set the monitor to, the PDF file still won't open and it still thinks it's on another monitor @640x480.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I do not have dual monitors engaged.<br />
<br />
Solutions, please.&nbsp; I need to open my homework assignment.<br />

<h2>            Opening multiple files with the same extention</h2>
                    <p>I feel stupid even asking, but I used to be able to&nbsp;open many files with the same extension (in this case&nbsp;.xlsx) by selecting them all in File Explorer and hitting enter. Now it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 how do you open multiple files, with the same extension, at the same time?</p>

<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />When I select the files I make a right-click then I hit open and it is working great for me. I did it with Excel and other apps and it's working as it should. Don't you?

</blockquote>
<p>I have noticed no specific extensions, I only open Word and Excel documents this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A while ago I had a problem with file explorer, I couldn't drag-and-drop files (awful for uploading documents to the web). I tried LOTS of ways of fixing it. In the end, I rebuilt windows and changed to Firefox as Chrome seemed to use a lot more memory.
 Somewhere along the way I got my functionality back - or did I?</p>

<p>Thanks Pedro, I should&nbsp; have been more specific when I said I tried lots of things - Scannow and DSM were part of what I tried (there are also a lot of homespun 'solutions' that involve changing settings). I was desperate and did all that...though I avoided
 PUPs (thank you for that bit of knowledge!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran scannow and DSM again and both reported no corruptions, but thank you for the reminder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, the link for DSM only applies to Windows 8, I have found this instruction set for Windows 10.</p>

<p>Hello Storm287,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For us to isolate the issue, please provide us below information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the exact Skype version installed your device? </p>
<p>2. Was the number dialed correctly?</p>
<p>3. Did you dial your Skype To Go / Access number properly from a landline or mobile? You can check the format of your Skype To Go / Access number from your account page.</p>
<p>4. Is the destination number dialed properly? When greeted by the voice menu, you should select option 2 and enter an international number starting with the country code followed by the number itself.</p>
<p>5. Are you sign in to Skype to your account on multiple devices at the same time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your reply.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Settings for TouchPad are in Control Panel - Mouse (there might be several tabs with TouchPad
<br />
entries) and some have a utility that loads in Notification Area near clock on lower right.<br />
<br />
Check with System maker's support, on-line documentation,&nbsp;and/or forums as there probably
<br />
are Hotkeys that enable and disable&nbsp;the touchpad functions. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
</p>
