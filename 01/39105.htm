<h2>            Groove Music does not find music</h2>
                    <p>Groove Music does not find existing music on my HDD. </p>
<p>The OS is on an SSD. </p>
<p>The music files are on second internal Western Digital 1TB HDD.</p>
<p>When I search in Windows Media Player, the files are found and play.</p>
<p>When I search with Groove Music, it says, "Sorry, we didn't find that in your collection".</p>
<p>I've specified for it to search in E:\Music. </p>
<p>I&nbsp;do have a LOT of music on my PC, over 400GB probably, but it's a computer, it should have no problem if I tell it where to look, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The search functions of Groove Music seem rather un-friendly, as the spelling has to be correct and it makes no attempts to find partial words of a title or phrase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried removing other folders from the, Where should it look for music section, but it still doesn't seem to search sub folders or partial file names or something. I have no clue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a final complaint, why does Microsoft choose to put so many half-finished products on the market these days? If it doesn't work, it's not really a product is it?</p>

<p>or you could try playing the music file through windows explorer first (play it with groove when the prompter shows up)... then the whole music in your folder will get refreshed in groove music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>at least that's how I got my music collection shows up in groove.</p>

<h2>            Black Friday discounts not showing up in cart.</h2>
                    
<p>Black Friday sales are not reflecting the discounted price. I wanted to add The Evil Within and Shadows of Mordor (both which are showing 50% off) however when I click on the black Friday deal to buy it still shows full price. If I add something like Valient
 Heart it shows the discounted price. What do I have to do to purchase these at the discounted prices (and yes I am logged in when attempting to purchase).</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem. Trying to buy Shadows of Mordor .. lists in the store as 50%, at checkout it's showing full price and a comment all sales final, so I'd rather get confirmation the discount WILL be applied before purchase.</p>

<p>I never post... but please re-post this! It is long, but essentially I contacted Microsoft customer service over $5! As I bought a game online last for $35, and this morning it is $30 and they would NOT re-credit my account the $5! Thanks Micro$oft! Friggin'
 B-S! (again, sorry about the length, it was an hour long chat with customer service that amounted to nothing)</p>
<p>Here is the chat transcript with customer service;</p>
<p>Edison: at 12:30:25</p>
<p>Hi there! Welcome to Xbox customer support and I am Edison. I will be assisting you with your concerns today. By the way, how are you doing?</p>
<p>Edison: at 12:30:30</p>
<p>Hi, Lee. Sorry for the long wait. We are experiencing a unforecasted high volume of chat sessions. We want to accomodate all your queries as much as possible. Thank you for your understanding and patience.</p>
<p>Lee: at 12:30:46</p>
<p>Hi. I'm doing well thanks</p>
<p>Edison: at 12:31:02</p>
<p>By the way. I am currently reviewing your concern and it seems that you are having an issue with the Shadow of Mordor purchased, right?</p>
<p>Lee: at 12:31:26</p>
<p>Yesterday I purchased Shadow of Mordor on Xbox Live Store on sale for $35. Today on your website it shows a price of $30. Just wondering if a $5 credit is possible?</p>
<p>Edison: at 12:32:48</p>
<p>I see. Let me check on that for you, Lee. First, we will need to check on the actual transaction and then the details for the discounts, please stay with me.</p>
<p>Lee: at 12:32:57</p>
<p>Sure</p>
<p>Edison: at 12:37:49</p>
<p>Thank you so much for waiting, Lee.</p>
<p>Edison: at 12:38:43</p>
<p>Sorry to inform you, the discounted price Game is not transferable, the system will get an error if we process the already purchased game to get the discount since, it was purchased before the discounted price released dates.</p>
<p>Lee: at 12:39:46</p>
<p>Really, by one day (actually a few hours from the sale) and there is no way to just credit the account for the amount?</p>
<p>Edison: at 12:41:32</p>
<p>We understand that, Lee. Actually, I have tried to do that from my end and the system prompts an error. It means that the any purchases that was not settled after the discount release dates may not avail the discounted pricing.</p>
<p>Edison: at 12:41:40</p>
<p>As much as I do not want to tell you this, Lee, but I rather be honest than set wrong expectations.</p>
<p>Lee: at 12:43:19</p>
<p>I appreciate the effort... it just seems odd that there is no other way to credit a voucher or something like that. I understand it's only $5... but I mean I purchased last night at like 10pm.... and it got $5 cheaper this morning.... just seems odd there
 is nothing that can done</p>
<p>Edison: at 12:44:16</p>
<p>I apologized, Lee. But to be sure, let me double check again for you, I just really want to help, I am a customer too at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Lee: at 12:51:10</p>
<p>Ok</p>
<p>Edison: at 12:53:09</p>
<p>Thank you so much for waiting, Lee. I have double checked it from my end together with the assistance from our Billing support team and we're sorry, if the purchased was made before the launch dates for the Black friday deals, the system will get an error
 if we processed it.</p>
<p>Edison: at 12:56:21</p>
<p>Sorry, Lee. I cannot see you typing now. Just want to check our connection. I hope I didn’t lose you yet. Are we still connected?</p>
<p>Lee: at 12:57:21</p>
<p>yes sorry</p>
<p>Edison: at 12:57:32</p>
<p>It's okay, Lee.</p>
<p>Lee: at 12:57:34</p>
<p>just one second... I had a phone call come in</p>
<p>Edison: at 12:57:45</p>
<p>I see. Please take your time.</p>
<p>Lee: at 12:59:49</p>
<p>Sorry about that.</p>
<p>Edison: at 13:00:09</p>
<p>It's okay, Lee.</p>
<p>Edison: at 13:00:12</p>
<p>I'd love to ask. Will there be anything else that I can help you with?</p>
<p>Lee: at 13:02:10</p>
<p>I understand what you are saying about the Black Friday Sales... however I find it disheartening that there is no other solution to this problem. Especially if we factor in that I am a loyal Xbox Live subscriber for the last 7 or 8 years and I have made
 many online xbox purchases though this system. If there is nothing we can do, then that's that... but I feel it's pretty crazy that nothing can be done over a small amount like $5</p>
<p>Edison: at 13:04:48</p>
<p>Sorry, Lee. You know, If I can only override our system and convert your purchased to be included with the Black Friday discounts, I will do that immediately, since, I am also a customer and discounts really matters now a days.</p>
<p>Edison: at 13:06:43</p>
<p>However, if I will do that, I might lose my job. Hope you understand that we need to follow certain policies, Lee,</p>
<p>Lee: at 13:07:00</p>
<p>A credit is fine with me..... I am not looking for a refund, I would be happy with a credit to be used at a later date through the Xbox Store</p>
<p>Lee: at 13:09:21</p>
<p>If that is not possible I would like this conversation submitted to a manager and I would like to be contacted so that I may complain (not about your service, you've been forthcoming and nice) but the general policy for customer service.</p>
<p>Edison: at 13:11:07</p>
<p>I understand, Lee. Just a heads up, you might have the same response with my Manager, however, I will request this chat to be connected with him now.</p>
<p>Lee: at 13:11:18</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>Lee: at 13:15:44</p>
<p>When can I expect to be in contact with the Manager?</p>
<p>Edison: at 13:17:28</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay, Lee. We're requesting it now, just need to wait for the approval from him.</p>
<p>(Manager) Steven: at 13:20:46</p>
<p>Hello Lee! This is Steven, Edison's manager, I see that you have purchased a game before the promotion period came up and is now wanting to get a discount, is this correct?</p>
<p>Lee: at 13:22:14</p>
<p>Yes, I purchased it on sale last night (it was showing as a black friday or pre black friday deal) for $35. Today I saw on the website that it is $30. So I was just wanted to know if I could receive a credit as it was only a few hours ago.</p>
<p>(Manager) Steven: at 13:25:59</p>
<p>I understand what you are telling me Lee, with regards to getting the credit for the promotion we are not able to get that done as promotions are based solely on the promotion window it is on. The price would stand as is and no refunds or credits can be
 given as it was purchased outside the promotion window though it was a few hours away.</p>
<p>Lee: at 13:28:17</p>
<p>wow.... ok. I feel that is a bit ridiculous. But there you go. Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>(Manager) Steven: at 13:29:16</p>
<p>Anything else for now Lee?</p>
<p>Lee: at 13:29:54</p>
<p>No, thanks.</p>
<p>(Manager) Steven: at 13:30:22</p>
<p>From all of us here at Xbox Support, we are truly grateful for your cooperation with us today. Thanks for contacting Xbox Customer Support Lee!</p>
<p>info: at 13:30:25</p>
<p>Chat session has been ended by the agent.</p>
<p>I can't believe that this is how Microsoft treats there customers! I would like this be shared as often as possible. I have been a great supporter of Xbox and Microsoft for many years, but this is ridiculous! If I purchase something at Best Buy and 30 DAYS
 LATER is goes on sale... I can go in, with no hassle and get my money back! I have done this on occasion and it is great. How can Microsoft not provide a similar service.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading,</p>
<p>- Lee</p>

            <p>Leedo, sorry to hear you had such a rough time. &nbsp;I had a similar situation recently where I purchased an item from the marketplace and the next day it was on sale. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I called up phone support (better to do that than use chat for this situation) and explained the situation to them. &nbsp;The also informed me that they cannot do a partial credit on an item. &nbsp;It cannot be done.</p>
<p>What they did do though was credit me the full amount for the purchased item at which time I went back to the marketplace and purchased it again at the discounted rate.</p>
<p>Maybe give that option a try and see if they'll work with you on it.</p>

            Hackerspy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should keep checking with the chipset maker&nbsp;of the sound card for updated drivers.&nbsp; As far as codecs, I have personally used the K-lite Codec pack.&nbsp; I haven't used any others yet but have found that one to be reliable.&nbsp; You can

<p><span><span>Thank you for bringing up your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows&nbsp;10 is a service, which means it's always up to date and your PC always has the latest and best features. The November update, which includes
</span><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=691748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">additional features and improvements</span></strong></a><span>, will automatically download and install
 when it’s available.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to wait for some time and check for the updates. You may also upgrade your PC to Windows&nbsp;10 Version 1511, using the Media Creation Tool:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/C/4/1C41BC6B-F8AB-403B-B04E-C96ED6047488/MediaCreationTool.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/C/4/1C41BC6B-F8AB-403B-B04E-C96ED6047488/MediaCreationTool.exe</span></a></p>

<h2>            Error&#58; 1612 - Feature Transfer Error when tried to uninstall USB Audio&#47;Video driver</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: Error:- 1612 - Feature Transfer Error - I cannot uninstall a specific driver that was installed from a CD.</p>
<p>I want to uninstall a driver for redundant device.&nbsp; I can see it stuck there in my Control Panel/Programs &amp; Features list.</p>
<p>The driver software was bundled on the same CD as the application software that came with the device, which is a GrabMe Video/Audio Capture Stick by AGK Nordic, (who seem to have gone off the radar!).&nbsp; The application software is by ArcSoft who are disclaiming
 on the driver software for the device.</p>
<p>Evidently the software was ill-suited for use with Windows 7 and although patches were available they weren't effective.&nbsp; If I could have my time over again I would have left well alone, but as they say, fools rush in where angels fear to tread and you learn
 only by&nbsp;your mistakes!&nbsp; I have now purchased another device and different software which is configured correctly for Windows 7 and it works!</p>
<p>In my Control Panel/Programs &amp; Features list it is entitled, "USB Audio/Video Driver"&nbsp; I have attempted to uninstall it from here and failed and also by reinserting the CD and that failed too.</p>
<p>When I use the Control Panel/Programs &amp; Features&nbsp;method I get this information/message box:</p>
<p><em>The installation source for this product is not available. Verify that the source exists and that you can access it.</em></p>
<p><em>C:\Windows\Installer\612f7.msi</em></p>
<p>Using the setup CD I am given two options.&nbsp; The first is to repair and the second to remove.&nbsp; This option screen&nbsp;comes up because there is something related to it already on my system, having already installed it, (even though it doesn't work!).</p>
<p>Whether I choose either option my system&nbsp;generates similar information/message boxes.</p>
<p>I have tried both methods of uninstallation with and without the device plugged in.</p>
<p>Basically, they are telling me that:</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">USB Video/Audio Driver</span></em></p>
<p><em>Setup could not find a file on&nbsp;the specified path or disk.</em></p>
<p><em>Please check that the proper disk is inserted or specify a new path.</em></p>
<p><em>Unable to locate file</em></p>
<p><em>C:\Users\BRIANS~1\AppData\Local\Temp\{F2A8ACD9-1F63-4565-82DB-3E07B9F7FE2E}\USB VideoAudio Driver.msi</em></p>
<p>This is the attempt through the Control Panel/Programs &amp; Feature.&nbsp; The path is displayed slightly differently when the attempt is made using the setup CD in that it is:</p>
<p><em>{EAA60D5D-06D8-476F-8875-5D8D6D753EC1}</em></p>
<p>I click on Retry and I get the same message, so I click on Cancel and I get this message:</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Feature transfer error</span></em></p>
<p><em>Error:- 1612.&nbsp; The installation source for this product is not available.&nbsp; Verify that the source disk exists and that you can access it.</em></p>
<p>There is not a great deal I can do here apart from click on OK and abandon the exercise!</p>
<p>If someone can help me I would be eternally grateful but please keep it simple as&nbsp;I am a raw beginner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If screenshots would help you help me I have prepared a couple of Word documents with the procedure I have followed.&nbsp; All I need is someone to tell me how to upload them to the forum because&nbsp;I haven't a clue!&nbsp; If you do need to see the screenshots then&nbsp;let
 me know how to do it and I'll include them in my next post.</p>

<p>I can access everything in Safe mode but any attempt to restore or revert just fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Advanced system restore does not work and ends in error, go back to previous versions same startup repair... nothing,</p>

    <title>Lockscreen Win-Spotlight &#38; Slideshow are not triggering after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edgarvo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lockscreen Win-Spotlight &#38; Slideshow are not triggering after update 1803</h2>
                    <p>Since Update 1803, the slideshow and Windows spotlight do no properly start when the PC is locked or on inactivity.<br />
<br />
Before the 1803 update it was possible to set a Slideshow album, Picture or Windows Spotlight and with WIN+L or on PC inactivity it would switch to the lockscreen and run the pictures
<strong>with the system time, weather-apps, etc. in the lower left corner</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since update 1803 the lockscreen slideshows <strong>ONLY trigger on first system boot</strong>. Afterwards, when the user uses WIN+L or waits for inactivity, the lockscreen displays only the first picture of Spotlight and no slideshow starts. The
<strong>system time is not displayed</strong> anymore.<br />
Setting the lockscreen to Slideshow, the lockscreen will only show a blank screen and not start the slideshow and the
<strong>system time is missing</strong>.<br />
User needs to select a picture from the slideshow album as Picture option first and switch back to Slideshow.&nbsp;<br />
Then, the lockscreen will only display this first picture and not start the slideshow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, after boot up, when the user uses WIN+L, it may happen that the system time and slideshow are working.
<strong>BUT ONLY randomly</strong>. I found no pattern if this works on 2nd, 4th or whatever screen lock attempt.<br />
Most certainly, the <strong>slideshow and spotlight are not working when the PC goes inactive</strong>.<br />
<br />
Furthermore;</p>
<p>Before 1803, when waking the PC from lockscreen, the user did not need to enter his PW in case the lockscreen was triggered by inactivity. Only if the user used WIN+L the start the lockscreen.<br />
<br />
After 1803, the PW is needed in both cases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This really bother me ;)<br />
I posted this in the feedback hub already with captured steps.&nbsp;https://aka.ms/AA1tewq</p>

<p>Yes there is. In Windows 10, "This PC" icon is the same as the old My PC or Computer Icon. When you open This PC, that is where all your hard drives appear and to access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to the person posting this, If you want to increase free space on your 1 terabyte hard drive to more than 119 gigabytes free space&nbsp;left, then you have to move some data to another EXTERNAL LOCATION. Such as; Another Hard&nbsp;Drive, other PC's Public folders
 on your home network, DVD, Blue Ray, USB Stick, Cloud storage, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This PC is just for you to access where data is stored, such as Drive C:\ your system drive or other storage devices or drives you have connected to your PC</p>

<p>LOL, you may have more than 1 partition on hard drive with separate drive letters&nbsp;and you can transfer between partitions or drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This PC is where your storage devices are located or to access them. LOL. </p>
<p>Windows 10 = This PC</p>
<p>Windows 7 and 8 = My PC or similar</p>
<p>Windows XP, Vista&nbsp;= My computer&nbsp;or similar</p>
<p>
</p><p>But regardless here you go.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cfccb41b-1f84-474b-b28a-870efdc63003?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cfccb41b-1f84-474b-b28a-870efdc63003?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>There is the Default Windows "This PC" Icon to access your drives quickly. This or Desktop is just the beginning point in File Explorer.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b932af89-1823-4c68-80a8-b62a15aec8a5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b932af89-1823-4c68-80a8-b62a15aec8a5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know what version he has because he didn't say, but this is the Windows 10 section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You click on it and this is where any storage devices is or connected to your PC.</p>
<p>So usually C:\ Drive is your system drive with OS and all files, unless you connected any other storage devices, and they would be here too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double click This PC or open any File Explorer and This PC and every other location is on left side.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1ed8ded-a05f-4ce1-ab6c-73862ad7cb6e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d1ed8ded-a05f-4ce1-ab6c-73862ad7cb6e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And This PC on Desktop is for accessing System Properties, if you right click it and select properties. Same as "Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\System".</p>

<p>Do a complete&nbsp;Disk Clean UP, including system files, windows update clean up (Excluding install or upgrade log files) and delete all but recent restore point. That could give you a lot of free space. Depends how much to clean up.</p>

<p>Why open Disk Management.&nbsp;Disk Management will not show anything more but additional partitions on the system drive in question. And I doubt they are big enough to hold one movie video as they are most likely for UEFI boot and Windows Recovery Environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just curious, Do you own or have even used Windows 10 or any windows versions. Because My Computer, My PC, This PC have been on all OS's and is the Location to access Storage devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if "This PC" is not a Location, I will eat my shorts. </p>

<h3> gameshoes3003  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t get Windows 7 to identify my printer</h2>
                    
<p>So I have an HP Laserjet 4si MX (yes, it's an old printer).</p>
<p>So I just plugged it in via USB to my computer but it is not being identified as a printer. It's just an "Unspecified Device".</p>
<p>I looked up the HP website and according to what I found Windows 7 should already have these drivers for my printer so there's nothing to download.</p>
<p>So... Windows 7 should already be set up for my printer however it isn't?</p>
<p>I need help with this, I can't keep paying my school to print stuff when I have a perfectly good printer right next to me!</p>

<p>The cable that I'm using to hook the printer up to my computer via USB has no label on it, so I don't know what to say about that. It just hooks up to the end of the printer cable and then I can plug it into my computer with the USB port.</p>
<p>Also if it were to work on XP, which I can just use XP mode for, that won't help me much because the programs I'm using are not compatible with XP.</p>
<p>What then... oh dear.</p>

<p>So I just plugged it in via USB to my computer but it is not being identified as a printer. It's just an "Unspecified Device".</p>
<p>I looked up the HP website and according to what I found Windows 7 should already have these drivers for my printer so there's nothing to download.</p>
<p>So... Windows 7 should already be set up for my printer however it isn't?</p>
<p>I need help with this, I can't keep paying my school to print stuff when I have a perfectly good printer right next to me!</p>

<div><span>How exactly are you using USB to connect this non-USB capable printer to a computer?&nbsp; If you are using a Parallel-USB cable it may not work with Win 7 but would with XP.&nbsp; Give the name of the cable manufacturer.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>If you are using some other device to enable this to work on USB/Parallel or using an add-in card for the printer give the name and model of that device.</span></div>
&lt;/BLO CKQUOTE&gt;
<p>The cable that I'm using to hook the printer up to my computer via USB has no label on it, so I don't know what to say about that. It just hooks up to the end of the printer cable and then I can plug it into my computer with the USB port.</p>
<p>Also if it were to work on XP, which I can just use XP mode for, that won't help me much because the programs I'm using are not compatible with XP.</p>
<p>What then... oh dear.</p>

<br />
<div>You have the USB to Parallel cable and while I used one made by Belarc with XP for many years with a portable printer and my newer XP laptop I was never able to get the cable to work with Vista or Win 7 even set up the exact same way.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One suggestion is that you may be able to find a Print Server device that will hook up to the printer's Parallel port and also the computer network (or even with a crossover Cat 5e Ethernet cable) and use the old printer that way.&nbsp; The
 print server is given an IP address and then the printing computer is configured to find the printer on the IP address.&nbsp; I use this method on my home network for 3 different printers.&nbsp; If you go the print server device route ensure that whatever you purchase
 has at least one&nbsp;Parallel (DB25) output.</div>

<p>I don't have another device to hook the printer up to. Would it be possible to use a virtual pc like Windows XP Mode and hook it up through that thing and put it on the network then access it? I'm not sure if this would work or not since XP mode is acting

<br />
<div>I know that if you had a true XP machine you could share the printer over a network and use it that way as I have with my USB/Parallel adaptor cable.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As I have said, I was never able to get that "quality" adaptor cable to ever work in Win Vista or 7.&nbsp; If you are running in XP mode on the computer you would have to print from that emulation mode also as I don't think you can share
 a printer in emulation mode and then still run a program in Win 7 mode and access the "shared" printer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>While the printer is a good one, it almost looks like it is time for a new purchase of a new laser printer.</div>

    <title>SPOOLSV.EXE - Excessive CPU time Solution - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brooklynparkmikey  say:</h3>
<h2>            SPOOLSV.EXE - Excessive CPU time Solution</h2>
                    <p>Suggestions in several posts for excessive processor usage by SPOOLSV.EXE indicate the C:\Windows\System32\spool\PRINTERS folder should be emptied to solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found another solution that solved my excessive SPOOOLSV.EXE processor usage issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using Task Manager's Resource Manager, I found that SPOOLSV.EXE would continually try to connect to&nbsp;printers that are not attached to my
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">current</span> local network. These printers are located on the local network&nbsp;in another office which I rarely visit. To solve the excessive CPU usage issue, I opened the print spooler queue window for each
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">off network</span> printer, clicked on the
<strong>Printer </strong>menu item, then clicked <strong>Pause Printing</strong>. Immediately, SPOOLSV.EXE stopped using processor time. I will just have to remember to click on
<strong>Resume Printing </strong>should I need to use that printer if I am&nbsp;in the other office in the future.</p>
<p>

            <p>I understand the risks, as have done it before to IMPROVE some features Microsoft has left out.</p>
<p>So, you are not going to tell me. Either way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sure is useful, giving me a picture and the time. A screen that does nothing but waste time.</p>
<p>I can get the time from after I logon by looking at the clock. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What was Microsoft thinking?&nbsp; They need to SLOW the logon time down from Windows&nbsp; 7 as it was TOO fast?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is like REMOVING the REFRESH from the File Explorer as when changing, adding a file, it does not REFRESH itself automatically and I have to END the program, RE-START it again sometimes to get it&nbsp; to REFRESH itself as the REFRESH button is there, but
 can find half the time as it is HIDDEN. Where in Windows 7, it was in clear sight all the time.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You may want to read this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/134620/how-to-disable-the-lock-screen-on-windows-8-without-using-group-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/134620/how-to-disable-the-lock-screen-on-windows-8-without-using-group-policy/</a></p>
<p>It gives clear instructions on what to add to the registry to remove the lock screen, or you can just download their disablelockscreen .zip file, which will basically do it for you.&nbsp; "Be careful with the registry, you can break stuff, etc. etc."...but it
 sounds like you know the drill.&nbsp; The article says Windows 8, but it works the same in 10.</p>

            <p>195I see not purpose of that screen. All we do is press an icon and go to the screen that requires a password. To me, why is not the password the LOCK screen.</p>
<p>Surely is has some purpose, what is it?</p>

            Windows 10 Home apparently doesn't have gpedit; Windows 10 Pro does.&nbsp; But the instructions on HTG are for disabling the lock screen
<em>without </em>using gpedit, and instead either using regedit or just downloading the .zip file they provided.&nbsp; So if you don't mind adding the reg key manually, you can just follow their instructions; if you don't want to mess with regedit, you can just
 run the .zip file and it will add the key for you.

<h2>            Unable to connect  Samsung NP550P5C on a wireless network</h2>
                    Hi Microsoft,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have used the forum discussion and seen several Network issue reported without exact answer to this Problem. I purchased Samsung (NP550P5C-S07AU). It comes with Windows 8 but as a usual problem of learning windows 8 I have reinstalled Windows 7 on the
 machine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since than I am not able to Connect to Internet. I saw yellow mark under device manager for
<b>Ethernet controller</b> and <b>Network Controller</b> as both the driver were not found. I figured out Ethernet driver detail using Hardware ids.&nbsp;</div>
<div><b><u>Ethernet Controller : Solved</u></b></div>
<div>Steps : Right Click on Ethernet controller under Device manager --&gt; Properties --&gt; Details Tab --&gt; Select Hardware id --&gt; search on google and found &nbsp;<b>realtek pci gbe family ethernet controller. &nbsp;</b>Found the online Driver and installation had correctly
 created LAN adapter and my internet works using LAN cable.</div>
<div><b><u>Network Controller:unsolved</u></b></div>
<div>Now when I applied the above method for Network controller I figure out that&nbsp;<b>intel(r) centrino(r) advanced-n 6235
</b>is my Wireless device and I have tried to download the latest version of driver using
<a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/SearchResult.aspx?lang=eng&amp;ProductFamily=Wireless+Networking&amp;ProductLine=Intel%C2%AE+Wi-Fi+Products&amp;ProductProduct=Intel%C2%AE+Centrino%C2%AE+Advanced-N+6235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Intel</a>&nbsp;or even the previous version 15.0. with any driver it fails to update my device under Device manager and it lists Network Controller as Unknown Device.. Tried using samsung website.. not fixed. tried Microsoft auto update drivers and still Wireless
 device is not fixed on the machine.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I found somewhere that microsoft Transport layer tries to look for Intel Centrino driver version 14. 8.8.75. but this driver is not available for download anywhere. I would highly appreciate any assistance with this driver issue.&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Does Microsoft still accept the original Xbox 360 for repairs&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've been using the same Halo 3 Xbox 360 since Christmas 2007. It has probably had to deal with one repair in it's lifetime. It's been overheating lately and I am sure I could fix it myself by vacuuming it and placing it in a less confined place, but just
 in case, does Microsoft still take in the original Xbox 360 for repairs? My Xbox is quite old, and it's held out for a long time now. It's&nbsp;a Master Chief styled Xbox so I don't believe it can die considering it's a Spartan. :P</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes Microsoft still accepts original Xbox 360's for repair. However, the Xbox 360 console you get back might not be the same one you sent in which means you might not end up with the same Halo 3 console you sent in.<br />
<br />
At this point you'd be out of a warranty which means that you'd need to pay $99 for the out of warranty repair service. I would honestly suggest against it at this time, I would just get a new console which is going to be cooler, quieter, and faster.<br />
<br />
But, if you insist on getting it repaired you can do so by going <strong><a href="http://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Heh. My Halo 3 console is still in warranty. They keep allowing me to re-up the extended warranty on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remove the faceplate and HDD before sending it in. You should get a Halo 3 chassis back, but there are reports that they don't always come back with the removable bits attached, including the faceplate.</p>

    <title>My list of things I think we need on the Xbox 360 and or Xbox One, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vf1st wolf pack  say:</h3>
<h2>            My list of things I think we need on the Xbox 360 and or Xbox One, please read Microsoft&#33;&#33;&#33; &#61;&#93;</h2>
                    
<p>So far Microsoft has done a good job keeping me entertained BUT I feel there some things that you guys and gals could do that would make Xbox even better!!!</p>
<p>*Get Final Fantasy 7 on the Xbox 360 or Xbox One</p>
<p>&nbsp; It doesn't have to be graphically remastered, this game is fine as is.&nbsp; I know a new version of it came out for Windows PC some what recently with achievements.&nbsp; If it can be updated for PC without much graphical changes it should be on the 360 and One
 as well.&nbsp; This is the best RPG in the Final Fantasy series.&nbsp; Youll make us all super happy.&nbsp; You will get extra brownie points if the game as unlock-able FF7 side games based on all the Final Fantasy VII games they have released on the cell phone and other
 game systems.</p>
<p>**If you have to add something to make it Xbox Exclusive add a cool secret Kefka boss fight in it.&nbsp; If you do make him harder than any other boss in the game... please</p>
<p>*Speaking of Kefka if you could add Final Fantasy 6 as well.&nbsp; Also add Final Fantasy Dissidia.&nbsp; This is one of the best fighting game series I have ever seen.&nbsp; For me its tied with the Soul Calibar series and the Mortal Kombat series.&nbsp; The fighting is epic
 and you get to play as people you almost never get too, like say Kefka!!! ;)</p>

<p>* My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic Xbox exclusive content.&nbsp; This is a big one.&nbsp; If you guys and gals could make a bunch of high quality very fun MLP games and make some MLP themed Xbox 360s or Xbox Ones you guys will make a huge mint.&nbsp; I bet you may even
 almost catch up with Sonys PS4 in sales numbers if not exceed them a bit.</p>

<p>** To make a awesome MLP video game I think mechanic wise it needs to be a lot like a mix of Final Fantasy VII and skylanders.&nbsp; If you made it so it is canon with the show, had tons and tons of side quests that explore the main characters, the mlp world,
 mlp popular quest characters, and new characters added to this game, along with a amazing epic story (that is also serious while also having the cuteness and comedy you see in the show) you will have a game that will sell so fast that the molds and printing
 presses will burn out like a sun going supernova.&nbsp; It could be a story exploring the MLP multiverse that involves crossovers with the many Human and other versions of the MLP characters.&nbsp; They must stop a threat that may destroy the MLP universe and the threat
 it was coming was hinted at in previous eps of the show and other works as is the key to stoping it...maybe ;)</p>
<p>Its needs to have music and a story as serious and heartfelt as the music here.</p>

<p>This is all fan made and very beautiful in my opinion</p>

<p>**Also take a look at this fan made MLP Xbox gear.&nbsp; Princess Luna is the one depicted in the fandom as being the Gamer followed by Rainbow Dash and Applejack.&nbsp; If you guys made controls and systems with their themes, especially Princess Luna, you will have
 people going nuts to get their hands on these game systems.</p>
<p>Here are good examples</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPvTfDZeglc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPvTfDZeglc</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/sPvTfDZeglc?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/sPvTfDZeglc?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><a href="http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2014/091/a/6/princess_luna_themed_xbox_360_controller_by_cardi_ology-d7clfxv.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://fc09.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2014/091/a/6/princess_luna_themed_xbox_360_controller_by_cardi_ology-d7clfxv.png</a></p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/koqun.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/koqun.jpg</a></p>
<p>**The game systems shown here I would buy in a heart beat, and I would have to buy half those controllers because of how awesome they are.&nbsp; I am not the only one ether.&nbsp; If you guys couldn't have this all be exclusive to Xbox you at the very least get your
 hands on Princess Luna as a Xbox exclusive because of her status as being the gamer of the group and she is one of the most popular characters of the show ever.
</p>

<p>*Speaking of Princess Luna... Since she is known as the ultimate gamer of the series and she is depicted loving HALO a lot and other games could you have dlc for Princess Luna exclusives in your games.&nbsp; The fans will love it.&nbsp; I would love to have Spartan
 armour that has her style of hair on it or just anything that based on her, even just emblems.&nbsp; Heck it would really be super cool if you guys got Tabitha st. Germain to do lines for a Princess Luna spartan or any other Luna thing in whatever game she is a
 guest in.&nbsp;&nbsp; The kills have been DOUBLED!!&nbsp; The Kills have been TRIPLED!!!&nbsp; The Killing spires have COMMENCED!!! (character get killed, the person doing it gets a killjoy) everyone hears this dialog though

<p>*MLP fans and Luna fans will love you guys for it.&nbsp; Also please add her, or at least have a talk with people who make exclusives for Xbox, to other games like World of Tanks, Mega Man (she loves Mega Man / Mega Pony)&nbsp; Star Wars Battlefront EA.&nbsp; Its not fair
 that the Windows PC crowd can have Luna in all their games including World of Tanks, HALO, Team fortress 2, all the Call of Duties and so on.&nbsp; Your platform gamers will love you for it esp if they are fans of MLP and their are a lot of us 5 mil I believe as
 was estimated in a MLP documentary.</p>

<p>*Please release all of the Mega Man games, especially Mega Man 1-10, Mega Man world 1-5, Mega Man Power Battle, Mega Man Power Fighter, Mega Man and Bass.&nbsp; If you can added every Mega Man game into this collectors set, including Mega Man game gear, Mega
 Man pc 1 - 3, Mega Man battle and chase.&nbsp; Mega Man rock board.&nbsp; And too make the MLP crowed happy throw in the fan made Mega Pony game.&nbsp; It is a freaking awesome game.&nbsp; I like it more than Mega Man 1, Mega Man 4, Mega Man 6, and Mega Man 9.&nbsp; The other I didn't
 mention I think are epically awesome.&nbsp; I know you guys can add fan made games too your shelves because Nintendo added "The Angry video Game Nerd" fan made game to their digital store.
</p>
<p>Check this game out IT is so AWESOME!!!&nbsp; It doesn't feel like a fan made game and everything is perfect, the level design, the story, the music!!!&nbsp; And like the later Mega Man games you can alternately play as other characters with different play styles.&nbsp;
 You can even play as classic Mega Man!!!</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FuUepDcGNcc</p>
<p>I wouldn't mind a graphic over hall but could you add the same feature that was added too the HALO remakes?&nbsp; The ability to switch new to old graphics and music in a flash is AWESOME!</p>
<p>*Also could we get Mech Warrior 1-4 (add-ons too) or more on the 360 or Xbox One?&nbsp; This would make so many Mech Warrior fans happy, I wouldn't even care if they got a graphics boost, they are just so fun to play that the graphics don't matter too much.</p>

<p>*Heres a real big one.&nbsp; You got to have Star Wars: TIE Fighter and all its add-ons on the Xbox 360 and or Xbox One.&nbsp; We haven't had a proper re-release of it and if you guys had this as a Xbox exclusive you will make so many fans of many different types
 happy.&nbsp; It is considered the best Star Wars game ever.&nbsp; It constantly wins the award of best game ever even when compared to current games, it is also in the game hall of fame.&nbsp; If you do you got to release a good flight stick with it.&nbsp; HECK even better, release
 a flight system that is based on the TIE Interceptors pilots interface and have it come with a collectable helmet and you guys will make a mint and fans die happy.&nbsp; Flight game fanatics love this game as well.</p>

<p>*Adding Alien vs Predator 2 is also a great idea because it was one of the most fun FPS games ever, and the story is fantastic.</p>

<p>*Last two suggestions are for Kinect games.</p>
<p>**One people have complained that it isn't possible to have a Real time strategy game on a consul BUT I think you guys should try making one that uses the Kinect hand gesture and focal commands to control the game.&nbsp; IF you use grid point references it could
 help control your units.&nbsp; You could all out units like you give out commands in chess.&nbsp; NOD Commando unit G5 attack GDI Mammoth at M2 from cover.</p>

<p>*Last I think you guys should make a "Robot Jox" Kinect video game.&nbsp; Just look how they control the mechs in this video and you'll see that the Kinect should be able to handle it well.&nbsp; I would sell the game with controls similar too what you see the Pilots
 using in the movie.&nbsp; But look at the possibles.&nbsp; You could have a mech that can be upgraded with many different weapon loadouts and other systems that enhance it performance, as well as using different mechs that can hold more equipment and just have different
 natural capabilities that isn't the same as others.</p>
<p>Just watch this whole video and tell me that this movie wouldn't make a good kinect game based on the fight sequences.</p>
<p>If you need too skip ahead to only watch the fight it starts at 1:46 but I think the whole movie is cool and recommend watching all of it to get the point I am making about a Robot Jox Kinect game.</p>

<p>Yes I did and they are all great ideas, especially your Star Wars and Halo ideas :) If you are offended by my last forum post, I apologise and meant no disrespect. MLP is enjoyed by many different audiences and making a Game would be a good idea. Why Hasbro
 hasn't jumped on it already is surprising. You can get MLP monopoly and they have released a couple of DVD movies. Imagine a music game like guitar hero crossed with the Rainbow Rocks movie.</p>

<p>So basically you want My Little Pony and a load of remakes and PS ports. &nbsp;And Tom Clancy already did the voice control RTS thing. &nbsp;It was ok but useless if you wanted to be in a party. &nbsp; &nbsp;Far as im concerned all My Little Ponies should be piled up and burnt.</p>

<p>What I would like from Xbox 360 to be on Xbox 1, is the following:</p>
<p>The Xbox Guide Menu back. Chatpad. Avatar Store. Your Avatar to be incorporated into the Friends pane like Xbox 360's Social tab, on the Dashboard instead of locked up in a Windows 8 Avatar app. Also games which involve your Xbox Avatar like A World of Keflings.
 Be able to turn off controller vibration. And play music in the background while playing games like Xbox 360 can do. Xbox 1 is an "Xbox" console after all. I don't really mind about the music feature as I don't use it, but others would like it back. I love
 COD BO2 zombies on Xbox 360. COD AW zombies isn't quite the same. Also Halo MCC should have the Halo 4 Heavies Halo 4 Big Team and Halo 4 Flood playlists. Many love things from Xbox 360 which Xbox 1 may not have. It would be great if Microsoft continues to
 incorporate things from 360 over to Xbox 1, like change the dash background and voice messages. Xbox 360 is far from dead.

<p>I would like Final Fantasy X-2 on the Xbox 360 or Xbox One because I've only owned Xbox consoles. &nbsp;I love the whole "dressing up to change your character class" idea and this song absolutely rocks...</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiXcL06P3ko" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.youtube.com/watch</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/oiXcL06P3ko?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/oiXcL06P3ko?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>and I would also like to see a " Fashion designer type " game on the Xbox One (but I know that this will only happend if Hell freezes over and pigs fly).</p>
<p>I've never seen " My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic " because I am more into Hannah Montana, iCarly, and the Disney Channel in general (yes, I know that iCarly is not Disney).</p>
<p>I enjoyed "Aliens vs Predator" on the Xbox 360, but the story mode of each race (Human, Xenomorph, and Predator) needs to be longer. &nbsp;I liked "Aliens Colonial Marines" more than "Aliens vs Predator".</p>
<p>Have a nice day or afternoon or night "VF1st Wolf Pack" &nbsp;:)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Sound and user profile switching</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to the latest Windows 10 build (not insider build), I've been having an issue where Windows doesn't want to play sound until the sound card was deleted from device manager and then reinstalled. Strangely though, it normally seems to be specific
 to one user account, usually my mothers - more than once I've switched back and forth between the two accounts, getting sound on one account but not the other.</p>
<p>Today it was my account that had no sound though, with her signed on in the background. As soon as I signed her off, I had sound again, which makes me think that this is the problem - if there are two accounts signed in, the first will "lock" the sound card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how to fix this? Other than the obvious one of not having multiple users logged on at once!</p>

            Hi, Dave7X,
<br />
<br />Enable Media Sharing
<br />Access Control Panel.
<br />Type media in the top-right search box and open Media streaming options from the results.
<br />Click Turn on media streaming.
<br />
<br />Both users will hear sound.

            That option doesn't sound relevant - that's for sharing my music and whatever across the network. The issue is that the second user logged on cant get any sound at all, not that we need to stream a file from one user to the other. I've turned it on anyway
 to see how it goes (ive just switched and the sounds working, but its an intermittent problem anyway)

            What is the make/model of the computer?
<br />
<br />Are you saying Media Streaming worked for sound on both accounts?
<br />
<br />Right click on Start &gt; Select Device Manager
<br />Uninstall Realtek sound drivers

<p>im saying the sound worked when ive just tried it, but whether that has to do with turning that setting on remains to be seen, its an intermittent problem anyway</p>
<p>
</p><p>the computer isn't a shop bought machine, its a custom build - the motherboard is an asus rampage ii gene</p>
<p>
</p><p>ive been using the device manager to reinstall the sound driver (its not a Realtek driver, its just listed as high definition audio device - I cant remember what the card actually is offhand). it fixes the problem n the short term, but it does come back</p>

<p>Hi TRBesser,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you found a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, I've turn off fast startup; it was leaving other users logged in.</p>
<p>Now when I restart works fine but I'm trying to find a final solution to avoid restating and force to log off other users that may have unsaved files open.</p>
<p>In case you haven't tried, here is a screenshot that guides you where to find that option in Windows 10.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Window 7 Home Premium &#34;User Profile Service service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded.&#34; </h2>
                    
<p>I have followed the advice of varios Fora on this issue and have been able to troubleshoot the problem. Usually i can boot into safe mode and perform a repair or restore to a previous point in time. I have also used the fix on the Microsoft website but the
 description of the problem does not necessesarily fit what i am experiencing. The&nbsp;issue is&nbsp;not the temporary resolution of the issue&nbsp;but moreover&nbsp;that the problem keeps re occurring even after performing a complete system restore; applying the Microsoft fix;
 and various system repairs in safe mode. The machine ususlly performs for about a moth or so and then i'm back to square one.</p>
<p>The only logon profile that is set up is the one offered during the first boot of the machine. There is only one user&nbsp;using the machine and no other user profile has been created manually. My first question is&nbsp;if the adminsitrator account set up during the
 first machine boot is based on a temporary profile? This issue is most frustrating ...if it happened with any other product&nbsp;i would expect my money back! Will an upgrade to 7 professional put an end to this issue permanently? as a permanent fix is what is
 required here or Mr. Gates is getting the bump.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Its not Windows causing the issue, more likely to be the influence of hardware or other software.<br />
So an upgrade to Windows Professional is not likely to solve the issue, possible just not likely or<br />
recommended. See the next message to check the hard drive thorughly and other methods to<br />
help. Afterwards the methods below AND the diagnostics maybe a Repair Installation can help<br />
(see next message).<br />
<br />
You can try to fix with Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you bootup. The ADMIN account in Safe<br />
Mode has no password by default (so unless someone changed the password it should be available).<br />
<br />
Some programs like the Google Updater (if you added the Google Toolbar, Chrome&nbsp;or Google Earth)<br />
has been known to cause this issue. What antivirus/antispyware/security programs are on the computer<br />
and which have EVER been on it even if uninstalled?</p>

<br />
Use the Hidden Admin Account to lower your account to user APPLY / OK then raise it back to ADMIN.<br />
This helps clear corruption. Do same for other accounts if needed after following the above message.<br />
<br />
You can use the Hidden Admin Account - Make another account as ADMIN with your same password<br />
(or two with same password) use one to test or fix the other.<br />

You can run the Hidden Admin Account command from the Command Prompt from here if needed.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Disk issues can get serious very quickly so I would thoroughly check the drive now and be sure<br />
to keep redundant backups of your important data (use several methods).<br />
<br />
Inside Windows - Regular or Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot).<br />
<br />
Run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />

----------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
For even better and more efficient checking :<br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista/Windows<br />
7&nbsp;disk - if you do not have a&nbsp;Vista/Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friend's (it needs to be same<br />
32 or 64 bit and they are not copy protected) or make one. Also your System maker will sell the<br />
physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
Space after k and before /&nbsp; and after f and before /<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />

<br />
Go into Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch screen as you startup. Set the<br />
boot order to CD/DVD to use Windows&nbsp;disks (Vista or Windows 7 whichever you have installed.)<br />
Remember to set back when done.<br />
