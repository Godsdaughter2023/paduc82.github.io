<h2>            No Audio Output Device is installed with red x over speaker icon</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When this happened to me all i was doing was trying out a set of external speakers and when i was done and had unplugged them I saw the red X over my speaker icon. In the device managet there is no sound,game,controller option to highlight. Please
 help I have tried alot of things and still no audio. I need my computer for day care class tomorrow. If i can't get it fixed today it will have to wait. I have an Acer Aspire&nbsp;3100 series with windows home premium 64 bit.&nbsp; If anyone has any ideas i would greatly
 appreciate it. My mind is frazzled with this one. I don't have any of the discs that came with the laptop. I have tried system restore with no luck. If i could go back more than a month the system restore may work. I have went into the device manager and tried
 to update driver only to find out the sound game and controller is not there?&nbsp; There is an ! point next to HD Audio Soft Data Fax Modem with SmartCP? I don't know what elese to try.&nbsp; Th

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I should have mentioned it happened a little more than a month ago, i had a backup lsptop i was using from a friend and they needed it back. I was going to take this one to a professional t be dixed but can't afford at this time. I did try system
 restore but it wouldn't go back far enough. I have also tried the safe mode al well. This computer has a 64 bit os but the acer website shows it haveing a 32 bit. IDK about that. When i got this computer it was used and had a countdown&nbsp; for 30 days going and
 was going to stop so i did take to a professional and he fixed that. Since this computer is older and when i got it the lady said she would mail me the discs that came with it but never did so im stuck here. Also when i took it to the professional tech that
 fixed the countdown he also fixed the sound as well. I jjust know when this happened i had external speakers plugged in the headphone jack and when i unplugged them the red X came up. I don't see how that would caus

&nbsp;I have 64 bit edition of windows vista home premium. I have worked on finding out what is wrong for days now and im ready to beat this thing. I have been in the device manager, services.msc, i have ran error checks, diagnostic tool, I don't know anything else
 to try. My daughter told me if it happened when i was using external speakers that the laptop may have recognized those as the default. She checked that&nbsp; and no luck. I have downloaded alot of driver error programs and none of them are free so i can't do that.
 I think it has something to do with the permissions on the security tab of drive C. The reason i say this is because I changed the permissions because i thought all should have full permission and that may fix the problem but i was wrong i guess, I went into
 the services.msc yesterday and clicked on the properties of the windows audio and then clicked on the log on tab&nbsp; and it showed that the audio was on local service when it sould be on local system so i changed it and it said to restart the service after i
 changed it and it stopped and wouldn't start back,&nbsp;and i had to do another system restore. So now im back to aquare 1 again. Im searching google for drivers is the only thing i know to try at this time. I took part of the bottom off my laptop to see if i could
 see the sound card but no luck. I would had to take the whole thing apart to get to it. This laptop is an Acer aspire 3100 and ive took the pc to a tech once to stop a windows countdown because the woman i bought it from had done someting strange to start
 that. I think this pc had 2&nbsp; os on it, maybe im wrong. i think it came out with xp on it even thought it has windows vista basic sticker on it. So needless to say it has a i guess a bootleg vista home premium 64 bit on it now.Either which way i need the sound
 to work, do you thignk if i go back to the services and changed it to local system insted of local service that would help??? Thanks Missy

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have never had to reply to myself, but i still have the sound problem and it isn't solved by no means and i don't understand why it said solved when i came back here. I have been trying everything i know to try. If there is anyone out there who
 may have any step by step solution please let me know. I hope i haven't done damage by messing around in the device manager. There is no sound,video, and game controller listed in the DM. I have checked in the services to make sure it is started and it shows
 it is, but listed as a local service insted of local system? Thanks in advance to who can help me out. It is windows vista home premium 64 bit / the computer is an acer aspire 3100. which now has a different operating system than when it was new.. I have another
 laptop and a vista 32 bit disc tht goes with it. could i use that disc to fix this one?

<h2>            Screen keeps going black</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron laptop running Windows 10. My screen will repeatedly go black, like it went to sleep, in the middle of using something. Following a swipe on the touch screen, shake of the mouse or typing on the keyboard the screen will return to
 normal-for a bit. It will happen repeatedly, as fast as every second or two or intermittently every minute or two.&nbsp; Sometimes it will go a good 20 minutes before a black out pattern starts again. It is not over heated, not low on power (happens plugged in
 or on battery) or over worked (I can have only one window open). I have updated all drivers and changed power settings with no improvement. What else can I do to fix it?

<h2>            &#39;Share&#39; charm not working when sharing via Mail app</h2>
                    One of my favourite features of Windows 8/RT is the 'Share' charm, which makes it so easy to do just that. However, recently it's stopped working when sharing things via the Mail app&nbsp;(I can still share to Facebook), which was the main way I used it. But
 now I get the error message "Something went wrong and this application can't share at the moment. Try again later." This now happens each and every time I try to share via the Mail app, despite already trying things such as restarting the Surface. Anyone else
 had this?

<h3> _joris  say:</h3>
<h2>            I changed my Region on my Xbox - now I can&#39;t redeem my code, no matter what.</h2>
                    <p>I live in Austria and bought a game code (Red dead redemption (the first one for xbox 360).<br />
I changed my language settings (not my location in the first place) in order to install the game in English (since i prefer it playing it in original language)<br />
<br />
After that, i entered my game code and it says I have to change region.<br />
Okay, so I thought i need to switch it back to german and language area german/austria</p>
<p>- Next thing I try it accepts the code and says I will get "Red Dead Redemption" - I press next and it says: change your language/region.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok... so I tried it in several regions/ways but no luck. There also isn't any indication on the cdkey where i might need to change it to - it was a key for all regions (world) so what is going on here please?</p>
<p><br />
SKU states:<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">D/REDEREXO360XO</span><br />
</p>
<p>Yes i tried it with German, since there is a big D for "Deutsch" in the beginning but as you might already guess - Yes, I've tried that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be happy if you can help me out here.</p>

            Changing the region on your console does not change the region of your account. for that you would need the region migration tool to change your xbox 360 region as it is a 360 game. You may find that you are unable to do somethings you are used to when
 you change your region. I would suggest contacting the retailer for assistance with this matter as game keys are not usually region free

<p>Hi Joris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Digital content codes for Microsoft are region specific so I'm not sure how CDkeys sold you a code for all regions when that doesn't go by Microsoft policies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing the location of your Xbox can only be done every 3 months I believe so if you try changing it multiple times it may not make any changes after the first one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The location on your Xbox is what determines the Store on your Xbox and the market that reflects that region. Redeeming codes is influenced from this rule since they are prepaid based on the region you are in so the region your Xbox is set to has to match
 the region the code was bought from. That is why I don't know how CDkeys sold you a code for all regions as that is not possible on Xbox. Codes are region locked basically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some resources pertaining to Xbox and different locales:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/locale-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/locale-faq</a></li><li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10604/microsoft-account-redeem-gift-card-or-code" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10604/microsoft-account-redeem-gift-card-or-code</a></li></ul>
<p>

<blockquote>I would suggest contacting the retailer for assistance with this matter as game keys are not usually region free</blockquote>
<p>I have done that already and awaiting an answer. Nevertheless I'm quite shocked how minimal the information is on how to fix this matter. I saw another forum post that this seems to be quite common with xbox 360 games...</p>
<p>
</p><p>...hopefully the retailer can give me info...<br />
Nevertheless I see the microsoft store in responsibility to figure out wether this can be activated or not and how, since it is the platform to hold all the games.<br />
<br />
Well, we will see...</p>

 really want to use OneDrive because I'm a bit adverse to having my stuff out-of-hand (so to speak), and have some purchased downloaded files that have copyright regulations that state that the files are not allowed to be stored on anything other than my personal

    <title>Windows 10 Access for Local&#47;Standard Users - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> primevalley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Access for Local&#47;Standard Users</h2>
                    <p>On 1 August 2015, I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. The download and installation went will and I was initially able to try out some of the new features when logged in both as my main Microsoft Account/Administrator, and also as our separate family
 Local/Standard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On 4 August 2015, I was unable to log in with the Local/Standard user, with a message showing of "Windows couldn't connect to the Group Policy Client service. Please consult your system administrator".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Windows 10 allow Local/Standard user access?</p>
<p>Why would Local/Standard user access initially work fine after installation, but now not work at all?</p>
<p>Is this a fault known to Windows for which they will provide a fix through automatic updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping that there is a simple fix for this as the family Local/Standard user included valuable files, that were initially accessible following the upgrade to Windows 10, but now are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p>I am now having the same error message display upon computer restarts. I have upgraded to windows 10 and upon signing into the only account on this computer, an error message displays with the following information "Failed to connect to a windows service:
 Windows couldn't connect to the Group Policy Client service. This problem prevents standard users from signing in."</p>
<p>
</p><p>While this computer only has one account, I want to know how the error can be remedied. I do not have files or anything I need to get from another account, I want to know how this error originated and how to fix the issue or issues causing it to occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following this error message, the desktop icons rearranged themselves randomly. I want to have the cause of this error fixed before any further, more frustrating symptoms occur. I am not able to pull up the context menu in file explorer, when attempting
 to do so, windows hangs and then resets the desktop and windows services. Along with the context menu, I am not able to create new folders or documents or edit folder or document information from the file explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any responses that will help achieve the elimination of these causes.</p>

<h2>            Printer Error &#40;0X000006ba&#41; and didn&#39;t have this issue before today&#33;</h2>
                    I have Vista Ultimate and just got this problem and is very annoying and can't google search the solution. We are on a shared network and for some odd reason today I got this error message when trying to print something today.
<br />
Operation could not be completed. (error 0x000006ba) The server printer spool service is not running. Please restart the spool on the server restart the server machine. I don't know what happened here and sure don't know how to correct this problem.<br />

            Hi Harley123<br />
<br />
Thank you for Posting on Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
To see if the Print Spooler Service is running, do the following:<br />
<br />
Click on Start<br />
In the Start Search box type in <strong>services</strong> and then press the "ENTER" key on the keyboard<br />
In Services scroll down to <strong>Print Spooler</strong><br />
Is the <strong>Status</strong> set to <strong>Started</strong>?<br />
Is the <strong>Startup type</strong> set to <strong>Automatic</strong>?<br />
<br />
If not, start the Service and change the startup type to Automatic (by double clicking on the Print Spooler Service)<br />
<br />
<p><span><span>If the print spooler won’t start properly make sure that any dependent services on the spooler are started and then retry starting
 the spooler. Can you try the article below and then tell us whether or not that has any effect on your problem.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There is no guarantee that it will work but it might cleanup any software for your printer that may have corrupted during the
 install and be preventing the spooler from working properly.<br />
<br />
Please Post back and let us know if this has helped to resolve the issue - thank you</span></span></p>

            I use snipping tool and take a screengrab of what i need then print that.
<br />That's the fastest and easiest way.

            Thanks for your fast reply. I can do the screen capture, I was hoping for a more "elegant" solution. Apparently, there's a process to add a "Print Directory" feature. I'm looking into it.

            Hu Jutta, you can do that with Command Prompt . . .
<br />
<br />Open a Command Prompt window
<br />
<br />Navigate to the folder you you want a listing of
<br />
<br />Then use one of the following commands to create a text file in that folder with the listing and you can print that out:
<br />
<br />dir &gt; printit.txt will print a list of the files, with full file path
<br />
<br />dir /b &gt; printit.txt will print only the file names
<br />
<br />dir /o:d &gt; printit.txt will sort the files by date

            If you just want a printed listing of what’s inside a folder, here’s what you do.
<br />
<br />    Open the Command Prompt.  To do that, click Start, type CMD, then right-click Run as administrator.
<br />    Change the directory to the folder you want to print the contents of. To do that, use the cd command—for example, “cd c:\users\yourusername\documents”.
<br />    Type the following command and hit Enter: dir &gt; listing.txt
<br />
<br />This will generate a basic text file listing the contents of the directory.  The filename you save can be anything you want. You can call it listing.txt, files.txt, folder.txt or whatever.
<br />
<br />This is what it looks like:
<br />
<br />If you want to go a step further, you can print the contents of subfolders by issuing the following command: tree “c:\directory_name” &gt; “c:\file_name.txt” /A /F
<br />
<br />TIP: On the command line, using “&gt;” will always send the output of the command to a file. It works with any command. You can also use “&gt;&gt;” to append the output to the end of an existing file.

    <title>Backup Hard Drive filling up with a Huge System Volume Information - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eixle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backup Hard Drive filling up with a Huge System Volume Information File, but backups are set to manual&#63;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I noticed that the first hard drive that came with my laptop was slowly filling up though I was not adding any new files to it: at the time I was running Windows Vista. I made the Upgrade to Windows 7 and grabbed a new hard drive to copy all my data over,
 reformatted the old one to use as backup and Storage of Music and etc. The first hard drive is now my backup drive, and the main hard drive is what I run programs on/install programs to. My system protection settings are set to manual, and I only have two
 system restore files at any given time. One from when I first upgraded, and a new one whenever I install large program or fix an issue. Yet somehow, the :\SytemVolumeInformation file on the backup drive continues to grow, and is beginning to seriously impact
 the amount of space I have left on the hard drive (100/500 GB). Some may not consider this to be so bad, but I do music mixing and the backups I've learned to make of the sound libraries I use in order to not waste a day reloading them all are relatively tiny
 overall, except that I have quite a few. The total amount of everything on the hard drive apart from the file comes to just over 310GB, while the new hard drive has just over 70/320GB. Ordinarily I wouldn't worry about this except that the SystemVolume File
<em>keeps growing </em>&nbsp;&nbsp;at a rather alarming rate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I discovered this growth while using Piriform Defraggler, and comparing the logs I had between one week and the next, over the course of a month where I have added nothing to either drive, the file has grown substantially larger everyday, but not really
 in a pattern. It went from 34GB, which I could understand, to roughly 80, which I cannot, over two weeks, and now another 20 GB in a week.</p>
<p>My Music libraries are not backed up by System Restore, so I cannot think of them being responsible for this huge file. If anyone can explain to me why this is happening, even if there is no way to fix it, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>Hi <br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to reduce the number of unnecessary files on your hard disk to free up disk space and help your computer run faster, use Disk Cleanup.
<br />
It removes temporary files, empties the Recycle Bin, and removes a variety of system files and other items that you no longer need.<br />
<br />
You may also delete old restore files, backup files and VSS files and index files<br />
<br />
You may refer the link below for more information.<br />

cheers!<br />

<div>I tried running Disk Cleanup like you suggested Nathan, on both hard drives. The first worked fine and actually cleaned off almost a GB (yikes!). But when I went to run the backup it only had the Recycle Bin available for 0KB. I tried the System Restore/Shadow
 Copies too, but that didn't do anything on the second one either. :(</div>

Okay, so you clicked on the "More Options" tab and cleaned out the System Restore and Shadow Copies?&nbsp; What are your System Protection settings like?&nbsp; Go to Control Panel -&gt; System -&gt; System Protection (top left corner).&nbsp; Then click on the "System Protection"
 tab.&nbsp; Make sure that System Protection is Off for your backup drive.&nbsp; Just to make sure, click on "Configure", set the % to 1%, then switch the protection on and off again.&nbsp; You can even click on "Delete" to delete all restore points for that drive.&nbsp; Then
 click "OK" when you're done.&nbsp; Try that.&nbsp; It worked for me, but YMMV.<br />

<h2>            Skype App not working properly on cellular but works fine on wifi.</h2>
                    <p>When I make outbound calls via my Skype App on cellular data, it tries to dial and then stops - it shows a missed call.&nbsp; When I am connected through wifi, it connects outbound calls just fine.&nbsp; I've checked my bandwidth and it's fine.&nbsp; I've tried restarting
 my iPhone and deleting and re-downloading the app.&nbsp; Nothing works.</p>
<p>

            Skype is going through a limbo period ever since its acquisition. Microsoft in honesty, can't keep up with the development of the service on the variety of platforms it exists. Especially on newer, modern devices such as the iPhone X. I personally have switched to Viber on my iPhone X. You should encourage your friends to do the same or recommend other VoIP services. 
<br />
<br />Right now, your only option is to periodically check for updates and kep trying.

<h3> 40thed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 i-3 2nd Monitor Portrait Mode</h2>
                    <p>I think an i-3 can support a 1920x1080 monitor with the docking station (which I recently purchased), but can the i-3 surface support the second monitor with an extended desktop in portrait mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">I like using at least one external monitor in portrait mode on my desktop machines, and I'm thinking of picking up a Dell P2214H 21.5" rotating monitor for my surface setup.</p>

            Here's one thing you can try. Make sure you connect the camera first and have it turned on. *Then* start up the PC. If you are still having trouble, try the windowsmoviemakers.net forums under "Importing and Capturing Media".

Also I have managed to retrieve old e-mails which were lost when my computer went down and Windows had to be reinstalled but they also appear to be in code<br />
and I can't read them either.<br />

<p><br />
Now that you have installed the Adobe Reader, try to RIGHT click at the pdf attachment, click Open. See if it still opens in Notepad, or if it opens correctly in Adobe Reader.</p>
<p>If it still opens in notepad please post back.</p>

Is that what you were trying to say ?</p>
<p>Each attachment has a file extension.</p>
<p>Each file extension has a specific program to open it. Such as .....</p>
<p>Microsoft Word Viewer ( or Microsoft Office Word )&nbsp;to open .doc, or .docx attachments.</p>
<p>File extension is represented by the last 3 or 4 letters at the end of the file, such as, .doc, or .docx, or .pps, or .ppsx etc etc etc.</p>
<p>What is the file extension of the attachemnt in question ?</p>

<h2>            &#34;Something went wrong&#34; when applying updates. Error code 0x80070003</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased and received an HP 15-f233wm (15.6" laptop) from Amazon and I'm having issues trying to activate Windows. After trying to troubleshoot with Amazon support, we came to the conclusion that the updates that were downloading needed to completely
 install before I would attempt to activate Windows again. The laptop attempted to install these updates three times but during the restart process, somehow the updates didn't take effect and had to be undone. With all these happening, I still can't activate
 Windows. Are these affecting one another?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update issues are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cumulative Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3205383)</li><li>Security Updates for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3172729)</li><li>Feature update for Windows 10, version 1607</li><li>Security Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3074679)</li><li>Security Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3074680)</li><li>Security Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3074674)</li></ul>

<h2>            Windows Time Display in Taskbar</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have updated to Windows 10 Pro Creator's update on a PC. I changed the system font back to the font I normally use, Architect's Daughter. After changing the system font, the windows time in the taskbar does not read correctly. The time normally
 looks like this: 3:45 PM. After changing the font, the time no longer has the : (colon) in it, but has an open rectangular box instead.</p>
<p>No matter what font I now choose as default, even going back to the system default, the : stays a rectangular box. So far, no other oddities have shown up in programs or display by changing the system default font. I have removed the time from the taskbar
 and reshown it using Turn system icons on or off in Settings. Still no : just the open rectangular box.</p>
<p>Any suggestions or should this be reported as a bug in the creators update?</p>

            <p>Andre, Thanks for the quick response. I tried all 3 DISM Commands with no problems. I have also done a reinstall and all went well until I changed the font. So, it actually works until you change the font.
</p>
<p>I agree it may be a bug, and there may be no current fix, but I hope others discover this so it can be investigated by Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Still same problem. Have noticed no other areas affected. colons still remain open rectangular boxes regardless of font choice for system font.</p>

            a bug maybe. Try reporting it to the feedback hub. So they can see people with the same issue.

            Same problem....but I notice on mine that the colon is fine anywhere else in the system, it's ONLY the time in the taskbar that has the rectangle. &nbsp;I want to say that if it's everywhere, that font may not have the special characters, I could definitely
 be mistaken though...

<p>JMB2K</p>
<p>I did not notice any other area that had the colon replaced as a box except for the time either.
</p>
<p>I also had problems with a couple of apps, so I reinstalled WIN10 from a disk image to the time before the Creator's update. It is still that version of windows installed, Version 1607, OS Build 14393.1066
</p>
<p>With the current build I am running, everything works fine. Obviously, the Creator's Update has some issues and I do not plan on updating again until some time has passed to allow these issues to be corrected.</p>

<p>Same problem for the same reason. I know the colon character is present in my chosen font; it's recognized elsewhere. As with everyone else, the time is the only place it's not working properly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: </p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally sorted it out, and it wasn't that difficult of a fix, for mine at least.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I changed my font, it blanked out the registry lines for most of the Segoe UI font entries. Once I put them back properly, I no longer had my chosen font, but I also didn't have the box instead of colon issue (after a restart).<br />
