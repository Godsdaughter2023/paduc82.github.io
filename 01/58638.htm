            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and we are happy to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following steps to create a partition from the Disk Management.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Log on to your Windows 10 PC with an administrator account. (The process of creating partitions requires administrative privileges on the computer.)</li><li>Once logged on, right click on the Start button and select <strong>Disk Management</strong>.</li><li>Shrink the C: drive by right clicking it, selecting the <strong>Shrink Volume</strong> option, and following the on-screen instructions to free up some space and to get the unallocated area.</li><li>From the context menu, click <strong>Create Simple Volume</strong>.</li><li>On the welcome page of the <strong>New Simple Volume Wizard</strong> box, click
<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Specify Volume Size</strong> page, in the available <strong>Simple volume size in MB</strong> field, specify the amount of space you want to assign to this new partition. (Make sure to specify the space in megabytes, i.e. 10240 MB for 10
 GB. 1 GB = 1024 MB.)</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to continue.</li><li>On the <strong>Assign Drive Letter</strong> <strong>or Path </strong>page, leave everything as it is for simplicity, and click
<strong>Next</strong>. (If you are an advanced user, you can choose a drive letter of your choice from the available
<strong>Assign the following drive letter</strong> drop-down list.)</li><li>On the <strong>Format Partition</strong> page, choose the settings of your preference. (If you are unsure what to choose, leave the default settings intact.)</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong> to proceed.</li><li>On the <strong>Completing the New Simple Volume Wizard</strong> page, click <strong>
Finish</strong> to create a new partition in the hard disk drive.</li><li>Once the partition is created, you can start using it normally.</li></ol>

            This answer is not complete. If you want to use the new drive as a 'documents' drive, you will need to set all special folders to save to this drive. E.g. "my documents" points to the C: drive by default. Check Properties, then Location.

<h2>            Wasteland Workshop will not install</h2>
                    
<p><span>Purchased Wasteland Workshop on 4/12/2016</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Went to install it and it seemed like it worked. &nbsp;Started the game and none of the items are in the game.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Went back out to the dashboard and clicked on "Manage Game". &nbsp;Shows that Wasteland Workshop isn't installed. &nbsp;Tried to install it again...immediately went from 0 to 100 percent (Very Odd)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Tried many things: &nbsp;Uninstalled Fallout 4 and Automatron. &nbsp;Re-downloaded them all. &nbsp;Didn't work.</span></p>
<p><span>"Cleared Persistent Storage", "Clear MAC Address"...didn't work</span></p>
<p><span>Hard Reset didn't work either.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Figured everything would be fixed right with the 1.5 Survival Update. &nbsp;Went to download again...went through the installation process like it should. &nbsp;Started the game...items still aren't
 in the game. &nbsp;Go back out to "Manage Game"...shows that it isn't installed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'm at a loss at what to do.</span></p>

<h2>            can updates to virtual hardware &#40;qemu&#47;kvm&#41; deactivate a windows or office installation&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been thinking about Windows activation because in a recent interaction with Microsoft support I learned that my Windows 8 installation had somehow deactivated itself.&nbsp; I have had trouble with Windows activation before so it is a mechanism that makes
 me somewhat nervous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Windows in a virtual machine and I have noticed that the name that Windows associates with the processor is "QEMU Virtual CPU version 1.7.91".&nbsp; The presence of the version number in the suggests that the processor name changes each time the hypervisor
 is updated. Is the Windows activation software smart enough to recognize that this is ok?&nbsp; I think that I can set the cpu type (e.g., kvm64)&nbsp; and the name of this cpu, "Common KVM processor", looks like it is less likely to change between versions.&nbsp; But for
 various reasons I am not able safely test this and I am worried that changing this might also invalidate my activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else use a similar setup and is there an issue here?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t connect to Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everybody,&nbsp; I can't connect to Xbox Live with the main profile to Xbox Live with other profiles in the same console I can, so any&nbsp; help will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Two weeks ago I bought Soul Calibur V and I remembered having a lot of some microsoft points which I did not use from my last visit to Xbox Live (like three months ago or two) so I decided to connect to Xbox Live&nbsp; to downloading some equipment parts for
 Soul Calibur V, and is not&nbsp; possible connect to Xbox Live from my&nbsp; profile.</p>
<p>I can connect with my wife's profile to Xbox Live or with the profile that I had when I was living in Mexico, we live in Chile and we bought the console in Chile.</p>
<p>Additional questions:</p>
<p>Is it possible to transfer the microsoft points or the amount of money to my wife's profile?</p>
<p>I have done everything (I think so) and it still appearing a message saying that is not possible to connect my console to Xbox live&nbsp; (which is weird because i am offline)&nbsp; and this number:</p>
<p>&nbsp;8015104.</p>
<p>When I am playing a game it appears the message disconnected from Xbox Live and it takes longer than usual to load the Xbox dashboard when I turn on my console.</p>

<p>Thanks for helping me.</p>
<p>- - - - - - -</p>
<p>Hola a todos, no me puedo conectar con mi perfil principal a Xbox Live, pero con otros perfiles en la misma consola si se puede. cualquier ayuda será agradecida.</p>
<p>Dos semanas atràs compré el Soul Calibur V y recordé que tenía algunos puntos Microsoft los cuales no usé durante mi última visita a Xbox Live (como tres ó dos meses atrás) entonces decidí conectarme a Xbox Live para descargar algunas partes de equipamiento
 para los personajes en Soul Calibur V y no es posible conectarme a Xbox Live desde mi perfil.</p>
<p>Puedo conectarme con el perfil de mi esposa, ó con el perfil que tenía cuando estaba viviendo en México, nosotros vivimos en Chile y la consola la compramos en Chile.</p>
<p>Preguntas adicionales:</p>
<p>Es posbile trasnferir los puntos Microsoft ó dinero de mi cuenta a la cuenta de mi esposa.</p>
<p>He hecho de todo (creo) y todavía me aparece un mensaje dicièndome que no es posible conectarme a Xbox Live y el siguiente nùmero: 8015104.</p>
<p>Cuando estoy jugando un juego me aparece el mensaje de desconectado de Xbox Live(lo cual es raro ya que estoy en offline)&nbsp; y toma más de lo normal para mi consola para cargar la interfaz de Xbox.</p>
<p>Graciaspor su ayuda. </p>

<p>G'day Oorovos! We'll be happy to help with your profile, but I'm afraid that error code is not valid. Those codes are 8-digits long, could you possibly check it again and let us know?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, try these steps on your profile to get you reconnected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Delete the profile ONLY (not items!) </li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear the cache</a>.
</li><li>Turn your console off completely, then start it up again. </li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download your profile.</a>
</li></ul>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
</a>Let us know the result and the error code. If you're still unable to connect, we'll find another solution!</p>

                    My hard disk drive blew it's connection port so I now have a new drive in the original PC. I tried to use the media creation tool to obtain a Windows iso. But my laptop I am getting it from keeps crashes out at 12% or so. Is there any other way around
 this in order to get my licensed windows 10 up and running? Error code 0x60070013-0xA0003 I think. It disappeared quickly.&nbsp;

            Hi Kevin
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Try downloading and making a bootable copy using this method:
<br />
<br />download Windows 10 1903 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1903 
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />		How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-clean-install-of-windows-10/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi Kevin
<br />
<br />If like a lot of other users, you are having difficulty with the Media Creation Tool, this is a reliable and safe method to create Windows 10 Bootable Media
<br />
<br />Click this link to download the Windows 10 ISO
<br />
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />You can then use Rufus to create the bootable media form that ISO:

<p>
</p><p>You need to go to the McAfee website and get their <em>removal tool</em>.&nbsp; That will uninstall McAfee and remove its debris from your system.&nbsp; Part of the removal process turns Windows defender back on.&nbsp; Search for

            <p><strong>Doing a Custom Install</strong></p>
<p>Using the custom install option allows you to reinstall your original copy of Windows while preserving your personal data by moving it to the Windows.old folder. Of course, you will need to reinstall your applications and hardware drivers. To begin, retrieve
 your installation disc for your copy of Windows and make sure you have the product key.</p>
<ul>
<li>Boot to the Windows 8 desktop.</li><li>Insert your Windows 7, Vista or XP disc</li><li>Click Install Now (Windows XP users, please restart from the installation or recovery disc).</li></ul>
<p>To learn how to change your BIOS options to boot from the DVD drive, see the following tutorial:<br />
<a href="http://notebooks.com/2011/05/05/how-to-load-bios-and-change-boot-configuration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://notebooks.com/2011/05/05/how-to-load-bios-and-change-boot-configuration/</a></p>
<p><strong>If you have an RTM disc</strong></p>
<p>If you have the original RTM disc for Windows 7 or Vista, you can download an updated disc with Windows 7 SP1 or Vista SP1 integrated. This should at least take some of the load off when it comes installing post SP1 updates or Service Pack 2 for Vista.</p>
<p><strong>Download the corresponding edition of Windows 7 you have a license for from the following link. You can identify the edition on the COA sticker attached to your machine, at the bottom or within the battery compartment (laptop) or top/side if its
 a desktop computer.</strong><br />

<p>Unfortunately, Windows XP users will need to get a hold of a genuine copy of Windows XP with SP3 disc. It should not be hard to get one, but will require that you look for one if you can’t find yours.</p>
<p><strong>If Windows came preinstalled on your computer.</strong></p>
<p>If Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7 came with your computer, this might be a bit tricky depending on the version of Windows you are running and the options you selected during the installation of the Windows 8 preview. I have noticed that installing later
 versions of Windows can sometimes render a recovery partition inoperable.</p>
<p>Some computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into it when you start your computer by
 pressing a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p><strong>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular computer brands:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit.</li><li>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</li><li>For Toshiba, press and hold ’0′ BEFORE and during the power up</li><li>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo.</li><li>For Samsung: Tap the F4 Key at the Samsung logo when you first power on.</li><li>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</li><li>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message “Starting System Recovery” is displayed</li><li>Lenovo <a href="http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-4HWSE3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-4HWSE3</a><br />
Lenovo notebooks include a feature called the Lenovo OneKey Recovery button, which is used to boot into the Recovery Environment and reinstall Windows.</li></ul>
<p>If your recovery partition happens to be damaged, then you will need to use the link to download the corresponding edition of Windows you have a license for and use the product on you COA sticker. Again, Windows XP users will need to borrow a disc or likely
 use the recovery discs that came with your system.</p>
<p><strong>Doing the Custom Install</strong></p>
<p>A custom install allows you to reinstall Windows without actually formatting the hard disk.</p>

<p>When installation is complete, setup your user account and password.</p>
<p><strong>Recovering your personal files</strong></p>
<p>Now the important part of doing this will be recovering your personal files. To do that, browse to the root of the drive where Windows is installed, normally C:\. There you will see a folder called Windows.old</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/image10.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f12%2fimage_thumb10.png%3fw%3d436%26amp%3bh%3d280" /></a></p>
<p>In this folder you will find your old User folder with all your personal folders for Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos etc. You can copy the contents from within each folder and paste them into your respective personal folders in Windows 7.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/image11.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f12%2fimage_thumb11.png%3fw%3d463%26amp%3bh%3d359" /></a></p>
<p>After you have copied over your data, you can delete the folder if you wish. This is just the basics though and you might have other data stored elsewhere that you need to recover from the Windows.old folder such as email or even your iTunes
 Library. </p>

<p>original title:&nbsp;Repeated BSOD with BCCode 27 and a reference RDR_File_System, Lenovo t61p, Windows 7 64-bit</p>
<p>My Lenovo T61p previously had Vista installed.&nbsp; About a month ago I started receiving a BSOD error which reported out as RDR_File_System.&nbsp; Rather than try to trouble-shoot it, I went out and bought Windows 7 Ultimate and installed it.&nbsp; I did a clean install,
 I did not do an upgrade.&nbsp; (So lost all settings, etc.)<br />
<br />
After installing and updating all the drivers I could, I still am getting BSOD and a reference to RDR_File_System.&nbsp; Here's the error report:<br />
Problem signature:<br />
&nbsp; Problem Event Name:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BlueScreen<br />
&nbsp; OS Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.1<br />
&nbsp; Locale ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1033<br />

======<br />
I should add that it appears at random times.&nbsp; Sometimes the computer is operating fine for 20 minutes, sometimes it happens after 2.&nbsp; No apparent correlation to anything that I can determine.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any ideas on how to stop this?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            In the Notifications area at the bottom of your Windows screen, right-click the OneDrive icon and click Settings. You might have to click Show hidden icons to find OneDrive.
<br />
<br />
<br />In the Settings box, on the Auto save tab, under Documents and Pictures, click the list at Documents or Pictures and pick the default save location you want.
<br />
<br />    This PC only - When you create a file, the Documents or Pictures folder under This PC is the first-choice location offered to save it. The file is not saved to OneDrive unless you do so separately, and it is available only on the PC you used to save it.
<br />
<br />    OneDrive - When you create a file, the first location offered is within the Documents or Pictures folder under OneDrive. Because these folders sync to your PC, files you save there are available on your PC, even when it's not connected to the Internet. And you can use any device with an Internet connection to access your files.

            Hi Vince.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The Documents and Pictures folder in OneDrive are not the same shell folders under your User name which are moved via this method:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>
<br />
<br />Those are OneDrive folders used to store certain Pictures and Documents to OneDrive if you set it to do so.  
<br />
<br />When I relocated my User folders into OneDrive to sync across all devices, I merge them with those folders and get a warning it cannot be undone.  But you can always restore your User folders to default using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-restore-default-location-personal-folders-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-resto...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Vince, try all the other options proposed . . .
<br />
<br />If all else fails, here is a registry hack
<br />
<br />Copy your files out of your Documents folder before proceeding
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor
<br />
<br />Navigate to this Key:
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders
<br />
<br />In the right hand pane, double click Personal
<br />
<br />Set its Value Data to:
<br />%USERPROFILE%\Documents
<br />
<br />Close the Registry Editor and restart your PC

                    Hello I recently Installed Windows 8.1 Preview, and I was having issues so I decided to Refresh. It said that it would NOT remove any personal files. After it finished refreshing I looked through my files and noticed that my Steam folder was not there.
 I had to reinstall Steam and now I am having to reinstall all of my Steam games! I had about 10 or 11 Steam games, which take about 5-10hrs to install each, because of my slow internet. That's 50-100hrs to get all my content back. Is there anyway to restore
 the lost files? It's just kind of strange that my FILES were deleted when it said NONE of my personal files would be deleted.

            <p>That is correct, all your personal files (Documents, Pictures, Videos, Music, etc) will be preserved.&nbsp; Program files are removed (that's the exact thing the refresh is designed to do).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When you start the Refresh process, you will see the following message:</p>

            I ran the system refresh this afternoon. The User profile was still in tact, but the files under that profile are missing. I've checked the "Windows.old" directory that was created with today's date and timestamp from when I initiated the refresh, but
 there is not data available, nor is the user account listed in the user's directory.

                    <p>I updated from Vista Basic to Windows 8 and purchased&nbsp;2013 Home &amp; Student.&nbsp; I backed up my QuickBooks files before downloading.&nbsp; When I went to restore, the message was "File not found".&nbsp; So I downloaded QuickBooks 2012 again and now I have two of them and

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How did you backup the QuickBook files? any third party software?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't think, this is an issue with Windows 8. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways, you can install the quick books in Win 7 compatibility mode and try.</p>

            I ended up doing a complete uninstall, a clean uninstall, and downloading QuickBooks Pro 2012 again.&nbsp; When I restored from my original back-up this time, all is working fine.&nbsp; Thanks

En assassins Creed Unity si se puede desde las configuraciones del juego, pero los demas que tengo no (Halo TMCC, Gears of War).</p>
<p>Me han dicho que cambie el idioma de la consola, pero al hacer eso tambien se cambia la region, espero puedan ayudarme, gracias&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know I threw a lot at you, but as I stated, my daughter <b>failed to make the recovery discs</b> so I'm assuming that trying to do so now may too late? Can I make them at this point and, if so, is it still ok to use the back-up tool, or would I only be
 backing up more problems?</p>
<p>Also, "<b>start up repair" doesn't come up for me and there are&nbsp;only 4&nbsp;system restore dates showing and all are from well after problems began.
</b></p>
<p>I thought that I saw a forum deccribing a way to manually create an earlier restore point in a situation like this but would have to find it in my notes again.&nbsp; Any knowledge about this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know more about what hardware/memory problems that were detected from&nbsp;Windows Memory Diagnostics and was hoping to upload&nbsp; the reports for some idea. Also hoped to be able to upload the event log so someone who understands them better could
 see if there are more problems that I think, or if the older ones are typical.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would like to know more about power settings and whether "hardware acceleration" should be on or off. If there are recomended settings,&nbsp;should be following from Asus or Windows 7....(can't find recocmmendations from Asus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also like to make sure there are no traces of that bad MS Office linger&nbsp; and resolving and problems that might show up with Windows in the event log.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Jomari, I've already run the app troubleshooter. I'm not doing a clean boot as I don't see it as some program conflict and I don't believe it is unique to my computer; I believe it's a win 10 app bug. Are you saying that it doesn't happen on your win 10
 computer, or anyone else's. How about checking on one or two win 10 systems. Note; the games app comes as part of win 10 and was in the computer from new.&nbsp;

            I'm having the same issue. Seems like any time I see a box "don't show this again" I check it but I have yet to see it work properly. Like when I log into Exchange; there is a box to not "show this again" for the "Stay signed in" question but it still
 shows next time I log in.

<h2>            Monitor won&#39;t wake up after being on standby</h2>
                    <p>I got a new monitor in July and since then it has happened 6-7 times already that the monitor wouldn't wake up after being on standby (it's set to 10 minutes, the PC itself never goes to sleep!). Once or twice it actually worked to turn the monitor off,
 wait a little bit, then turn it back on but the other times I either had to unplug the DP cable or even the monitor's power cord in the worst case because it tried getting a signal through DVI and HDMI, then only displayed the "no input signal" message when
 going back to DP.</p>
<p>I also bought a new gpu not too long ago and while the problem hadn't occured in the last almost two months, it just happened again.</p>
<p>There's something else that's weird about the whole thing: The windows that were open at the time got resized to around 640x480.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<p>Win 7 (64bit)</p>
<p>GTX 1070 (375.70, previously GTX 770 with an older 375.xxx driver)</p>
<p>Acer XF240H (connected via the DisplayPort cable that came with the monitor and set to 1080p @ 144Hz)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that there are a few problems with DP if you have a dual setup but I don't and I also can't use HDMI (doesn't support 144Hz) or DVI (doesn't carry audio and I want to exchange this monitor for a different model that hasn't got a DVI port soon). Since
 the problem has occured with different gpus and drivers, it most likely has to be a problem with either the monitor itself, DisplayPort or Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what exactly the problem could be and if it's maybe one of the usual DP ones?</p>

            <p>No and no.</p>
<p>I built the PC in 2012 or 2013 and it had the GTX 770 and Win 7 right from the start. The new Acer monitor replaced my really old one (never had any problems and always had been connected via DVI) in July 2016 and the GTX 1070 got here about a month ago,
 so in October 2016.</p>
<p>The problem started occuring either in July or in August, like one or two times at first, then 3-4 times pretty much right after another (maybe over a span of two days) and now again once after almost two months.</p>
<p>My PC is running pretty much the whole day and my monitor goes into standby after 10 minutes and approximately 5 times a day, so it's pretty random and even with a new cable or a new monitor I wouldn't be sure if it's fixed until it actually happens again,
 which could take another two months or more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know of problems with DP, like if you have a dual monitor setup and turn off one of them, Windows will move all your icons to the other, active one, so it is possible that this is another problem. The weird part is that the windows of all the open/running/minimized
 programs (Firefox, Skype (in tray), Outlook,...) got resized to around 640x480, while none of the icons on the desktop got moved, which usually happens if the overall resolution gets changed to a smaller than the current one.</p>

            <p>If there were a defect in the monitor, I don't think it would change resolution.&nbsp; The more I think of it and the more you describe it, it sounds like a problem with your GPU or the drivers for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried connecting it with a DVI or HDMI cable instead?&nbsp; Those probably use different drivers within the GPU software.</p>

            <p>That's the weird part, it kind of did, then also didn't at the same time because the icons didn't move.</p>
<p>With all the driver versions I've had since owning the new monitor (364.xx most likely being the first, possibly an even older one, I'm not sure, and 375.60 being the current one - 375.95 got released yesterday) and even two different gpus, I highly doubt
 that they have anything to do with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's something else I just remembered that makes it look more like it's a problem with Windows or DisplayPort:</p>
<p>When I still had my old monitor and uninstalled the graphics driver to then restart my PC and install the new one, the picture would usually go black for a couple of seconds, then come back with a smaller resolution and/or a "laggy" mouse. But when I uninstalled
 the last couple of drivers, the picture never actually came back and it just showed the same "no input signal" message. I gave it some time to properly uninstall the driver, then restarted manually with the windows and arrow keys, which also brought back the
 picture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I haven't because HDMI doesn't support 144Hz and DVI can't transmit audio and, like I said, who knows if and when it would happen again with DVI. Since there's a new driver version out, I will try and install it with a DVI cable connected though to see
 if the screen still stays black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would be really interested to know is if anyone else has ever experienced a problem like this with a monitor that was connected via DP.</p>

            <p>No, I haven't but I will/have to tomorrow because 30 minutes ago every time I turned the monitor off while my PC was still running, it changed the size of all of the open windows and moved the icons around. And with moving around I'm not talking about simply
 moving them to the upper left corner like Windows does it when you change the resolution to a really small one but in a weird way and always the same way, like this:</p>
<p>http://i.imgur.com/hpsPUCJ.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I turn the monitor off again without changing anything, it moved the icon in the left upper corner in the first row/second column down to the forth row, second column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted the PC twice (1. direct restart, 2. shut down and unplug/plug in everything), I turned DDC/CI off and on and changed the Hz a couple of times but it didn't help. I then even changed the resolution to 1280x1024 and it actually kept all the icons'
 positions/windows sizes. After going back to 1080p it messed up once more but after getting the "no input signal" message again (this time simply turning the monitor off worked) after my last test, it looks like it's back to normal again now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something must have seriously messed up when I unplugged the monitor today!</p>
<p>Do you know where Windows saves the position of all the icons and the windows sizes? Some file might have gone corrupt, that's the only explanation I can think of at the moment, even though I'm not sure how that would come into play with my initial problem.</p>

            <p>Damn! It isn't fixed, it just did it again today and I have no idea what causes it. At first I thought restarting my PC, moving around icons or adding new files to the desktop/deleting some from it would but after changing the resolution I did all of that
 and it's still okay again at the moment.</p>

<h2>            ESO Plus Subscription</h2>
                    <p>I have an ESO Plus subscription and it renewed as always earlier in the month but for some reason in ESO it says it's not active. It was paid in full automatically and my xbox account says that I have a subscription but in game it does not. I went to the ESO website first and they direct me to contact xbox support.&nbsp;I've&nbsp;tried to contact xbox support through chat but it keeps timing out and saying there have been too many repeated authentication attempts. There is no option for requesting support to call me and there is no phone number listed. There for me to reach anyone that can fix this besides posting right here. I posted this before and not only get a 100% unhelpful reply but my thread was locked. I need to talk to actual support to get this fixed</p>

            The credit card that I set up this account with had to be changed. I submitted new card info which was accepted. Yet when I log into the game my characters are not able to have their loot automatically sent to the craft bag. The message is "the craft bag
 requires an active ESO Plus membership. My renewal info has been accepted. I have changed my gamertag info a couple of times and I have also changed my character name. Have I messed things up by doing this.
