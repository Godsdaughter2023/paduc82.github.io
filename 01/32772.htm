<h2>            Front USB Ports Overloading Flash Drives</h2>
                    
<p>My computer is an HP Pavilion purchased this past Christmas at Best Buy. About a month ago, after plugging my flash drive in to one of the USB ports and noticing that it didn't recognize that any device had been plugged into the system, I pulled the flash
 drive out with the intention of trying it over again. The flash drive was very hot to the touch, close to the point of being painfully so. I immediately tried plugging it into my laptop, with no success. My wife then got her old flash drive and tried, just
 to see if it was a fluke, but the same problem occurred. The USB port ate her flash drive. It wasn't burning hot upon being removed, but the drive would no longer read when I plugged it into the laptop. It would recognize that a USB device had been inserted,
 but would be unable to discern what type of USB device it was and, as a result, fail to read it at all.</p>
<p>I have no idea whether the front USBs are shorted out or if this might be some kind of odd software issue. A friend of my wife seems to think the USB drivers need to be reloaded, but I still wonder if it isn't a short in the physical circuit. Has anyone
 ever heard of this happening? If so, what is the best solution? I've already contacted HP about it and they want me to mail them the tower for a complete system reload - back to factory conditions. I really want to avoid that with all the data I have on this
 computer, if at all possible.</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>You should probably take HP up on their offer.&nbsp; Whether the USB flash drive or the USB circuits in the computer went defective first isn't able to be determined but odds are they are both fried now (judging by what happened to your wife's flash drive).</p>
<p>You could remove the system drive and pop in a temporary&nbsp;replacement, then reload the OS onto it&nbsp;yourself&nbsp;from your recovery disks (good time to make them if you haven't already).&nbsp;&nbsp;No need to go beyond that or load other software if you're only testing the
 USB ports. I can't see drivers being the cause of this problem but you can easily rule that out for yourself this way.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the below methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><span> I suggest you to place your computer in Clean Boot state as below and check whether the issue persists or not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the article How to perform a clean boot in Windows in the below link and check if it helps:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong><strong>:</strong> Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section
<strong>“<span>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</span>”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:
</span></strong><span>Also I suggest you to perform Disk Defrag as below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>In the search box type as ‘<strong>Defragment and optimize drives’.</strong></span></li><li><span>Select each <strong>
Drive</strong> and click on ‘Optimize’.</span></li><li><span>Then <strong>
Restart </strong>the computer and check.</span></li></ol>

<h2>            wireless connection to VGA projector&#63;</h2>
                    I'm searching for a wireless display adapter that I can use for my Surface Pro to connect wirelessly via VGA to a projector for powerpoint presentations.&nbsp; I'd like to be able to use my Surface Pro without a cable connecting to the projector for lectures.&nbsp;
 Must be VGA, not HDMI.&nbsp; Has anyone solved this problem?

            Search for Wireless VGA. What you will probably find is a USB adapter to plug into the Surface Pro and a receiver that would be connected via VGA cable to the projector.&nbsp;

            Thanks, Steve!&nbsp; However, that adapter you suggested is for an external <i><b>HDMI
</b></i>monitor (e.g. TV) not a <i><b>VGA </b></i>projector and its not clear that it will work with a Surface Pro.&nbsp; I spent all weekend searching the internet for such adapters and just came up with ones like that one.<br />
<br />
Has anyone out there had any luck using the Surface Pro in a powerpoint presentation using a conventional VGA projector AND connecting wirelessly?&nbsp; How did you do it?!<br />

            FYI, here's an update:<br />
<br />
<i><b>Actiontec</b></i> makes an adapter (<i>ScreenBeam Wireless Display Kit</i>) that appears to connect a Surface Pro to an HDMI-compatible device (monitor, TV).&nbsp; See:
<a href="http://eiuitc.blogspot.com/2013/02/wirelessly-display-windows-8-to-big.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://eiuitc.blogspot.com/2013/02/wirelessly-display-windows-8-to-big.html.</a><br />
<br />
However, that kit only connects you to HDMI-compatible devices.&nbsp; Many lecture halls, presentation rooms only have a VGA-compatible projector.<br />
<br />
Here's another possible solution, but this is more expensive (~$200) and appears to rely on an existing wireless network with plenty of bandwidth remaining after your students are occupied&nbsp; surfing the net, logging into their Facebook and Twitter accounts,
 shopping on Amazon, etc!: <a href="http://www.startech.com/AV/Extenders/VGA/WiFi-to-VGA-Wireless-Video-Extender-with-Audio~WIFI2VGA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.startech.com/AV/Extenders/VGA/WiFi-to-VGA-Wireless-Video-Extender-with-Audio~WIFI2VGA</a>.&nbsp; This device at least gets you to a VGA-compatible projector wirelessly.<br />
<br />
Has anybody tried these approaches or have alternatives for lecturing/presenting wirelessly to a VGA projector?<br />
<br />

            <p>How about connecting the Screenbeam kit HDMI out to a HDMI to VGA converter? I use the converter to attach my HP ultrabook to an older second monitor (that does not have HDMI port), so was&nbsp;wondering if the same can work with the Screenbeam kit.</p>
<p>HP has a special on the convertor right now at CAN$ 25 (<a href="http://h20386.www2.hp.com/CanadaStore/Merch/Product.aspx?id=H4F03AA&amp;opt=ABL&amp;sel=ACC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h20386.www2.hp.com/CanadaStore/Merch/Product.aspx?id=H4F03AA&amp;opt=ABL&amp;sel=ACC)</a>.</p>

            The link is to an adapter that has both HDMI&nbsp;<em><strong>and</strong></em> VGA outputs. &nbsp;You can see it in the image and it's backed up in the description. &nbsp;The device will support a conventional VGA projector.

<p>
</p><p>Looking at using a Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter.(HDMI)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then converting the VGA feed to the projector to a HDMI using a VGA to HDMI after market adapter. Then running a USB power lead to the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also think we would need a VGA switch to save unplugging and re plugging all the cables back into each other.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tested this as of yet but this should bridge the gap until all rooms have projectors with HDMI and USB ports.</p>

<h2>            Service Host&#58; Local System Constantly using CPU and has High Memory Usage</h2>
                    <p>I clean installed to Windows 10 and have been keeping up with updates. With a recent update, I have been having issues with CPU and Memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I check Task Manager, Service Host:Local System is constantly running at about 25% CPU usage. It occasionally surges or stops for a couple seconds, but soon goes back to 25% CPU usage. Its memory usage starts around 230MB as soon as I log in, and then
 climbs at a rate of about 1MB per second to over 1.5GB. I have seen it go as high as 2.3GB. If I open Task Manager as Administrator, then I can end End Task, but then certain things like my Start Menu and Search stop working. However, after about a minute,
 CPU and memory usage go back to their previous states and the process shows up in Task Manager again, but the broken things continue to not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I assumed this could be a driver issue, but when I checked all my drivers, the only one which updated was my display driver. I have the same problem after the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for you help.</p>

            <p>Thank you for offering some suggestions to fix this issue Ramesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked into your suggestions with these results:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:<br />
I found Windows Update in the Services list.<br />
In your step d, you said in "Start-up type, select Enable". But that option isn't available.<br />
Instead, the options are "Automatic, Manual, or Disabled".<br />
I suspect your goal was to enable this service, yet the "Status" of this service was "Running",<br />
so I see no need to try to enable it. Yet, the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I found that "Background Intelligent Transfer" and the "Cryptographic Service" services were<br />
also running, so it made no sense to try to start them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, you can see this same information a bit easier by just bringing up the Task Manager,<br />
clicking on tab Services, and then clicking on the Description column heading to sort by task<br />
description. Right clicking this service will allow you to select options Start, Stop, and Restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2:<br />
You suggested "copy and paste", but that doesn't work with command prompt. When I try, all I<br />
get is a control-V character in the command prompt field. But the paste does work if I try to<br />
bring it into the Notepad editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I tried typing these commands in manually.<br />
But when I tried to stop msiserver, it said "The Windows Installer service is not started."<br />
Furthermore, both of your suggested renames failed with the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access is denied</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I was running Command Prompt in Administrator mode, as confirmed by the window title.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, trying to start services wuauserv and cryptSvc gave the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The requested service has already been started</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other two services, bits and msiserver, did start however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, based upon these results, I have to ask if anyone has successfully run this series of<br />
commands under Windows 10??? Maybe they USED TO BE valid under earlier versions<br />
of the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, at various times during typing in these commands, I monitored the processes running,<br />
using Task Manager, and saw no difference in the resource hogging "Service Host: Local System (No Network)".</p>
<p>Isn't it possible that this is a real bug in the system software???</p>

<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.

<span><span><span><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter,
 you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>you already own</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>to

    <title>Printing on 5x7 postcards - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elsie1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing on 5x7 postcards</h2>
                    Hi experts,<br />
<br />
My marketing materials include a 5X7 "postcard."&nbsp; It's a highly glossy picture pre-printed on one side of the card.&nbsp; Paper weight is slightly heavier than Premium Plus gloss&nbsp;photo paper.&nbsp; I'm trying to print on the other side, 2 columns - one for the message,
 one for the address.&nbsp; I'm using Vista Home Premium, 32-bit, and an HP OfficeJet J5780 All-in-One printer.&nbsp; The document is created in Word 2007.&nbsp; All drivers are up-to-date.&nbsp; Within the document, the page size is set for 5x7, margins are 1/2", orientation
 is landscape, and left column is wider than right column, with a vertical line&nbsp;between the columns.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Various things happen at different times when I try to print.&nbsp; Here are some of the things that happen:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It sounds like it's printing, but the card comes through blank;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The print is tiny, smudgy, and about half is off the edge of the card, with a huge right margin;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The print is large and most of it is off the left edge of the card, with a huge right margin.<br />
<br />
In general, it's printing way too far left (off the page), and not the correct size print.&nbsp; The&nbsp;paper doesn't&nbsp;appear to be&nbsp;"slipping" or being misfed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have tried&nbsp;"quick print," and I&nbsp;have fussed with all different settings in the Preferences tabs within&nbsp;the Print menu.&nbsp; I have tried all the options&nbsp;within the Preferences button, including setting it at letter size, then scaling it&nbsp;to 5x7.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I need to print about 200 of these.&nbsp; I would prefer to use mail merge and print the address right on the card, but if necessary, I can just print the left side, and use labels with the address for the right side.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I need to get these in the mail w/in the next 24 hours, so any help you could give me would be so much appreciated.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks forever.&nbsp; <br />

                    <p>Purchased a new&nbsp;computer with 8.1&nbsp;4 days ago and attempted to restore Outlook files saved to "ABF Outlook" backup program on new system.&nbsp; Had no success, so rather than leaving the external hard drive with back-up attached to the new computer, I saved the
 ABF file to "Recovery" on my new system.&nbsp; That was obviously not a good move, as my recovery drive on this new computer now indicates it only has 2.93GB remaining out of the original 28.8 GB!&nbsp; Next I deleted the huge Outlook file from Recovery; however the
 Recovery file size did not revert down to its original size.&nbsp; Lastly I emptied the recycle bin thinking perhaps that was the problem -- evidently not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do to restore my Recovery drive storage capacity?</p>

            <p>The 28gb recovery partition holds hidden folders pertaining to re-installation of the OS in the event of an unrecoverable crash. It is NOT an empty 28.8 gb partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as you have deleted the Outlook backups from the partition it should be ok, and be now left as it is and NOT used for personal backups..

</p><p>I've also looked at the advance options: I can't use System Restore as it says no restore points have been created on my computer's system. It's the same for System Image Recovery. Windows Memory Diagnostic doesn't fix anything. And I've also had a go at
 Command Prompt after researching the internet, making a backup of directory, but the copy has all 0 bytes for the folders so this way won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I've tried Safe Mode (all 3 variations) but the blue screen appears for a split second also, so I can't even startup using Safe Mode. Same for Last Known Good Configuration. And I don't have the original Windows 7 DVD, I have access to another computer
 but there is no Create a System Repair disc option confusingly enough. I've really ran out of ideas on what to do... can anyone help? Or is my only option to save all the data that is on my laptop harddrive and wipe everything clean?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Sound volume bar overlaps EVERYTHING -- how do I get rid of it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo Yoga 12 running Windows 10 (upgraded from the original Windows 8).</p>
<p>It has developed an annoying bar on the top left corner of the screen that blocks everything in that corner.&nbsp; It can't be moved.</p>
<p>Through trial and error, I figured out it's the volume bar for audio.</p>
<p>I wish I could figure out how to get rid of it.&nbsp; I have had to modify the top bars on all programs so that no critical icons are under it.</p>
<p>I took a screen show showing it, but am failing miserably at trying to paste it here.</p>
<p>It's a black box with column inside it.&nbsp; Most of the column is blue; the very top is white.&nbsp; "100" is below the column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get rid of this garbage?&nbsp; I have tried disabling my sound, without success.</p>

            <p>That's the bar.</p>
<p>It's there all the time.</p>
<p>I can't even adjust the volume reading down; if I try, it goes back up to 100%.</p>
<p>However, in fact, there is no sound happening on the computer.</p>
<p>Obviously it's some glitch.</p>
<p>I have tried uninstalling the Conexant sound driver, but that didn't remove the bar.</p>

            <p>I don't know if it sheds any light on the problem, but if I use the mouse or my finger on the touchscreen to move the volume bar down, it moves itself back to 100%.&nbsp; That has no effect on the lack of audio; the computer remains mute.</p>

            There definitely seems to be some problem with the audio driver. Try uninstalling all the audio devices shown under Device Manager (select the option to delete the driver if prompted) and reboot. If the overlay is still present, also check another user
 account.

            <p>I first tried uninstalling Conexant using the uninstall programs feature.&nbsp; It winked out briefly, then came back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I uninstalled using Device Manager and selected the option to delete the driver.&nbsp; The overlay disappeared until the next time I started up the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know enough about computers to know how to check another user account; I'm the only user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalling using Device Manager each time I use the computer is a good enough solution to limp along with.&nbsp; I'm already having to do the same thing every once in a while with my Synaptics touchpad driver.&nbsp; At some point I'll be replacing this computer
 and solving its many problems that way.&nbsp; M$ did a major update of Windows 8 in the fall of 2015 and messed up about a dozen functions.&nbsp; I've found work-arounds for some of those, but no long-term solutions for any of them.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since uninstalling the Conexant audio program using Device Manager, I have been happily working away without the annoying overlay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the first time today, I plugged in my USB hub that has a thumb drive, an SD card, and the little blob that reports my daily steps for my FitBit.&nbsp; The overlay immediately reappeared.&nbsp; The Conexant audio program had reinstalled itself.&nbsp; Uninstalling it
 deleted the overlay again.</p>

            Please re-read my question. I get a drastic reduction in brightness when this computer is placed on battery power, power cord removed. (extends battery life although I would just plug in the adapter when battery gets low) The color calibration is fine
 and adjusted correctly. I know because I preformed the steps as you directed and aware of these types of modifications.&nbsp; I remember Win 7 had Power Saver options and you could manually dim the screen when on battery power. Does Win 10 no longer provide this
 option. All my Power and Sleep settings are set to "never".<br />

<h2>            Cannot run php.exe after install of KB3201845, even as an administrator it gives me error message.</h2>
                    <p>Last night the&nbsp;KB3201845 was automatically installed on my Windows 10 machine. Today I cannot run php.exe on my machine. It worked yesterday evening and nothing else is changed on the PC. Reasonable conclusion is that the&nbsp;KB3201845 is causing the problem.</p>
<p>The error message given is "This app can't run on your PC".</p>
<p>I cannot see how to revert the update, is it possible? will it help?</p>
<p>What can i do to be able to run php.exe again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very annoying since I need to be able to use this program in my daily work.</p>

    <title>How do I stop Windows 10 from adjusting the volume levels in the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sebastianbenson  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop Windows 10 from adjusting the volume levels in the Volume Mixer for the various inputs</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 is auto-adjusting the volume levels on whatever I have open on an ongoing basis and doing it badly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For example, at the moment I have sound coming from a browser window, a discord app and a game. I have the Volume Mixer open and Windows keeps fiddling with the volume levels of everything for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read you forum posts at length and tried to deselect all enhancements for my output device (my headset device). The drivers I use for this device are the ones which were automatically downloaded when I plugged it in. I have not made any alterations
 (other than deselecting Enhancements) to anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This variation of volume is seriously impacting my experience in a negative way and I feel that I am perfectly able to adjust my own sounds manually and don't need Windows to interfere as now I'm having to manually adjust things on an ongoing basis to compensate
 for Windows getting it wrong over and over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please can you help me turn this system feature off once and for all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seb</p>

<h2>            Error Code&#58; 0x000014c</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was using my laptop normally and then it turned off to a blue screen of death which I didn't have enough time to remember its code, and when I tried to start my computer a blue screen showed that my boot configuration data are missing or contains errors,
 so I searched for that error and created a recovery disk and tried to do an automatic repair but it failed, I tried to go back to a restore point but it said that it couldn't be done, I tried to reset my system with keeping my files but it says that my hard
 disk is locked, I tried to repair boot from command prompt but in bootrec /rebuildbcd it says that the system device couldn't be found, I plugged the usb that I use as a recovery disk in different ports (usb 2.0) but it was all in vain. I hope you could help
 with this error. Thank you</p>

<p>Hi Johna, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome and thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>We regret the inconvenience caused to you. </p>
<p>I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please share:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Which file format you are trying to play using windows media player?</p>
</li><li>
<p>Which version of Media Player do you use?</p>
</li><li>
<p>Have you made any changes to the settings of windows media player?</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly follow the below methods and check.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Windows Media Player troubleshooter</p>
<p>1. Press the <strong>Windows</strong> key on the Keyboard. </p>
<p>2. Type <strong>control panel </strong>and then select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Click on <strong>View all</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Click <strong>Windows Media Player Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Clear the Media Player database and check for the issue.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click Start, click Run, type <strong>%userprofile%</strong>\<strong>Local Settings</strong>\<strong>Application Data</strong>\<strong>Microsoft</strong>\<strong>Media Player</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select all the files in the folder, and then click <strong>Delete</strong> on the File menu.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: You do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Restart Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.</p>
<p>If this does not resolve the problem, clear the Windows Media Player database cache files. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Exit Windows Media Player. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong>Start</strong>, click Run, type <strong>%userprofile%</strong>\<strong>Local Settings</strong>\<strong>Application Data</strong>\<strong>Microsoft</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. . </p>
</li><li>
<p>Select the <strong>Media Player folder</strong>, and then click <strong>Delete</strong> on the File menu.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Restart Windows Media Player. </p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong>:</p>
<p>If something isn’t working with Windows Media Player, you might not have the right codec on your PC. The easiest way to solve the problem is to go online and search for the codec you need.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: However, use caution when installing codecs that you find on the Internet, particularly some of the free codec packs that claim to include codecs from a wide variety of companies or organizations. Incompatibilities are known to exist
 with some of the components in these codec packs that can cause serious playback issues in the Player and other players, lead to system corruption, and make it difficult for Microsoft Support to diagnose and<br />
troubleshoot playback issues. For these reasons, we strongly discourage you from installing these codec packs, and recommend that you remove them if you have installed them and you're having problems with the Player. Install only codecs, filters, or plug-ins
 from trusted, authorized sources, such as the website of the official supplier. Even then, use caution: many codec suppliers offer minimal customer support. Before installing any digital media components, set a system restore point. The restore point enables
 you to return to your original system configuration, if necessary.</p>

            Hello SteveO_1968,<br />
<br />
<br />
To run the <strong>Bootrec.exe tool</strong>, you must start Windows RE. To do this, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Put the Windows Vista installation disc in the disc drive, and then start the computer.
</li><li>Press a key when you are prompted. </li><li>Select a language, a time, a currency, a keyboard or an input method, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Repair your computer</strong>. </li><li>Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click <strong>
Next</strong>. </li><li>In the <strong>System Recovery Options</strong> dialog box, click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>. </li><li>Type <span>Bootrec.exe</span>, and then press ENTER. </li></ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong> To start the computer from the Windows Vista DVD, the computer must be configured to start from the DVD drive. For more information about how to configure the computer to start from the DVD drive, see the documentation that is included
 with the computer or contact the computer manufacturer.</p>
Bootrec.exe options
<p>The Bootrec.exe tool supports the following options. Use the option that is appropriate for your situation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note </strong>If rebuilding the BCD does not resolve the startup issue, you can export and delete the BCD, and then run this option again. By doing this, you make sure that the BCD is completely rebuilt. To do this, type the following commands at the
 Windows RE command prompt:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>bcdedit /export C:\BCD_Backup</span> </li><li><span>c:</span> </li><li><span>cd boot</span> </li><li><span>attrib bcd -s -h -r</span> </li><li><span>ren c:\boot\bcd bcd.old</span> </li><li><span>bootrec /RebuildBcd</span> </li></ul>
/FixMbr
<p>The <strong>/FixMbr</strong> option writes a Windows Vista-compatible MBR to the system partition. This option does not overwrite the existing partition table. Use this option when you must resolve MBR corruption issues, or when you have to remove non-standard
 code from the MBR.</p>
/FixBoot
<p>The <strong>/FixBoot</strong> option writes a new boot sector to the system partition by using a boot sector that is compatible with Windows Vista. Use this option if one of the following conditions is true:</p>
<ul>
<li>The boot sector has been replaced with a non-standard Windows Vista boot sector.
</li><li>The boot sector is damaged. </li><li>An earlier Windows operating system has been installed after Windows Vista was installed. In this scenario, the computer starts by using Windows NT Loader (NTLDR) instead of Windows Boot Manager (Bootmgr.exe).
</li></ul>
/ScanOs
<p>The <strong>/ScanOs</strong> option scans all disks for installations that are compatible with Windows Vista. Additionally, this option displays the entries that are currently not in the BCD store. Use this option when there are Windows Vista installations
 that the Boot Manager menu does not list.</p>
/RebuildBcd
<p>The <strong>/RebuildBcd</strong> option scans all disks for installations that are compatible with Windows Vista. Additionally, this option lets you select the installations that you want to add to the BCD store. Use this option when you must completely

<h2>            Trouble Processing your Payment&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I don't know what is going on with Xbox today, but I'm trying to buy Need for Speed, but yet it's coming up with "Contact us at Microsoft Support" -&nbsp;"We're having trouble processing your payment and we'd like to get it sorted out." I've never had this problem before, and I know for a fact I have money because I just put in my check from work this week into my debit card. I've tried multiple games and add-ons, and they all say the same thing. I'm not sure what to do?</p>
