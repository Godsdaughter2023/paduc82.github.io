<h2>            LOCKED - Using MSP to pay for my Gold XBox Live Membership</h2>
                    
<p>Is there a reason why there is no option to pay for my yearly membership using Microsoft Points?&nbsp; I can buy just about everything else to do with XBox with them but not a membership.&nbsp; I would like to be able to do this in the future please and thank you.</p>

<p>You pay £10 for 1000MSp (I know it's not £10 but bear with me), you then use those 1000MSp to pay for a year's subscription. Net cost to you £10. Now take young Timmy over there, he pays £10 for 1000MSps and then chooses to use cash rather than MSps to pay
 for his year's subscription. Net cost to Timmy £50 because he's paid twice. Essentially anyone who pays using MSps will be getting a freebie compared to those who pay cash for both items, MS also loses money on the sales of gold subscriptions hence why you're
 not allowed.</p>

<p>I'm sorry but that still makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>A yearly Gold membership here in Canada costs $59.99. &nbsp;I can see no difference between using a credit card to pay the $59.99, paying cash for a year membership card, $59.99, or purchasing the equivalent amount of MSP (approx. 4200 MSP) to cover the $59.99.
 &nbsp;Regardless of my payment method the price of a full year is $59.99.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm an idiot but I also fail to understand how doing any of these things would be the cause of myself paying twice or Microsoft losing out on being paid for their product.</p>
<p>Could I possibly get a response from a Microsoft employee? &nbsp;I believe this is a question that others would like answered as well.</p>

<p>I'm sorry you don't understand the process or the reason, but the fact remains that you can't purchase LIVE time with MSP. You can purchase LIVE time with a credit card, Paypal, or by purchasing prepaid LIVE time cards at retailers.

<p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>I understand the process, I have been a Gold subscriber for seven straight (almost eight, renewing for eighth in July) years. &nbsp;No reason why this isn't possible has yet been offered, just that it isn't which isn't really any kind of reason or explanation
 at all.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm asking too much, I'm just a loyal Microsoft and XBox customer that has spent thousands of dollars on multiple consoles and PCs, games, accessories and Live subscriptions that was hoping to be able to use my MSP to pay for my next year of Live.
 &nbsp;Upon realizing that this option was not available, I had hoped to put the suggestion forward to Microsoft that this option be available. &nbsp;Oh well, I guess I'm just wasting my time here hoping for an actual response to my question so that I may "understand
 the process or the reason." </p>
<p>Might as well "Lock" this thread, I'm not anticipating getting an informative response to the question anymore.</p>

<p>I know the reason. Xbox live is region free, but Microsoft points are not. If you bought a live card in the US/UK/Japan/Germany/-any-other-live-supported-region it would work on your Canadian account. But, Microsoft points bought will NOT work on any other
 account besides their home region. So to prevent potential "out of area" spending, they simply disallow MS points being spent on live subs.</p>

<p>The very fact that MSP cannot be spent outside of the region that they're purchased in prevents them from being used to buy anything (content, or even a Gold membership, for that matter, if it was possible) in another region.</p>
<p>There can be no "potential out of area spending" as there is no ability to spend them "out of area" whatsoever.</p>
<p>That Gold Membership cards themselves are "region free" in and of themselves seems to encourage "out of area spending" seeing as I can buy one here in Canada and redeem it anywhere XBox Live is available.</p>
<p>To sum up: &nbsp;That XBox Live is region free is irrelevant considering that would like to use MSP (which are region specific) within the region that they are allowed to be used in.</p>
<p>Put another way: &nbsp;I would like the ability to use my region specific points in the region that they're designed to be used in to purchase something that has no region specificity.</p>
<p>My brain hurts.</p>

<p>If you compare the people having issues using their credit card to pay for live vs using it to buy MSP, you'll notice the latter is the larger group. Also, there are people who can't buy MSP who claim they can pay for live just fine, but not the reverse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer that runs live subscriptions is programmed to "wave you through", so long as your credit card clears. It won't care that the US account is using a card that belongs to a bank in Nigeria and the IP address is in China - if the card doesn't decline,
 WELCOME TO LIVE GOLD! <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-1.gif" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, the computer that runs Microsoft points is set on "paranoid mode"&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-7.gif" /> (TM). Your credit card says John C. Smith but your live account says John Smith? REJECT!
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-45.gif" /> Your IP address changed twice in the same year? REJECT!
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-45.gif" /> Your live address says "123 fake st" but your card says "123
<b>fak</b> st"? REJECT! <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-45.gif" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above are exaggerations, but you get the point. Now, it is possible to try and get around Mr. Paranoid by setting their account out of region and buying cards for that region from the Internet.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-40.gif" />
 However, sometimes Mr. Paranoid catches them on the flip side by blocking them when they make their purchase&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-39.gif" /> or by stopping the download or even corrupting the file.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-14.gif" />
 These are all over the forums and it seldom comes down to anything other than "non-supported region".
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-4.gif" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you tried to buy a gold subscription with those points, the gold subscribe machine would wave them through at once - and Mr. Paranoid can't allow that.
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-15.gif" /> So, it simply won't take them at all. Now why Microsoft set it up this way is a another question entirely... but that's how it is.

<h2>            ROP exploit blocked by Malwarebytes every time I open Edge</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a problem that I have not encountered before with MS Edge. I use Malwarebytes Anti exploit &nbsp;to protect my browsers on my PC and today it has been blocking a 'ROP exploit' of MSEdge and add ons every time I open Edge which is the default if I type
 in a search from start page/Cortana. The start/home page also fails to remain open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please enlighten me ? My PC knowledge is limited and I do not understand why this 'exploit' warning from Malwarebytes has suddenly started appearing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have posted a question in the Malwarebytes forum but have not received a reply so far.</p>

            <p>Hi Prashrey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) is one of the ways you can share an Internet connection among several PCs. To set this up, you'll need a second network adapter—a piece of hardware that makes it possible for your PC to connect to a network. You can also
 share your Internet connection using a wireless router. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may refer to the following link for more information on the same:</p>

<h2>            Project to PC&#47;Second Screen mixed up</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've&nbsp; been having an annoying problem for the past few days. I sometimes play or watch films on my TV, hence I have my TV plugged in via the DVI port as a second screen. Up until a few days ago, I could select that screen by pressing Windows+P and selecting
 "Second Screen Only". However, now it's all mixed up. My PC Monitor is now the second screen and my TV is now the "PC Screen". I've tried finding an Option that would let me set this right in both the Display Settings and the Nvidia Control Panel (I have an
 NVidia GeForce&nbsp;GTX 770). Does anyone here know how to reverse this problem? I want my PC Monitor to actually be the PC Screen in the Project Menu.</p>

                    <div>Hello All,</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So I am currently running into the problem of trying to upgrade from windows 8.1 to windows 10 but I keep getting a message that says my graphics card is not compatible with windows 10. I have a PNY GeForce 1060 on a GIGABYTE Z370XP SLI.
 I just updated the drivers on the GPU for windows 8.1 thinking that would help, but the problem is still there. Any help would be awesome. If there is anything else that you would need to know I will gladly tell you! Thanks in advance.</div>

<p>Your 1060 is obviously compatible with Win10, but you may want to uninstall the Win8.1 driver before doing the update.</p>
<p>Disabling SLI may also help ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should also download Win10 drivers for your motherboard before installing Win10 so you can install them once you</p>
<p>have completed the install.</p>
<p>I still prefer installing a driver directly from Nvidia as well - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi there. I tried downloading Win10 drivers for my 1060 instead of the windows 8 drivers and when I went to actually install them, it told me that this version of the download was not compatible with this graphics card (or something along those lines).
 I am currently looking at the drivers list for my motherboard but I'm not entirely sure what to download. I have a GIGABYTE motherboard model Z370XP SLI

<p>
</p><p>- I only meant for you to have them on hand for after you install Win10, not install them on Win8.1.</p>
<p>If you are doing an upgrade from Win8.1 it's actually best to uninstall all drivers first. Also do some house keeping.</p>
<p>Delete stuff you don't need, uninstall programs you don't use, and run Windows
<em>Disk Cleanup </em>(last).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you don't have a lot of games and software to reinstall you may find it better to do a clean install of Windows rather than an 'upgrade'.
</p>
<p>Do backup your User folder and any other important date that may not be in your User folder first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do have a lot of stuff installed try doing an upgrade to Win10 first. If for some reason it has poor performance or is buggy,</p>
<p>reformat and do a clean install. You won't loose too much time having tried the upgrade first.</p>
<p>Obviously backing up your important data is more critical here as it will all be wiped during the reformat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Use the most recent version of each of the drivers supplied by Gigabyte for you motherboard.</p>
<p>Also update the BIOS, and read the instructions carefully. An up to date BIOS can be important, particularly when changing Windows</p>
<p>versions, but they do come with some risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Don't install any of the Gigabyte Utilities until you know exactly what the do. Best to wait until you discover if you actually need them.</p>
<p>Some of these utilities such as Easy Tune have had reputations for causing conflicts now and then.</p>

                    Hi. I recently bought a dual sim S8+ and despite numerous install &amp; uninstall i cannot get it to function. I have been through the initial install/logun procedure but beyond the screen just 'spins its wheels'. My Skype account works fine via my desktop
 however nothing else works. Am i doing anything wrong or is there a workaround or do i migrate to another android supplier. ?

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
As the message says you need to re-install the BlueTooth drivers. Check with the System Maker's Support<br />
(Motherboard Maker for custom systems) or the actual device maker if using a 3rd party dongle for BlueTooth.<br />
Those should have the drivers for you to download and re-install. Update to newer versions if available.<br />
<br />
(Seems your BlueTooth OEM is Widcomm so keep that in mind in case there are other BlueTooth driver setups<br />
so you get the correct one.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

    <title>Windows 8 Default Programs for All File Extensions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> archinfo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Default Programs for All File Extensions</h2>
                    In Windows 8, clicking "Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Default Programs &gt; Associate a file type or protocol with a program", opens the "Set Associations" window.<br />
<br />
The "Set Associations" window lists all file extensions with the "Current Default" program associated with each extension.<br />
<br />
Is there a list available somewhere that shows the original programs associated with all file extensions, i.e., the programs used when Win8 was originally installed? If so, where?<br />
<br />
Is there a way to make a copy of the list shown in the "Set Associations" window that can be saved to a file?
<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

            Thank you for your reply.<br />
<br />
Since Microsoft determines the file extensions and their associated default programs when Win8 is first installed, I assume there is a list somewhere at Microsoft that has this information. Is this list available?<br />
<br />
The "assoc" command, unfortunately, does not provide the same information that is in the "Set Associations" window.<br />
<br />
The "assoc" command shows a file extension and its assigned file type, but it does not show the associated default program for that extension that is shown in the "Set Associations" window.<br />
<br />
Moreover, the "assoc" command creates a list of extensions in the "Fileassociationlist.txt" file that is different from the list of extensions in the "Set Associations" window.<br />
<br />
For example, the "Fileassociationlist.txt" file contains the ".zip" extension, but ".zip" does not appear in the "Set Associations" window.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the "Set Associations" window contains the ".pdf" extension, but ".pdf" does not appear in the "Fileassociationlist.txt" file.<br />
<br />
Why is there a difference between the extensions shown by the "assoc" command versus the "Set Associations" window?
<br />
<br />
Is there another possible way to save a copy of the information in the "Set Associations" window?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

<span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Who’s your email service provider?
</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d suggest you to check the spam/junk email folder and check if the confirmation email was received there by mistake. Generally,
 some email service providers treat any mail from unusual sources as junk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re using Hotmail and if the confirmation email is indeed in the junk folder, you can select the particular email
 and click “Not junk” to receive all further mails directly in your inbox. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Alternatively, you can request the Vimeo website to resend the confirmation email.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3> sean phil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live account hacked stolen microsoft points</h2>
                    
<p>About a week or so ago, I was getting off xbox and go to bed and such... went to dashboard to check up to see if anything special came up on spotlight, inside xbox e.t.c, Look at my account and 10,000 Microsoft points??? (over 120$ USD) as soon as i found
 out, I went to my email, and the password was changed. Luckily, I had my mobile number to text me if I had a lost pass, so I changed it and soon got access to my email. Went to my xbox folder to where all my xbox related emails come in and 2 purchases of 6000
 and 4000 microsoft points were made the morning before at 4 AM. I immediately changed the password. I soon called Microsoft RIGHT AFTER. I spoke with the rep and told him the story and was very professional about it and very sincere. He told me that it was
 confirmed that someone changed the pass and changed the secret question. (which was in "symbolic letters") Reassured that no one spent the points right after, and no one has access to my xbox other than me, I know that no one else spent the points than someone
 who wanted my account. And also the points were spent on the Xbox Live website, because you can buy Microsoft Points on here as well, and I had access to my account on Xbox, surprisingly.</p>
<p>They started the investigation about Monday or so. Now I have to wait it out. (up to 25 buisness days, past the gears of war 3 date which i was super pumped about...)</p>
<p>Now they're up to the status of pending resolution...</p>
<p>but I post on these forums to hear if they've had successful cases like this, and if anyone can help me from the Microsoft Staff As in if they got they're money refunded and such. I'm worried because as of right now, I'm desperate for money, I need to pay
 off bills, insurance, and e.t.c and I can't wait the 25 days. 120$ is alot, and I've researched up alot of cases like this, and no resolve.Luckily I have this account to last gears 3 for a bit, but my original reached rank 100 and I want the bonuses lol.</p>
<p>Yes patience is a virtue, I realize that, but when it happens to yourself as such, it takes a toll. Especially if your not making that much. I've already canceled my auto renewal for my other account, and made a huge note when I call them saying to remove
 the card as soon as the investigation is done. I've been calling them every day, and continue to do so, as such. This is my money, I NEED IT.</p>

<p>P.S <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">No I did not distribute any information about my account, or my personal details on the internet nor, does any virus that I know of exists on this computer. No one knows my password but me.</span></strong>
 If anything, they probably used a brute force program on my WLID that I've heard about.</p>

<p>My account was hacked too, &nbsp;just a few days ago too. 3 x 6000 points about $300 Canadian &nbsp;some how that makes your points sound alot cheaper. Just call your credit card people to report the fraud. &nbsp;They will do the transaction reversal. &nbsp;Mine did (or will
 eventually), getting a new card too. &nbsp;You would think &nbsp;it should take about 25 minutes work to confirm what I.P. address was used, not 25 business days. &nbsp; Given that there are likely others too, &nbsp;it makes you .wonder what is up and how they are getting our
 passwords, and when Microsoft will be puting out a warning. &nbsp; Amex didn't seem to care how the fraud happened. &nbsp;They just want to give me a new card so we can do it all over again. &nbsp;Microsoft at least recommended that I change my password. &nbsp;I'm still wondering

<p>Yes, I did call support too ( That was implied by Microsofts reccomendation to reset the password). &nbsp; My account did get suspended for a couple of weeks during their investigation, but they gave me some id's to redeem. &nbsp; I still have to do that, as it failed
 on my first try but that should make up for the missing time. &nbsp; My suggestion to Microsoft is that if someone transfers an id to a new xbox that they must re-enter the credit card security digits before money can be spent.</p>

<p>Good luck. I'm on my 2nd investigation.</p>
<p>1st investigation was started on July 9th. I called in August 15th to find out that the 1st investigation was close and was never contacted via email that it was closed. So I had them launch a second investigation and it's still open as we speak. Lucky for
 me I didn't have a card on file. Also in my case the account was migrated to Brazil and used to buy some Call of Duty Black Ops Map Pack and 2 arcade games. I don't even own that game either. This all from back in July.<br />
<br />
Also I play mostly single player games too. I don't use the same password as any other site. I don't have any viruses and I rarely even sign on to Xbox.<br />
Didn't see how much of a problem this really was until it happened to me. Seems worse to me then what my relatives went through with the PS3.</p>

</p><p><span>If the issue still persist, let us&nbsp;perform a system restore and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>System restore</strong>: This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Restore points are generated when you install a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you
<span>create a restore point manually</span>. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the section <strong>Restore from a system restore point</strong> in the following article:</span></p>

 restoring. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead

    <title>Windows 10 Update&#58; Error Code 0xc000000d - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kibblet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update&#58; Error Code 0xc000000d</h2>
                    <p>Hello. My fiancee's computer (Dell) did an auto-update this morning for Windows 10. After doing an update, it went through its usual "We've tweaked some things for you" messages as the system finished updated. Her computer loaded normally, and she was able
 to get into chrome and word document files fine. It wasn't until she tried to open file explorer or basically anything on the start bar that she noticed something was wrong. Nothing was working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As such, she figured she just needed to restart her PC. However, after restarting her PC, a blue screen saying "PC/Driver Needs to Be Repaired" error came up, along with the following error code:</p>
<p>
</p><p>0xc000000d</p>
<p>
</p><p>A note saying to run the Repair Tool to fix the issue was below the error code. Since we both upgraded our PC's to Windows 10 for free, neither of us have a CD. I went ahead and looked up what to do, and copied the Media Tool for Windows 10 onto a USB drive.
 Of course, in order to boot the USB, I have to get into BIOS, which is where the problem lies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I try to get into BIOS (through pressing F12 or F2), the screen blinks black, as though it's going to the set-up screen, and then immediately returns back to the blue screen error. I have tried several methods to get into BIOS, but every time
 BIOS tries to start up, the error message flashes back on and prevents me from getting into BIOS to run the repair file. This is extremely frustrating, considering that even if we did need to reformat her computer, we could not even get to that option because
 we are unable to get to anything because of the error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know if this is a Dell specific problem, or apart of the error problem from Windows 10. Everything seems to be blocked off, and I am unable to get into anything. The update for my computer went through fine and I have had no issue, so I am unsure
 of what is wrong or what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Folder Location for SkyDrive Files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardbtibbitts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folder Location for SkyDrive Files</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a new Surface 2 Pro 256 gig. I'm loving it but want to now take advantage of my 200 gigs of storage on SkyDrive. I have several questions I hope can be addressed here:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>As I work frequently from another computer I would like to direct my primary files to save on SkyDrive. From what I've read, I should be able to right click on a folder and then change the folder location to one of the folders on SkyDrive (i.e. change c:\users\&lt;username&gt;\documents
 to c:\users\&lt;user name&gt;\skydrive\documents). It seems to me using this process will assure that all new files and folders under that directory would always be stored on SkyDrive.
<br />
<br />
I'm finding that the only folders I can modify the folder location on are the primary system folders like documents, music, pictures, etc. The problem with this is that I don't want the entirety of my documents folder to be on SkyDrive. There are many subfolders
 that I don't want gumming up my SkyDrive. Is there a way to change the folder location on folders other than the main profile folders?
<br />
<br />
When I have tried to modify one of the profile folders locations I'm receiving a message that in part states:
<br />
<br />
<em>"if you proceed with redirection you will not be able to separate them or restore default location"</em><br />
<br />
That seems quite ominous and so I've not moved forward with SkyDrive afraid I might create a big problem for myself.<br />
<br />
</li><li>I would like to have the files on both computers pull from SkyDrive. Assuming I can change the folder locations of both computers Document folder (or subfolders within Documents), can I have duplicate folder names on both drives dumping their files in to
 one folder? If I can, what happens if I had the same file name in the same directories of both folders but with different content? Would one file just overwrite the other?</li></ol>
<p>I've searched all over the internet for a thorough best practices document for SkyDrive use but it seems almost everything I've found doesn't cover setup these topics. I would really appreciate your help and referral to any collateral materials that would
 help me.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Rick Tibbitts</p>

            <p>Hi George,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Media player is a preinstalled feature in Windows 8.1. I would suggest you to search for Windows Media Player using the search tab in the Charms bar or you could navigate to the following location and see if Windows Media Player exists:</p>
<p><strong>C:\ProgramFiles(x86)\Windows media player</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also check, if Windows media player option is checked in Windows features:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>a:</strong> Press <strong>Windows key </strong>to open the Start tile screen<br />
<strong>b:</strong> Now type <strong>Turn Windows features on or off </strong>and hit enter<br />
<strong>c:</strong> Now expand <strong>Media Features</strong><br />
<strong>d</strong>: See whether Windows Media player option is unchecked, if it is then place a check<br />
<strong>e</strong>: Click<strong> apply</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we will be glad to assist you.</p>

    <title>Suspension on Xbox Live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grifdaddy1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suspension on Xbox Live</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am suspended on Xbox live for having bad language against another person in the community. However, I did not say those bad words and it was my little brother playing Rainbow Six Siege last night. I would like to please be unsuspended because it
 was my brother, and he showed me that the person he was talking to was calling him, "trash," over and over again and it made him furious so that is the reason why he cursed to him on messages. I do think this is a flaw in Xbox Live because many people instigate
 people who have anger issues to use profanity against them just to report them and get them suspended. That being said, may I please be unsuspended from Xbox Live?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Can you confirm which version of MM you are suing and what file type you have added to the timeline.</p>
<p>Some file types work better than others, so does this happen with all types of files or just this one?</p>
<p>If just this one, you may need to convert it to a wmv before editing.</p>

            Have you placed your playback marker in the <strong><em>middle</em></strong> of a clip at the point where you want to split the video?&nbsp; Split will
<u>not</u> be available if you are at the beginning (or end) of a video clip (nor on a photo).&nbsp; So try it in the middle and see if you see the button enabled.&nbsp; Another shortcut for splitting is to use 'M' on the keyboard, but again, you must be at a logical
 point in a video to split.

<h3> oilsud  say:</h3>
<h2>            plugged in, not charging &#40;Vista issue &#63;&#41;</h2>
                    My laptop battery meter constantly reads "plugged in, not charging" in the system tray and won't charge.<br />
<br />
I have tried a number of supposed fixes and none has worked including:&nbsp; <br />
- cleaning pins and ports<br />
- changing the battery,<br />
- changing the power adapter<br />
&nbsp;-flashing the bios<br />
- updating all drivers<br />
- tapping the laptop near the inspiron logo<br />
- a series of variations on removing the battery shutting down and restarting with the battery in or out etc.<br />
<br />
I can very rarely get my battery to charge by unplugging and plugging in my AC adapter. Sometimes after about 20-30 minutes of unplugging and plugging in the adapter it suddenly starts charging.<br />
<br />
Note: each time I unplug and plug in the adapter the screen intensity lowers to reflect the battery power plan and then returns to brighter when I plug in the adapter. leading one to suspect that the laptop is drawing power from the ac adapter fine.<br />
<br />
Reading on various support forums, it seems this is an intermittent problem for nearly all makes and models of laptop owners who all have one thing in common: Vista O/S.<br />
<br />
So, the most likely reason for this problem seems to be an undiagnosed bug in Vista.
<br />
<br />
I run Visa ultimate 32bit on a Dell Inspiron 1525.<br />
<br />
I am looking for help with this problem.<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
How old is battery and how much use has it seen? This really sounds like a hardware issue so contact<br />
Dell - maybe a known issue and also check their forums.<br />
<br />
Dell Support<br />
<a href="http://support.dell.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.dell.com/</span></a><br />
<br />
Dell Forums<br />
<a href="http://en.community.dell.com/forums/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://en.community.dell.com/forums/<br />
</span></a><br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
Old battery? Unplug power to computer - remove battery and clean the contact with a pencil<br />
eraser (do not use this if your battery has thin slots just clean the knife edges that fit into<br />
them and be careful). Batteries do wear out if old, or it could be a problem with the computer.<br />
Check with the support of system maker and many have on line forums.<br />
<br />
Newer type Litium-Ion batteries usually last longer if you do not discharge then below 30%
<br />
however on a laptop that will not extend their life that much. Best is to use A/C adapter
<br />
whenever possible.<br />
<br />
I use the free version of BatteryBar to monitor my battery. Click the Green button on the
<br />
Yellow box on right side of page to download latest stable version.<br />

<p>It's fairly fast to race season race through the 3rd season, maybe 4 to 6 hours play time. &nbsp;By the end of season race, if you only use the quick upgrades that is suggested for various races (the game will prompt you for these for a given car), you should
 be sitting at around 500,000 credits. &nbsp;You can increase your credit earnings if you race on easy by simply removing the full race line and only using the brake line, if you want it, and also switching to manual shift. &nbsp;That alone will increase your earnings
 by 15% over the regular easy mode. &nbsp;Season 4 takes quite a bit longer, maybe another 4 hours, but at the end you should have roughly 1 million credits. &nbsp;At least that is the way it's worked for me on both my online and offline accounts that I use to play the
 game.</p>
<p>Also check out the online store, they offer up a lot of free cars to add to your collection. &nbsp;Also during the season race, as you level up, they give you various cars. &nbsp;I find it much faster to gain credits in Forza III than it was in Forza II for season
 play, plus the GS seems to be easier to come by.</p>

<p>I think you're misunderstanding locked. You can still purchase or win the car, but when you try to sell the car it says that it's locked. If you tune it, it unlocks the car so that you can make changes to it and also sell the car.</p>

<p>Yeah, I was thinking of a different locked. Not that I have a problem with money. I actually have more than I'll probably ever need (nothing left to buy). Besides, I'm much more into GT5 at this point. Oddly enough, I've reached the maximum money I can have
 in that game ($20,000,000).</p>

 did not work. There is no Guest user account listed in Control Panel-User Accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I want to be able to share files between a Desktop PC and 5 laptops all running windows 10 without having to login with a password. It worked fine until sometime last year. Now, it only works if I login using a Microsoft account and password.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi RichardCox5 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />Yes they changed this in version 1803 which came out last year.
<br />Now it is very difficult to get this working unfortunately.
<br />Below is a link that you should go through to make sure all your PCs are configured the same.

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I've gone through that. I can now share everything between the laptops, and I can access all the laptops from the desktop pc, but I can only access the desktop pc from the laptops if I login to the desktop pc with a microsoft account and password. Otherwise
 it asks for credentials, but doesn't accept what I type in there (the microsoft account e-mail address and password). I can live with the situation as it is now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for the help.</p>

<p>I had tried that many times over the last 4 days. It didn't work either. The local account name has no password, but password protected sharing was always on and I think that was the problem. As long as that was turned on, I coudn't connect without a password.
 When I open the credentials manager, the local account name is listed there, and although it has no password, there are 8 dots in the password space for that credential.</p>
<p>I don't know. I'm just glad it works now.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Ghost clicking &#38; spazzing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My laptop is a Dell - Inspiron 2-in-1 13.3" Touch-Screen Laptop - Intel Core i5 - 8GB Memory - 256GB Solid State Drive - Silver, I have a free trial version of windows 10. I bought it just this month, my sister also bought the same laptop and is having none
 of these problems. It has been phantom clicking and the&nbsp;mouse is&nbsp;spazzing out. It repetitively clicks in the top (usually right) corner. It does this in laptop and tablet mode. I have tried calibrating and updating. The only way to get it to stop is restarting
 or shutting it down. </p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Jessie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The possible cause of this issue is because your Windows is outdated. <span>The best way to keep your PC updated is to turn on automatic updates. With automatic updates, you don’t have to search for updates online or possibly miss critical fixes or device
 drivers for your Windows PC. Windows Update automatically installs important updates as they become available.</span><span> To turn on automatic updates in<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><span><span><span>Windows&nbsp;10</span></span></span></span></span><span>,
 follow these steps:</span></p>
