                    File Explorer Preview Pane shows preview for docx and pdf, but not for jpeg or (as far as I can tell) any photo app. &nbsp;I have tried the suggestions regarding View&gt;Options&gt;View Tab&gt;Show (or not) preview handlers. &nbsp;Doesn't help. &nbsp;Unless Microsoft programmers
 have lost their minds (a possibility given the vagaries of Windows 10), there must be a switch somewhere I cannot find. &nbsp;Has anyone who has experienced this found a solution?

<h2>            Gmail using Live Mail 12 &#38; Win10</h2>
                    <p>Your IMAP command could not be sent to the server, due to non-network errors. This could, for example, indicate a lack of memory on your system.</p>
<p>Configuration:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Account: Gmail&nbsp;xxxx<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Server: imap.gmail.com<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Username:&nbsp;xxxx<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Code: 800ccc0e</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried setting this up months ago and didn't succeed. Seems like I'm doomed to failure again despite or perhaps because I read and followed the instructions to the letter...Any suggestions, please? Yes, after each failure I "remove" the a/c and start again
 and yes, I have selected "imap" in Gmail settings, and yes, I have opted for "less secure apps"...so what have I missed this time...</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Jump Lists not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 Jump Lists not working</h2>
                    I have been using Windows 7 for quite a while now without problems. I have pinned Word, Excel and other programs to my task bar. I have been able to pin documents to these programs as well. When I right click it pops up the pinned and most recent. Yesterday,
 Excel decided that it would not do this anymore. I cannot pin anything to the program in the task bar and it does not show history. My word program works fine as well as the other programs I have pinned to the task bar. How do I fix this? It is quite annoying
 as it takes a few minutes to open Excel files by going through "My Computer."<br />
Thanks for any help.

<p><br />
Hi</p>
<p>There are several&nbsp;known problems with Excel 2007 and the Jump List component. No fixes have been released yet.</p>
<p>You can still pin items to the Excel Jump List by dragging the file and dropping it on the Excel Taskbar icon.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>In the list of results, click Windows Update.</p>
<p>Click Check online for updates from Microsoft Update, and then wait while Windows looks for the latest updates for your computer.</p>
<p>If any updates are found, click Optional updates are available.</p>
<p>Under Windows 7 Language Packs, select only the language pack that you want (installing all of them might take up too much space on your drive).</p>
<p>Click OK, and then click Install updates. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation. You might have to restart your computer too.., NOT helpful for several reason , first make sure you read
 my first post above this one before you want to answer and second this is not anything for windows 7 SP1 the install is for years ago before windows SP1 came out

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>The error seems to somehow relate to printers. Do you own a DELL printer by any chance? No matter who is the manufacturer of the printer is; try uninstalling and reinstalling the printer drivers.</div>

<h2>            Intel Audio Drivers no longer available under the Sound Manager</h2>
                    <p>So this morning 10/11/2018 before I started work, I had to restart my Windows 10 laptop. After I had restarted the computer, the audio manager is no longer working and I have no audio devices being noticed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done most things I can think of to try to fix it; ex. update drivers manually, updating via the device manager.</p>

            Hi  LoganJames
<br />
<br />The latest Windows update seems to have a bug in it, lots of users are reporting loss of audio after the latest Update, this has especially hit the Intel HD Audio versions
<br />
<br />Rather than updating your drivers, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the driver they recommend. That may be an older driver, but it will at least be compatible with your audio . .

<p>Letting us know what type of system configuration might help us.&nbsp; Many systems have audio through another device and the Intel is used for external or HDMI audio..&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance, of my 5 systems, they all have some form of Realtek audio.&nbsp; </p>

            The update still fails.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to STOP this update on machines with older AMD processors (they actually should not have released it at all, since it was NOT ready or tested properly).

            It usually gets to somewhere between 86% and 96%, then it says it can't finish and undoes the changes.&nbsp; It has gotten to be beyond annoying.

            The issue is NOT resolved - AT ALL.&nbsp; The update keeps failing to install and it is putting wear on my SSD.&nbsp; Someone has to know how to stop this update from installing - period.&nbsp; Microsoft was supposed to stop sending the update out to older AMD machines,
 but this one keeps trying it.

            Hi Najie,<br />
<br />
I believe this error is not related to Windows Update but is a result of some third party application software.
<br />
<br />
Did you recently upgrade your Operating System to Windows Vista?<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, let us try to put the computer into a clean boot to check what program is causing this error.<br />

</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Follow all the steps to find the real culprit which is causing this and try uninstalling that software to see if you’re able to get rid of this issue. Make sure, you to put the computer back to normal startup once you’re able to resolve
 this issue.<br />
<br />
Based on my further research on this issue, I came to know that the following steps have resolved the issue.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click Start, type Run in Instant Search to access Run command window.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Type<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>“C:\Program Files\Common Files\InstallShield\UpdateService\ISUSPM.EXE” -bootstrap.</strong>
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click OK.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Restart your computer.<br />
<br />
Let me know if this worked.<br />

<h2>            Do I need Microsoft Silverlight&#63; Or can I delete it&#63;</h2>
                    So I noticed the other day that Silverlight was DL'd on my system on 7/24/14. I didn't download it and in fact have been ignoring those optional things that come with my automatic updates. My question is, can I delete it safely without causing issues?
 I have Win8 and am trying to keep the amount of HD space as free as possible so I don't download or want programs that I don't need or will never use unless it's 100% necessary for the OS to function. Thanks!

            Silverlight hardly uses much disk space. Its not a requirement to have it installed, but as noted, some web pages utilize it for streaming multimedia content. I believe the last Olympics which MSNBC had exclusive rights to stream on the web, required Silverlight.
 Its what you call a Rich Internet Application, similar to Adobe Flash.

<h2>            WHEA  uncorrectable error 158 hard drive id is the same for two drives.</h2>
                    <p>Have been having some issues on this pc for some time now.</p>
<p>New build as of march 2015 AMD 9370 @4.0 gig, 32 gig ram, </p>
<p>gtx 970 4gig.</p>
<p>Was getting boot drive disconnecting from the host error messages from </p>
<p>3rd party software increasing on each boot.</p>
<p>Rma the drive for new one, clone drive and replaced it; everything is fine,</p>
<p>&nbsp;no disconnect errors.</p>
<p>10/21/2015 installing some software, bsod, whea &nbsp;uncorrectable error, system&nbsp;</p>
<p>restarts.</p>
<p>Go into bios settings, only one boot option listed for dvd drive, nothing else out</p>
<p>of seven hard drives and other dvd.</p>
<p>Reboot pc, go to event viewer disk is listed, as error 158, the drive id for disk</p>
<p>six is the same for other drive.</p>
<p>Go into disk management, all drives have their own drive letter, except two are
</p>
<p>using the same sata controler and both listed as device O on that channel;</p>
<p>they are not identical drives ( only similarity is size) but they are not on the&nbsp;</p>
<p>connection the sixth drive that had caused the bsod.</p>
<p>Have used microsoft default sata driver, the amd chipset driver, disabled and&nbsp;</p>
<p>enabled amd iommu driver in bios and uninstalled the driver in windows.</p>
<p>Another error listed was that a raid 0 reset was called by the hard disk controller.</p>
<p>Raid was never set up on this pc on either of the two sata chips on the mainboard.</p>
<p>That was something win10 decided load that driver for and is part of the cause
</p>
<p>of this issue.</p>
<p>When I look at log files and search for known issues and get returns going back as</p>
<p>far as vista, it looks like much of the code put into win10 is much the same.</p>
<p>Sad state when win10 has been touted as new and improved over all other microsoft
</p>
<p>products and built from the bottom up, just a rebrand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall performance of the drive is 75% and only the operating system and a few&nbsp;</p>
<p>lightweight tools are installed to the c drive.</p>
<p>The drive is a seagate 3tb 7200 rpm sata 6g drive not an ssd. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Info update on 10/26/2015.</p>
<p>Have done a clean install on this pc with only one blank hard drive in the system ( cleared using diskpart and clean commands.</p>
<p>Bios set to uefi and legacy boot for devices, os and hard drive option set for uefi only.</p>
<p>Cheeked to make sure boot drive was in uefi mode and using all space in gpt format.</p>
<p>Connected to internet, changed local account login to microsoft account login.</p>
<p>Shutdown system, replaced the other drives that were removed before install.</p>
<p>Boot into bios, cheek drive order is correct, boot into windows.</p>
<p>No power management settings were altered on install.</p>
<p>Reboot or cold boot the pc, go into bios, drive chain list unchanged, 0 to 4.</p>
<p>Windows start up screen comes up, pc reboots before login.</p>
<p>Go into bios, boot order has changed not just the c boot drive but all drives</p>
<p>are out of order, reset boot order to proper way.</p>
<p>Pc boots,multiple issues with fast boot, kernel power boot, shutdown and startup.</p>
<p>Turn off all power management options in power options and device manager, except &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>hybrid sleep, still same issues.</p>
<p>Turn of &nbsp;hybrid sleep, have not had issues so far.</p>
<p>Both AMD and marvell sata controllers are using native microsoft drivers at this point.</p>
<p>When the hard drives had sleep time outs, the responses time to wake the drive was
</p>
<p>very long, having to click the drive several times.</p>
<p>This could also been part of the drives being shuffled around in the bios.</p>
<p>This is a serious issue, that the bios settings are working on the fly.</p>
<p>There needs to be some sort of boot flag set by the os to have the bios retain the last boot</p>
<p>record, thought win10 did this but maybe not.</p>
<p>A needs to be a better controller for sata devices, because the native windows drivers do not seem to work well with newer, bigger and faster drives.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Insider build number is 10240 was activated two weeks before public release. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not seen build updates on this pc or the other system that was an upgrade</p>
<p>from win8.1 ( upgrade on that pc was done using usb media after july 29th).</p>
<p>The drivers for the motherboard ga-990fxa-ud5 rev 3.1 have been installed or&nbsp;</p>
<p>updated to the current available from the OEM, AMD and Gigabyte.</p>
<p>The topic pc has had this issue in various ways from very early on.</p>
<p>Can not prove this, but I believe most pc builds of of Gigabytes ud3 and ud5</p>
<p>based boards have driver issues, some are corrected by driver installation,</p>
<p>but others stay broken.</p>
<p>Think this is due to the microsoft or oem drivers that are not completely removed</p>
<p>on any kind of update path.</p>
<p>This needs to be looked at by the engineering team because as I have stated, what</p>
<p>has been done and what still does not work.</p>
<p>A fresh install may or may not fix this, but what bios settings &nbsp;need to be active or&nbsp;</p>
<p>off because of driver issue needs to be made available to the users.</p>
<p>The link posted to fix the issue was done before this post.</p>
<p>What I would like to know is where can I find a list of certified &nbsp;drivers that work
</p>
<p>in &nbsp;win10.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>3rd party program is hard disk sentinel pro.</p>
<p>The build was 10240 insider activated two weeks</p>
<p>before public release.</p>
<p>After not receiving any new builds for some time, </p>
<p>opted out of the insider builds.</p>
<p>According to the reports of when will this edition </p>
<p>of win10 expire, info I received back was that the pc is </p>
<p>permanently activated, so a clean install may have to be done.</p>
<p>But if the issue is not fixed on said fresh install would be a waste&nbsp;</p>
<p>of time and energy.</p>
<p>Shutting of AMD iommu driver in bios and uninstalling the driver</p>
<p>in windows fixed the issue of complete shut down.</p>
<p>On four pcs with &nbsp;hard disk sentinel, one win7, one vista and one </p>
<p>other win10 pc, I do not see this&nbsp;error.</p>
<p>Moving the boot drive from the AMD sata to the marver controller has </p>
<p>no effect, as well as placing the drive in an external enclosure.</p>
<p>My belief is that win 10 configured the controller the wrong way on either</p>
<p>the first install or a preview update that is causing the issue, forced updates</p>
<p>did not help.</p>
<p>I have seen both ud3 and ud5 motherboard user's have issues with win10.</p>
<p>Going to start a new topic on these boards and see what kind of feedback I get.</p>

<h3> an unseen enemy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Discs not being detected</h2>
                    
<p>The day the newest Dashboard Update came out and I downloaded it my Xbox 360 stopped recognizing discs. When I put a disc into the tray the Xbox 360 gives me no error message and acts like I did not put a disc in.</p>
<p>The day the update came out I was sitting in the menu of XCOM: Enemy Unknown and tried to go to multiplayer and was told to sign into Xbox Live. To do that I needed to download the newest Dashboard Update. After downloading the update my Xbox showed no game
 in the tray. I turned off the console and tried again with no success. I cleared my cache and tried again with no success. I tested 3 Xbox Games, 12 Xbox 360 Games and 2 DVDs. I have not found a single disc that my Xbox will detect.</p>
<p>My Xbox 360 is a Pro with an upgraded 120GB HD and has a BENQ Disc Tray.</p>

<p>I am curious as to why you specified that it has a BENQ disc tray. Is this a modification and, if so, have you eliminated all possibilities of that being the cause of the problem by using the default tray? Sometimes, with new updates, compatibility issues
 will occur in modified devices because they are not considered the "default device" - basically the device that the program and machine considers normal across all systems. It's a similar issue when using software that interfaces with a hardware device over
 computers using an older (or sometimes even newer) Operating System.</p>
<p>If this does not remedy your problem, then it may possibly be a fault with the dashboard installation. On your console, go to Settings hub, and then select System.</p>
<p>Select Storage.</p>
<p>On your controller, press the following button sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the left bumper. </li><li>Press the right bumper. </li><li>Press the X button. </li><li>Press the left bumper. </li><li>Press the right bumper. </li><li>Press the X button. </li></ol>
<div>If the issue continues to persist, please make another post going over any other details of the problem you are experiencing (any issues with the disc spinning, problems opening/closing the tray, any error codes, things along those lines).</div>

<p>I specified that my console has a BENQ Disc Tray simply because before posting my problem I read through the forums to find similar problems and solutions and it seems everyone with a problem similar to mine has said that they have a BENQ Disc Tray. My Xbox
 360 is a replacement version I received after sending in a console with the RROD to Microsoft. I have made no modifications to the console except for buying a bigger hard drive.</p>
<p>I deleted and then reinstalled the update and nothing changed. I experience no problems other then the Xbox 360 acts as if there is no disc. I get no error codes, discs spin inside the Xbox, I can open/close my tray just fine.</p>

Sorry, but that is the only information we would be able to offer you in regards to the disc unreadable issue on all of your games.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Which&nbsp;Skype version are you using? There are several different things that may be causing the problem, but most fixes should
 only take a moment to try.</span></p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>If Skype for Windows Desktop is installed uninstall<span> and reinstall it.</span><strong>
</strong><span><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10634/how-do-i-uninstall-and-reinstall-skype-for-windows-desktop?q=uninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Go here</span></a>
 then locate "Completely uninstall and reinstall Skype" and follow the instructions carefully. Do not sign in yet and follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><strong>Click the Tools menu and select "Options".
</strong>This will open Skype's Options menu, where you'll be checking what playback device is selected.
</span></li><li><span><strong>Click the "Audio Settings" option in the left menu.</strong> You'll see options for your microphone and speakers on the right.
</span></li><li><span><strong>Check the playback device selected in the "Speakers" drop-down menu.</strong> This should be the port that your speakers or headphones are plugged into. It should typically be the
 "Speakers" option. </span></li><li><span><strong>Click the blue Play button to play a test ring.
</strong>This can help you determine if you've selected the correct playback device.
</span></li><li><span><strong>Click the "Advanced options button" to see the device order.
</strong>If your regular playback device is located lower on the list, move it to the top so that it is chosen as the default.
</span></li><li><span><strong>Unplug and then reconnect your speakers or headphones.</strong> If you've selected the correct device and it's still not working, try unplugging your speakers or headset and then
 plugging it back in. Oftentimes, this will cause Skype to re-detect the device. Make sure that the "Automatically adjust speaker settings" box is checked before plugging it back in.
</span></li><li><span><strong>Reboot your computer.</strong> Oftentimes, a simple reboot will solve the problem that you're having. Sign in to Skype app and check.
<br />
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If rebooting doesn't work, try the more advanced fixes below.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Open the Windows Sound panel and check your default device.</strong> Open the Start menu or screen and type "mmsys.cpl". This will launch the Sound panel. In the "Playback" tab, find your speakers or headset and then click the "Set Default" button.
 Try Skype again to see if it is working now. If it isn't, read on. </li><li><strong>Open the Device Manager. Press ⊞ Win+R and type "devmgmt.msc".</strong> This will launch the Device Manager, which lists all of your installed hardware.
</li><li><strong>Expand "Sound, video and game controllers". </strong>This will display all of the sound adapters installed on your device. You may have multiple sound devices listed here.
</li><li>
<div><strong>Right-click on your sound device and select "Update Driver Software".</strong>Select "Search automatically for updated driver software" to have Windows find the latest version online. The "driver" is the software that controls your
 hardware. Updating the driver can help fix issues with it not working in Skype. <br />
•&nbsp;If Windows finds an updated version, follow the prompts to install it and then test your&nbsp;device in Skype again.<br />
Try disabling and re-enabling your sound hardware. If updating the drivers doesn't fix your problem, turning the card off and then back on may fix it.
<br />
•&nbsp;Right-click on the hardware in Device Manager and select "Disable". Confirm that you want to turn it off.<br />
•&nbsp;Once it's disabled, right-click it again and select "Enable". This will turn it back on. Try Skype again to see if it's working.</div>
</li><li><strong>Try the audio troubleshooter. </strong>Microsoft has a tool to <a href="http://support2.microsoft.com/mats/audiorecording/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>This wasn't me not knowing my way around the sound settings on the computer, or how to configure skype - I've used skype for many years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a new windows 10 pc, I searched skype, it found it, added it, and when launched it did not work with supposedly&nbsp;ms skype&nbsp;certified hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I resolved the issue myself by going back to a previous version of skype and it worked fine.&nbsp; The reliability of MS patches and updates has improved so much over the years and then bam this piece of crap</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not real crazy about the recent skype changes - no personalized voicemail message any longer. My linux computers versions of skype have stopped notifying me of inbound calls.&nbsp; The forward users to voicemail after a certain number of seconds has stopped working
 numerous times- people tell me my phone just rings and rings. I know how to login and set that at the website, the issue is I never changed that setting (why would I)&nbsp;and yet&nbsp;it was changed. Email alerts about new voicemail messages don't work reliably- not
 sure why, they worked just fine for years. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked at ms, I like ms- but boo! on skype as of late</p>

<h2>            Multiboot windows 8 and XP</h2>
                    I have a new laptop with Windows 8. There are quite a few hardware and software issues. My other machine runs XP SP3 and these issues don't exist. Therefore I want to install XP onto my new laptop as a multiboot. I have shrinked (Shrunk?) the existing
 C: and created a new partition called X: (30GB). I can't get my laptop to boot from CD despite making changes in the BIOS. I can run it from setup.exe, but I don't get the option to install XP - it is greyed out - only the other options which are not what
 I want to do. I want to do an (advanced) install to the new X: drive so that I can have the option at boot to choose the operating system. I'm hoping that this will give me a workaround until microsoft sort out the problems with windows 8 ( ha! ha!)

            It makes sense why it will not let you do it within the Windows 8 environment because it thinks your upgrading a three generation older operating system onto Windows 8 and Windows thinks you want to do an upgrade.
<div><br />
<div>The only way to Install Windows XP is to do it with the cd so your in a Catch-22 until you figure out how to install it via BIOS. Or you can run a Virtual Machine setup using a program called Virtual Box but I have no way to know &nbsp;if your hardware supports
 virtual mode.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't know why it will not boot from the BIOS if you don't know how to change the bootorder within the bios then press f10 or f11 when your laptop boots up it will give you an option to choose if you want to boot from your cd drive or hard drive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also if you want to edit the bootloader there is a great program called EasyBCD you can download from download.com just in case your having problems accessing the Windows XP partition later on.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you use EasyBCD you will lose the graphical bootloader that Windows 8 displays on startup when you have a dualboot configuration.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since it looks like the Windows 8 bootloader is a separate program if you choose Windows XP or another operating system that is not Windows 8 it will automatically reboot. I believe it is some sort of security precaution with the Windows 8 bootloader if
 you do use the EasyBCD bootloader it will not do that.&nbsp;</div>

<p>It would be recommended you install Windows XP in a virtual machine. </p>
<p>The following references Windows 7, but the same principles apply to Windows 8:</p>
<p>The following instructions will show how to dual boot Windows 7 and XP on your machine instead of replacing one with the other.
</p>
<b>
<p>It is important you have a reinstallation or repair disc in case you need to reinstall or repair your WIndows 8 installation.
</p>
<p>The following article will show you how to create a repair disc (references Windows 7, same instructions for Windows 8):</p>

<b><span>
<p>Drivers for Windows XP:</p>
</span></b>
<p>You should first find out if your computer is compatible with Windows XP. A lot more modern computers are phasing out support for Windows XP.</p>
<b>
<p>Create Partition</p>
</b>
<p>Open a Run command (Press Windows key + R) on your keyboard. Then type diskmgmt.msc then hit Enter on your keyboard.</p>
<p>Once Disk Management is open, select the C:\ or where Windows 8 is installed. </p>
<p>Right click it and click Shrink menu. </p>
<p>Wait while Windows 8 checks for available disk space.</p>
<p>Enter the amount you want to allocate.</p>
<p>Click OK. </p>
<p>The Disk Management window should display unallocated disk space. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<b>
<p>Install Windows XP</p>
</b>
<p>In order to install Windows XP on the partition you created, you will need to boot into your BIOS and set the hard disk mode to IDE.
</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>After you have set the hard disk IDE mode, you can proceed to install Windows XP on the partition you created;</p>
<p>Insert your Windows XP CD, then restart your computer.</p>
<p>When prompted to boot from the CD, do so. This requires pressing any key on your keyboard.</p>
<p>Windows XP will go through its setup process. </p>
<p>Once you arrive at the Welcome Setup, press Enter on your keyboard to begin the setup process</p>
<p>Press F8 on your keyboard to accept the license agreement</p>
<p>Select the partition </p>
<p>Select Format the partition using the NTFS file system</p>
<p>Press F on your keyboard to begin the formatting.</p>
<p>Installation files will now be copied to your hard disk</p>
<p>Your system will be restarted, Windows XP setup will continue</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------</p>
<b>
<p>After Windows XP installs successfully, you will not be able to boot into Windows 8 This is where the recovery disc for Windows 8 comes in.</p>
</b>
<p>Boot from the Windows 8 DVD</p>
<p>a) At the Install Now screen</p>
<p>b) Click Repair your computer</p>
<p>c) Click Advanced Options</p>
<p>d) Click Troubleshoot</p>
<p>e) Click Startup repair</p>
<p>f) Follow the on screen instructions</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>After you have repaired your Windows 8 installation and try to boot it, you will notice that Windows 8 does not boot.
</p>
<p>Boot into the BIOS again and set the hard disk mode to SATA. You will now be able to boot into Windows 8 again.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------</p>
<p>After doing that, download EasyBCD and add a boot entry for Windows XP to the Windows 8 boot manager;</p>
<p>EasyBCD by NeoSmart Technologies would be your answer, it provides a graphical front end to the BCDEdit Command line that makes it easy for you to define start-up settings and edit boot entries on the new Windowsboot manager.

<p>The next step now is make it possible for Windows 8 to boot in IDE mode. </p>
<p>Here are the instructions for doing that:</p>

<span>
<p>Welcome all , so let me explain I installed Windows 8 With AHCI set from Bios , but after that i wanted to use ide (becose it boots faster) and when i set Ide from Bios , the windows 7 loading screan camed upp and BSOD (Blue screen of death) with an error
 code 0x0000005B , i tryed the regedit trick by setting in the "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESystemCurrentControlSetServicesMsahci" and then in the right pan the START value from 0 i set it to 1 and it supposed to be working but it was a failiure , it still did the Bsod
 and i was so pissed of , i wanted to make it work ... AND I DID IT !<br />
<br />
Here are the pases :<br />
1) I assume u have installed Windows Vista or Windows 8 with AHCI set from BIOS !<br />
2) Download my registry fix (to add the ide keys to regeditor) simply apply the key
<br />
3) Now the manually regedit part Go to : <br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_Msahci <br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_iaStor<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_iaStorV<br />
<br />
And in thease three keys in the right pan u will find a key named "START" change at all three (Msahci,iaStor,iaStorV) values from 0 To 1
<br />
Now navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_PciIde<br />
,then change the start value to "0" <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4) Now u are allmost done , restart your computer/laptop , and go to Bios and set from AHCI to IDE !!! , save settings in Bios and restart<br />
<br />
5)Windows will be loading , and VOILA !!! NO BSOD !!! , windows Vista/Seven will install new Ide drivers and u will see in windows device manager that you dont have AHCI drivers anymore , u have Ide drivers !<br />
6)It will prompt for another restart , just restart it and u will be happy </p>

            Hi there,
<div>thanks, Scamly and Andre de Costa for your quick responses. I need to think about the info you have given me. I have a recovery disk which I made when I first got my m./c (about 2 weeks ago).</div>
<div>Setting up the dual booting seems quite complicated compared to previous operating systems. And I'm not too happy about making direct edits to the registry.</div>
<div>I assume that Win8 was installed with AHCI as the machine came preloaded. I assume that allowing W8 to boot in IDE is just something you wanted to do to increase boot speed and not necessary for dual booting Win8 &amp; XP? Why would Microsoft choose an option
 that results in slower boot? Presumably there are some pros and cons?</div>
<div>Best wishes ... John N</div>

winesunswim</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The long guide for installing XP on a Win 8 computer is really too complicated even for an advanced user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. There is no problem in installing XP using IDE mode on free space on disk - no partition, just free space ! XP will create the partition from free space during installation.</p>
<p>2. Boot XP. Install AHCI driver in Windows XP.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Download and install <a href="http://www.boyans.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Visual BCD</a> package in XP.
</p>
<p>4. Run "Dual-boot Repair" tool (part of package)-&gt; "Automatic Repair".</p>
<p>5. Reboot. Switch in BIOS disk to AHCI.</p>
<p>6. Reboot - you will boot to Windows 8 by default.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;Install Visual BCD in Win 8. Run Visual BCD Editor.</p>
<p>8. Right click in left pane, select "Create missing Windows loaders". Confirm.</p>
<p>9. Reboot - you will have a dual-boot menu Win 8 and XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            I don't see how I can boot with XP as my Win8 m/c will not recognise the (genuine) XP installation disc. It seems to me that the only way I can get XP to work is if I completly get rid if Win 8 first, and quite honestly if I do that I don't think I'll
 put it back on again (assuming the system restore disc would work anyway). I'm not opposed to change, but Win 8 doesn't seem to offer anything that I didn't have with XP and much of my paid for s/w won't work with XP. So much for backwards compatibilty. I
 thought MicroSoft had sorted this problem out with the US government some years ago!
<div><br />
<div>Back to your post: &nbsp;How can I boot with XP in IDE mode? Could you be more specific on how to do it please? Could you perhaps give an almost key by key instruction?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your help. I'm currently getting over the problem by using another machine on my network as an 'XP Server' as it's the only way I can run the s/w I need and have paid for!!</div>

            <p>You can boot IDE/AHCI by changing BIOS settings for disk access.</p>
<p>When you change to IDE mode you can install XP without problems.</p>
<p>Then you can install AHCI driver in XP so XP will be prepared to boot using AHCI disk access next time it boots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then follow guide already posted above.</p>

<br />
I'm intrigued by your reply and here is why:<br />
<ul>
<li>The subject of your post is "create user from command prompt". The answer I gave you will certainly do this.</li><li>If you had stated that you were unable to log on then I would have given you a method to resolve this issue.</li><li>You found your own solution but you chose to keep it to yourself, thus depriving other people who might read this thread of your answer.<br />
<br />
</li></ul>
If this happens to you again then I recommend using a subject such as "Forgot my password, cannot log on" as this would summarise your situation in one phrase. Creating an account from a command prompt is quite irrelevant in your case.<br />

<h2>            How to activate a KMS client Windows 7 clients&#63; How about Office Pro 2010&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone, please help~~ I have been struggling for 2 days on this simple VMWare desktop deployment/composition.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After all the reading patiently today.. finally I know how to setup a KMS host. I made a win7 to be KMS host, and create the _vlmc srv record in the dns. I ran some commands to verify the status on the KMS host and it seems to be fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I would like to ask...let's say...after finishing the Windows 7 installation.... Do I need to do something to make that Windows 7 to be KMS client? Also, do I need to take any actions at all to activate the windows 7 license on the client? Or is it automatically
 access to the KMS host?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about the Office Pro? Do I need to take any action to make the PC to act as a kms client?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance, and hope you can share your ideas.</p>

            <p>Yes, you'll need to install drivers for whatever audio device you have.</p>
<p>Re-post with the make, name and exact model number of your machine. Should it be one that was cobbled together from different parts, give either sound card or motherboard info.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

<h2>            Windows search not working correctly. Could it be a corrupt admin acct&#63;</h2>
                    <p>original title: WINDOWS 7 SEARCH NOT WORKING CORRECTLY--CORRUPT ADMIN ACCT?</p>
<p>AS A NON-TECH SAVVY USER WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE HELP!</p>
<p>WHILE SIGNED IN TO WINDOWS 7 HOME PREMIUM AS AN ADMINISTRATOR THE&nbsp;SEARCH FUNCTION (&nbsp;FROM THE START MENU OR A SEARCH BOX) DISPLAYS ONLY REULTS FOR PROGRAMS AND CONTROL PANEL DESPITE PUTTING KNOWN DOCUMENTS FROM THE DOCUMENT FOLDER AND CLEARLY VISABLE DOCUMENTS
 FROM MY DESKTOP IN THE SEARCH PANE__I ALSO CAN'T CHANGE THE COLOR OF MY DESKTOP BACKROUND. IT WAS WORKING FINE APPROX 1-2 WEEKS AGO.</p>
<p>AFTER&nbsp;6 HOURS ON THE PHONE WITH BOTH HEWLETT PACKARD AND MICROSOFT TECH HELP A TECH HELP PERSON CREATED A NEW ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT AND WHEN I SEARCHED WITH IT THE MISSING SEARCH CATEGORIES AND FILES/FOLDERS WITHIN THEM__EMAIL, DOCUMENTS, ETC. APPEARED AS
 THEY SHOULD.&nbsp; I WAS TOLD THAT MY USER ACCOUNT WAS CORRUPTED AND I WOULD HAVE TO USE THE NEW ACCOUNT AND THE OLD USER ACCT &amp; BEAR WITH THE INCONVIENIENCE THAT CAME WITH THAT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IS MY USER ACCOUNT DEFINATELY CORRUPT?</p>
<p>IS THERE NO OTHER SOLUTION THAN TO ACCEPT THAT MY MAIN ADMINISTRATIVE USER ACCOUNT WILL NO LONGER HAVE THE RAPID SEARCHES WHICH ARE ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL IMPROVEMENTS IN WINDOWS 7?</p>
<p>DO YOU NEED ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OTHER THAN WHAT I HAVE PROVIDED THINKING IT MIGHT BE USEFUL? (SEE BELOW)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SOME ADDITIONAL INFO:</p>
<p>WINDOWS VERSION: WINDOWS 7 HOME PREMIUM X64</p>
<p>OTHER PROGRAMS WHICH MIGHT IMPACT THIS PROBLEM (UNSURE): NORTON 360 PREMIER EDITION.</p>
<p>OTHER HARDWARE: SANDISK ULTRA USB 2.0 32GB FLASHDRIVE USED FOR LOCAL BACKUPS.</p>
<p>HAVE NEVER RECEIVED ANY ERROR MESSAGES ABOUT THIS.</p>
<p>SEARCH AND INDEXING TROUBLESHOOTER RUN (REGULAR &amp; AS ADMINISTRATOR)__ COULDN'T IDENTIFY ANY PROBLEM.</p>
<p>DISK CLEANUP__&nbsp;PROBLEM NOT FIXED.</p>
<p>SYSTEM FILE CHECKER RUN FROM STARTUP__ NO PROBLEMS FOUND.</p>
<p>INNUMERABLE REMOTE TECH HELP TRIPS INTO MY FILES TO BE INDEXED AND REBUILDING OF MY INDEX__ PROBLEM NOT FIXED.</p>
<p>NEW ADMINISTRATIVE ACCT CREATED__ SEEMS TO WORK FINE BUT MY MAIN WORK ACCOUNT CAN'T SEARCH (A LARGE PAIN).</p>

            William,
<div><br />
<div>When rebuilding the index did you try also adding the <b>users</b>&nbsp;folder to the list of included locations? Verify that:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>Click <b>start.</b></li><li>Type <i>index.</i></li><li>From the list, click <b>Indexing options.</b></li><li>Verify that the <b>users</b>&nbsp;folder is on the list and that the <b>exclude</b>&nbsp;section has AppData (depending on the number of profiles, you'll see more than two.)</li><li>If you don't see the <b>users</b>&nbsp;folder, <a href="http://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-7/windows-7-file-search-indexing-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
follow this steps</a> (start at <b>to add a new location to the index...</b>).</li></ol>
<div>By default Win7 doesn't index the contents of C:\Users\<i>username</i>\AppData for all user profiles on your computer. You will have to do that manually. Also, by default, the AppData folder is hidden. To make it visible and exclude them from indexing:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Open Windows Explorer (computer).</li><li>Click <b>Organize</b>.</li><li>Click <b>Folder and search options</b>.</li><li>Click the <b>View</b>&nbsp;tab.</li><li>Make sure that the radio button of <b>Show hidden files, folders and drives</b> is selected.</li><li>Follow all the steps that I described in the first section of this posting. If you're adding the
<b>users</b>&nbsp;folder, make sure that you expand <b>local disk -&gt; users -&gt; </b><i><b>username</b>&nbsp;</i>and delete the check mark by the AppData folder.</li><li>While in the <b>folder options</b>&nbsp;window, click the <b>Search</b>&nbsp;tab and click the
<b>Restore defaults</b>&nbsp;button.</li></ol>
When you finish, I strongly recommend to follow 1-5 just above and to set <b>Don't&nbsp;Show hidden files, folders or drives</b>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Do not forget to mark my posting as answered and/or helpful. I'm working very hard to build a reputation in this forum.</div>
