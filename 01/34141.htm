            Hi Andre, I have followed your instructions that you mentioned above and I was not able to fix the problem. However, I did manage to fix the problem by changing the BIOS settings on my computer, after trying the things you instructed me to do while using
 the default BIOS settings.&nbsp; The settings that I changed In&nbsp;the Bios were in the section labled "Boot" in that section, I changed the option "Boot List Option" from UEFI to Legacy and then I changed the option "Load Legacy Option Rom" from Disabled to Enabled.
 Thank you, for your help and quick reply.

            Hi <span>Sue Terjesen,<br />
<br />
<span>The error you received may be caused by these 2 possible reasons:<br />
<br />
1. Incorrect POP settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) - check with your provider if it is required or not<br />
<br />
2. Firewall blocking ports (usually port 25) - could be 3rd party since Windows Firewall generally allows this port through, unless specifically told not to do so<br />
<br />
Also, please reconfigure your account in Windows Live Mail. Please click on this link for instructions:<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Blue Screen Errors constantly</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC has been having a lot of blue screen errors recently, and nothing I tried helped,
</p>
<p>Here are a few errors (they happen randomly, sometimes 10 hours pass, sometimes 15 minutes):</p>
<p>
</p><p>-System service exception (dxgkrnl.sys, afd.sys)</p>
<p>-Kmode exception not handled</p>
<p>-Unexpected kernel mode trap</p>
<p>-Attempted to write read only memory</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>-Clean reinstall of windows 10 from a boot USB (twice)</p>
<p>-Driver verifier</p>
<p>-Chkdsk</p>
<p>-Memory check (100% no errors)</p>
<p>-Checked system file integrity</p>
<p>-Graphics, Chipset, and other drivers updated to newest</p>
<p>-Graphics drivers reverted back to older versions</p>
<p>-Clean boot without any non-Microsoft drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I haven't tried that may help?</p>
<p>-Flashing Bios (although the PC starts just fine)</p>
<p>-Reverting back to the pre Fall creators update windows version</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC is not even a year old, is it possible this is a hardware issue anyway? Should I try the two options listed? Please help!</p>

<p>Hi Regile,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated my BIOS to the latest version (3504 for AMD Z170-A motherboard), the blue screen errors strangely didn't happen for about a day and a half. But today I'm getting them again, I have uninstalled everything I installed today, and they still persist.
 Checked for memory test, ran an "sfc /scannow", and all returned 100%. I have no idea what is causing this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since we've already upgraded the firmware of the BIOS, we recommend that you perform a clean installation of Windows 10 by formatting your hard drive. After doing a clean installation, kindly observe if the issue is still occurring. Click this

<p>
</p><p>Note: Don't install any applications/programs after clean installation, to check if the issue is software or hardware related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what happens after.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like it is a hardware issue after all. I formatted my SSD and HDD, and then tried to install windows 10 from a boot USB (which I created with an up-to date media creation tool). And I got Blue screen errors every time, DURING the windows installation.
 So it's definitely not a driver issue. I'm suspecting it is the motherboard. Now (2 days later) when I start it the screen just stays black, doesn't even get to Bios (HDMI cable and screen works, I'm using them on my laptop atm). So I'll probably send the
 PC back to the shop and let them figure out what the problem is, luckily I have a warranty on the motherboard. Or do you have any other suggestions?</p>

<p>It's possible that the issue is related to the motherboard since the BIOS is not accessible, as what you've concluded on the troubleshooting steps that you've tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated on the results, after the repair is done on your motherboard.</p>

Reboot the PC and then hit F8 to launch the Windows Advanced menu and then choose "<b>Safe Mode With Command Prompt</b>" from the menu.
<br />
<br />
When the command prompt loads, type: <b>sfc /scannow</b> and hit Enter to run the system file checker which will detect that sfc_os.dll is missing and replace it.
<br />
<br />

            <br />
Not to be a jerk but...<br />
<br />
Those are some ideas, but there are lots of reasons why they will not work.<br />
<br />
First of all, there is no error 'sfc_os.dll file' missing' so Sahihyan needs to provide more information and the correct error message.<br />
<br />
Second of all, the sfc_os.dll is one of the 3498 files that Windows File Protection looks after so it should never be missing.&nbsp; It takes extra effort to even delete it on purpose.&nbsp; Try renaming or deleting yours and Windows File Protection will quickly and
 silently replace it unless WFP is also afflicted.<br />
<br />
So if it really <i>is </i>missing, it was probably quarantined by the unspecified antivirus/antimalware application on the system of unspecified make and model with unspecified XP version and Service Pack<br />
<br />
Next, you can't run sfc /scannow in Safe Mode and if you were to actually try it yourself, you will get an error like this:<br />
<br />
Windows File Protection could not initiate a scan of protected system files.<br />
The specific error code is 0x000006ba [The RPC server is unavailable.].<br />
<br />
You cannot start the RPC Server in Safe Mode either.<br />
<br />
You could however run sfc /scanonce to initiate a /scannow on the next reboot:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310747/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310747/en</a><br />
<br />
But that will only work if you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (most people don't).&nbsp; And it still will not replace a missing sfc_os.dll file in the system32 folder since that is not what
 sfc does, that is not how it works and that is not what it is for (try it).<br />
<br />
If the sfc_os.dll file is really missing, no matter what mode you use to boot you will see this:<br />
<br />
winlogon.exe - Unable to Locate Component<br />
This application has failed to start because sfc_os.dll was not found.&nbsp; Re-installing the application may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
Click OK and things should look okay if nothing else is wrong.&nbsp; You should still get a desktop and be able to maneuver unless something there is some other problem.<br />
<br />
If the sfc_os.dll file is corrupt, you will see this:<br />
<br />
winlogon.exe - Bad Image<br />
The application or DLL C:\windows\system32\sfc_os.dll is not a valid Windows image.&nbsp; Please check this against your installation diskette.<br />
<br />
Then when you do get past that, sfc /scannow will not work either because it will not run without the sfc_os.dll file and if you were to actually try that you will see this:<br />
<br />
sfc.exe - Unable to Locate Component<br />
This application has failed to start because sfc_os.dll was not found.&nbsp; Re-installing the application may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
Window File Protection is also broken if that file is missing.<br />
<br />
Let me assure you with 100% certainty that running sfc /scannow will not 'detect that sfc_os.dll is missing and replace it'.&nbsp; That is not what sfc /scannow does, that is not how it works and that is not what it is for.&nbsp; That is what a lot of people think it
 does, but I can give you a test scenario you can go through to see what sfc /scannow really does and what it doesn't do.<br />
<br />
Why not boot your system in Safe Mode (so Windows File Protection is not running) or the Recovery Console and rename your sfc_os.dll to something you can remember:<br />
<br />
From the system32 folder:<br />
<br />
rename sfc_os.dll&nbsp;&nbsp; sfc_os.xxx<br />
<br />
Now the file is "missing" (but you can rename it back later).&nbsp; Since Windows File Protection does not run in Safe Mode, the file will not be automatically replaced.<br />
<br />
If you were to boot normally and rename the file, Windows File Protection would quickly and silently replace it and put a message like this in the Event Viewer System log:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows File Protection<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 64002<br />
Description:<br />
File replacement was attempted on the protected system file c:\windows\system32\sfc_os.dll. This file was restored to the original version to maintain system stability. The file version of the system file is 5.1.2600.5512.<br />
<br />
That is Windows File Protection in action.<br />
<br />
When your file is "missing" because you renamed it in Safe Mode or the Recovery Console, Reboot and see how your ideas about Safe Mode and other things work out.<br />
<br />
We know XP keeps backup copies of critical system files here (assuming XP is installed in the Windows folder on your C drive):<br />
<br />
C:\windows\system32\dllcache<br />
<br />
So you could copy the file from there into the system32 folder, reboot and see how things look.&nbsp; But if it was quarantined by the unspecified antivirus/antimalware program, it may have also quarantined the backup copy so you are going to have to get it someplace
 else - and most people don't have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as their installed Service Pack, so now what?!<br />
<br />
If you installed SP3 from a download, there may be a copy here:<br />
<br />
C:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386<br />
<br />
If it is still missing, there is a copy on my SkyDrive to download.<br />

I must admit I've never tried it on XP, but it can be run in Safe Mode on Win 7 and 8, so I assumed that XP wouldn't be any different.

            Hi Levente 
<br />
<br />What version of Microsoft Office did you have installed on your PC, and was that licence attached to your Microsoft Account, when you activated it?
<br />
<br />If so, go to <a href="http://www.office.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.office.com</a> and if you're not already signed in, select Sign in
<br />
<br />Under licences and subscriptions, find you Office licence and you can re-install that from there
<br />
<br />If you do not see your licence listed there, what version of Office did you have before it disappeared?

<p>
</p><p>Now I downloaded again and reinstalled and he ask for Product key and after that I was able to download it and install. unfortunately he told that still cannot activate it because in my acount is no any Key. However, in the Word or Excel if I open its written
 that is activated.</p>

    <title>Lock Screen Refreshing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kjerafk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lock Screen Refreshing</h2>
                    So when I have the screen saver set to (None), On resume, display logon screen enabled, and the wait time set to lets say 1 minute, the screen saver behaves as expected. After 1 minute of inactivity, the screen goes blank, then to the lock screen which
 is the time, date and a background image. The issue is that every minute after that, the screen saver re-initiates and starts the process over again meaning, every minute, the lock screen goes to the Login screen, but with a loading wheel, screen goes blank,
 then shows the lock screen again. The screen saver should check to see if the screen is already locked before initiating. There isn't a security issue but its irritating when i'm working next to my machine or reading a book, I see the screen changing every
 minute or so.&nbsp;

            I'll +1 this issue - we are having it as well. When the PC locks from a timeout, if it sits for more htan a moment or so we cannot get a login prompt to load; We wake the PC and all we get is the spinning dots, but no login prompt.

<p>I logged onto my Xbox 360 the other morning to find a message requiring me to download a system update or I wouldn't be able to use Xbox Live.&nbsp; I attempted to do so only to get the following Error Code: 42FE-0000-3000-0906-8007-0070.</p>

<p>I went through all the forums I could find.&nbsp; I followed every set of instructions I could find.&nbsp; I have tried installing via CD as well as USB with the download I got from the Microsoft update link on the support page (different downloads, with different
 internet connections.)&nbsp; It still won't install, and I keep getting the same error code.&nbsp; I even formatted both my hdd and my system memory as well as deleted the cache on both.&nbsp; Still the same message.&nbsp; The closest I can find on the code on your site is XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-8007-000F/0185,
 but that states that the system can not find a HDD connected, and when I check storage, the HDD is there plain as day.</p>

<p>Please Help. The system was working perfectly fine until this recent update.</p>

<p>Hey n0nserv1am!</p>
<p>Let's try the following:<br />
•On your console's dashboard, head over to the "Settings" section and select "System"<br />
•Select "Storage"<br />
•Press the following buttons one-at-a-time: LB, RB, X, LB, RB, X<br />
•Confirm "Yes" in the next window<br />
•Clear your system's cache at least 3 times just to be safe</p>
<p>Once that is done, turn off your console and <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/system/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
remove your hard drive</a>&nbsp;and all other storage devices (USB flash drives / memory units).</p>
<p>Now, reattach your hard drive, reboot your console, and attempt the online update again.</p>
<p>If you get the same error code, turn off your console, remove your hard drive again, attach your USB flash drive this time, and attempt the online update again. If possible, use a different USB flash drive than the one you attempted the update with. If you
 don't have another available, move the update files from the USB drive to a folder on your computer while you do this step. If this step fails, connect the drive with the update (or move the files back) and attempt an offline update again (with the hard drive
 still removed).<br />
<em><br />
</em></p>
<p><em><br />
</em>Hopefully that will work! Make sure you note any error codes you receive during this process.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live Ban - Again Destiny Related I Presume</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm sure no one from Microsoft will read this or explain anything, as this is the third time I've incurred a ban, it is safe to say I'm now here to speak up. Someone will say that it is my fault or that I'm offensive. Some will say "Support doesn't handle this, only the Xbox Enforcement does", and yet they are always A) Unreachable and B) Provide no details or evidence as to why someone is banned, even when you submit a rebuttable which is a measly 200-250 characters, something of that sorts. Both times their attempt at a response is a copy paste of "go read our rules":</p><p><br /></p><p> </p><p>"After reviewing your inquiry, we have found the enforcement to be <br />warranted.

The NEXT DAY I was banned. The reason? "suspension for harassment of other Xbox Live users, including the abusive use of profanity and homophobic slurs" We simply removed him and moved on. It was all via Headphone so does Xbl have any proof beside this kids report? No of course not. I have a room full of witnesses, does that matter? Nope. Go ahead Xbl go scan through my messages to that date or the days prior, nothing from me was sent beside a party invite. Check the Raid logs as to how long we kept that kid trying to help him out. Obviously I'm an abusive person.<br /><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Here 

<p> End date:&nbsp;&nbsp;July 27, 2018, 2:18:09 PM</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Yesterday I played Two Strikes with people not running the burns, inactive, and quitting at the end of the strike. Each was reported as appropriately as Destiny allows - I had to go with Other for a few things. I asked in a frustrated manner why people weren't using Solar weapons on Solar burn, as it would get us through this faster, via voice coms with no response.&nbsp;Now I'm sitting on a ban because what? I should have quit out of the strike if I didn't like how they were playing? Then I would get reported for quitting. I should have said nothing instead of make them aware we could be doing this better? What it comes down to is how much Enforcement babies Destiny and how toxic that community is. Is the answer anything I see something I don't like that I have to quit or leave? Literally I'd get nothing done, my time has a value too and the people inactive are disrespecting that. I actually stopped playing Trials due to how awful people w

<h3> neilcampbell taylor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 64bit&#58; SFC tells me I need an uncorrupted version of CoreMessaging.dll. Where&#63; How&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I booted up my PC today and found that the app tiles section of the Start Menu had vanished. I just have the folders listed now. Looking into things, I found:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/app-tiles-disappeared-from-windows-10-start-menu/5d8abf5b-f73b-45f1-9d80-b988cd6da49a</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the method 2 steps and was unable to repair the files. That article then directed me to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</p>
<p>
</p><p>And examining the output of the CBS.log I have several corrupt files that cannot be automatically replaced with their copies as there is a hash mismatch or the manifest is damaged. So the suggested route is to manually replace the files from "a good uncorrupted
 copy"... from another PC running the same version of Windows. Which I don't have. Where do I download the following files (amongst others) from?</p>
<p>
"CoreMessaging.dll' of Microsoft-OneCore-CoreMessaging, version 10.0.14393.206, arch amd64, nonSxS, pkt {l:8 b:31bf3856ad364e35} in the store, hash mismatch<br />
'SetupCleanupTask.dll' of Microsoft-Windows-Setup-Cleanup-Task, version 10.0.14393.0, arch amd64, nonSxS, pkt {l:8 b:31bf3856ad364e35} in the store, hash mismatch<br />
'System.Windows.Forms.dll' of System.Windows.Forms, version 4.0.14305.0, arch msil, versionScope neutral, pkt {l:8 b:b77a5c561934e089} in the store, hash mismatch<br />
'CoreUIComponents.dll' of Microsoft-Windows-CoreUiComponents, version 10.0.14393.206, arch Host= amd64 Guest= x86, nonSxS, pkt {l:8 b:31bf3856ad364e35} in the store, hash mismatch<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>I strongly suspect that the fastest route will be for me to "simply" reinstall Windows 10.</p>

            Okay. I bought a new SSD and reinstalled (turning the inconvenience into an upgrade). Took about 9 hours but at least I have a working Windows 10 again. Upon investigating further there was a repeatedly failing Windows Update since back in October. I've
 seen this before: once windows update gets confused there is no hope. Seems like every 6 months I'm reinstalling this OS. But problem solved.

                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently reinstalled Windows 10 Home (Version 1511, OS Build 10586.494) after having some issues with the insider version. After a clean install, I tried to recover my files that I backed up using File History. I turned on File History once again and tried
 using the feature "Restore your files with File History" straight by typing it into the Start menu. When I try to launch the application, it barely pops up and another windows pops up saying "File History has stopped working" and closes the program. I went
 ahead into my machine's event logs and this is all the information I managed to gather on the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Faulting application name: FileHistory.exe, version: 10.0.10586.0, time stamp: 0x5632cf47<br />
Faulting module name: fhshl.dll, version: 10.0.10586.0, time stamp: 0x5632d7aa<br />

Faulting application path: C:\Windows\system32\FileHistory.exe<br />
Faulting module path: C:\Windows\system32\fhshl.dll<br />
Report Id: c791109b-9e6f-46dc-9ece-ec6f0e3342fc<br />
Faulting package full name: </p>
<p>Faulting package-relative application ID: </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried running the System File Checker, but it runs without finding any integrity violations. At this point I'm out of ideas. I've tried plugging in my drive at different ports too. I need to restore my files on my computer but the application that
 is supposed to do that for me is not working. </p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> stevenshapiro  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you stop Windows 8 from deleting the thumbnail cache at every restart&#63;</h2>
                    Every time I shutdown on my Windows 8 laptop, the system deletes my thumbnail cache. &nbsp;I have a very large folder with videos and pictures that I like to browse via thumbnail image, and having to rebuild the images each time I restart is time consuming
 and annoying. &nbsp;This problem never&nbsp;occurred on my old Vista laptop and is&nbsp;counter-intuitive to the entire point of having a cache at all. &nbsp;Further, I have not changed any system or folder settings, nor have I been using any programs or features that erase the
 cache such as CCleaner or Disk Cleanup. &nbsp;Any help would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Karthik, thank you for your efforts, but the proposed fix did not resolve my problem. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>First, I do not have any system optimization programs running and my computer is new Dell 15R laptop with standard Windows 8 which I have not yet tweaked or optimized in any way. &nbsp;I have also not used any programs that would delete the thumbnails such
 as Disk Cleanup or CCleaner.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I believe that rebuilding my thumbnail cache is the problem, not the solution. &nbsp;I want to computer to maintain the thumbnail cache after shutdown. &nbsp;On my old Vista laptop, the thumbnail cache was maintained and I never needed to rebuild all my thumbnails
 each time I viewed my folders containing hundreds of video and picture files. &nbsp;It is normal for Windows 8 to purge or delete the thumbnail cache upon shutdown and then rebuild the thumbnail images as may be necessary upon restart then viewing a particular
 folder?</div>

            I'm a digital scrapbooker and have many GBs of picture files. I was having the same problems with my system rebuilding the thumbnail cache. Upon doing a quick search at my favorite tip site, Addictive Tips, I found this article very helpful&nbsp;<a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/prevent-windows-8-file-explorer-from-deleting-images-thumbnail-cache/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/prevent-windows-8-file-explorer-from-deleting-images-thumbnail-cache/</a>

</p><p>Recently i can not update anymore and i get the following error:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>The internet connection is working and the windows update service is running so that is not the issue.

<p>
</p><p>At the moment i have Windows 10 Version 1803 (OS Build 17134.228)</p>

<br />Please run Windows Updates troubleshooter from Settings app &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot. See if it works. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, try this:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc

<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then.

<p>I found a User Guide for your computer but I cannot see where it covers restoring your system to Factory Settings, which may be&nbsp;what you need to do.
<br />
<a href="http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/support/jsp/modelContent.jsp?ct=SB&amp;os=&amp;category=&amp;moid=3025145&amp;rpn=PSK0YU&amp;modelFilter=&amp;selCategory=2756709&amp;selFamily=1073768663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/support/jsp/modelContent.jsp?ct=SB&amp;os=&amp;category=&amp;moid=3025145&amp;rpn=PSK0YU&amp;modelFilter=&amp;selCategory=2756709&amp;selFamily=1073768663</a></p>
<p>Remember that restoring to factory settings removes all data files and user installed programmes so you need to have backed up data files to external media before attempting the task.</p>

<p>If you are using WPA2-AES then I wonder why the Xbox is complaining about a WEP password.
<br />
<br />
Can you (just for testing purposes) disable the WLAN encryption temporarily and try to connect your console? Also make sure you change the SSID to something personal (maybe the Router was set up by AT&amp;T with a default name, that is the same for everyone, and
 a neighbour set up a WLAN with the same SSID?)<br />
<br />
If the console is able to connect without encryption to your WLAN, set up WPA2 encryption again. When choosing a password, make sure you use characters from the standard ASCII range, meaning you should avoid overly special characters like Umlauts or accented
 characters, as these can lead to problems. Try a "simpler" passphrase first with only upper and lowercase letters from the standard alphabet and numbers. Then (if desired, but also recommended) make the password more complex by using special characters like
 punctuation or symbols like #%! etc... See if the Xbox is still able to connect.

    <title>What justifies the &#39;Important&#39; rating for the Windows8 Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> falling rock  say:</h3>
<h2>            What justifies the &#39;Important&#39; rating for the Windows8 Update item, KB3032613&#63;  Why would I need this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The subject patch is identified in Windows Update as, &nbsp;"Update for Windows 8 for x64-based Systems (KB3032613)."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update is not labeled a Security update.&nbsp; In my experience with Windows updates, those&nbsp;identified by the Windows Update Agent, the items rated as
<strong>Important </strong>have been titled as, "Security Update for Windows ..." or for IE, or for .NET Framework, or for (etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;Those updates not titled a Security Update have been rated Optional, sometimes as Recommended, but not as, &nbsp;Important.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just
 HOW important is this item, KB3032613? </p>
<p>
</p><p>The "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">More information</span>"&nbsp;hyperlink in Windows Update delivered my browser to URL:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3032613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3032613</a>.&nbsp; Included in the information there,&nbsp;is a caution that another patch, KB2917499, is a Prerequisite that
<strong>must</strong> be installed prior to installing the subject patch. Surprise!&nbsp; This was not made known in Windows Update.
<strong>All updates requiring Prerequisites should be so indicated in the Windows Update description,</strong> so that we will know that we must take time and trouble to go and read about Prereqs before clicking the
<em>Install now</em> softbutton. And, <strong>when Windows Update scans our system and finds that a prerequisite was not Installed, Windows Update should add the prereq to its list of Updates and sequence the updates accordingly.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That KB2917499 patch has never been installed in my Windows 8 (x64) system, and in fact, Windows update has never identified that KB2917499 as a candidate for updating my Windows 8, and my laptop has been in service since 11/23/2013.&nbsp;KB2917499 has never
 been proposed for downloading and installation, and it is not found in the "Installed Updates" list window, where there are more than 185 items now listed. It is also notable that the subject KB3032613 article lists two other Prerequisites to installing the
 subject patch, and both of those <em>are</em> found in "Installed Updates."&nbsp; But, not KB2917499.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Article KB3032613&nbsp;is titled, <strong>"Text in Polish, Bulgarian, or Greek does not display completely on the Windows Store installation page in Windows."</strong></p>
<p>Now, how important is THAT?&nbsp; Why would I care? I am fluent in English, and I do not expect to require anything from the Windows Store in any of those excellent languages. I appreciate the importance of those languages. I have had friends from Bulgaria, and
 have known admirable persons of Polish and Greek heritage. However, the Windows Store&nbsp; - -&nbsp; for anything I might require from the Windows Store, surely there will be an English version of its installation page. Hm?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that with every patch&nbsp;installed&nbsp;from Windows Update, history shows that there is&nbsp;some degree of risk that&nbsp;my OEM Windows 8 might become corrupted, and THIS patch seems to require Prerequisite patch to be installed beforehand that has never been identified
 by Windows Update Agent as even an Optional. Not inspiring confidence in these two.&nbsp; Will withhold installing until the&nbsp;questions can be satisfactorily answered and explained&nbsp;(to me, not just more Virtual help). Here's hoping this will be received as helpful
 to Microsoft and your other cautious customers, for I have now given several hours over multiple days &nbsp;to puzzling out the relationships described and to clearly stating the issues for your edification. &nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for "listening."

            <p>Cmdr Keene,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying, but this reply falls short, I think, on two counts. 1) still no justification for rating this minor language fix KB3032613 as Important, and 2), no recognition that KB3032613 cannot be installed because one of the Prerequisites for KB3032613
 is not available. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To repeat what i said in my first posting&nbsp; - -&nbsp; the article KB3032613 specifies that KB2917499 MUST be installed.&nbsp; Windows Update has never installed, nor offered to install,&nbsp; KB2917499 to my Windows 8 (x64) PC. And there is no evidence in Windows that KB2917499
 is/was installed, no evidence either in Update History or in Installed Updates, neither a Succeeded nor a Failed item. Without all the Prerequisites, I am reluctant to chance trying to install a probable failure.&nbsp; Can you offer any explanation?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I as well as you always thought that Windows Update engine was "smart enough to check first" but, maybe not, this time. There are now 186 items of updates recorded in Installed Updates.&nbsp; Maybe, Windows Update engine is just overloaded?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the authoritative statement in KB3032613 that KB2917499 is a Prerequisite that must be installed first, and yet it is not installed first, why was Windows Update engine not "smart" enough to include KB2917499 in the group of Important updates pushed
 out with the subject item on March 11. 2015, to support installing KB3032613? </p>
<p>
</p><p>For another example - More recently, about a week ago, Windows Update began offering me two more&nbsp; Important updates, namely, KB2976978 and KB3008273. Also, Optionals KB2876229 and&nbsp; KB3048778.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Among those, interestingly, <strong>Update for Windows 8 for x64-based Systems (KB2976978)</strong> is found in Installed Updates with Date = 12/14/2014, and the same is found in
<em>Control Pane\System and Security\Windows update\View update history</em> with Status = Succeeded, Importance = Recommended,&nbsp; and the same date.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, <strong>Update for Windows 8 for x64-based Systems (KB3008273)</strong> is found on my PC, in the window titled
<em>Installed Updates</em>, with Date = 2/16/2015; and the same is found in <em>Control Pane\System and Security\Windows update\</em>
<em>View update history</em> with Status = Succeeded, Importance = Recommended,&nbsp; and the same date.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, just how smart IS Windows Update engine?&nbsp; Or, is there a good, sound reason why these same packages, as it would seem, are being pushed for double-installation? If so, please lay out your&nbsp; reasoning, and its supporting statements from Microsoft Support
 documentation, confirming the safety and necessity of running these packages again. WUA informs me that they are already downloaded again. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, how safe is it, to run the same update again after it has already been installed once? Why would I want to run the risk of crashing my computer with a thing that I already have, therefore, don't need?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I look forward to your full and complete response. </p>

<em>without</em> quoting this post: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Did the computer come with Win8 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win8, or did you upgrade a (e.g., Win7) computer to Win8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your currently-installed <em>third-party</em> anti-virus application or security suite&nbsp;(i.e.,
<em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>), if any, and <em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. What third-party anti-malware applications (i.e., <em>not</em> <em><strong>Windows Defender</strong>!</em>) are installed, if any? &nbsp;What third-party firewall, if any?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer<em>&nbsp;since you bought it?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer
<em>when you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>6a. Is KB3032359, KB3030377, KB3032323, KB3035131, KB3034344, KB3035126, KB3035132, KB3039066, KB3033889, KB3046049, and/or KB3025417&nbsp;listed in
<strong>Installed Updates </strong><em>(not <strong>Update History</strong></em>)<em>?</em> [1]
</p>
<p>
</p><p>6b. How about <em>KB3000853</em>, KB3008273, KB2973544, KB2917499 and/or KB2871389?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6c. Has Windows 8.1 ever been offered to your computer via the Windows Store?</p>
<ul>
<li>IMPORTANT! =&gt; Support for Windows 8 ends on 12 January 2016. Whether you like it or not, no further updates will be offered to your computer unless &amp; until Windows 8.1 has been installed. Microsoft really,
<em>really </em>wants you to get Win8.1 installed ASAP, hence the <strong>Important
</strong>(yet optional) updates. <em><br />
<br />
</em></li><li><strong>Important </strong>(AKA Recommended) updates (e.g., KB3000853, KB3008273, KB2973544, KB2917499&nbsp;&amp; KB2871389)&nbsp;are not necessarily security-related.
<strong>Important </strong>updates include performance updates,&nbsp;optional software updates/upgrades, as well as driver updates for third-party hardware. Left to its own devices (i.e., set to
<strong>Automatic</strong>), <strong>Automatic Updates</strong> will (attempt to) install all
<strong>Important </strong>updates - whether you or your computer need/want them or not.
</li></ul>
<p>7a. What Update Version &amp; KB number are displayed in the <em>second line of text</em> in IE10's Help | About [<strong>Alt+H+A</strong>] tab; e.g.,
<strong>Update Version: 10.0.54 (KB1231231)</strong> ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>7b. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?<br />
<br />
8. Is Adobe Flash Player <strong>v17.0.0.134 </strong>installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>9. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; PC Doctor;
 TuneUp Utilities; WinMaximizer; WinSweeper; Comodo System Cleaner; Advanced System Optimizer; CCleaner's

            <p>&nbsp;PA Bear,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is very good of you, to take an interest in my problem and to pose questions with such high-quality specificity.&nbsp; I have been gathering the information you called for. I hope that this will give you most of what you need, and will stand by for any further
 requests from you. <br />
<br />
F.Y.I.&nbsp; - -&nbsp; Here's an anomaly that might (or might not) be significant for your consideration of these issues.&nbsp; When User Access Control (UAC) halts my installing Windows Update downloads and requires Admin User to authenticate the installer, the Security
 Certificate that it always references always shows date "Valid to: 7/9/2013."&nbsp; This Security Cert. has not been updated or renewed for Windows Update by Microsoft® since 4 and 1/2 months prior to the purchase date when the system was delivered.&nbsp; Does this
 indicate that there may be a vulnerability to hacking, cracking, or malware in any actions (that the admin user MUST confirm) based upon this expired Cert.? ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a.&nbsp;&nbsp; Purchased 11/21/2013.&nbsp;&nbsp; Opened the OEM sealed box and registered/activated&nbsp; Windows 8 online the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
1b.&nbsp; OEM Win 8 (x64), H-P Pavilion g7 Notebook, REFRESHED from D:\ RECOVERY partition on May 2 or 3, 2014. &nbsp; (Then had to re-install about 126 updates from Windows Update. Bummer.)<br />
F.Y.I. -&nbsp; The following hardware is original eqpt., HDD = nominally 700 GB, System on C:\ = 672GB total, 80GB used;&nbsp; RECOVERY on D:\ = 25.6 GB, 22.9 GB used; CPU = Intel® CORE™ i3,&nbsp; RAM = 6 GB DDR3; not equipped with touch-screen. Start Menu 8 by IObit (3rd-party)
 was installed to obtain desktop with adequate usability; now v1.5.0.150.&nbsp; &nbsp; Ref. www.iobit.com/iobitstartmenu8.&nbsp; Note - Silverlight&nbsp; has never been installed; will probably accept it and its updates AFTER getting 8.1 to working.
<br />
<br />
2. Anti-virus = AVG Internet Security 2015, version 2015.0.5863, license paid to ~May 27, 2015.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Anti-malware = same, AVG IS 2015. Includes AVG Firewall (activated).&nbsp; <br />
F.Y.I. -&nbsp; Windows Advanced Firewall and Windows Defender are installed and de-activated.&nbsp; AVG Scanner is reporting no Threats the last few months, but about 1000 Notifications of items not scanned, mainly Locked folders and files, a few Macros, a few Password-protected.&nbsp;
 The only threats AVG has found and has removed since the Refresh have been Tracking Cookies, found not in the Macromedia directory where LSOs are usually found, but in a Cookies subdirectory deep under C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\AppData. Can find and report this
 path in full, if needed. .&nbsp;&nbsp; MalwareBytes was used in 2014 for a month or so. Microsoft Safety Scanner v1.0.3001.0 was downloaded and run on 3/25/2015, and it reported zero threats found on its completed scan.&nbsp;&nbsp; EMET (Enhanced Mitigation Experience Tool) v4.1.1
 was downloaded and installed months ago and has appeared in the Notification Area from time to time, but is not there in the last few days.&nbsp; The recommended settings for maximum security have been applied, some few months ago.&nbsp; Opening EMET tonight, I can
 see that four (4) processes named as Wordpad are the only PIDs marked, and indeed, I do have four Wordpad docs open. I don't know if these are indicating an issue exists or not.<br />
<br />
4 &amp; 5.&nbsp; Yes,&nbsp; Norton Internet Security, version 21.1.0.18, was pre-loaded by OEM and was used during its free trial period (the first few months), then Uninstalled and replaced by&nbsp; AVG Free Trial, then I moved the license from an older PC and downloaded &amp; installed
 the AVG program. That license was paid (2 yrs) and expires about the end of this coming May. . In March or April 2014, Windows 8, Wordpad, Ie and Firefox,&nbsp; and AVG became squirrely.&nbsp; When AVG could not connect to its remote updating server(s), and after a
 few days, suddenly vanished from the Notification Area, and could not be induced to run by any means at hand, nor in Safe mode; also, both browsers were unable to connect with AVG.com and a RTF document I had created and had been editing daily became unreadable
 suddenly, so,&nbsp; I surmised that I needed to perform a Refresh of the PC, and did that in early May 2014.&nbsp; Since then, Norton was uninstalled again, and nothing of Norton, Symantec, or McAfee is shown in the list in Control Panel\Programs\Programs &amp; Features.<br />
McAfee:&nbsp; never downloaded, never installed.<br />
<br />
6a.&nbsp; Yes, the window located at <em>Control Panel\Programs\Programs &amp; Features\Installed Updates</em> includes all eleven (11) of those you listed, all were installed on 3/12/2015.<br />
<br />
6b.&nbsp; Yes, for four (4) of these five, and No, for one (1). KB2917499 has never been offered me by my Windows Update. The absence of this update was confirmed by typing KB2917499 into the Search bar in the
<em>Installed Updates</em> window. The presence of the items present was determined by the same action, typing the KB of each into the same search bar.
<br />
<br />
6c.&nbsp; Am not sure, as to Windows Store.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hardly ever have looked into Windows Store and simply cannot say for sure, whether Windows Store has ever offered this. Maybe, maybe not.<br />
F.Y.I. - Here is what I do know, about the Windows 8.1 upgrade's availability.&nbsp; Windows 8.1 has been offered when the Desktop first comes up at login, at least once or twice each week for several months.&nbsp; The offer has been presented in the form of a bright
 blue band containing the offering words in white, laid across the full width (horizontally) of my monitor.&nbsp; I have always clkd the 'Remind me later' softbutton, because I was waiting for Windows 8.1 to become more stable. And several weeks ago, decided to
 go ahead with it, when I would have time to study the process guidelines and make prudent preparation and backup;&nbsp; then these recent issues with Windows Update raised a caution flag.&nbsp; The available guidance has urged that all Important-rated updates available
 should be installed prior to beginning the Upgrade. Now that Windows Update is presenting me with an item that cannot be installed and others already, previously installed, I am in a few quandaries.<br />
<br />
7a.&nbsp; IE 10 shows "Update Version: 10.0.25 (KB3032359)."<br />
<br />
7b.&nbsp; Yes, Firefox v37.0.1; I think that it was v36.0.4 and then v37.0, when the conundrum of KB3032613 vs. KB2917499 was first observed.&nbsp; Opera is installed in my Standard User (pwd-protected user) but rarely used, and is not enabled in the admin user, and
 Opera is not listed in Programs and Features, at least, not in this admin user.<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp; AFP version is confirmed installed when tested in both IE 10 as follows, "You have version 17,0,0,134 installed" and, F.Y.I., in Firefox Plugins as well.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp; AVG PC TuneUp (license paid to May 27, 2015) is installed and has been used sparingly, once or twice since the refresh. No others.<br />
<br />
<br />
Am hoping your expertise can resolve these issues without forcing a wipe and reload.<br />

<p>1. Had the preinstalled Norton Internet Security free-trial period already expired by the time you replaced it with AVG Free?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Did you (a) uninstall the Norton&nbsp;application AND THEN (b) download/run the Norton Removal Tool &amp; reboot (c) BEFORE you installed AVG Free?</p>
<ul>
<li>Fact: Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here.</li></ul>
<p>3. In Windows Explorer [<strong>WinKey+E</strong>], navigate to &amp; right-click on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>C:\Program Files\</strong><em><strong>AVG</strong> &lt;=this folder</em>
</li></ul>
<p>Select PROPERTIES: What's the CREATED date displayed on the resulting GENERAL tab?<br />
<br />
4. Do you have backups of ALL the changes AVG PC TuneUp has EVER made to the computer?</p>
<ul>
<li>Injudicious use of registry cleaners may be playing a role here too.<br />
<br />
</li><li>TIP: If you ever again think your Registry needs to be cleaned, repaired, boosted, tuned-up, cured, tweaked, fixed, maximized, "swept" or optimised (it doesn't),

            <p>&nbsp;Thanks again for offering help. Here goes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Yes, but remember, this was prior to the Refresh from the D:\RECOVERY partition. Will try to remember...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; I think so. Sequence not really&nbsp; clear in my tired, foggy mind tonight. Need to research my notes tomorrow,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; No AVG folder exists&nbsp; in&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>C:\Program Files.</strong>&nbsp; AVG always installed in
<strong>C:\Program Files (x86).</strong> &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Properties sheet General tab on <strong>C:\Program Files (x86)\ AVG</strong> showed "<strong>M</strong><strong>onday, ‎October ‎13, ‎2014, ‏‎4:29:00 PM</strong>". I'm not sure why that date, I was expecting to see the refresh date approx., in May 2014.
 Will check tomorrow on this.&nbsp; There was some funny stuff happening over that Summer 2014, started around June 22, 2014, and extended into Sept. or October.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Will describe tomorrow Tues., it's ~3:20 AM CDT , Monday night right now and I am bushed. Will hit the sack and hope to get a good start tomorrow ..
</p>
<p>Maybe can do it on this laptop while at the auto shop (tires, shock and struts, oill and filter change, transmission flushing, and EGR valve among the items needed on my buggy of about 170K mi.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Don't recall having deleted any AVG logs since the Refresh, will need to research, don't really know exactly where to look for PC TuneUp's logs but can probably find a route to them .&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, and let me get myself some rest, catch you later. </p>

            <p>Thanks for the questions.&nbsp; I have to report an 'OOPS!' on my part - I found a note that I did take an Adobe Flash Player update v14.0.0.125 replacing v13.0.0.214, and that I did let the McAfee be included at some point. I think I did not have McAfee to remove
 anything, but as my notes from those months are blocked from view, I cannot be sure.&nbsp; Maybe, you might be equipped to clear up the problem that I found intractable.&nbsp; Maybe I could&nbsp; upload the file to you for your analysis. Your call.&nbsp; It's 8 to 10 MB filesize.
 OK, back to your questions: <br />

</p>
<p>I hope that the top line of the datablock above can resolve the question satisfactorily&nbsp; It is the best clue I have, so I am inclined to accept that Refresh was correct. As a serial user, can not be sure that a Reset would have described its results as "resetting"
 and not as "refreshing."&nbsp; Have never experienced a reset.&nbsp; You would no doubt have more info on Reset vs. Refresh.&nbsp; Pls explain the diff., "in words of one syllable."&nbsp; :-)<br />
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Maybe possible. I will make inquiry of AVG Support as to what was date the 2015 was released, if you need that, but some&nbsp; "interesting times" (in the Chinese sense) happened that prevents my accessing my notes for a long period including that date.&nbsp;
 Complicated to describe, will explain later. My notes available now do mention AVG IS 2014 did update its definitions on June 20, and things went haywire a day or so later. The notes returned on October 23 referred to the 2015 AVG as being the version in place
 at that time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; 1st,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Why - because there was a seriously squirrely thing going on in Summer 2014 that started after the Refresh and AVG was not finding any real threats or anything to explain it and was reporting hundreds of files not scanned, every day.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>2nd,&nbsp;&nbsp; When? - Am not sure, but I have a note that I downloaded <strong>MWB (Free trial edition)</strong> on May 12, 2014,&nbsp; (maybe it was after Midnight that night, so might have shown Tues., May 13 as its date but didn't install it immediately). Note says
 I disabled AVG in order to install MWB late Wed. night; MWB updated itself online immediately, .and then I started MWB scan; but AVG re-enabled itself. Disabled AVG again, for longer, but ran out of gas and left it scanning about 5 AM on the 15th.&nbsp; Next day,
 found it had completed and had reported no threats.&nbsp; Strengthened some settings and ran another full scan, that finished 19 minutes later and reported no threats found. Cannot say that MWB ever removed anything.&nbsp; MWB began pushing its 5-day warning on the
 24th or 25th, so maybe it was only a 2-wk trial license. Didn't promptly uninstall it after the trial expired. Lost all notes for May 26, 27, &amp; 28 unexpectedly and still unexplainedly, on the 30th when something, after I had logged into Microsoft.com, closed
 that&nbsp; login and made my Microsoft password, that I had logged in with manually time after time and knew quite well, to fail to be recognized for login.&nbsp; At the same time, AVG closed (or was closed)&nbsp; out of the Notification Area.&nbsp; I went back to microsoft.com
 and worked the Forgot your password? loop and succeeded in getting back in after resetting pwd, but Malwarebytes was not&nbsp; used, at that time... &nbsp;&nbsp; I shut down Windows and left this machine for a week and used my Mac exclusively until Patch Tuesday, June 10th.&nbsp;
 Tried to get into Safe Mode, for troubleshooting, but was defeated. It was then that it became clear that the F8 start into Safe Mode didn't work. I don't know why, but Microsoft had been bragging for years about getting rid of the START button with Windows
 8.&nbsp; WHAT A CROCK!&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, it looks like you have to get logged into Windows 8 in normal mode, in order to change some settings and then restart Windows 8, before you can get into Safe Mode to run a command-line scan, and you are p the creek w/o a paddle if
 you cannot get into Windows 8 when you power up.&nbsp; Catch 23?&nbsp; I think so.&nbsp; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Found a note asserting that MWB updated itself on June 12th, to program v2.0.2.1012 and Vdb = v2014.06.12.10 &gt; this was followed by&nbsp; Malwarebytes notice: Your free trial has expired &gt;
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Yes, EMET v4.1.1 is still installed, and it is listed in Programs and Features.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other problems that developed during this time; and why I cannot say when MWB and McAfee were&nbsp; uninstalled, are described as follows.
</p>
<p>My daily Notes included this following group starting on 6/12/2015:&nbsp; <br />
... "McAfee Security Scan, downloaded with Adobe Flash Player v14.0.0.125 replacing v13.0.0.214, was OK'd to install and did &gt; OK'd it to update installed &gt; is run and upchucked because no anti-virus app was running first &gt; after enabling AVG again, McAfee

 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I then put that file and clones aside, and have continued to take notes daily in a separate, Wordpad, *.rtf file.&nbsp; All the notes from 6/23-10/21 are locked up and inaccessible, in the file of my older blog.rtf, but that file has become corrupted so that
 Wordpad and Notepad are DISABLED by opening that RTF fileor any clones. Scanning the file with AVG IS 2015 never found any threat.

<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2015/03/12/emet-5-2-is-available.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
EMET v5.2</a> (or higher) if you wish - but leave it uninstalled for now. Its presence is complicating matters and only serving to confuse you further IMHO.</p>

            <p>PA Bear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Thanks for confirming Refresh. I still don't know the difference from Reset.<br />
You posed a complicated question, needing research to develop the answer.&nbsp; This will take some research in those lost notes, I expect - info not available currently., because the day-by-day notes are inaccessible.&nbsp; That is, the notes for the Summer are in a
 RTF document file that cannot be accessed by Wordpad and Notepad.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Ditto, sorry.&nbsp;&nbsp; The file when opened by either app immediately puts the app to Not responding behavior and showing only a blank white text window. within which the cursor cannot be placedd and keystrokes will not show anything. &nbsp; Only way to get it closed
 is by use, often, repeated use of Task Manager.&nbsp; Am aghast that an RTF file could do that. to Wordpad.&nbsp; Don't have Microsoft® Office running, although there might be a 60-day free trial never used, and Word maybe could read and live with that file. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Would you recommend that we might open a new thread to seek help with recovering text access from the "bewitched" file, as this seems to me a significant issue that would gain benefit from separate status, although it certainly does feed back into this
 issue?]</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Research in the "lost" notes is needed to answer this...&nbsp; I have the file, but cannot read its data.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Will need to test Safe Mode, but it's grown too late now, ~2:50 AM.&nbsp; Wil ltry to get back to you on this tomorrow night.&nbsp; Your humble correspondent will be on travel tomorrow, Friday, and Sunday, and will try to pursue the researches and prepare answers
 offline as time permits. Am sure that you can well appreciate that these things can chew up big blocks of our time, and big blocks cannot always be had. Will respond if I can find time to develop answers, and find a wi-fi connection somewhere each night.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. It looks like IObit Start Menu 8 did sneakily cause installation of&nbsp; IObit's Uninstall Programs app. Also, just remembered, a Microsoft tech about a month ago, did some remote desktop stuff, and installed Revo Uninstaller and ran it - maybe it was a balky
 Adobe FP upgrade. Adobe FP upgrades are always trouble, IMHO. </p>
<p>
</p><p>On your Tip, I will set a Restore Point and then uninstall EMET via Programs and Features, then restart Windows 8, set another RP, and then shut down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please advise if you want me to do more, e.g., to run Revo U. or IObit uninstallers on EMET instead of
 P&amp;F, or to search for remnants and delete them manually. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Good night!</p>
