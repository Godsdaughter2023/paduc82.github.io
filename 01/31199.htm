<h2>            Joining Windows Insider Program removed file write permissions</h2>
                    <p>I didn't like the white title bars that came as standard with Windows 10 and while trying to find out how the change them I read that the Windows 10 insider preview build 10532 had this feature. So I joined the Windows Insider Program to get this build asap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As part of joining the program I had to sign in to my Microsoft account. When Windows 10 build 10532 was downloaded and installed and the PC rebooted, I could change the colour of title bars, but I couldn't save any files, and I could only open saved documents
 as "read only".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure this is something to do with signing in to my Microsoft account to access the Windows Insider Program. I don't recall al the steps, but it seems that Windows now doesn't recognise my previous user permissions. I know how to change the permissions
 on a folder or file using the context menu, and this is what I see when I do it:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/adf1f490-2684-4845-bcec-af60898ea32a" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the "Write" permission for "HomeUsers" is not ticked. I can change this and then write to the file or folder, but this is a bit tedious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't understand how to do is to give myself - which I assume means "HomeUsers" because there is only one login ID set up on this PC - global write permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, there is only one user on this PC, that's me. I have looked at my user account in settings and it is set as Administrator. That's the only account I can see. So I don't understand why this problem with permissions exists.
<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards - David</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Try taking ownership of the folder (and by "the" folder, I mean any one having an issue). If they are all in one folder, use that one. If it's all

<p><span>To take ownership:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Right-click the folder and go to Properties</span></li><li><span>In Properties, go to Security (tab) &gt; Advanced (button at the bottom) &gt; Owner (tab)</span></li><li><span>In the Owner tab, the current owner will be listed.

            <p>Hi Arun,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, I appreciate your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't need to take ownership of the folders or files before I could change the permissions to give HomeUsers write access, probably because I was logged in as Administrator. However, I could only see how to do this one folder or file at a time using the
 context menu. Because I have hundreds of folders, and thousands, of files this was not an acceptable solution.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also didn't get to the root of the problem, which is how/why my permissions changed after logging in with a Microsoft account rather than a Local account. I was concerned that this might have deeper reaching effects that hadn't come to light but would
 show in future. I wanted to solve the cause of the problem, not deal with the effects one folder and file at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should mention that I upgraded to Windows 10 directly from Windows 7. Windows 7 did not use Microsoft accounts so I had always logged in with a local account, both in Windows 7 and initially in Windows 10. But participation in the Windows Insider Program
 required me to log in with a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that this post&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/change-from-local-account-to-microsoft-account/9a15f6eb-5335-4a3c-8ec0-39a26bf5c42e" title="Change from local account to Microsoft account permission issues">Change
 from local account to Microsoft account permission issues</a> is helpful. I followed the steps outlined by Vardhaman S:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>"Try to reset Group Policy and check if it helps.</span></span> </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> +
<strong>X</strong> . (This means press the special Windows key and at the same time the letter "x")</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select "Command Prompt (Admin)"</span></p>
</li><li>

<strong>Enter</strong> key after each command:</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(50, 50, 50, 1)">: If your Windows is installed on other than C: drive then replace C:\ with drive on which Windows installed."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to have worked for me and now I can save and access files as before. I will monitor this over the next few days to make sure that the problem has been completely resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>**** Update:</strong> I was mistaken, the steps above have not resolved the problem, which remains exactly as I described above in the first post. I can edit the permissions on a file to give "HomeUsers" write access, but this has to be done one
 file at a time. I am still seeking the root cause of the problem and a global - or at least PC wide - solution to the problem.
<strong>****</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears my change from logging in to a local account to logging in to a Microsoft account had caused a problem with the "Group Policy", whatever that it is!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that the Group Policy is something to do with security, but as this is a one-user PC in my home/office and not on a network I have never looked into this aspect in detail. Why a change from logging in to a local account to logging in to a Microsoft
 account should cause it to lock me out of my own machine is rather a mystery - to me at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Windows still has some way to go to implement a security system that is both effective and easy for users to understand.<br />

            <p>I went into Setings-&gt;Accounts and used the option "Sign in with a local account instead" to sign out of my Microsoft account and sign in with the local account that I used to use with Windows 7, and with Windows 10 before deciding to join the Windows Insider
 Program. This has solved most but not all of the file write permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still rather mystified by this, so I am going to ask a separate question about local and Windows accounts.<br />

            <p>My separate question asked at&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/using-windows-account-instead-of-local-account/122d58ca-2db8-4841-a7f1-e6a0094fdcfc">Using Windows account instead of
 local account removed file write permissions</a> received an answer that seems to have resolved the problem. These are the steps I took:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Log in with Microsoft account.</span></li><li><span>Open the properties of the main user profile folder where the files are located (such as Documents, Pictures, etc.).
</span></li><li><span>Go to the Security tab and click Advanced. </span></li><li><span>Check the box at the bottom of this window. It is labeled "Replace all child object permissions with inheritable permissions from this object" and then click Ok.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li></ol>
<p>This didn't go entirely smoothly because after processing a number of folders and files I received an error message on a file "Failed to enumerate objects in the container. Access is denied." I tried pressing the "Continue" option and it did a few more files
 and then returned the same error, and then I pressed "Continue" again a few dozen times and the process eventually finished. I don't know why I should get the "Access is denied" message when I am signed in as Administrator. This is a very frustrating aspect
 of Windows security. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, it seems to have done the trick and I haven't had any problems since. What happened to the files that returned the error message I don't know, maybe I just haven't tried to work with any of them since.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your question you mention <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Photos</a>, still given that this is a discussion for Windows Photo Gallery I would address both applications, for everyone's benefit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily, Picasa 3 saves much of its metadata back to the file.&nbsp; Here is an <a href="https://www.organizepictures.com/2013/09/everything-you-need-to-know-about-picasa-metadata" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article on how Picasa stores its metadata</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last version of Picasa can store name tags to the file using a well accepted standard called
<a href="http://www.metadataworkinggroup.com/specs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MWG Regions</a>. MWG Regions is recognized by various photo management applications such as Adobe Elements Organizer. However, by default Picasa does not store Name tags to the file. You will need to enable this option by going to:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Tools</strong> -&gt; <strong>Options</strong> -&gt; <strong>Name Tags</strong>, and checking "<strong>Store Name Tags in Photos</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, you could use this tool to store <a href="http://www.anvo-it.de/wiki/avpicfacexmptagger:main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Picasa name tags to the photos as MWG Regions</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Saving the metadata back to the file is a good option if you plan to migrate to another photo management application which can read this information. Some examples are Adobe Lightroom, Photo Supreme, ACDSee, and Digikam among others.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Windows Photo Gallery (as of Jan 2017, no longer supported by Microsoft)</strong></span></p>
<p>Windows Photo Gallery can read the captions and keywords added in Picasa. Windows Photo Gallery uses a different standard than that of Picasa Name Tags for its
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee719905%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
People Tags</a>. If you wish to convert the Picasa Name tags to Windows Photo Gallery tags a way I have done it is by using the aforementioned tool to add the People's names as a subject keyword. Then in Windows Photo Gallery I convert it to a People Tag. However
 you will need to re-label the people's face regions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Microsoft Photos</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The short answer is <strong>no</strong>. To date, the current available version of Windows 10 Photos App
<em><strong>does not</strong></em> read captions, people tags nor keywords stored in the photo metadata. It does have a face detection and recognition which will group together similar faces. However, you cannot add names to the recognized faces. I do hope
 that this functionality is added in a future version. You can request this functionality by using the Windows 10 Feedback tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,<br />

The echo test runs perfectly, but when I dial a regular number, I get the beep beep (1 low, 1 high) for about half a minute and then the call stops trying to connect.&nbsp; I have got messages on the screen such as "missed call" and " missed call from cid - (-3668786674401237873)@outlook.com.&nbsp;
 I also sometimes get a message that my wireless signal is not strong enough, but I am 20 feet from the router and have full signal bars at 100mbps.&nbsp; &nbsp;Once in a while the call will go through while still beeping without ringing and the person will answer.&nbsp;
 Occasionally it will ring and go through like normal. For instance today I tried calling Japan and Ireland about 10 times each with no luck.&nbsp; I have Skype version 8.19.01 and calling version 2018.13.01.4.</p>
<p>What do I need to do to resolve this?</p>

Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. I understand that you are unable to install Gangster game on windows 7 computer.</p>
</span>&nbsp;
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>-Are you able to use the CD/ DVD drive to view or install any other applications on the system?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The game is too old to be supported for this operating system. I tried to search for its compatibility with Windows 7 and
 couldn't find anything.<br />

    <title>Can I move a taskbar icon into &#34;Show hidden icons&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flycaster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I move a taskbar icon into &#34;Show hidden icons&#34; section&#63;</h2>
                    I have several active program icons on my taskbar that are not being regularly used and would like to move them into the "show hidden icon" area. Is this possible? BTW, I've followed some instructions using the control panel, but they seem to deal with
 icons that are already in the systray. Also, I know that when the taskbar is full, I can move these "unwanted" icons into the second layer of the taskbar, but I would rather hide them

            I believe that it is not possible to do what you what unless the application was written to put an icon in the notification area.

<h2>            Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic &#40;Xbox 360&#41; download problems</h2>
                    <p>I purchased KoTOR on my 360 a few days ago through the Xbox store.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>When I go to download it, it downloads the whole game, but then a pop-up says "Unable to download game", and the corresponding file under the system menu says the file is&nbsp;corrupt. I've tried countless times and all the suggestions i can find here and online (clear cache etc), but it's still not working.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

<p>I'm wondering if it is a region thing: I'm in Australia (and have my account etc set up as Australia), and while the game does appear in the Xbox store on the console, maybe it just hasn't been released here yet??&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>



<p>I'm getting a bit annoyed, as you know, I paid money for it and am dying to play it again!!</p>

    <title>Vibration Xbox One Elite - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Vibration Xbox One Elite</h2>
                    <pre>Hello !

I train thoroughly on the new MotoGP. I had an Xbox 360 Burn controller (with two paddles in the back) but that ended up giving up a week ago. So I went on the Elite Xbox One, a joystick paddle also and very comfortable. That being the case, I have a problem, and a big problem!

He finds that the controller handles the vibrations quite differently than the Xbox 360 controller. The 360 vibrated as soon as the front tire slipped off.
The Elite is different: as soon as you brake a little on the angle, it vibrates (and not much). It is very destabilizing because we have no more sensation on the front of the shot and hard to know the limit ...

Do you have any solutions to that? Microsoft offers a small downloadable software for the controller on the Store but nothing solves my worries :(</pre><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Hello !</p>

<p>Je m'entraine à fond sur le nouveau MotoGP. J'avais une manette Xbox 360 Burn (avec deux palettes à l'arrière) mais qui a fini par rendre l'âme y'a une semaine. Je suis donc passé sur la Elite Xbox One, une manette à palette également et très confortable. Cela étant, j'ai un soucis, et un grand soucis même !</p>

<p>Il ce trouve que la manette gère les vibrations tout autrement que la manette Xbox 360. La 360 vibrait dès lors que le pneu avant déccrochait.<br />La Elite est différente : dès que vous freinez un peu sur l'angle, ça vibre (et pas beaucoup). C'est très déstabilisant car on a plus aucune sensation sur l'avant du coup et dur dur de connaître la limite...</p>

<p>Auriez-vous des solutions par rapport à ça ? Microsoft propose un petit soft téléchargeable pour la manette sur le Store mais rien ne règle mon soucis :(<br /></p>

<p>Hi REVABHOI,<br />

There could be a number of factors as to why you are getting an error when inserting a blank DVD on your computer. This could be caused by an outdated/incompatible device driver. Kindly verify the changes made to the computer prior to the issue.<br />

    <title>Suddenly Skype won&#39;t open - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cindyhurn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Suddenly Skype won&#39;t open</h2>
                    This morning my Skype worked as normal. This afternoon, when I turned it on, the white dots keep spinning in a circle on the plain blue background, and it never opens. The only thing that changed is that I did a regular cleanup with CCleaner, which I have
 done many times before, and that has never affected Skype. I have the latest update - 8.17 I think... so then I tried downloading the older version of skype to no avail. Please help!

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3d743515-6c50-4dcc-bdd4-3738c0d4de51" title="CindyHurn">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the version of your Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not possible to install the Skype version 8.17&nbsp;if you are running Windows 10 anniversary update and above.</p>
<p>The Classic Skype is currently in repair but will be available as soon as our dedicated team resolves the issue with the installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you uninstall Skype and download it directly from the Microsoft Store app as that is the default Skype app for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know I you need further assistance.</p>

<h2>            How do I restore the menu bar to my Windows Task Manager&#63;</h2>
                    This morning (1/27) while I was trying to unfreeze my computer due to an annoying program that Norton 360 uses, I somehow disabled/deleted not only my menu bar for my Windows Task Manager, but the icons that reduce, expand and close the screen for the
 Task Manager as well. The only way I can close it now is by right clicking on the icon when it appears on my task bar.

            It sounds like you are running Task Manager in tiny/small footprint mode.<br />
<br />
If you double click the empty space around the border of the Task Manager display it will switch back to regular mode and then you should see the tabs you are used to seeing.<br />
<br />

<h2>            How do I require password to be entered for profile switching&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp; I recently added a new account to our XBOX for our children to use.&nbsp; The intent is to not allow them access to the games with more mature themes/etc.&nbsp; When I sign them onto the xbox, they don't seem to have access to ANY of the games unless my profile
 is also signed in.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when my profile is signed in, they can switch to it without needing to enter a password, which really defeats the whole purpose.&nbsp; How do I require password entry when switching profiles to my profile that's already logged
 in?

<p>I am assuming you have a Parent Account and then Child Accounts for your kids.&nbsp; You can then adjust the content level of what you want them to play on the website and also restrict time of day and how long per day they can play.&nbsp; For example, I have my kids
 setup to Teen and below games and they cannot play before 8am in the morning or after their bedtime at night.&nbsp; This ensures that I am awake and know what is going on in the house.&nbsp; I have Mature games installed that I play when I sign in but they don't have
 access to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sign in to the Xbox, go to Settings --&gt; Account --&gt; Sign-in, security &amp; passkey.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set it up to "Ass for my passkey" for the Sign-in &amp; security preferences.&nbsp; Create a passkey, it is shorter than a password and just uses controller combinations for login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then make sure that "Instant sign-in" is set to Nobody.</p>
<p>Then make sure "This controller signs in" is set to Nobody.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These options should make it so the system opens up and someone will have to sign in to play games.&nbsp; The kids accounts you can set them so a password and passkey is not needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would also go into System --&gt; Signed-out content restrictions</p>
<p>Set "Access to content" as Restricted</p>
<p>Set "Let people download &amp; make new accounts" to unchecked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will limit what can be done without signing into with an account and will not let the kids "make a new account" and get around your parental controls.</p>

<p>The Xbox 360 was actually fairly state of the art in some instances at the time.... why do you think they were taking a lose on the hardware? &nbsp; The PS4 makes sense, it's probably a mid-tier machine but it is standardized so developers can get more out of

<p>Being underpowered compared to a PC doesn’t worry me as it’s a separate market. PC players will always point out that PS/XB will never beat a PC and I’m ok with that. I get a unit and it plays games for longer than a PC would without upgrades at a decent

<p>On PC, developers and gpu manufacturers improve graphics on games that have already been released. I can make Half Life 2 look better than any xbox360 game out right now. Half Life 2 was released over a year before xbox360.</p>

<p>Thats with hardware upgrades. Im talking that the same hardware tech will produce better games each year. Look at how the Mass Effect graphics changed over time? Same hardware and yet improved each time till they pretty much have tapped all they can out
 of it. &nbsp;On a PC they can tweak and tweak but more often than not its "to get this resolution you need to upgrade". &nbsp;I dont fault it and yes, PC will always beat out a console but to me the ease and lack of after initial hardware purchases are worth it.

<h2>            Can i install programs and games on other partition other than &#40;C&#58;&#41; drive&#63;</h2>
                    I wanted to know if i can install programs and games on G drive. Will that be a problem?Last time when my pc's hard drive got damaged, I was the one blamed for it because everyone would think installing games on other partition is the reason for hard drive
 damage. Before the damage whenever i turned my pc on i would get something like disk checking C drive. Now please tell me if i can install programs and games on other partition. And tell me that was i the one for whom the hard drive got damaged previously?
 Awaiting for your answer. By the way i want to install games on other partition because of empty space matters on c drive...

            <pre>Yes you can install applications on a drive other than C: (sometimes).
Exactly how you do that depends on the type of application.   For example many "traditional" applications, like Office 2010 and earlier allowed you to do a "custom" install to select a diffent drive.  Then MS "improved" Office 2013 and removed that option ... &lt;sigh&gt;

2017 03 06- HOW TO INSTALL APPS ON A SEPARATE DRIVE ON WINDOWS 10 – EXTERNAL DRIVE (TO FREE UP SPACE)
https://www.windowscentral.com/how-install-apps-separate-drive-windows-10 
By Mauro Huculak Monday, Mar 6, 2017 at 7:00 am EST 
When your PC has limited storage space, or you simply want to keep things separate, use this guide to install or move apps to a different drive on Windows 10.
&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;
For other apps, you can use "Symbolic Links" to move files and folders to other drives.  Here is my collection of articles on that subject (the first couple of links may be enough to get the idea across):
MOVE FOLDER TO ANOTHER LOCATION
2014 02 13- REDIRECT FOLDERS TO OTHER DRIVES IN WINDOWS
http://www.tomshardware.com/faq/id-2024314/redirect-folders-drives-windows.html 
This article describes the built in way to redirect folders to other locations, ie other drives.
2013 03 21- MOVE THE SNAGIT LIBRARY TO A SECOND HDD USING SYMLINKS
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/migrate-snagit-capture-library/ 
&lt;snip&gt; 
… by default the Snagit capture library is stored in your local AppData folder and there is no setting to change this. When you’re running a small SSD as your primary drive, you can see how this might be a problem. To work around Techsmith’s feature indiscretion, you can move the library to a second drive, and then use symbolic links to trick Snagit into thinking it’s still there in the original location 
&lt;/snip&gt;

JUNCTION VERSUS MKLINK
Please note that Junction is not supported over network shares. For that you can use the ‘mklink’ command, but only if it is available / supported in your version of Windows. Click here for an example using a network share with mklink via the command prompt; it works very similar to Junction but the command line switches (parameters) are not the same. Click here to read differences between mklink and junction. You can download Junction here.

Windows 10, 8, 7, and Vista all support symbolic links—also known as symlinks—that point to a file or folder on your system. You can create them using the Command Prompt or a third-party tool called Link Shell Extension.

365 ALTERNATE INSTALL LOCATION - SYMBOLIC LINKS
I have received independent confirmation that using symbolic links will successfully redirect Office 365 installations to an alternate location.

Office click to run products install to the win drive, you cannot do a custom install, its an all or nothing install
There is a method, if you are prepared to delve in. Modify the following steps according to your specific situation: 
I too was wanting to move my Office 365 install to a different drive. My main goal was to put it on a RamDisk to make it very quick to load.
I had created a RamDisk of 5GB, using http://www.radeonramdisk.com/software_downloads.php . The new drive was mounted as drive O:
•	Install Office 365 as normal, on the C drive.
•	Make a note of the two main Office directories:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15
C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office
•	Empty the Recycle bin before continuing.
•	Run Task Manager
•	Stop anything Microsoft Office related.
•	Delete both of the above directories
•	Open a CMD prompt, and run these commands:
MKLINK /J “C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15” “O:\Program Files\Microsoft Office 15”?
MKLINK /J “C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office” “O:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office”
•	This created junction points for each directory on the C drive that Office installs to, and point them to the O drive. So the OS thinks its going to C drive for those folders, but in reality its going to the O drive.
•	Go to the recycle bin and restore all the deleted files. The files then appeared on the O drive.
•	Save the RamDisk to an image file (so it gets loaded when windows starts)
•	Reboot
After reboot, when I open an office app, its so fast you can’t time it! 
You don’t have to do the ramdisk portion, its the junction’s that make it work.
I have 32GB of ram, and am only using about 5gb on average, so having a ramdisk makes sense for me.
RamDisks are about 8 to 10 times faster than SSD but are volatile memory, so it needs to be saved to disk if you don’t want to lose it.
&lt;/snip&gt;
HOW TO MOVE INSTALLED PROGRAMS TO ANOTHER DRIVE IN WINDOWS 7, 8, 10
Using Junction means that you will need to run it from an administrative command prompt. To do so, click Start and then type in “cmd” (no quotes), then wait for Command Prompt or CMD.EXE to appear in the list, then right click it and choose Run as Administrator.
As a working example: in the past I had to move the ‘..\appdata\Apple Computer’ folder for a user because it was taking up too much space on the C drive. I made an ‘AppData’ folder on the D drive using the command below; note that the ‘-s’ switch means to include all directories inside of the parent folder (otherwise known as directory recursion). The command was:
junction.exe -s “C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer” “D:\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer”
Note that I used quotes around the directory names - that is required if you have any spaces in folders or files. It’s a safe bet to use quotes around the source and destination folders, regardless. I suggest using the “-s” (recurse directories) for all your symbolic links, otherwise your programs may not work properly. If you wanted to remove the junction, then the command would be:
junction.exe -d “D:\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer”
SYMBOLIC LINKS TO REDIRECT CTR INSTALLATION?
You can use “Symbolic” links to tell the Office 365 installer to put the program files in a different location on the HD, or a different drive

HOW TO: MOVE INSTALLED PROGRAMS TO ANOTHER DRIVE IN WINDOWS 7, 8, 10 - JUNCTION

“ Dear Dennis,
Back in the days of Windows 95 and 98 there used to be a utility called Change of address (also known as ‘COA’ or ‘COA2’), which allowed you to move a program from one drive to another. For example, I could move an installed program from C: to D: drive, then Windows would run the program from the new location. Is there still such a utility available for Windows 7, 8 and 10? “
My response:
Change of Address was created by Ziff Davis and is downloadable through PC Magazine’s website. That said, the program was made in 2001 and I am not sure if you can still use it on newer operating systems such as Windows 7, 8 and 10.
There is however another program that is widely used today that works similar to Change of Address. It’s called “Junction” and it’s made by SysInternals - the same people that brought us Process Explorer, which is like Task Manager on steroids. There’s also ‘mklink’ by Microsoft, but some versions of Windows do not have it.
&lt;/snip&gt;
HOW SYMBOLIC LINKS, OR “SYMLINKS” WORK
Junction works by using a symbolic link or “symlink” - this is basically a placeholder with a redirection to another location. When you create a symbolic link to a file or folder, the file / folder will still appear as it normally does, but the system will automatically point to another location you previously specified. For example: you could create a symlink for C:\Documents relocate it to D:\Documents. Clicking on C:\Documents would actually take you to D:\Documents, and any program that referenced the old location would automatically and seamlessly link to the new location.
If you intend to move the entire C:\Program Files folder (for example), you should reboot into Windows Safe Mode first, as using Junction on an open program will either result in an ‘Access Denied’ error, or possible data corruption. Put another way, you cannot move around files and folders that are currently open; by booting into Safe Mode, you will effectively run Windows in ‘bare bones’ mode, which does not automatically launch programs that typically start when Windows boots into the desktop.

Standard boilerplate legalistic bafflegab disclaimer for any links to non-Microsoft websites:
The link(s) to non MS-page(s) appears to be providing accurate, safe information. I suggest you stick with the “manual” instructions. Unless I explicitly suggest it, avoid downloading their “utilities”.  Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it. Sometimes they include 3rd party programs, "unwanted" programs that are automatically installed during a standard install.  So, if offered, do a "custom" install and carefully read each step. One of the steps MAY give you an option to install, or NOT, "additional" programs.  99.9% of the time you don't want to let them be installed.  For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs. 
As well, watch out for ads on the site. They may advertise products that include PUPs. Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.

            I did read your question. You are making dual statements.
<br />One side you say your disk is failing,
<br />Other side you say C: is full.
<br />If we believe #1, even if you install it on D:/ everything would be lost when disk fails.
<br />
<br />And The games you are asking like GTA are Win32 apps. Usually when you open the setup you would have option to change the installation drive.

            Do both the modern and desktop versions of IE crash on these sites? Microsoft isn't updating Surface RT or Windows RT, including IE and any sites require a newer browser for compatibility. (Surface RT and Surface 2 are discontinued).

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Started happening a few months ago but now it's to the point that I'm thinking I need to throw the surface in the trash. Opened troubleshooter still no fix. Wife's chrome book has no problems... Makes you wonder that Microsoft doesn't support the surface

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks for the suggestions. I've done them all, short ifa total reset.&nbsp; Read a report today that Microsoft is giving up on IE and going to chrome soon as their default browser.&nbsp; Tells me to throw this $500 anchor in the trash and just buy a Chromebook.
 What a waste of money..never will I even think about a Microsoft product... unless I have no choice. Been several months and no fix....that tells me something.</p>
<p>Leaving 1 star review on every site I find their products.</p>
<p>Thanks for getting back to me with a fix</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Netflix app &#39;runtime broker&#39; process causes infinite loading circle</h2>
                    <p>Hi after using netflix app extensively without issue, I recently got a odd issue where none of the content would load/buffer and would get a infinite loading circle icon.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I searched I found only one mension of a workaround fix: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1sZxWY1_eA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1sZxWY1_eA</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/T1sZxWY1_eA?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/T1sZxWY1_eA?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>It basically shows the user ending the netflix nested 'runtime broker' process from the task manager.</p>
<p>I believe the runtime broker is a process related to the windows store and all apps installed by the store have this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a proper fix for the issue, this has to be done everytime the netflix app is opened.
</p>
<p>I have tried re-installing, store reset and updating the netlfix app but nothing changes.</p>
<p>Im not sure why I would get this problem and what has caused the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Can someone recommned a real persistant solution?</p>

            Hi, 3rownz
<br />
<br />My name is Phillip and I am an Independent Advisor.   I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />Check this link, I hope it helps, it is to run (Scannow and Dism) that are used to repair Windows system files.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />
<br />If the above does not work. Follow these steps: 
<br />
<br />1) launch powershell 
<br />2) Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3) Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.       
        </p>

<p>Thanks, I tried what you suggested and the scannow and dism did clean up corrupt files...but did not fix the issue. I then tried the powershell section and get the following:</p>

            What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.
