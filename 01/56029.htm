            Depending on the age of your system, it might be too old to run Windows 10. Also, it might be better running an older, but still supported release such as Windows 7 or Windows 8.
<br />
<br />How will I know if my computer can run Windows 10?
<br />
<br />System requirements
<br />
<br />If you want to upgrade to Windows 10 on your PC or tablet, here’s what it takes.
<br />
<br />Latest OS:  Make sure you are running the latest version either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update.
<br />
<br />For Windows 8.1, see the following article:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/install-latest-update-windows-8-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/in...</a>
<br />
<br />For Windows 7, see the following article:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/learn-how-to-install-windows-7-service-pack-1-sp1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/lea...</a>
<br />
<br />Processor:  1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor or SoC
<br />
<br />RAM:  1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit
<br />Hard disk space:  16 GB for 32-bit OS 20 GB for 64-bit OS
<br />Graphics card:  DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver
<br />Display:  1024x600
<br />
<br />How much actual free disk space is required by Windows 10 setup?
<br />
<br />Windows 10 uses approximately 10 GBs of disk space. The minimum disk space available is to facilitate the installation process. Some install files are compressed and need to be expanded during setup. Some files are temporary and are deleted during or after installation. Also, because you might have data and apps on the hard disk, they will be moved around during migration.

<br />
<br />Purchase Windows 7:
<br />
<br />Because Windows 7 is in limited stock after Microsoft ended sales in October 2013, this has created demand due to its scarcity. This means retail boxed copies demand a premium, while OEM System Builder copies remain relatively affordable.
<br />
<br />Full version (Retail):
<br />
<br />- Includes transfer rights to another computer.
<br />
<br />- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.
<br />
<br />- Expensive
<br />
<br />Upgrade version (Retail):
<br />
<br />- Includes transfer rights to another computer.
<br />
<br />- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.
<br />
<br />- Expensive, but cheaper than full version
<br />
<br />OEM System Builder version:
<br />
<br />OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:
<br />
<br />- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel
<br />
<br />- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on
<br />
<br />- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard
<br />
<br />- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system
<br />
<br />There is nothing particular wrong with using it too, especially since all future releases of Windows will be full versions anyway.
<br />
<br />You can find OEM System Builder software from dozens of online merchants. The current price for OEM Windows 7 Professional at Newegg (<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=100006816&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;Description=windows%207%20oem%20professional&amp;name=Operating%20Systems&amp;Order=BESTMATCH&amp;isdeptsrh=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?...</a>) , for example, is $140. When I checked a few minutes ago, Amazon was offering OEM Windows 7 Professional packages from multiple sellers (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=windows%207%20professional%20OEM&amp;sprefix=windows+7+profe%2Caps%2C268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=se...</a>) at prices ranging from $101 to $150. When I checked just now, a package specifically intended for refurbished PCs cost only $50 for a 64-bit copy (<a href="http://www.amazo
<br />
<br />There are no technical limitations to prevent you from using OEM software on your own PC, although this software will work only for a clean installation and not for an upgrade. In the past, Microsoft has been remarkably inconsistent in its advice to customers about whether this practice is allowed. (See "Is it OK to use OEM Windows on your own PC? Don't ask Microsoft." - <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/is-it-ok-to-use-oem-windows-on-your-own-pc-dont-ask-microsoft/1561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/is-it-ok-to-use-...</a>
<br />
<br />See the section of the article for Windows 7 how to perform a custom install:
<br />
<br />How to: Perform a custom installation of Windows - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Migrate to Windows 8.1 or Windows 10
<br />
<br />My personal view, if I had to choose between Windows 8.1 or Windows 10, I would go with Windows 10 if your hardware can support it. Windows 10 features a more familiar experience for Windows Vista users, such as the Desktop, Taskbar, Start menu  and floating application windows. Before you can consider either operating system, you need to ensure your operating system can actually run either operating system.
<br />
<br />To install Windows 8 or Windows 10 on your PC, the processor (CPU) must support the following features: Physical Address Extension (PAE), NX, and SSE2. Most CPUs have support for these features, so if you receive this error, it is likely because the NX feature is not enabled on your system. You can use a free utility such as CPU-Z (<a href="http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html</a>) to determine if your processor supports this extensions:
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />32 or 64 bit
<br />64 bit Windows comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more RAM. 32 bit Windows can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 or 10 64 bit is more secure too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7 or 10.
<br />
<br />As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in 64 bit versions of Windows 7 or 10, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, no 16 bit installer or uninstallers. Also, if you decide to move to 64 bit Windows in the future, there is no upgrade path from 32 bit Windows, clean install only.
<br />
<br />I personally recommend Windows 10 or Windows 8.1 32 bit for hardware 5 years or older. If your computer originally came with Vista, the 32 bit version is highly recommended and actually might add a performance boost. Studies have shown, 32 bit versions of Windows experience a 9% performance increase on 64 bit capable hardware.
<br />
<br />Performing the Installation
<br />
<br />Vista users will have to perform a custom install (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>), any attempt to start the Windows 10 installation in legacy versions of Windows will trigger the following error message:
<br />Image
<br />

<br />
<br />Also keep in mind, the Rollback function (<a href="https://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/how-to-rollback-to-a-previous-version-of-windows-from-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/...</a>) in Windows 10 does not support custom installs, so if you decide you want to go back to Windows Vista, you will have reinstall it using original reinstall media. So try creating a backup of your installation if this matters to you. If you are running Windows Vista Business, Ultimate or Enterprise, you can use the built in Complete PC Backup (<a href="https://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2007/09/29/speaking-of-recovery-tools-windows-vista-backup-center/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2007/09/29/...</a>) to create a system image of your installation. Users running editions such as Starter, Home Basic or Home Premium, will need to use a third party utility such as EaseUs ToDo Backup (free).

<h2>            Windows 10 Installation completely destroyed my laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi all</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a DELL Inspiron laptop (17R 5737) which was originally running Windows 8 (and later 8.1) with all updates installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried upgrading to Windows 10 and I had a few installation errors but on the 6th try it worked because I chose not to keep my settings and apps. At first after the initial installation, Windows 10 was working well and I spent some time downloading apps,
 checking out Edge and talking to Cortana but then I hibernated and the next day I tried turning my laptop on and for no reason whatsoever it threw me to the "Automatic repair" menu and then got stuck in a repair boot loop. From there I tried all the obvious
 choices, to restart a few times, to restore to an earlier image which it couldn't find, to boot to safe mode which didn't work, etc. I couldn't do anything at all. I tried resetting a few times (cleaning all settings and apps) but that also failed. I then
 saw that every time it tried a recovery it created a new partition on my drive called "Recovery partition". When I noticed that, it had already been a few hours of me trying all logical solutions and it had created 8 recovery partitions and my drive must have
 run out of space because it would no longer even start. It would immediately throw me on a blue screen showing hard drive errors. After hours of trying every alternative option, my laptop was completely DESTROYED&nbsp; and the only real option to get my laptop
 doing anything at all was to format it and install Linux from a live CD.</p>
<p>From what I understand I can't install Windows 10 from the ISO DVD any more, but I need to find the original Windows 8 ISO, install that, then upgrade to Windows 10 and hope it doesn't destroy everything again for no reason. Is that right? Is there a shortcut
 to all this procedure? I think the product key of Windows 8 is encrypted in the BIOS or something but I can't find the Windows 8 Home x 64 bit ISO anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously confidence in Windows 10 is now extremely low as my experience was a nightmare but I do need Windows for work so I have no choice but to try again and hopefully I won't go through this hell on earth again.<br />
I do, sort of, know what to do next, but if someone knows of a shortcut how to deal with this do let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone reading this, the only advice I have is to keep a recovery image before installing Windows 10. Even if installation works fine and everything looks good at first, the laptop could still be destroyed for no reason the day after. That's my experience
 anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi there,<br />
<br />
Maybe you didn't read? I had followed DELLs steps and the installation was successful.<br />
<br />
Windows 10 destroyed my laptop randomly the next day, for no reason. It was working fine for a while. No driver issues or anything like that.
<br />
<br />
The most frustrating this is that the only solution now is to find Windows 8, install, run all available updates and then install Windows 10. Something which will take many many hours and after it is done might, again, destroy my laptop again for no reason.<br />
<br />

    <title>EDB index search database file -- can I locate on a removable hard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mark lewiecki  say:</h3>
<h2>            EDB index search database file -- can I locate on a removable hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just indexed a 2 TB USB-attached, external hard drive on my Windows 10 Enterprise laptop. The indexing was added to the *.edb file located in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Search\Data\Applications. The process increased the size of the "Windows.edb" file by
 about 4 GB. There is lots of room on the external hard drive, but not much less free space on my C: drive, which is a 300GB SSD. Is there any way to put the indexing info on the drive that is being indexed? I.e. the *.edb file containing indexing info for
 Drive C: would be located on Drive C:, while the indexing info for Drive D: would be located on Drive D:.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The benefits of this approach would include:</p>
<p>* better use of limited SSD hard drive space</p>
<p>* "portable" index-based searching, e.g. if I plugged the removable drive into another system</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Google Chrome Has Stopped Working error frequently, I Don&#39;t Have Google Chrome...</h2>
                    <p>I use to have Google Chrome on my laptop, my brand new Windows 8 laptop. Until I started getting the same error message
<em>every 15 seconds</em>: "Google Chrome has stopped working, Windows is checking for a solution to the problem..." "A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available." You sit
 on a throne of LIES!&nbsp; #1, this happens even when I don't have Chrome open, #2, Chrome did
<em>not</em> stop working, #3, it doesn't even close Chrome after I get this error message. I'm so sick and tired of getting this error message that I deleted Chrome off my laptop and started using Mozilla Firefox as this error message did nothing but interrupt
 everything I do on my laptop. But then, <em>it keeps popping up</em>. The message has already popped up 5 times while I typed this! I finally realized it's the computer itself and not Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Chrome is allowed through my firewall.</p>
<p>

I close every window to no avail. So I have to use the MS trademark Re-boot and everything is snappy again.</p>

<h2>            Transferring Skype number to another Polish provider</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm having issues with transferring out my Skype number to ANY other Polish telecom provider.</p>
<p>I've tried many of them (including T-Mobile).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually I've been chatting with Microsoft support while standing in front of a T-Mobile employee and Microsoft support (chat) just washed their hands and said that it is the new provider's responsibility. T-Mobile employee said that the number is not visible
 in their systems, it is not recognized&nbsp; as a valid number and that most probably it is a stationary number and, as such, it cannot be transferred to any mobile network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If T-Mobile is unable (and I've found information in these forums that T-Mobile is handling Skype numbers) then with whom and how to proceed on this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

</p><p><span>The reality&nbsp;is that a guy with a PhD in computer science seems to be unable to accomplish such a supposedly trivial thing, in reality, -&nbsp; and the reality / practice&nbsp;is what I'm interested in.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thus, kindly please provide me with a sample provider who would be capable of performing such a&nbsp; process.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I've tried most of the Polish mobile providers and none of them succeed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"</span><span>Please approach your new designated telephone carrier (planned number operator) and request that they initiate the number porting request."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Trust me ; I've done this multiple times; in vain.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"</span><span>You do not have to have details about our telecom partner."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Supposedly, nor do I need to have knowledge in regard to the inter-telecom CRM IT systems. But the fact is simple - in practice, my request&nbsp; does not work; and judging by the fact that there's no problem with transferring&nbsp;between
 'regular' telecom operators; maybe; just maybe; there's something wrong with your integration with the polish telecom IT/business realities.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'm not a lawyer but I've heard that in the US&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(16, 16, 16, 1)">&nbsp;the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&nbsp;ruled acts on these matters as early
 as in 2002 (for landlines sooner) and we've been having similar acts in the European Union for quite some time now. I do not know if Skype is registered as a telecom provider and whether is is obligated to conform to such acts; but anyway; it would seem as
 quite a welcome; and user-friendly feature / option - to have.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hiding behind phrases such as "<span>just to let you know that&nbsp;</span><span>number porting requests are carried out between telephone operators"</span></p>
<p><span>, when we both simply see that it does not work, is not what&nbsp; I would expect from a company such as.. Microsoft.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade boot problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> craig somerton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade boot problem</h2>
                    <p>My wife was prompted to update her laptop from Win7 to Win 10 last night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update appears to have struck a problem saying the boot sector is corrupted or files are inaccessible. &nbsp;The upgrade keeps saying it will revert back to the original version of Windows or attempt a system repair but it is now stuck in a loop, unable to
 move forward or back. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The black and white DOS screen tells me I have to reinstall the previous Win7 OS again, but we didn't receive any install disks when we bought the laptop - everything was pre-installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife isn't particularly tech savvy so I know she would not have thought to back-up her data. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to restore Win7 and start again? &nbsp;Or if we do a fresh install of Win10? &nbsp;I have a second PC on which to create an install disk, but either way, will she lose her files?</p>

            <p>Hello Craig,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I will be glad to assist you with the issue you are experiencing with the computer. I understand the difficulty when things won’t work the way they should.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model of your PC?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages?</li></ol>
<p>As per the description, I can see that you&nbsp;have mentioned&nbsp;"The black and white DOS screen tells me I have to reinstall the previous Win7 OS again", which means the operating system is corrupted and needs to be reinstalled. Hence it is not able to revert
 back to the previous Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Keep Pressing F8</strong> at the startup of the manufacturer logo and wait till you get the
<strong>Advance Boot menu </strong>and check if you have a option to <strong>Boot the Windows
</strong>with<strong> Last known good configuration.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to get it, I suggest you to <strong>contact your manufacturer
</strong>and check if they can provide you a <strong>installation media of the preinstalled operating system
</strong>from which you can <strong>repair or recover your Windows.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Without upgrading the Windows 10 from the previous Windows if you are fresh installing the Windows 10, it will result in activation issues and you may have to buy the product key for activating the Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted to help you better.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I was not able to restore the last best config, nor could I advance past the loop. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many fruitless hours I eventually searched on the Toshiba forums, which revealed a way to restore the machine to original factory settings. &nbsp;This meant we lost everything stored on the drive, as the restore did a re-partition.</p>

<em>msvcr100.dll is missing error</em></strong>&nbsp;(which i may or may not have fixed) and they may result in more frustrating problems in the future.</p>
<p>I will install anything needed but currently it doesnt even mention what to install and i would really like some help, thanks!</p>

    <title>how do I edit video file properties details&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            how do I edit video file properties details&#63;</h2>
                    When playing avi files, the contributing artist is displayed as a stupid code by the uploader, such as 'Done with AutoMKV!', which is then displayed<em> ad nauseum</em> on the viewing panel of my Windows Media Player.&nbsp;Opening file attributes does nothing
 for editing the usual details (as for mp3 files, for example) and seems to be beyond any control of mine. Anyone got a step-by-step answer for editing these 'blued-out' values? Title, Subtitle and anything in the Media sections are just 'blued out', but the
 more-than-useless 'Star rating' (5 stars) is operable (God only knows why). Keep the answer in plain English please, as computer gobbledygook is just plain daft. Thank you in advance. Mike

<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does the issue happen with all the video files?</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Explorer and WMP (Windows Media Player) probably don't write tags to files in AVI and MPEG format, because these formats
 don't properly support tagging. I think that it's advisable to instead use new formats that have proper tagging support, like WMV or MPEG-4.</span></p>

<h2>            Can I still purchase a Windows 98 CD with a Product Key&#63;</h2>
                    After a response from another Community Member, it would appear that Windows 10 is not compatible with my computer. Her response most likely is/was correct as I have had problem after problem since installing it. I used to have a Windows 98 CD, but I gave
 it away when I upgraded to Windows 10. So now I would like to buy another one, if they are still available with a Product Key. Are they? Any idea of the cost too. Thanks

<p>Would you mind explain what compatibility issue are you facing with Windows 10?</p>
<p>Windows 98 is no longer supported and using it will put you at risk and modern tools and applications won't work on it.</p>
<p>I suggest look into a way to resolve compatibility issues , instead of looking for Windows 98 CD. It is not officially available and even if you find it, install unsupported operating system is risky.</p>

    <title>YouTube App on Xbox One Low Streaming Quality - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> papusapapi  say:</h3>
<h2>            YouTube App on Xbox One Low Streaming Quality</h2>
                    
<p>Alright so these are the steps I have tried to do before posting to this support page</p>
<p>-DMZ Hosting</p>
<p>-Port Forwarding</p>
<p>-Call ISP Provider</p>
<p>-Check for Updates</p>
<p>-NAT Type OPEN</p>
<p>Anyway, lately I have been seeing POOR Streaming Quality on YouTube and only YouTube. Netflix and any other app has HD Streaming. Seems like YouTube is only Streaming at 480p and I can't figure out why. Really annoying when you are trying to watch a video
 on a 55" HD TV and it comes out almost unwatchable. My Download speed is 11.00 Mbps and Upload speed is 0.95 Mbps with 0% Packet Loss and 18ms</p>
<p>Anyone know what is going on? Thanks!</p>

<p>So even after contacting Xbox Support these are the steps they told me to attempt,</p>
<p>1.In your console, Please go to Settings&gt;Network&gt;Network Settings&gt;under Troubleshooting choose "Test Network Connection" to see if you are connected to Xbox Live</p>
<p>2.Now, we are going to refresh your account and I can assure that it will not loose anything in your profile. In your console, please Go to Settings&gt; Sign-in, security and passkey&gt; Remove account</p>
<p>3.Now, in your console, please go to Settings&gt;Disc &amp; Blu-ray&gt;Persistent storage&gt;Clear Persistent Storage</p>
<p>4.In your console, Please go to Home &gt; Network Settings &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Alternate MAC Address &gt; &nbsp;Clear &gt; Restart</p>
<p>5.Can we please turn off the console and remove all the wires connected from it including the Kinect and power supply. Reconnect them all tightly to the console after 30 seconds. After that, kindly press the Xbox button on the controller to turn the console
 on.</p>
<p>6.Now, please Click the icon found at the upper left most of the screen beside the globe&gt; Add new&gt; Enter MS email&gt; password</p>
<p>7.This time, please try to check on the YouTube application and we hope that it is working fine this time.</p>
<p>After steps 1-7 I still had Poor Streaming Quality, </p>
<p>"No worries, we still have the best resolution for you." That is what the Agent said to me.</p>
<p>New Step that was provided to me,</p>
<p>1.Let's try to reinstall the application of YouTube. Just a heads up, the installation &nbsp;will take few minutes of your time, &nbsp;however, we will provide you a service request number for our reference. &nbsp;In the event that we still encounter the same issue, &nbsp;I
 would recommend that you contact the YouTube application developer cause I am afraid that it is an in application issue.</p>
<p>Of course that didn't work..so I asked for Contact Information for YouTube App lol Agent really eased my mind saying, "I can assure that there is nothing wrong in your account and console as well."</p>
<p>YouTube Contact is : You may reach YouTube application developer at 1-650-253-0000 VIA Skype. Not sure if Phone Number can be dialed with Cell/Home</p>
<p>So I have come to the conclusion that Xbox Support has no idea how to fix anything and is just handing out steps VIA a list of steps and no other knowledge beyond that. I guess this is an APP issue and it will require a future update...sigh. Hopefully this
 helps someone else out there lol</p>

<h3> alexalexmax  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t unzip zipped files</h2>
                    I have Windows 10, latest update, everything. Yet for some reason, any zipped files I come across aren't unzippable. Maybe i'm just doing something wrong, but when I double click on the file I want,(WinZip file in this instance) it tells me to buy WinZip.
 What do I do? This is a problem for me.

            Hi AlexMax, 
<br />
<br />I’d uninstall and reinstall WinZip. Give it another go. If no dice, 
<br />Give 7 Zip a shot:

            Try resetting your Windows 8 Phone by going to Settings &gt; About Phone &gt; Reset Your Phone.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>It'll make your Windows 8 Phone very refresh and brings everything to its normal state. Be sure to copy/move all your important files or photos before doing this as resetting your device will erase everything on it including files, installed apps, customizations
 etc.&nbsp;</div>
