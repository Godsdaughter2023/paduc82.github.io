<h2>            Xbox One Liga, mas depois de 03 segundos desliga.</h2>
                    
<p>Oi amigos, deixei meu Xbox one desligado por alguns dias (fora das tomadas) e hoje, fui ligar, coloquei todos os conectores (kinect, fonte, hdmi) vi que a luz da fonte estava laranja (manual diz que é economia de energia), passei o dedo na Logo do Xbox e
 Plin, o mesmo acendeu, a fonte foi para cor branca só que não deu vídeo e em 03 segundos o console desligou.</p>

<p>ç.ç já rodei a internet atrás disso e o mais próximo que cheguei foi um erro que ao tentar ligar ele desligava no mesmo instante, o meu fica uns 03 segundos, você consegue sentir o cooler funcionando, o barulho do sistema desligando &gt;.&lt;.</p>

<h2>            Upgraded hardware. Windows 10 won&#39;t recognize my digital license from last install. Troubleshooter does not help</h2>
                    I recently changed my mother board. In 2016 I upgraded my windows from 7 to 10 using the free update they offered. My Microsoft account WAS connected prior to the hardware change so as stated by Microsoft I should only need my account to activate my old
 version. I used the media creater to get windows 10 on my usb and installed it that way.It was Windows 10 pro 64 bit BEFORE AND AFTER my hardware update After signing in to my Microsoft account windows will not recognize my old code/account the troubleshooter
 gives me error C004C003, the troubleshooter had a button that said "i changed my hardware" clicking through it and selecting my device simply said it could not be done and to try again later. I DO NOT HAVE THE OLD WINDOWS 7 CODE FROM OVER 4 YEARS AGO

    <title>ASUS battery refuses to charge. &#34;Plugged in but not charging.&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter-san  say:</h3>
<h2>            ASUS battery refuses to charge. &#34;Plugged in but not charging.&#34; &#34;Battery&#58; Battery capacity unknown.&#34;</h2>
                    I bought a ASUS P552LA laptop 2-years ago which refuses to charge. The included battery and the laptop are original and bought from a known local reseller.
<br />
<br />
The laptop originally had Windows 8 pre-installed but I downgraded it to Windows 7 due to my wifes preference. I never needed the battery so I kept the laptop running on the adapter with the battery unplugged for around 2-years. Now I need the battery but it
 still wont charge. I tried charging it when I first bought it and it didn't charge. Since it was my first laptop, I figured maybe I'm doing something wrong. I tried fixing it by reinstalling drivers, discharging the laptop and running diagnostics. Nothing
 seems to work on either operating systems. <br />
<br />
- I tried discharging the laptop by unplugging everything and holding the power button down.
<br />
- I ran a diagnostics with command prompt in admin mode using <strong>powercfg -energy -output pwr.html</strong>
<br />
- I tried charging the battery with the laptop turned off over-night. <br />
- I tried reinstalling the ACPI battery drivers. <br />
<br />
When I plug the battery in and turn on the laptop with the adapter, an orange LED light turns on for the battery indicator. After entering windows, the battery icon displays "<em>Plugged in but not charging</em>" (It changes to "<em>plugged in (charging)</em>"
 if ACPI drivers are reinstalled, but remains at 0% indefinitely). The diagnostics I ran were unable to identify the battery and the battery capacity is unknown. Is this a faulty battery?
<br />
Note that the battery had never been used nor charged.

<p>You need support from Asus.&nbsp; My best guess is that the battery itself is defective, and probably was from the day you got it, or shortly afterward.&nbsp; It is unlikely that Asus would honour any warranty.&nbsp; It is also possible, but much less likely that the charging
 circuit is defective.&nbsp; You can buy replacement batteries for about $50 or less.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should check to see if the power cord/adapter is defective.&nbsp; You can replace them for about $20 or less.&nbsp; Also check to see if the port where the power cord plugs into the computer is breaking.</p>

</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click ‘OK’ and then restart your PC.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in safe mode then, start the computer in clean boot and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press the ‘<b>Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the ‘<b>Run</b>’ window type ’<b>MSCONFIG</b>’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>

<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the ‘<b>General’</b> tab, click to select the option ‘<b>Selective startup</b>’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the ‘<b>Services</b>’ tab, click to select the ‘<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b>’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the ‘<b>StartUp</b>’ tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager</b>’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2</span></b><span>: <b>Enable half of the services</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click to select half of the check boxes in the
<b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>OK</b>, and then click
<b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3</span></b><span>: <b>Determine whether the problem returns.</b></span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected
<b>service</b> causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4</span></b><span>: <b>Enable half of the Startup items</b></span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5</span></b><span>: <b>Determine whether the problem returns</b></span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item list</b>. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item list</b>, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the

<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem.</span></b></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the
 problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7</span></b><span>: </span></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the ‘Run’ window type ’<b>MSCONFIG</b>’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the ‘<b>General</b>’ tab, click the ‘<b>Normal Startup</b>’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘<b>Restart</b>’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Run a system file checker scan and then try to create system restore points check if that helps. Refer the following steps to run SFC scan.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Move the mouse pointer to bottom left of the screen where you see preview of start menu and Right-click to bring up a list of Windows settings.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <b>‘Command Prompt (Admin)’</b> to bring up elevated command prompt. Note: Click
<b>‘Yes’</b> if it prompts for permission.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the command prompt type in the following command:
<b>‘sfc /scannow’</b> and hit enter.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3</b>:</p>
<p><span>Download and run Microsoft Safety Scanner from the link to make sure you computer is not infected by virus:</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all but nothing seemed to help my taskbar flashing problem.</p>
<p>Also control panel won't let me click and instantly disappears. (mouse pointer changes from arrow to hand.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even with ‘<strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong>’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’, taskbar still flashes.</p>
<p>So, it is not caused by installed application. Most likely it is caused by Windows 10 upgrade on my Lenovo T420 pc (Windows 7 before update.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what to do next.</p>
<p>This taskbar flashing is really annoying.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>
<p>

<p>Amigo,</p>
<p>O sistema esta impresso na propria capa do DVD e no disco ( se genuini) no lado esquerdo, tem uma pequena tarjeta em branco indicando o sistema. Se seu console for Americano/Brasileiro, não adquira jogos europeus em Pal, não roda. Já confirmei com o suporte
 da Xbox, não tem o que fazer! É trocar o dvd.</p>

    <title>File is not a valid Win32 application&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob is interested  say:</h3>
<h2>            File is not a valid Win32 application&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I'm trying to battle with XP Pro and force it to open a file type with an usual program. &nbsp;Its like battling Goliath. &nbsp;It sure would be nice if Windows would listen to the user and do what its told once in a while. &nbsp;So I'm trying to open a HTM file. &nbsp;I
 can't stand Internet Explorer and use Opera 99% of the time. I have 2 version of Opera installed. &nbsp;The latest and one that is about a year old. &nbsp;I want the one that is a year old to be the default. &nbsp;You'd think that would be easy. &nbsp;You'd be wrong. &nbsp;Things
 get grayed out, you select the program and the system ignores your request, and on and on. &nbsp;Folder Options, Types seems useless. &nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I try to open a .htm or .html file it wants to use Internet Explorer. I've set the default file type in Opera. &nbsp;And in Folder Options (or I tried unsuccessfully). &nbsp;When I click the older version of Opera to open this file it says:<br />
File is not a valid Win32 application<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How can a file be an application? &nbsp;This makes no sense. &nbsp;Its a file, not a program. &nbsp;Files are not 32 or 64bit.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is there any way of making the Operating System listen to the user and do what its told? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Pick a file. &nbsp;Select the default program for opening it no matter where it is on your computer. Could be Z drive. &nbsp;Just do what you're told. &nbsp;Is that asking too much? &nbsp;It seems to be in the the tyrannical world of Microsoft. &nbsp;I can't even imagine how things
 like this must be in Win7 and 8. &nbsp;Users must feel like ants. <br />
<br />
And is there any way of making this Operating System that seems to suffer from a major bout of Amnesia and Alzeimers remember where I last was when I clicked Open in my program? &nbsp;It keeps on defaulting to some stupid location in C: drive when I haven't opened
 anything from C: drive in months, actually probably never. &nbsp;You do something 1000 times and the OS still can't take a hint? &nbsp;Thank you Microsoft for completely ignoring the user! &nbsp;Well done! &nbsp;You're almost as stubborn as Apple. &nbsp;And that is REALLY saying something.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It seems you are blaming Microsoft for your own lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to "Set Program Access and Defaults" (Via Add/Remove programs in Control Panel), click Custom and change your default browser to Opera. All htm files will then, by default, open with Opera.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for "File is not a valid Win32 application" I do not think the message refers to the file that you are trying to open. More likely it refers to the file that you are trying to open it with. Not sure about two versions of Opera installed concurrently,
 not something I'm prepared to experiment with, suggest you look at Opera help pages.</p>

            <p>Well I did that and it didn't work. Still get the same error message. And it would be nice if you had addressed by query: How could a File be 32bit or 64bit dependent? Its programs that are 32bit or 64bit. Like I said, I've set .htm and .html files to be
 opened by Opera 11.64 yet XP stubbornly refuses to obey. Its just sickening how often this happens. As if anyone in their right mind would use such an awful browser as Internet Explorer. Its even worse than Firefox and that's bad. It would be great if Microsoft
 focuses on what they do rather well most of the time: Building an Operating System. I can't think of a single product that is worth using that they're come up with besides the OS. What they SHOULD do is scour the market looking for top notch products, then
 buy them and integrate them, then include them with their Operating System if they so wish. They just bought Skype. Let's see if they destroy it somehow. They've joined with Facebook and Skype so that's a great sign. We'll see what the future brings.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I should add that when I have Opera opened and click Open File and when I do it that way of course it works perfectly. Its just when Microsoft gets involved that it doesn't cooperate. So are there any bright people out there that have experienced this issue
 before and have some suggestions that work? &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One day Microsoft (and Apple and many other big companies like Adobe) are going to realize that its better to listen to the customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
You answered this question yourself so I didn't see the need to answer it for you but as you said</p>
<p>"Files are not 32 or 64bit"</p>
<p>However, executable programs <strong><em>are</em></strong> 32bit or 64bit, hence the reason why I said it is likely to be the program that you are specifiying to open the file rather than the (htm) file itself.</p>
<p>Hey look, you have your opinions and others have theirs (and I haven't stated what my opinions are at all). Being agressive with us (we are not Microsoft) about your opinions won't get you very far. I nearly didn't answer you at all for this reason. If you
 walked into a butchers and said "meat is a rubbish food and not worth eating, you wanna turn veggie and be a greengrocer", what do you think would happen? If you want&nbsp;assistance it really does help to be civil when you post. Being openly antagonistic cannot

            I also have the same problem. I transferred a file from my windows 10 computer into my hard disk. I inserted the hard disk into my xp computer when I realised (British English)&nbsp;the problem. My Windows 10 computer is 64bit while my Windows XP is a 32bit
 computer. And I am so upset. I do not know how to make a file change from 64bit to 32bit. Even though I have a WIFI network, I can't see my network in my xp computer and so I cant download the 32bit version of the program. Any suggestions? P.S. I don't even
 have a file compressor as I didn't download it before as I have no network connection.

<h2>            Turn off swipe drag with surface pro 3 pen</h2>
                    Simple question, when I'm drawing with my pen on the surface pro 3 if I swipe left with the pen a little page icon which says "forward" pops up, when I swipe down it says drag down and drags my canvas down....same thing with swiping up. As an artist, this
 irritates me to no end because it screws up what I'm drawing...how do I turn off this swipe drag crap?

<br />Those both appear to be the initial windows for two programs. You can try using external manifests. It's complicated. I wrote up how to do this for Adobe Photoshop, but you may be able to do this for your programs, substituting the name of the exe where appropriate. <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro4-surfdrivers/scaling-adobe-apps-on-surface-pro-4/a478e17b-b9c2-4696-92ee-72e5e01cbf2b?auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/for...</a>

<p>All these complicated instructions - have tried as many of them as seem applicable with both my Quickbooks program (where the too small icons and too small to read dialogue boxes have been a problem for over a year) and tried to figure out why this started
 happening THIS week with dialogue boxes in Chrome while working in the back end of my WP website.<br />
<br />
This used to not be a problem at all. Seems a Windows "update" caused it and Windows needs to fix it. Because none of your complicated and convoluted instructions work.</p>
<p>

<p>I think the problem is that you have insufficient internet speeds to play the games, either because you're joining a Host who is in North America, or you just have very slow internet. Call up Xbox support and see what they can do. Usually thy can use an
 emulator to check your modem. So if it's a connection problem they will fix it, if not... Then you might have to upgrade your internet to DSL/Fyber optik</p>

<p>Like Sword Style said its accurate to the era, people got married simply because it was expected of them. The result were many couples that got married really young before most people knew who they were. You also have to remember that at the time women were
 not treated or regarded as equals as they are today. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Had Cole not been so close to the truth its likely the affair could have slid by rather then the LAPD using it to publicly destroy him. Who would believe a dishonored cop? Cole saved Jack because he had more potential with the DA to fix the problems then
 he could from within the LAPD. This was a real problem back then.</p>

    <title>Backwards compatibility is a farce and a lie - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fatal grymmm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backwards compatibility is a farce and a lie</h2>
                    
<p>So here I am, early xmas. Xmas in Nov!!! I get my xbox 1. Now, perhaps I should have read more on backwards compatibility. Perhaps I should not have assumed so much. When I heard so much advertising on the exemplary promises of backwards compatibility, I
 thought that meant I would have access to the many (40-50) games I had purchased digitally for my xbox 360. Most of these titles are from the last three years. Now, I can accept updates, and staggered releases. But, from what I am seeing, you actually expect
 me to re purchase most of those games. It seems many of the titles I have, they are already released and they have a price tag on them. One I already paid. This morning, I will be playing taken king of my xbox 360, because apparently microsoft does not understand
 what it is to buy and sell. You can only sell a product once to a buyer. Short of damage to the item through negligence of the user, no user will pay twice for the right to own something they already paid for. That is lunacy. Absurdity. An abuse of quid pro
 quo and even capitalism.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I am NOT PLEASED and I will likely be one more statistic. One more of the many who have returned the xbox1 due to lies, disappointment, and vagrant false advertising. Oh yeah... I don't put up with **** at all. To expect a person
 to pay for a game twice? Really? Anyone who buys a game twice after a system switch is frigging moron. Sheep lead to slaughter. We do not have to tolerate this people. Just boycott. Refuse. I hear sony has some kick backwards compatibility. Since I am going
 to have to pay for everything again, I may as well make the switch.</p>

<p>You do NOT have to repurchase any of these titles my friend. Not all titles have been re-released yet for backwards compatability. There are currently 104 titles available. Once a game has been released for backwards compatability, it will show up in your
 library to download FOR FREE. Microsoft will update thethe backwards compatability library regularly.</p>
<p>The issue here is that you did not do proper research before making poor decisions.</p>

<p>I'm having a hard time believing this is a real Xbox One owner.</p>
<p>The last paragraph shows how clueless this person is.</p>
<p>To say that Sony "has some kick backwards compatibility." just goes to show how misinformed you are.</p>
<p>Sony, with the PS4, has NO backwards compatibility. All they have is the ability to "stream" older games, which is (like BC currently on the Xbox One) limited to only a partial PS3 library. To also say that it's "kick" is wrong as well, as there has been
 many complaints about the framerate and stuttering while the game is being streamed.</p>
<p>Last but NOT LEAST, you HAVE to PAY for it. So, that whole rant about paying for games you already own (which you don't have to with Xbox One) makes your whole argument contradictive of itself, since you seem to want to PAY for Sony's streaming service to
 play games you've already paid for.</p>
<p>So, that being said, I think you're just a troll here and just trying to discredit Microsoft and trying to give people the wrong impression about them and the Xbox One.</p>
<p>Just leave and don't come back... or the next person like me will make you look like an idiot as well (which you already did a good job of that yourself).</p>

            <p>Hey Fatal Grymmm, unfortunately Destiny is not one of the backwards compatible titles therefor you would have to purchase the Xbox One version of the game. Xbox made it pretty clear in the BC announcement that only certain titles would be available at the feature's launch. The list of titles available so far is located <a href="http://news.xbox.com/2015/11/09/introducing-your-first-104-xbox-one-backward-compatibility-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>. </p>

<h2>            Vista randomly disconnects internet connection</h2>
                    I have had a problem with random internet disconnect since my computer was new 8/08. I have many tech people look at it, and all say it is a Vista problem.<br />
Vista randomly stops recognizing the signal from my IP, thru my wired linksys router connection.<br />
It sounds similar to this thread:<br />
http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistanetworking/thread/35f49ad8-1d19-4d84-94e3-633e86b3909d<br />
I am not tech savvy and need help fixing this. <br />
It sucks that Vista is not automatically fixed in Windows Updates.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Your router would be suspect here, <strong>have you updated its firmware as a possible solution</strong>? And
<br />
I would update your NIC drivers on the computers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of NIC - double click on it - driver's tab - write
<br />
down version - click Update Driver (may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then<br />
Right Click on NIC Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

How to Install a Device Driver in Vista Device Manager<br />

<br />
<strong>Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
</strong><br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
<strong>After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even newer versions.</strong>
<br />
(The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
<strong>Repeat above for WiFi Device</strong> and is a good time to get other updated drivers as Vista loves<br />
updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests one just HIDE it as they<br />
are almost alway old and you can look for drivers manually as needed.<br />

<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Make sure you know the login details for your wired/wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />
<br />
You will lose connection when doing this and have to redo your logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network &amp; Sharing Center - on Right Side click Customize - Set Network Locations page -<br />
on lower left click Merge or delete networks&nbsp;locations&nbsp;- DELETE ALL instances of your network&nbsp;(and any&nbsp;<br />
others you no longer use) - REBOOT.&nbsp;Start - Connect To to logon on to Network.<br />

<h3> clitheroe_uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype cancelled my long-term annual subscription for free UK landline calls.</h2>
                    <p>For absolutely no reason, Skype have just cancelled my annual local calls UK subscription, which isn't due to end until October 2018, (March 2018 as you read this).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Presumably, this is because it is a grandfathered account, (although a new subscription for the same service is exactly the same rate), but to simply cancel without warning is outrageous and insulting to a long-time customer! Such an action amplifies precisely
 SKype/Microsoft's attitude to customers and to the Skype service in general.<br />
<br />
I am truly angry and very saddened that Skype/Microsoft made this move, particularly as the first I heard of the cancellation was a refund from them into my PayPal account. Given that Skype is a communications application, it is highly ironic that Skype's intentions
 to cancel my subscription were not communicated to me beforehand.<br />

            you can use more than one licence with one Microsoft account, in fact using the same account to log on has some benefits such as syncing your settings and carrying on working on the second where you left off on the first.
<br />I have 4 licenses linked to my personal Microsoft account

    <title>Wireless printer offline - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hg99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless printer offline</h2>
                    I have a HP officejet pro wireless printer. Whenever someone starts to use the desktop computer with windows 10 and tries to print, the computer says the printer is offline. If I run a diagnostic on the printer, the printer says the connection is excellent
 while the computer says the printer is off. Sometimes turning the printer off and on will result in the computer recognizing the printer as online. However, frequently this does not help. FYI, I don't have trouble printing from my I-phone.

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Unfortunately, IE on the Xbox console does not support the Flash media player. Apparently, it supports HTML5, but most websites do not currently use that. Media streaming websites such as YouTube will not offer video streaming to the Xbox (apart from their
 console app) due to the lack of Flash support.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Posting in the beta support forums might yield more answers.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>I have no problem logging into my Microsoft account itself from my browser.&nbsp; The problem is if I try to use it to log into my Windows 10 machine using my Microsoft account rather than my local user account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Oh I see! Sorry for missing that.
<br />
<br />In that case, try the below to see if your Microsoft account is linked to Windows:
<br />- Open the Settings app with Windows Key+I
<br />- Go to Accounts &gt; Your account
<br />
<br />You should see an option to use your Microsoft account instead. If it's not set up, you can sign in with your Microsoft account and it should fix the issue. Otherwise let me know!

            Hello,
<br />
<br />As you're using Microsoft account to sign into your Windows 10, try resetting its password online using another device and then try to login with new password on original device.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!
