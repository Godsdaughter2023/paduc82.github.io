<h2>            Windows 8.1 Motherboard and cpu upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 8.1 and I am going to upgrand my motherboard and cpu (z97 &amp; i7 4790K)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would normally do a fresh reinstall of windows, but I have heard that with windows 8.1 you don't need to do this.&nbsp; Is this correct, can I just plug in my ssd in with the new motherboared and windows 8.1 will boot??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be appreciated?</p>

            <p>Under most circumstances, Windows 8.1 should reconfigure itself under the new motherboard, but you might need to reactivate by telephone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should still create install media just in case you need to repair the installation:</p>

    <title>14 minutes between BIOS and Win10 logo after November update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> names are already taken  say:</h3>
<h2>            14 minutes between BIOS and Win10 logo after November update</h2>
                    <p>After installing the November update, my laptop now takes a long time to boot (~16 minutes), either from powered off or as a restart. I have tried removing the hibernate option (no difference observed), checked the drivers via device manager and stepping
 through each device and 'Search for updated drivers', ran SFC and DISM, and BOOTREC within the RE.
</p>
<p>Within the BIOS (V1.3127), Quiet boot=Disabled, Network boot=Disabled, F12 boot menu=Disabled, D2D recovery=Disabled, SATA mode=ACHI mode, Boot priority order has the SSD (IDE0) as the first entry</p>
<p>Machine is an Acer 1420P upgraded to 8GB RAM and Crucial C300 250GB SSD. </p>
<p>Originally supplied with Win7, upgraded to Win10 prior to the November update becoming available, both of which booted and worked ok. When the system is finally up, it works fine. A clue might be that the disk light is on solid (no blinking) for the 14 minutes
 until the Windows logo appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone got a hint as to how to reduce the time before Windows gets going please?</p>

</p><p>&gt;&gt;<span><span>To get significantly lower figures you would need to install a solid state drive.&lt;&lt;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This <strong><em>IS</em> </strong>with a SSD (upgraded when the machine was still W7)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&gt;&gt;</span></span><span><span>Net.Tcp Port Sharing Service&lt;&lt;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Was disabled, changed to Automatic</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A CHKDSK was run on 11 Jan 2016 01:14:22 and is in the Application log</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Re-ran, the machine still spent 14 minutes between the BIOS and Windows logo appearing (with the disk light on solid)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&gt;&gt;</span></span><span><span>You have disabled Services related to Jeppesen software. Are you using the software&lt;&lt;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Yes, Jepp services are the primary use of this machine, but used when the machine is offline, and the CDA part is disabled as it is useless when the machine is offline:&nbsp; I start it when I need it (very rarely)</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&gt;&gt;</span></span><span><span>Do you need to have Garmin AT loading every time the computer is booted?&lt;&lt;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Fair point - not it is not a highly used app</span></span></p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Memory&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Just after boot, Hardware 98MB, In-use 1788M, modified 112MB, Standby 877MB, Free 5287MB</p>
<p><span><span>Just to re-iterate, the time is between the BIOS and Windows logo appearing, after the windows logo appears it is only a minute or three before it is ready for logon</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The treesize reports produced something interesting - in the
</span></span><span><span>System Volume Information/chkdsk folder there were only reports up to the end of 2014 despite there having been CHKDSK activity since. Running CHKDSK C: /r produces the prompt to perform at next boot, and at boot time the prompt appears
 to 'Press any key within 8 seconds to skip', yet there seems to be no trace of it actually running at boot time in the Application log. Running a CHKDSK while the system up reports the file system doesn't need any repair activities.</span></span></p>

            <p>Not sure exactly which step fixed this, but have recovered the situation!</p>
<p>Suspecting this was a SATA controller/SSD controller mismatch, and having a 128GB SSD lying about, what I did was:</p>
<p>Shrink the c: partition </p>
<p>Installed Easus Backup</p>
<p>Cloned the installed 250GB to the 128GB connected over USB</p>
<p>The machine didn't boot when I swapped the 128GB to the SATA mobo connector, so reverted back to the 250GB.</p>
<p>Booted from the 250GB without the delay! Noted that there as now a boot choices menu (Win 10 or Easus Linux)</p>
<p>Removed Easus backup</p>
<p>Extended the C: partition back to full size</p>
<p>Machine is still ok and boots to logon in less than a minute</p>
<p>Suspicion is that Easus Backup installation corrected something, but not sure what</p>

    <title>Problema cuffie xbox 360 slim - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dhastan90  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problema cuffie xbox 360 slim</h2>
                    
<p>Ciao ragazzi, questo è il mio primo post in questo forum, vorrei farvi una domanda per quanto riguarda un problema che ho con le cuffie... (A dire il vero il problema c'è l'ha mio fratello non io) Praticamente, il problema comincia quando noi due vogliamo
 giocare online ad un fps, vi spiego la scenetta che accadde la prima volta e che succede ormai sempre...<br />
<br />
Un giorno stavamo giocando a battlefield, con cuffie (Lui aveva queste, <a href="http://www.gamekart.it/files/gamekart_Files/Foto/21386_42788_185539722875.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.gamekart....85539722875.JPG</a>) e io avevo e ho ancora quelle originali xbox 360, uscite dallo scatolo della console, mentre si giocava, improvvisamente lui ha smesso di sentirmi, ma io sentivo lui... ci siamo guardati in faccia coi soldatini e
 ci siamo cominciati a pugnalare della seria "Oh mi senti ***!? xD" ma niente... da quel momento è cominciato il problema...<br />
<br />
Ha cambiato le cuffie, comprandone di nuove (ben due cuffie identiche a quelle che ho io, originali della xbox) ma entrambe non hanno funzionato. Inizialmente lo sentivo, lui sentiva me, poi nuovamente a lui si spegne la cuffia, se insiste nel provare a sentirmi,
 gli si spegne anche il microfono e a quel punto è costretto a sentirmi e a parlarmi tramite la kinect, mentre io continuo a parlare e a sentire dalle cuffie...<br />
<br />
Ho pensato dunque, fosse un problema di controller... anche se mi pareva strano visto che ne ha due e su entrambe non funzionavano le cuffie...<br />
<br />
Dunque, gli dico di comprarsi un paio di cuffie (Si compra queste <a href="http://www.gamemag.it/immagini/xbox360headset_s.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.gamemag.i...60headset_s.jpg</a>) Inizialmente funzionano! Miracolo! Fatta una brevissima prova in chat privata, si va a giocare col sorrisone sulle labbra!<br />
<br />
2 Minuti di gioco ed ecco che il problema si ripresenta! Stessa prassi, prima lui non sente me, dunque è costretto ad ascoltarmi tramite le casse della TV, questa volta però mi riesce a parlare tramite il microfono delle cuffie wireless... Il problema ora è
 capire cos'è/chi è/ qual'è/ la causa di questo problema o_O... idee</p>

<p>La soluzione al problema non ce l'ho, posso solo dirti che mi son trovato in situazioni simili (non identiche) e ho sempre addossato le colpe al provider: la sensazione era che tra due particolari provider o qualche volta addirittura con lo stesso, ci fossero
 degli strambi conflitti.</p>
<p>Io non ho mai risolto se non con il tempo (nel senso che è capitato che le cose si sistemassero da sole e senza spiegazione apparente).</p>

<p>Quindi ritieni che la colpa sia del gestore °_°? Tipo lui usa Vodafone, e io uso Telecom, effettivamente lui ha sempre avuto problemi di linea, io invece anche se vogli parlare con gli altri in game riesco tranquillamente, lui invece no...</p>
<p>Ora che ci penso però... quando lui prova ad inviare un messaggio vocale, nel momento in cui si registra, e prova a riascoltarsi, non riesce a sentire la sua voce.. in alcun modo, quindi non penso che in questo caso i provider centrino qualcosa o_O...</p>
<p>Altra nota: Lui in questo momento, sta passando da Vodafone, a Fastweb... (E' nella fase, 15 giorni lavorativi per il cambio di gestore) potrebbe significare qualcosa?</p>

<p>"nel momento in cui si registra, e prova a riascoltarsi, non riesce a sentire la sua voce"...(stile fantasma che non riflette la sua immagine sullo specchio)... "lui ha smesso di sentirmi, ma io sentivo lui..." ... Ma sei sicuro che tuo fratello sia reale?
 Dai scherzo naturalmente(però sarebbe un'idea per un "sesto senso 2"). </p>
<p>Comunque è capitato anche a me le prime volte che giocavo con mio fratello in chat privata ed era sempre uno che non riusciva, a un certo punto, a sentire l'altro. Abbiamo risolto avvalendoci del microfono della Kinetics. Però se fosse un problema del gestore
 telefonico(diverso o in scadenza che sia) non dovrebbe creare gli stessi problemi anche con la Kinetics? A quel punto visto che mancano 15 giorni ti conviene aspettare per vedere se quella del cambio gestore potrebbe essere una potenziale causa e nel frattempo
 insistere per vedere se vi da lo stesso problema (magari provando a giocare sia nelle ore di punta che in quelle meno intasate).</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 freezes only when connected to WiFi.</h2>
                    <p>I have been using windows 10 since it has come out, and have experienced no issues until now. A few weeks ago, my computer started freezing now and again, but now its worse, and freezing will occur about a minute after i connect to wifi, and nothing works.
 I have to hold down the power button to turn it off. I know its not my particular wifi network, because other ones cause this problem as well. If i turn on my computer and use airplane mode, no freezing occurs . &nbsp;I have done windows defender scans for viruses,
 and apparently i dont have any. I have tried resetting my computer several times, but it goes through about 30% each time and then stops. Please if any one has any ideas on what to do , let me know.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Sound and video freeze after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Hello, not dear Microsoft</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since upgrading to Windows 10 I have been getting sound/video freezes for around 1 second followed with buzzing sound. It is VERY VERY VERY widespread issue . I updated the **** out of the system &nbsp;- nothing helps.&nbsp;<br />
Now I am home and installed Win 10 on my PC - and guess what - SAME thing is happening.<br />
<br />
Are you actually going to resolve this issue or not? You can just go to google/reddit/tech forum and you will see that is a problem since the launch of Windows 10. HOW CAN I FIX IT?</p>

This is not due to a driver issue.<br />
I have tried all this before on both laptop and dekstop - it does not help.

<span>1. Put MY profile on my son's console, passworded so he cannot use my profile. HIS console will be listed as my HOME console (so that my digital versions of FM5 and FH2 and all DLC will be available to him). This way he won't need to use the discs anymore.</span><br />

 my profile OWNS the license for it, but HIS console is my "home" console with the license on it?</span><br />

 issues with it. Thanks!</span></p>

            <p>If you're in the same household, this is exactly how the system was intended.</p>
<p>You will both be able to be online and playing the same game at the same time doing this - you could even be playing multiplayer together.</p>
<p>Note: remote downloads will download to your Home console. So if you buy a game, it will automatically download to your son's console (your Home), whether he wants it or not. If you want to download it on your own console, you have to trigger it manually. That is the only issue you will run into. If you have a bandwidth/download cap for the month, this is worth being aware of if all games are getting downloaded twice.</p>

    <title>Folder customization changes randomly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folder customization changes randomly</h2>
                    <p>I set my folder views to a certain view: details, group by type and sort by date modified. Why is it I can hit the apply to all folders button this view, all my folders look the same, I can literally open and close the folder and it has the same view, I
 can do this everyday for weeks and months on end, it will look the same but sometimes, randomly it will destroy my views; I open and nothing is not grouped, nothing is in details layout and nothing is sorted by date modified. When we have an operating system
 that is truly dynamic and not static at all, one where the OS does not care at all about the user nor the user settings, how can this be considered a great or useful operating system. How? I RDP every single day into my computers and just randomly it asked
 me to add the cert to the cache. If I log in every day to that PC via RDP, why is randomly asking me this? How can any one agree with this? I make settings and it should stay that way until I say so, not when microsoft decides.</p>

    <title>Story of my account being stolen, and wondering if there literally is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Story of my account being stolen, and wondering if there literally is anything that can be done.</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, So. I've been through Microsoft phone support several times on this matter, and came out with a different outcome each time. So I'm deciding to post here and get the community's opinion (Aside from me being a complete and total idiot for doing what
 I did!) on the situation.</p>
<p>Sometime in August of 2009, I was in a Gears of War 2 ranked match with a clan I had been a member of since about the 3rd month after I signed up for xbox live (I signed up roughly in summer or 07 or 08, it's been a long, bumpy ride since then but I do know
 it's one of those two.) We of course competed in Game Battles matches and everything, so I thought everyone that was associated with us were decent and good people.</p>
<p>This was most certainly not the case.</p>
<p>That night, we picked up someone with the gamertag <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>(There might've been x's, again you'll have to trust me about some of the inbetween.) who had seemed pretty cool. Him and I synced up together pretty well as a team and we got
 to casually chattering for about 3 hours while we played. Well, I eventually learned him and I were no more than a 40 minute drive from each other. I also learned that he was a pretty popular GB/MLG player known as<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>
<p>We gamed for a few more hours and I went from using the Lancer to using my golden hammerburst. This of course got his interest and he wanted it. Well, I had known about the glitch where you could glitch your golden hammerburst to another persons account.
 So we decided we'd try it. I redeemed the <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> account and did the glitch, told him to redeem it. He checked. Nothing. So, we decided to try him redeeming my account and we tried him downloading the DLC then doing the glitch, and
 me re-redeeming the account after he tried it. He tried it again, nothing. So instead of re-downloading the account right from the get go, I decided I'd let him stay on my account for a bit longer. (Couldn't hurt, right? Back then K/D was everything to me,
 and this guy was apparently a professional level player. So I didn't see anything to lose.)</p>

<p>Well, the night went on a bit longer. I signed onto my second account (xMemoryDeadx) and we played Wingman. Things were really fun for a bit. Then our clan leader got on and we decided to pick him up and go play some regular matches. After about half an
 hour of that, my girlfriend called me like she did every other night. It was a long distance relationship, so the calling like that was slightly understandable to me. Anyways, I told them I'd be back in a few hours and signed offline. Sadly this was one of
 the nights where I ended up falling asleep as soon as I hung up the phone.</p>
<p>So, that next morning I wake up and go to redeem my account. And I was told the password and/or email was invalid. I checked everything and tried it again? Same error. That was about when I realized "Common! Did I really just get played like that?!" and
 get pretty angry.</p>
<p>Now, one thing I didn't mention earlier is that this wasn't my first run in with getting my account hacked. There had been a simular situation before were my friend who liked to
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> with me often decided to steal it and act like he was an old friend of mine whom I ended the friendship with on bad terms. So I called support at that time and told them everything that had happened,I was told
<strong>by an xbox live support agent&nbsp;that my account couldn't be recovered if I just handed over the password to them.</strong>&nbsp;This being the case were I didn't fully hand over the account on my own free will, the agent did not seem to care and seemed to
 think I was lieing to him, despite me validating that the I was the account owner, but he did place a lock onto the account. About half a week later the friend revealed to me that he was just messing with me and gave me the email and password to get the account
 back.</p>
<p>So, after that experience. I found it pointless to call and wait forever to reach a conclusion with an agent after what the previous agent had told me from the earlier experience. I just made a new account and continued from there.</p>
<p>Well, Around March of last year, I decided to get the case started up again and call support, after learning that even if you get screwed over in a situation simular to mine, there would be roughly a 90% chance of getting the account back. So naturally,
 I was pretty excited! I had put alot of work into that account, and couldn't wait to get back on it.</p>
<p>Well, after several phonecalls with support and several yelling sessions over xbox live with the guy that actually jacked the account, I got put on the phone with who I would assume was an highly ranking supervisior, and I was notified that the xbox live
 code stated that situations such as these had to be reported within a year of occuring for me to be able to get the account back.</p>
<p>I, having only been 13-14 when I first signed up for xbox live, didn't read the terms and agreements before signing up. I don' believe many people do. (To the people that do, kudos to you. You're definitely a wiser man than I.)</p>
<p>With the release of Halo 4 nearing, I've found myself really wanting to jump back into the xbox action. But after all these years it still doesn't feel the same without the account that I put so much effort into.</p>
<p>Does anyone have anything to say that might can assist the situation? I feel as if I've been mislead by the agents and do still feel like an idiot myself for what occured.</p>

<p>I am glad to see the community is as friendly as ever. But regardless, I do indeed believe this is a lesson learned. Nor was I aware that attempting to share a DLC that was given away for free as a preorder bonus was as serious as marketplace theft, or was
 accountable for an Perma-Ban.</p>
<p>I did admit to the situation being stupid, as I started several times in my first post that my stupidity had been realized and any further mention of it was rather off the direction I intended for the thread to go.</p>
<p>I do believe this will still classify under account theft, as it was taken from me and not returned. It's the same concept of being that guy who ask to borrow things but never returns them. Hacked is something it wouldn't be, however I believed either of
 which would attract the same members of the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope you all are having a great day/evening by the way, everyone. =/</p>

<p>In what point did I ever ask for sympathy from anyone? I just asked for you guys input on what I could do with the situation, and what would be wise to do. Not about how I *** up, where I *** up, and how stupid I was for doing it. Thank you for the quote
 from CoC.</p>
<p>Anyways, though I wasn't 100% sure if the apparent super visor is I was talking to didn't have their facts messed up either, and if there was something that still could've been done about it despite the violation of the CoC.</p>
<p>And what do I expect you to say? You input without being a cynical jerk about it. You know, what society tends to expect.</p>

<p>I never claimed that I should be given an advantage because I was young and ignored the CoC either, I just stated that as my reason for not reading it. Would've been pretty dumb to not have given a reason, last thing I need is to make myself look even more
 stupid. And further more, I believe your opinion on long distance relationships and MLG's players, along with their fans should stay out of the thread. Though I'm certain we'll come to agreement on anything involving MLG. (I stopped playing XBL for a reason,
 Keep in mind this was back in 2009. Alot can change.)</p>
<p>Anyways, Going to go ahead and request a thread lock for any of you moderators viewing. Things are heading south.</p>

<h2>            Windows Wordpad Application has stopped working &#40;while switching to landscape&#41;</h2>
                    <p>While attempting to print envelopes, I was doing page set up. Went File&gt;Page Setup&gt;Size: Envelope #10&gt;Orientation: Landscape. As soon as I do that I get this message: Windows Wordpad Application has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working
 correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available. Is there anything I can do for this or is Wordpad not an option for printing on envelopes?</p>

<p>Hello Jerod,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outdated printer drivers is the normal cause of issues in printing files, such as envelopes. Just to confirm, may we know if you already tried running the
<strong>Apps troubleshooter</strong> found on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>? This tool
 will allow you to diagnose and resolve most of the known issues in using applications that are already installed on your computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, updating, uninstalling, and reinstalling the printers drivers can be done to rectify this. To do so, see this article:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Update drivers in Windows 10</strong></a> for the list of procedures on how you can successfully accomplish the above processes. These methods will help us identify the appropriate drivers to run in your system to prevent any issues that may arise while
 maximizing the performance of your printer machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above instructions won't work, we highly advise getting and installing the most recent printer drivers from your manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting here for the update of your troubleshooting.</p>

<p>I've had this exact same issue and spent nearly 6 hours on and off the phone with HP support, not including the time I've spent on my own trying to resolve the Wordpad crash. Unless it's exclusive to specific printers, the driver updating does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most recently, and independently, I uninstalled my HP Inkjet Pro 8720 and tested Wordpad, and the program functions just fine! However, after reinstalling the printer software (this round, I elected to install using the original installation disc rather
 than the online option which I had previously tested out numerous times), Wordpad is back to crashing over and over again when shifting the orientation from portrait to landscape.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my calls with HP support, computer and printer software was updated, include the printer drivers, things were repeatedly uninstalled and reinstalled, and reboots and restores were endless (one restore, available from April 19, actually caused major issues
 with my computer, restricting me from even being able to access my login...which I had to figure out how to override on my own with an older restore from April 10 because HP support had closed down for the night; thanks for the heads up.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is extraordinarily obnoxious. Not only have I burned hours of my time trying to figure out an issue that even HP support hasn't been able to resolve, but it's left me stranded to complete a print project for a client, and I am still left with a non-functioning,
 basic Microsoft program.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Windows 7 SP1 is provided in two ways, either as a full .ISO file download weighing in at<strong> 2.4 GBs
</strong>or as an update available through Windows Update. The .ISO file contains SP1 code for different processor architectures such as x86, x86-x64 and Itanium systems. Because I have a mixture of 32 and 64 bit systems, I went with the .ISO file. Whichever
 method you choose, here are some tips for ensuring a smooth installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>* Getting Windows Update errors with Windows 7 SP1? MS notes "inconsistencies," provides fix:
</span><a href="http://is.gd/22brle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://is.gd/22brle</span></a></p>
<span>
<p>* 1. Click on Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories, and right-click on Command Prompt.</p>
<p>2. Choose Run As and select an Administrator account.</p>
<p>3. At the command prompt, type net stop cryptsvc and wait for the service to stop.</p>
<p>4. Type CD\ and press Enter.</p>
<p>5. Type CD windows\system32 and press Enter.</p>
<p>6. Type ren catroot2 catroot3 and press Enter.</p>
<p>Other solutions:</p>
<p>1. Make sure you install the latest updates for Windows 7, your applications and device drivers. This can ensure a smooth experience I noticed, although Windows 7 SP1 is minor, you don’t want to take any chances. If you are updating through Windows Update,
 it also guarantees a smaller update since only missing patches will be applied.</p>
<p>2. Backup – you can never go wrong with backing up; this is something you should do often even when you are not making major changes to your computer. Windows 7 has made it very easy tobackup your computer . The built in system imaging and backup and restore
 center makes it convenient to back up the operating system and all your critical data. In fact, I used this to test the beta and RC releases of SP1 on my production system. This method carried its risks, but at least I knew my RTM installation was safely backed
 up and tucked away from pre-release code.</p>
</span>
<p><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/</span></a></p>
<span>
<p>3. Don’t do it during a major project, if you have something you are working on at the moment on your computer or in the middle of an assignment or work related project which you might need your PC for, don’t install the Service Pack right away. Do it in
 your off time, such as on the weekend or when you know you can leave your PC while it installs itself automatically. My installation took over 2 hours.</p>
<p>4. This brings me to another point, which is, don’t install SP1 on a laptop on battery power, it’s a CPU intensive task and will use up most of your battery power. So make sure your laptop is connected to power. For desktop users, I strongly recommend you
 have a UPS connected, you just don’t know when the unexpected can occur. You might just be in the last lap of completing the 2 hour installation and lose power.</p>
<p>5. Disable your Antivirus, I remember installing the SP1 beta with Microsoft Security Essentials version 1 installed and received an error that my Antivirus is not compatible. Although this was resolved, your experience might vary. I haven’t experienced
 the issue in the RTM code although I am running Microsoft Security Essentials version 2. Someone reported receiving an error message about Forefront Client Security not allowing the Service Pack to install. The recommendation is to disable Forefront which
 is based on the same core scanning engine as MSE or make sure you at least have the latest version of Forefront client security installed.</p>
<p>6. Another thing you should do is a clean boot before installing the Service Pack, you can do this by:</p>
<p>* Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>* Accept User Account Control permission</p>
<p>* If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</p>
<p>* On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</p>
<p>* Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</p>
<p>* Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</p>
<p>* Click OK.</p>
<p>* When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>* After the computer starts, proceed with the installation.</p>
<p>7. Another task you should try is to check your hard disk for errors:</p>
<p>* Click Start</p>
<p>* Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD</p>
<p>* Click ‘Run as Administrator’</p>
<p>* At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f</p>
<p>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</p>

                    <p>System restore to pre KB install resolve the issue but looking at the time stamps of other KB CU install's and the fact I had to use a restore point two back it maybe that it was another KB causing the issue. And FYI forced driver update that seems to have
 been the fix for others didn't work in this case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this however is the third time in 30 days that this machine has been bricked by different windows update not very good is it?...</p>
<p>1 x AV related</p>
<p>1 x HDD boot sector issue</p>
<p>And now this..</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Current working winver is 16299.192&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now unfortunately this is a windows home PC so I can't defer / pause updates unless I decide to break win updates (which sucks, this shouldn't be necessary)</p>
<p>So I've created a restore point and we'll see if it happens again after the next install of updates hopefully MS can fix there s**ty updates..</p>
<p>
</p><p>To many tickets relating to 1709 upgrade QC has to be improved at MS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dave</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the update re applied itself again as the deferred timeout period had been reached, I has hoping you might have fixed the underlying issues but alas the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have submitted the data as requested, I'll remove the update and try to stop its for coming back..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another week another bug report.. :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>20 years I've been in IT and this last year I've reported more bugs to MS than in the 19 years before it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whoever is in charge of QC at MS needs taking outside and chaining to the dog house!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Better still bring back versioning so we can all avoid these new 'features' which seem to be causing no end of issues..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see the windows 10 name being so poisonous soon that you'll have to bring in windows 11 just to stop the rot..&nbsp;</p>

<p>You should be able to uninstall the KB cumulative updates individually. Go to Apps and Features and select Programs and Features and the View installed updates. Select one and then uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think it was a driver update then you can select to not install driver updates but that will affect all drivers. If your device is supported by HP for Windows 10 then only use their drivers. In Control Panel select System and then Advanced system
 settings. Select the Hardware tab and then Device installation settings change the settings to No.</p>

<p>This is not an isolated issue!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>KB4074588 bricked USB device support on my system killing my keyboard and making everything difficult.&nbsp; At least my mouse still worked so I could use the onscreen keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is a custom build dual Xeon E5-2670 Asus Z9PA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going back to 2/14 Restore did nothing just moved me from not being able to use my USB keyboard to now getting BSoD with&nbsp;Windows Stop Code 0xc000021a.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Spent 45 mins with a tech support agent on chat, after a 45min wait to speak to them, only to have them have connectivity issues to the chat and round we go again to having 65 people ahead of me now. Got a call back, then routed to a technician.&nbsp; After 25
 mins on hold, gave up.</p>
<p>Microsoft used to be great for support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to get the system to restore by going back to 2/4 restore point, no thanks to Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>My machine is an elder ASUS X72VSeries&nbsp; (X72Vn) notebook, that I used since 2010 (8 years!) now. It is modified with a Samsung SSD and a Sony BlueRay burner. ... I am a former software developer, who had developed tools for Win95-WinXP. - So I think, I am
 not a rookie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything worked without problems, until last year: November/December 2017. - First I got a "boot-hanger" blue-screen, because of one of Microsofts KB-updates, Then in January 2018 the same, because of another regular update. - I needed to uninstall the
 update manually and very complicated - and if I did not have Acronis Backup, I could reinstall Windows 10 every month from the beginning! ;-) - Now with KB4074588 this is for me the 3rd time I need to restore a complete partition C: backup from Acronis, for
 to get access to my cryptocurrency USB-stick again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think, the next things I will do are: 1.) Selling all Microsoft shares I have, 2.) Buying at the first time, since 1986, not a new PC, but an Apple Mac. 3.) Changing everything substantial for my working into MacOS software, which will not fail every month!
 ... I am 51 years old now. I don't think that I ever will return to Microsoft or Windows!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bye! :-(</p>

<p>This is true, and I am only commenting to support the issues everyone else is having, in hopes it may expedite a further patch.&nbsp;<br />
Currently, I am still and just now getting INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE issues, forcing me to image several laptops at a time, in a healthcare organization where downtime cannot be an option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, KB4074588 is the single-handed culprit in disabling USB/HID devices.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once uninstalled, these devices return to functioning normally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I don't mind so much that these problems arise, as patches tend to come fairly quickly, but I do mind being unable to control whether I want to receive updates or not, as it appears I am stuck fixing the same issue when it happens (these are happening AT
 RANDOM, and sometimes solo, and sometimes in waves).&nbsp;</p>

            Interestingly the patch reapplied last night and this time USB is functioning perfectly. Suggest folks get back to prior restore point and consider whether to reapply update.

<p>FIXED FIXED FIXED FIXED FIXED FIXED FIXED FIXED FIXED FIXED </p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot 1st before trying these methods. Some methods may have to be performed remotely because your friggin USB ports aren't working. Method 4 is the method for when nothing else can be done.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:</p>
<p>Windows Key + R</p>
<p>appwiz.cpl</p>
<p>View installed updates</p>
<p>Look for update KB4074588 (OS Build 16299.248)</p>
<p>Right Click it. Uninstall it. DO NOT REBOOT YET.</p>
<p>Windows Key + R</p>
<p>ms-settings:</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>Click Windows Update</p>
<p>Scroll way down to the bottom</p>
<p>There are possibly 3 options</p>
<p>Change them all to the max number of days</p>
<p>365 days for top option</p>
<p>30 days for security updates option</p>
<p>Pause updates (slider bar to turn it on)</p>
<p>None of this is recommended by Microsoft for Security purposes</p>
<p>All of it is recommended by MILE Technologies (us) for functionality and business continuity.</p>
<p>Reboot</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: (if Method 1 does not work)</p>
<p>Windows Key + R</p>
<p>rstrui</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>Restore to a date before the Windows Update</p>
<p>Windows Key + R</p>
<p>ms-settings:</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>Click Windows Update</p>
<p>Scroll way down to the bottom</p>
<p>There are possibly 3 options</p>
<p>Change them all to the max number of days</p>
<p>365 days for top option</p>
<p>30 days for security updates option</p>
<p>Pause updates (slider bar to turn it on)</p>
<p>None of this is recommended by Microsoft for Security purposes</p>
<p>All of it is recommended by MILE Technologies (us) for functionality and business continuity.</p>
<p>Reboot</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: (if Method 1 or 2 doesn't appeal or work)</p>
<p>Windows Key </p>
<p>cmd&nbsp; (just type cmd without thinking and the following will happen)</p>
<p>Command Prompt will become visible (Right Click it and choose Run As Administrator)</p>
<p>dism /online /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~16299.248.1.17</p>
<p>Press Enter (Return)</p>
<p>It will ask you to reboot ANSWER NO for now.</p>
<p>Windows Key + R</p>
<p>ms-settings:</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>Click Windows Update</p>
<p>Scroll way down to the bottom</p>
<p>There are possibly 3 options</p>
<p>Change them all to the max number of days</p>

<p>None of this is recommended by Microsoft for Security purposes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>Method 4: (last resort if all heck breaks loose)</p>
<p>Crash the computer a few times on purpose</p>
<p>Get to the Windows Automatic Repair screen</p>
<p>Advanced options</p>
<p>Command Prompt</p>
<p>dism /online /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~16299.248.1.17</p>
<p>Press Enter (Return)</p>
<p>It will ask you to reboot ANSWER&nbsp;Yes</p>
<p>After reboot, you may have to remove the update again using Method 1</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is almost the same fix for INACCESSIBLE BOOT DEVICE from&nbsp;another package name Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~16299.214.1.17 as well and January issues from another package Package_for_RollupFix~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~16299.192.1.9 Use
 these using Method 4 and substitute these package names for the one listed in Method 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been an instance that repeats the issue another user had called STOP 0xc000021a where a system restore caused this issue. I think that was caused by running a system restore PRIOR to a completion of a successful patch update. That's why the reboot
 first option is best.</p>

<p>Having the same issue, 2 PCs today lost mouse and/or keyboard functionality as a result of KB4074588. 1 Dell, 1 HP. The only common denominator that I know of currently is that both have Samsung 850 EVO SSD's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the second Windows 10 buggy update in a few weeks that has crippled multiple PCs, the other being KB4056892. Did they just stop testing updates over there?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: Restoring the system to pre-<span>KB4074588 brought USB functionality back. In both cases I then reinstalled&nbsp;</span><span>KB4074588 via Windows Update and did not experience the issue again.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE2: It happened on a 3rd PC, same HP model as before but this one has a Hitachi HTS723232A7A365 HDD, so nothing to do with the Samsung SSDs. I removed&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">KB4074588 and rebooted only to get the&nbsp;</span>INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE
 error. I had to do a system restore to several days ago to get it to boot. Once booted Windows Update reinstalled updates, including&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">KB4074588. Mouse/keyboard were working normally after that.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>UPDATE3: 4th PC affected. Uninstalled </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">KB4074588 and rebooted successfully. Reinstalled updates including&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">KB4074588
 and USB ports were working again.</span></p>

<p>Just an FYI, on this not being an isolated incident. I had this problem last week. It specifically nuked my external USB keyboard and mouse. The system is a Lenovo T530 laptop. Other USB devices (e.g. cameras, IPad, 4 port hub) all worked correctly. I swapped
 out the keyboard and the mouse with different hardware (Keyboard switched from Saitek-&gt;HP, mouse switched from Logitech-&gt;Dell) and went through a pretty exhaustive cycle of trying to update device drivers which was fruitless. Ultimately, uninstalling&nbsp;<span>KB4074588
 fixed the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also am finding the lack of user control over this process to be pretty unfortunate. Since I can't elect to not update, I'm now forced into
 realistically thinking about Windows as a ticking time bomb which I cannot rely on to function correctly on any given morning. I can't even turn of the broken thing which I uninstalled, it's already dying to apply itself again. I will eventually run out of
 options for delaying it. The bright side, if you want to call it that, is that I will know exactly how to remove it again instead of spending an entire day trying to get my system working correctly. Ubuntu is definitely on my short list as a more permanent
 solution if this type of nonsense keeps happening.</span></p>

<p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>i was happy to see my old favourite fallout three on backwards compatibilit, I have the newest one plus I already owned the old version and thought I'd download and play that for a while and I found out that none of my expansions for this game are available
 for some reason I have to go and completely re purchase everything again, now I know it's a reduced price compared to what it used to be, but as I have the, already I shouldn't be buying them again should I, how can I get them on my Xbox I have my old data
 saved to cloud, I also have shelves of old 360 with expansions like all the cod games will I have this no expansions available with them to when they become available on backwards compatible, I'm sure in the future oblivion and sky rim will be backwards compatible
 as well and again I have all the expansions alread and I don't want to fork out and again and again till this problem has been solved, so please can you can help with before I try all my other games form the old 360. Tyvm&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the expansions are on a disc, then just put the disc in, and the expansions will install as if you were installing an Xbox one game. &nbsp;If they are digitally owned, then you need to move to fallout 3, press menu on the Xbox controller &amp; select manage game.
 &nbsp;Your add-ons should show up ready to be installed.</p>

<p>I de mothballed the old 360 San I went to hat to upload it into the storage cloud so I can download it in to my Xbox one like it was suggested and it won't comply because there's limited cloud space and each of the expansions for the fallout here game are
 a few gigs more than there is on the cloud to store them so it won't do that for me which is annoying I know, but I can't seem to find a way around it and I can't access more cloud storage (as in buy in any) just stuck where I am and it's £3.40 for each of
 the expansions on the Xbox and I really don't want to have to buy them over again, anŷ chance for some help getting a little furtehr a long, I have tried one at a time I have and I have tried bulk and I have even be in there and manually done it but to no
 avail for some reason, thanks for taking time to help with this ongoing hitch.</p>

<p>Hey there LeClair l10l!</p>
<p>In order for you to receive assistance with retrieving your Fallout 3 code, you will need to make a post in the Promotions and Special Offers Forum. Thanks in advance!&nbsp;</p>

<p>No I cannot see any of my downloaded expansions for fallout three, I have my save game data which is just my character and how far I have gotten and what I have done ect, it keeps taking me to the page to download them and to do that I have to pay, there
 is no way there to download them for free, and I'm pretty sure it's going to do the exact same thing when I put my old call of duty and call of duty black ops one, I've already got the map packs and we all know how much the cost it's not right that we should
 have to buy them again, I was really hoping that everything would be there to download for my fallout 3 game so I could just jump right in from the beginning again.</p>

<p>Is it possible you purchased the expansions with another account on your Xbox 360? That would explain why they aren't showing up on your Xbox One. </p>

<p>Hello there, </p>
<p>Thanks for the reply, no I haven't changed the account at its been the same account I have had since my Xbox then the 360 and onto my Xbox one, I've always had my Xboxes for as far back as I can remember and I still have all the old games for them too :)
 some favourite games don't carry over or get expanded or remade like the old knight of the old republic, and older Star Wars one, all the years of the conflict series of games and every call of duty and so on I have huge boxes and containers and bookcases
 full of them, the only thing is with this many games and consoles is deciding what to play lol, I hope you can help with the fallout expansions :)

<p>Just to check, do you see the content over in your Download History by following the steps on <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/downloadable-content/view-download-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this page</a>?

<h2>            I am unable to access the internet on Windows XP.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
My name is Tommy and I need help. My desktop computer shows that it is connected to the internet, but when I try to use any application that requires the internet (i.e firefox, chrome, league of legends, etc.) I get a "connection error"/webpage cannot be reached.
 The internet works on my parents computer as well as my sisters, so I don't think it is a problem with the router(although they are using wifi). My firewall will not turn on either. I tried a winsock reset, but to no avail.&nbsp; I ran a couple of virus scans,
 and finally found a trojan.muldrop sitting in my System Volume Information folder, and I deleted it with CureIt by Dr.Web. After deleting the virus, my computer still will not access internet, and I can't turn on my firewall. Please help if possible!<br />
thanks!</p>

<h2>            Windows cannot find &#39;wuapp.exe&#39; issue in Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>I just installed Windows 10 Pro (Fresh install, not an upgrade), and I get the 2 following annoying behaviors:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When selecting the&nbsp;Internet Explorer menu: Tools-&gt;Windows Update, I get the following error dialog:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82bab1b4-3e4b-4ddd-86dd-ada50375d94c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Searching for "Windows Update" does not return the appropriate Windows Update module, just Web links:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6fb966fd-713a-4d1b-abd2-39302563a4a5" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix these annoying behaviors?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: The question is not about how to access the Windows&nbsp;Update module, this can be easily done through the Settings screen.</p>
<p>

            Windows Update (wuapp.exe) has been removed from the "Control Panel" and is now in the Win10 "Setting" menu. This is probably why the link to Windows Update in IE11 "Safety" tool bar item is broken or wuapp.exe has been replaced all together.

<br />Do you have an application named 'work group inc' listed there?

<p>
</p><p>If you are able to provide the Skype version number, please let us know. You can see the version number of Skype in the description upon downloading it.</p>

 it is written only this...."this version of skype is only available for Windows 10. If you are running an older version of Windows ..."</p>
<p>I'm not running an older version of windows....and i could not launch it !</p>

            <p>This is disappointing. Windows Live Mail 2012&nbsp;had a serious problem trying to send emails to a group (category). Because of this, we back graded to 2011 which works fine. This was discussed at the time on community, probably 2 years ago, but no solution
 was forthcoming. Hence the nervousness to upgrade to 2012 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was very hit or miss which members of the category actually received the emails, and was random. Next time, different people would receive them. There were no error messages either so manual checking was the only control mechanism.
