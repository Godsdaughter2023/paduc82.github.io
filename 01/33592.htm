            Nothing can be installed on Windows RT that is outside the Windows Store. Only&nbsp;apps and programs from the&nbsp;Windows Store can be installed. To install iCloud, you can upgrade your&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;Version to Windows 8, 8.1, or 10. This is also recommended because
 Windows RT is not supported anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Shared folders in Win 7 Ultimate Not Visible On Network PCs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beng lai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shared folders in Win 7 Ultimate Not Visible On Network PCs</h2>
                    
<p>Previously I have a Win 2000 PC that I shared folders to users over the network and users can view the shared folders in My Network Places.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently I upgrade this PC to Win 7 Ultimate. Shared subfolders are not visible anymore to the network users. I will have to share the entire main folder in order to make all the subfolders visible.</p>
<p>This is inefficient as different users need to access different subfolders based on their needs.</p>
<p>The other PCs in the network are running Win XP Home/Pro.</p>
<p>What need to be done?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>

<p><em><strong>---------------------<br />
</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The following looks like a long story because I do not know what the user level of knowledge is and what was already done.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>The info goes through the motions of configuring and checking most of the common aspects of Windows OS' LAN features.</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>----------------------</strong> </em></p>
<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network has <strong>three</strong> types of Sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup Network</strong> = Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Work Network</strong> = Basically similar to the previous methods of sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing</strong> = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a Network with the same name while each computer has its own unique name.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted
 Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted<br />
</a><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd
 party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p>------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>If your network is comprised of Win 7 only and you want a simple Network, use this.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/videos/sharing-files-with-homegroup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/videos/sharing-files-with-homegroup</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After configuring the Homegroup scroll down to the <strong>Permission/Security section.</strong></p>
<p>-----------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Networking&nbsp;Win 7 with other version of Windows as&nbsp; Work Network.</strong></p>
<p>In the Network Center, clicking on the Network type opens the window to the right.</p>
<p>Choose your type of Network. Notice the check mark at the bottom, and check/uncheck it according to your needs.</p>

<h2>            Why do Windows &#34;updates&#34; only ever do more harm to my computer than good&#63;</h2>
                    Every time I install a Windows update, it seems to mess something up in my computer, that had worked immediately before installing the new software...
<div>and what's more, it removes my restoration point and replaces it with a new one at the time that the software was installed...</div>
<div>-DESIGN FLAW-</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So either Microsoft update team have no idea what they're doing, or they are giving us viruses in Windows updates?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Keep in mind, this isn't a one-off thing. This happens EVERY DAMN TIME I install new updates from Microsoft.</div>

            Hi!<br />
<br />
I have NO answer to why the updates lately seem to be really buggy - I'm just a user like you.<br />
<br />
BUT:<br />
a) you can increase the disk space that system protection can use for storage of restore points. The more you increase it, the more restore points are stored. If this setting is too small measured, restore points are overwritten with the newest ones :
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/how-much-disk-space-does-system-restore-require" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/how-much-disk-space-does-system-restore-require</a><br />
<br />
b) you could always wait a few days before you install the monthly updates, and look a little bit around in the internet if you see lots of other people popping up with update-problems....<br />
<br />
Best wishes for 2014! :)<br />

<h2>            BlueScreen Error for Win7&#59;  STOP&#58; 0x0000001E</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Dear Reader,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have recently purchased a used Toshiba Satellite, which I believe was upgraded from Vista to Win7 because it has a Vista sticker but on startup it says Windows 7 Home Premium. I was told that the&nbsp;battery life is uncertain. From experience, I saw the battery
 go from around 60% to 3%. I was updating something, I can't remember the name of it, and my laptop turned off. I immediately plugged in the laptop charger and turned the laptop back on. Every time I start the laptop I receive a blue screen after I sign in
 or before I sign in. At the bottom of the screen it says "Technical Information: *** STOP: 0x0000001E (0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000000) I can't run windows normally without the error. I am currently on Safe Mode with Networking.
 During start up I go to advanced options and the option at the top, can't remember the name, It says It will try to fix what's causing windows to shut down. That doesn't work, I've tried using windows recovery, that doesn't work, I get errors. Something popped
 up earlier saying, "</p>

<p><strong><br />
Remove ALL power and reseat all the cards, memory, and cables (both ends when<br />
possible)</strong> - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Those are for a PC and about all<br />
that can be done for a laptop is reseat the memory and clear the vents. Make sure the BIOS,<br />
low level chipset drivers, and major device drivers are all up to date by check manually at the<br />
makers' sites.</p>
<p><br />
Many Bluescreens are caused by&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and other major device drivers<br />
which are not the most current even though the computer is new. Check manually for updates<br />
using the methods for updates as&nbsp;indicated in the troubleshooter linked above and/or the
<br />
methods below (which are the same).<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 1E&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000001E <br />
<br />
Bug Check 0x1E: KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED<br />
<br />
</strong>The KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check has a value of 0x0000001E. This indicates that a kernel-mode program generated an exception which the error handler did not catch.</p>
<br />
Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code
<p><br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p><br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p><br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>

</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Cause</strong> </p>
<p><br />
This is a very common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT
<p>An unaligned data reference was encountered.</p>
</li><li>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT
<p>A breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.
</p>
</li><li>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION
<p>A memory access violation occurred. (Parameter 4 of the bug check is the address that the driver attempted to access.)</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the ntstatus.h file located in the inc directory of the Windows Driver Kit.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution </strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
If you are not equipped to debug this problem</strong>, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques. If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates. Try changing video adapters.
 Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.</p>
<p><strong><br />
If you plan to debug this problem</strong>, you may find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter 2 (the exception address) should pinpoint the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p><br />
If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, this indicates that a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system was started with the
<strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly, make sure a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the
<strong>/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p><br />
If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame will supply additional information.</p>
<p><br />
If the specific cause of the exception is unknown, the following should be considered:</p>
<p><strong><br />
Hardware incompatibility. </strong>First, make sure that any new hardware installed is compatible with the installed version of Windows. For example, you can get information about compatibility with Windows&nbsp;7 at the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=246806" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 Compatibility Center</a>.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Faulty device driver or system service. </strong>In addition, a faulty device driver or system service might be responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.</p>
<p><br />
If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file
 system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you need to start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.
</p>
<p><br />
If the problem is associated with Win32k.sys, the source of the error might be a third-party remote control program. If such software is installed, the service can be removed by starting the system using the Recovery Console and deleting the offending system
 service file.</p>
<p><br />
Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x1E. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS might also resolve the error. You should also run hardware diagnostics, especially
 the memory scanner, supplied by the system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.
</p>
<p><br />
The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is a system BIOS incompatibility. BIOS problems can be resolved by upgrading the system BIOS version.<br />
<br />
<strong>To get a stack trace if the normal stack tracing procedures fail </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff551943(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>kb (Display Stack Backtrace)</strong></a> command to display parameters in the stack trace. Look for the call to
<strong>NT!PspUnhandledExceptionInSystemThread</strong>. (If this function is not listed, see the note below.)</p>
</li><li>The first parameter to <strong>NT!PspUnhandledExceptionInSystemThread</strong> is a pointer to a structure, which contains pointers to an
<strong>except</strong> statement:
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Copy </div>
<div>
<div>typedef struct _EXCEPTION_POINTERS { PEXCEPTION_RECORD ExceptionRecord; PCONTEXT ContextRecord; } EXCEPTION_POINTERS, *PEXCEPTION_POINTERS; ULONG PspUnhandledExceptionInSystemThread( IN PEXCEPTION_POINTERS ExceptionPointers )
<p>Use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff542790(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>dd (Display Memory)</strong></a> command on that address to display the necessary data.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>The first retrieved value is an exception record and the second is a context record. Use the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff563043(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>.exr (Display Exception Record)</strong></a> command and the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff562301(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>.cxr (Display Context Record)</strong></a> command with these two values as their arguments, respectively.</p>
</li><li>
<p>After the <strong>.cxr</strong> command executes, use the <strong>kb</strong> command to display a stack trace that is based on the context record information. This stack trace indicates the calling stack where the unhandled exception occurred.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This procedure assumes that you can locate <strong>NT!PspUnhandledExceptionInSystemThread</strong>. However, in some cases (such as an access violation crash) you will not be able to do this. In that case, look for
<strong>ntoskrnl!KiDispatchException</strong>. The third parameter passed to this function is a trap frame address. Use the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff565491(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>.trap (Display Trap Frame)</strong></a> command with this address to set the Register Context to the proper value. You can then perform stack traces and issue other commands.

You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen. <br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and provide a link to it so we can analyze it.
<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (Check for BIOS and driver<br />
updates.)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set VIEW
<br />
to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names. (Also update
<br />
the BIOS and&nbsp;chipset drivers.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and
<br />
then go look for new ones manually if you wish.</p>

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

                    My Wife's Dell Window 7 Laptop informed her two days ago that it had 11 updates when she was closing it down, 4 of 11 ran for 3 hours and eventually we&nbsp; unplugged&nbsp; it, when reopened today&nbsp;it stated Installing 4 of 11 then it shut down within a few minutes
 by itself. My wife then opened it again and it worked normal untill my wife tried to close it and it then stated it was installing 1 of 8, &nbsp;it is still there now on 1 of 8 after 3.5 hours - any clues anyone??

            <p>Hi, Allen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If given the option, always cancel the update but do not shutdown or unplug the unit as this could cause serious damage when updating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Windows Update</p>
<p>Click on View Update History</p>

<p>Retry updates</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you have multiple updates, select two and install them.&nbsp; Reboot if necessary.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Return to Windows updates and select one or two more.&nbsp; </p>
<p>You can also download the updates through microsoft.com and manually install them.</p>

<h3> dannystpauls  say:</h3>
<h2>            External speakers have suddenly stopped working</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>
<p>(Windows 7 64 bit, Dell T7400)</p>
<p>I had a pair of external speakers plugged in which were working fine. At first, Windows was telling me that there were no external speakers, then I ran the trouble shooter, and it enabled/activated something, then the speakers started working. That was OK
 for a couple of days, then I unplugged the speakers and used them on another computer. When I plugged them back in to the Dell, Windows would again tell me that there weren't any speakers plugged in.</p>
<p>When I run the Audio Troubleshooter, it tells me that</p>
<p>"Both the Windows Audio and the Windows Audio End Point Builder services must be running for audio to work correctly. Atleast one of these services isn't running."</p>
<p>However, I have checked in the "Services" Utility (services.msc) and it says these services have been started (Automatic and Local System). So are all the "Dependencies, DCOM, RPC Endpoint Mapper, ect, ..)</p>
<p>Also, the Audio Troubleshooter, seems to be checking for "Headphones", not speakers.</p>
<p>Either way, it tells me that one of these 2 required services is not working, when the "Services" Utility tells me that they are.</p>
<p>Any clues/advice/tips. ..... would be appreciated</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Danny</p>

<p>Hi Dannystpauls,</p>
<p>This might be an issue with the drivers for the speaker. Try updating the drivers for the external speakers and check if that works without any issues.</p>
<p>Refer the link to update the drivers: Upd<strong>ate a driver for hardware that isn't working properly:
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</strong></a></p>
<p>You may also manually download the drivers for the speakers from the manufacturer’s website and install the same and check if that works without any issues.</p>
<p>Try connecting the speakers to a different computer and check if that works without any issues.</p>
<p>If it is working with other computer then you may try uninstalling the drivers and re-installing the drivers for the sound card and check if that works.</p>

<h3> garyleight  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you stop the forced update to the latest version of windows in the Windows 10 Home version &#63;</h2>
                    <div>Does anyone have a solution that actually works to stop Microsoft from forcing the update to the latest version of windows ?&nbsp; (I have tried several things already)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The version of windows I have on that computer is the Windows 10 Home version.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The "windows update" keeps forcing the download and install of the latest version of windows, so far everything I tried to stop it doesn't seem to work, every time I use the "recovery" to go back to my previous version of windows within about a day it
 forces the update again, and again and again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I wouldn't mind the latest version except that it wipes out my network adapter and nothing I tried fixed it&nbsp;EXCEPT going back to the previous version of windows.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Under "recovery" it even states if the latest version gives you problems go back to the previous version, but&nbsp;WHY do they&nbsp;have that option if they won't let you keep the previous version but insist on forcing the latest version over and over after every
 time you go back to the previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is getting very frustrating, it seems every day I do a recovery to my previous version of windows and every day Microsoft forces the update to the latest version which wipes out my network adapter (both wireless and Ethernet) and hence my ability to
 connect to the internet until I do a recovery back to the previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would very much prefer to stay with windows, but if I have to keep doing a recovery every day, day after day, to my previous version of windows, then I might seriously consider switching to the Linux OS.</p>
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Thanks !</p>

<p>
</p><p>Actually I prefer no updates at all because it is an older laptop that I only want to use&nbsp;Ethernet hardwired to the router to use Softether VPN server software.&nbsp;&nbsp; So fancy extra features are not needed on that computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like the old saying goes "If it ain't broke, don't fix it" and the latest version of windows wipes out my network adapter so I have to keep the latest update from installing and/or messing with my network adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried that download from your initial reply but it could not find anything to "hide".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did more research and found this web page that says you can stop windows from updating drivers using "<span>ExcludeWUDriversInQualityUpdate"
</span></p>
<p>so hopefully IF windows forces an update to the latest version of windows 10 it won't wipe out my network adapter.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I hope something works as I am getting very tired of using the recovery option EVERY day to keep restoring my previous version of windows so I can have my internet connection back again.</p>

<p>Well, I just checked that computer and its in the process of updating to the latest version of windows AGAIN !!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess tomorrow I'll see if it wiped out my network adapter yet again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY WHY WHY does Microsoft even have the "recovery" option to go back to your previous version of windows if the latest version is causing problems, when it does NOT let you stay on the previous version but updates you to the latest version again within
 a day ????????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried about 4 or 5 different possible solutions to stop the updates but NOTHING seems to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there some hidden secret files, surely there must be some way to stop this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody just tell me if it is IMPOSSIBLE to stop Microsoft&nbsp;from keeping on&nbsp;updating my earlier version of windows 10 to the latest version ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least that way I will know if I just have to give up on windows and switch to a Linux OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As much as I would prefer to stay with windows, I have to do a recovery to an earlier version of windows 10 EVERY DAY in order to get my network adapter (and internet access) back again.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for asking, it has been resolved as far as stopping the forced upgrade from my earlier version of windows 10 to the latest version of windows 10, but ideally I want to be able to resolve the problem of the latest version of windows 10 messing with
 my network adapter, I have some ideas to try when I have time as far as that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime I was able to stop the forced upgrade by setting my Ethernet connection to a metered connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish I did not have to do that, but the latest version of windows wipes out my ability to get on the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the forced upgrade to the latest version of windows 10 both my Ethernet and wifi network adapters in device manager have the same error message -</p>
<p>
</p><p>"This device cannot find enough resources it can use. (code 12)" <br />

            <p>If you are trying to send from within Word then that will only work if you have a fully MAPI-compliant email client installed.
</p>
<p>Examples of these are Outlook (which needs a Profile to be created to work), Windows Live Mail (AFAIK) and Mozilla Thunderbird.</p>
<p>If you use WEB access to your email then you cannot do this - you need to create a new email message and attach the file in the normal manner.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong><em>Microsoft forbids any assistance being given in these Forums to help you bypass or "crack" lost or forgotten Passwords.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;suggest that you reinstall the Operating System to take the Computers back to new condition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If no disks came with them, contact the Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you recovery disks for them.</p>
<p>They charge a small cost for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also ask the Manufacturer if there is a Recovery Partiiton to do that reinstallation.</p>
<p>The Recovery process can be started by pressing a particular Key or Keys&nbsp;combination at Boot.</p>
<p>It may be F10, F11, Alt + F10, etc depending on the Manufacturer.</p>
<p>Ask them for the correct Key sequence.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: As they&nbsp;are ex-Company, they may also be Volume Licensed.</p>
<p>If they are, we can not assist you at all.</p>
<p>I suggest that you ask the guy you got them from how they were Licensed.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>the crash (SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M (1000007e)) is causes by the driver libusb0.sys (Tue Jul 07 18:53:02 2009). Please update the software which uses it.</p>

    <title>Window 10 on HP Mini 210 activation failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tallboyrip  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window 10 on HP Mini 210 activation failure</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Mini 210 Netbook. When Windows 10 first came out and I was offered the Microsoft upgrade (via the link that Microsoft sent out to genuine Windows 7 users). The Windows 10 installation process declared that the graphics on the HP Mini were not
 capable of being upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently learnt that Windows 10 will now probably run on this PC. Having downloaded / created an iso file for the the 32-bit Windows 10 Home installation &amp; burnt it to disc (and also having purchased&nbsp; Microsoft Windows 10 Home key) I set about trying to
 upgrade this Netbook. Once again I was thwarted when the install declared that the small Systems Partition did not have enough space for the upgrade to take place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then decided to do a 'clean' install. I re-formatted the System Partition and the install went without a hitch and Windows 10 is now running on my HP Mini 210 OK - apart from requesting activation. When I try activating it, Microsoft reports that I don't
 have a valid key or Digital License. (Which I did when Windows 7 was the OS.)&nbsp; I have just checked the OS build (Version 1809 Build 17763.316) and noticed that it is licensed to me at my email address used for financial transactions whereas my Microsoft login
 uses a different email address - both at the same domain. Could this be why the License Key I have purchased is not being recognized by Microsoft?&nbsp; If so, how do I get Microsoft to recognize that the two slightly different email addresses are in fact one &amp;
 the same person!</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s. I notice in another related answers post it states to enter the command simgr.vbs / div (from an Admin Command screen) to find the product key. On my system that command returns: "simgr.vbs is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable
 program or batch file". Is there a different command to use now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone will know how to fix this frustrating problem!</p>

            Hi  Tallboyrip 
<br />
<br />Which edition does it list as installed?
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation
<br />
<br />Does it say Windows 10 Home or Pro?
<br />
<br />If you have Windows 10 Home installed, I would try the following:
<br />
<br />disconnect from the Internet. Press Windows key + A then toggle on airplane mode. Proceed to enter the key.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />slmgr -ipk xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx (allows you to replace the current product key with the specified)
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Exit command prompt then restart.
<br />
<br />Go back online then check if it activates.
<br />
<br />If not ...
<br />
<br />you need to do is contact chat support and explain the issue and they will reactivate it for you:

<br />You might have to wait until Monday to this.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Many thanks for the prompt response. I followed your instructions, but alas, I was not able to activate my copy of Windows 10 Home. I firstly checked that I had indeed got the Home version of Windows 10 (which I do) and then I disconnected from the web,
 switched on Airplane mode and entered the four groups of numbers from the Product Key. Whether I entered one group of four at a time (with a Return after each group) or entered the whole string and then did a return, I got a Windows Script Host error message:
 Error 0xC004F050 The Software Licensing Service reported that the Product Key is invalid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't help but think that the error may be caused by the fact that when I purchased Windows 10 the vendor will have reported to Microsoft that my email address was *** Email address is removed for privacy *** whereas my Microsoft Account is actually registered with *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.
 Would this block the Activation.? (I own the @traegon37.me.uk forwarding address, but of course, Microsoft won't know that.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise if this might be causing the problem.&nbsp; I'll try &amp; contact Microsoft by phone in the morning.</p>

<h2>            HALO REACH&#58; Matchmaking just keep&#38;&#35;39&#59;s restarting the search for players once full lobby is found.</h2>
                    
<p>So for the last hour or so, Iv'e tried about 7 different game types on halo reach trying to get it to work, on the competitive playlist I tried. Regular Team Slayer, Super Slayer, Team Doubles, Team Swat, Team Snipers ... nothing works, It just starts the
 matchmaking search and goes onto the searching screen, it finds players quite quick but once a full lobby is found it instantly restarts searching for players once the last player is found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only playlist Iv'e got to work once is the MLG playlist. Why isn't competitive working for me -___- !!!</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Your router also affects the wireless speed however not the wired speed.<br />
<br />
i.e a g router real world&nbsp;will only hit 20 mbps or so - there are g+ methods that will increase</p>
<p>the speed to 30 or so.<br />
<br />
Wireless n can hit real world speeds of 130-160 mbs or so. <br />
<br />
And then you get into multi-band and whether there are slower speed device than the
<br />
wireless router's maximum rating. So on a single band 2.4 router if there is a g or slower
<br />
device then the maximum speed for all devices will be set to that slowest device limits.<br />
Multi-band 2.4/5.0 band routers help to resolve that depending on the capabilities ot<br />
the wifi device on the network.<br />
<br />
Also if the wifi device in the computer is less than max. or the router then the wifi device<br />
will be the limiting factor. <br />
<br />
So check your wireless router's capabilities and that of all the computers on the network.<br />
<br />
</p>
Hope this helps.

            <p>By Wifi card I refer to my adapter,probably erroneously.</p>
<p>wifi in my laptop is from a broadcom 811.2n</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>By faster speeds in the past I refer to the fact that I used to have a 60MBPS service and saw speeds regularly higher than the approximate 30MBPS I have at the moment.- And that was with the current router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea of how to work out any other values needed. I will add that the router is a 'superhub' provided by Virgin media (I'm in the UK).</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Do you have ANY wifi device running off that router that is running G speed? If so that will<br />
limit the speed of all devices on a single band router. Check the router to be sure no outside</p>
<p>system is connecting to your router (check with the router maker's support and forums).<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
</strong><br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;And I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers. How far are <br />
you positioned from the router? Are there obstructions in the way?<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver and clearing the network logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - click Update Driver (may not do<br />
anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi<br />
Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows&nbsp;7 (updating drivers manually <br />
using the methods&nbsp;below is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System <br />
maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />
<br />
Repeat above for network card (NIC) and is a good time to get other updated <br />
drivers as Windows 7&nbsp;loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
I would also disable auto-updates for drivers. If Windows Updates suggests <br />
one just HIDE it as they are almost alway old and you can look for drivers<br />
manually as needed.</p>

<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Make sure you know the login details for your wireless router - SSID and Password.<br />
<br />
You will lose connection when doing this and have to redo your logon.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network &amp; Sharing Center - on Left&nbsp;Side click Manage <br />
Wireless Networks - Right Click the Networks - Remove Networks - <br />
REBOOT.&nbsp;Start - Connect&nbsp;To - to logon on to Network.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Group Policies - Newly created user GPOs do not apply</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm after some help with a problem I've started to encounter.&nbsp; Windows AD domain (2012R2 DCs, but 2003 functional level), starting to provision Windows 10 (1703) clients.&nbsp; GPOs applied at container levels within the OU.&nbsp; As of about a week or so ago, any
 group policy created to apply to a user object does not apply.&nbsp; GPO applying to Computer Objects apply instantly.&nbsp; If I create a GPO that solely contains a drive map (start simple), this doesn't apply, GPRESULT doesn't show it being denied or empty etc.&nbsp; Using
 the GPMC results tool produces the same result as that on the physical workstation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What seems odd is there were no problems a couple of weeks ago, I could create new User GPOs and they would apply, now it's like they don't exist.&nbsp; The corresponding GUID folder appears in the sysvol directory for the new GPO and permissions look as expected.&nbsp;
 Sysvol and Netlogon UNC paths have been excluded from hardening, KB3163622 is not applied to any client.&nbsp; There is no WMI filtering applied, permissions appear fine (auth users, read and apply GPO).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware there have been a lot of community posts from people experiencing problems with GPOs and Windows 10, but the problem I have seems another level, it doesn't even seem to be aware there should be a GPO applying.&nbsp; I'm at a bit of a loss where to
 go next and would be hugely grateful for any advice that could be provided.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p><br />
Rob</p>

<h3> john on live  say:</h3>
<h2>            GWX &#40;Get Windows 10&#41; Updates are messing up Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>After installing the GWX updates, Windows Update does not perform normally. Instead of allowing me to update my definition files for Windows Defender and other updates, Windows Update tells me that their are no updates available or consistently hangs on
 downloading/installing the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After performing the Windows Update Diagnostics (http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9863223), often several times, to fix issues with Updates hanging in limbo, I am able to update normally. This is with the GWX Updates installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After cancelling my reservation and removing the GWX Updates (KB2976978 and especially KB3035583), Windows Updates works as it should, without running the aforementioned diagnostics. I have hidden the two mentioned updates until this problem is resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I can update Windows Defender through its own GUI (with the GWX Updates installed), other Microsoft software updates also hang upon downloading/installation. (Luckily, Microsoft Office updates via click-to-run instead of via Windows Update.) Now, after
 removing the GWX updates, all updates operate normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I will be able to download the Windows 10 .ISO when RTM is available, why are these recommended updates even necessary, especially if they add a security risk of not updating Windows Defender definitions and other software normally? (The added security
 risk is due to not updating Windows Defender definitions properly and not updating other software such as he recent zero-day Adobe Flash Player update.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said before, I have uninstalled and hid the GWX updates to restore normal functionality of Windows Update, thereby minimizing the security risk. Can we please change these updates from Recommended (which install automatically) to Optional (which do
 not)? If not, can we at least fix the Windows Update corruption problem?</p>

            <p>There must be some kind of unique situation or rare circumstance on your computer, because what you are seeing is not happening to others in large&nbsp;scale, and doesn't happen in a lab install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't blame you for not wanting to investigate it, it's likely not worth the effort.&nbsp; And since you've already hidden the GWX update, you won't be impacted again.&nbsp; As you said, you can still get the download when it's available, it just won't pre-download
 for you ahead of time.&nbsp;</p>

            I am having the exact same problem, and more. For those who&nbsp; have Norton&nbsp; Security, GWX and Norton do not play nice at all. Norton tries to stop and GWX tries brute force its way through.&nbsp; Th results are not pretty.&nbsp; Now every time&nbsp; Windows goes to boot
 , it claims that the SSD drive reserve are is corrupted (even though its not)&nbsp; then sits for almost 1 hours trying to find the problem.

            This is not an unique situation at all; see "eightforum". I want to wait a month or so before changing to W10 assuming everything is working OK. I do not like not being to update my W8.1 security options but I do have good anti-virus / internet protection

            <p>Yes, I had a slightly different GWX problem. I had initially reserved my Windows 10 upgrade when the GWX thing first appeared. Then I changed my mind, and removed my reservation at the point when my computer said that Windows 10 upgrade was available. Which
 meant that it had been downloaded to my computer already. When I cancelled the upgrade, I think that it removed the downloaded upgrade, verified that from looking at disk space usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few days later, I was notified that there were Windows 8.1 updates waiting in Windows Update, so I went there and saw that none of them, even the important ones, were selected. So I selected the ones that I wanted, and starting Windows Update "download
 and install", and I see just the cheery green "Downloading Windows 10" appear. So I cancelled out of that, and went and found the optional Windows 10 upgrade update, and deselected it and hid it. Then did disk cleanup, and cleaned up system files in case any
 upgrade installation files had been downloaded before I cancelled the Windows 10 upgrade. Then rebooted, just to re-initialize things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the system came back up, Windows Update showed only Windows 8.1 updates selected, the Windows 10 upgrade was still deselected and hidden (I checked) and said that it would be downloading about 200Mb. So I again "downloaded and installed", and what do
 you know, again the cheery green "Downloading Windows 10 update" started up. No attempt was made to download any of the Windows 8.1 updates that I had selected, of course I wouldn't need them since I was upgrading to Windows 10 (NOT!).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, I never did get the Windows 10 upgrade unstuck from Windows Update on Windows 8.1 I had done everything that I could think of, including going through the registry and removing anything that had GWX in it, and all files and folders off my system
 that included GWX in their file name, and everything else I could find on the internet about this problem. Worked on it a couple of different days, and finally gave up. Never did get the Window 10 upgrade unstuck from Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I posted this on eightforum as a question, 3 or 4 other forum users checked "also have this problem", so I'm not the only one that this has happened to. No answers, of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I ended up using the "media creator" thing to do the Windows 10 upgrade, since the computer is a laptop, and I needed to get through some Windows 10 driver issue. The upgrade went okay, but I'm pretty frustrated with Microsoft that I couldn't do the upgrade
 on my schedule. Especially since my laptop OEM (Dell) does not have Windows 10 drivers for my Dell laptop, just Windows 7/8 ones. Ended up using the Windows 7/8 drivers and they worked okay (luckily), but that was one of the reasons that I wanted to delay
 the upgrade, to understand the drivers situation before doing it. But Microsoft wouldn't allow that, really hate the way that worked. Once I could no longer update my Windows 8.1 OS, I had to upgrade real soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not a good experience, lots of wasted time. Got lucky on the results of the Windows 10 upgrade, but I'd have been a LOT madder at Microsoft if I'd had driver problems on Windows 10. Would have had to re-install Windows 8.1, and go through all the pain of
 configuring a new version of the OS yet again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These problems need to be fixed! There should be a general cleanup app for Windows 7/8 that makes sure that whatever might tell the system to install Windows 10 upgrade from Windows Update is removed when the user indicates that they no longer want an immediate
 upgrade. That would catch about 90% of these weird cases of stuff being left behind or changed and not changed back, and make Microsoft customers a lot happier.</p>

            <p>I get a similar issue in Windows 7 64-bit Service Pack 1.&nbsp; I reserved a copy of Windows 10 via the
<em>Get Windows 10</em> system tray icon (GWX).&nbsp; Windows Update started showing the Windows 10 Upgrade as a
<em>pre-selected update under Optional updates</em>.&nbsp; And even if I unchecked this update, proceeding with other security updates brought me to a screen that said
<em><strong>Downloading Windows 10</strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried several Registry entries to disable this, including the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">; Block the Get Windows 10 tray icon, from <a href="http://superuser.com/questions/922068/how-to-disable-the-get-windows-10-icon-shown-in-the-notification-area-tray" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>I also disabled the four GWX-related scheduled tasks.&nbsp; And restarted, of course.&nbsp; The system tray icon is gone, and the Windows 10 Upgrade no longer appears in Windows Update optional updates list.&nbsp; But whenever I proceed with Windows Update (i.e. to install
 a security update), it proceeds to say "<em><strong>Downloading Windows 10</strong></em>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled KB3035583 and restarted.&nbsp; Then I ran a Microsoft batch file to stop Window Update related services, purge my SoftwareDistribution folder and related dat files, and re-register Windows Update, followed by a restart.&nbsp; I went back into Windows
 Update and did Check for Updates, then hid KB3035583.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Windows Update still says "<em><strong>Downloading Windows 10</strong></em>" whenever I proceed with a security update.&nbsp; ****?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft needs to issue a correction to Windows Update, of provide a Fix-It link to un-reserve Windows 10 (or something else) to resolve this incorrect Windows Update status screen.&nbsp; No Windows 7/8 system that lacks KB3035583 (or that has the registry changes
 specified in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3080351" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3080351</a>) should ever be saying "<em><strong>Downloading Windows 10</strong></em>".</p>

            <p>Just bought a brand new HP laptop with Windows 8.1 on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalled some bloatware, and somewhere in the course of doing that and rebooting there were 3 Windows Updates that were installed: KB3020370, KB3083669, KB3072318.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then ran Windows Update - check for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was brought to the Windows Update - check for updates screen which showed:</p>
<p>"Downloading Windows 10" and I believe it showed that it was getting setup files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I cancelled the Windows 10 download, and then "Get Started" was displayed as the only option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to waste a couple of GB downloading Windows 10, as it doesn't work properly right now with a few important in-house developed applications yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I clicked into and looked through Important Updates, and selected all of those.</p>
<p>I then looked at Optional updates, and selected a Wifi driver update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I clicked "Install/OK" at which point it says "Downloading Windows 10" getting setup files - ****!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason "Upgrade to Windows 10 - Home" in the "Optional Updates" is SELECTED BY DEFAULT way down at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deselected and hide the "Upgrade to Windows 10 - Home" 'optional' update, then selected all the important updates, and the one optional Wifi driver update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, even after de-selecting the "Upgrade to Windows 10 - Home" optional update it still says "Downloading Windows 10" - getting setup files, etc then checking requirements in the status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had about 150+ (2GB+) of updates for Windows and Office to download, so I wasn't sure what was going on but I just left it for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking now at the "Installed Updates" screen I see that a number of updates for Windows and Office are now installing, eve though it still says "Downloading Windows 10, checking requirements."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please release a FIX for the non-functioning Windows Update "Get Updates" status screen, and stop trying to push a pre-selected "optional" Windows 10 update.</p>

            It looks like JC has found a way for those of us who 1. Do not want W10 or 2. Want to wait until the initial bugs are sorted out. I will try deselected all updates except one and see what happens with the W10 upgrade. Has anybody else tried this yet and
 if so what was the result? I will report back later<br />

            <p>Great news for all who want to wait / do not want W10!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows Update go to Optional and mark W10 upgrade as Hidden. Decide what updates you want to install Important or Optional and click install. The W10 upgrade will show but the selected updates will be installed. After installation of your updates the
 W10 upgrade window should close and show your updates as installed. If W10 Upgrade window still shows just close main Windows Update window. You will have to mark W10 upgrade as Hidden each time you want to install any updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have written this as a new response as possibly some people will miss my reply to JC's post which highlighted the scenario in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Great community solution. We just need MS to sort out its coding mess now so that nobody need be confused in the future</p>

            <p>Glad that helped you out TG.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a quick update, this morning I booted up the laptop and there were two new Important Windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to go in and check for Windows updates, and just those two important ones were selected by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked Install, ignored the "Downloading Windows 10" message in place of where the usual progress information area is and shortly after it finished with "The updates were installed, more updates are available, Succeeded: 2 updates".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the updates do still work, although I don't trust it not to try and sneak through an extra "Optional" update so I'll leave it on manually download + notify Windows Update settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note:&nbsp; I did add the registry key for Mike4Online above from Aug 20 to the laptop before I shut it down previously:</p>

<h2>            Persona 4 Arena Ultimax&#58; Cannot Download DLC Music Unlock File</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased P4AU and was able to download it and all the additional characters DLC, P4A story, and BGM files except for one.</p>

<p>I am currently Unable to download/install "Additional BGM: P4A Arranged Pack #1", everything else installed fine.</p>

<p>The DLC shows in my download history, but trying to download&nbsp;it results in&nbsp;watching&nbsp;the download&nbsp;screen&nbsp;stuck at 0% or 1% progress (on a 104kb unlock file... SMH).&nbsp;&nbsp;After a bit,&nbsp;the download "times out" into a "Can't download Additional BGM: P4A 1" message.&nbsp;
 I tried clearing system cache, marketplace cache, restarting, redownloading from purchase history, the game page on&nbsp;xbox marketplace, etc. all to no avail so far.</p>

<p>What is&nbsp;up with this?</p>

<p>Also, one more question for you: &nbsp;Since this issue with the download stuck at 0% comes up now and again on various content, gets sent to a team to investigate, and then gets resolved - do they ever actually tell you what the issue behind the scenes actually
 was? &nbsp;The reason I ask is that if there is a common cause to the "stuck download" issue, perhaps we could reference it when bringing the issue up to "support" in order to help resolve the issue sooner.</p>
<p>I spent 2 hours with an Xbox Support Live chat agent and basically got nowhere. &nbsp;They had no idea what was happening, nor did they plan to escalate the issue to any team, they just eventually offered me a refund. &nbsp;Well, that might please some customers,
 who knows, but the issue just persists for everyone else down the road. &nbsp;Either way, I'm glad that you are knowledgeable about this issue, were willing to have a look at it, and know who to get involved in order to actually fix the problem someday.</p>
