<br />
Only if you install Windows 7 with a "full version" license and not an upgrade license.

<div>The answer is still no. The upgrade price and use of the upgrade version </div>
<div>voids the Windows XP license - it may not be used on any computer again. </div>
<div>You need to contact the laptop manufacturer and get a set of restore discs </div>
<div>for her laptop to fix her problem, or purchase another copy of Windows XP to</div>

            The question has been answered in this thread.&nbsp; It's not a question of associating and email address with a photo program; it's that you must have an email client other than Windows Mail installed.<br />

<h2>            Logitech quickcam pro 4000 webcam installation in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Hello there fellow community members.<br />
<br />
I arrived here after failing to get my webcam drivers installed in Windows 8.1 (running all the lastest updates).<br />
Hopefully someone with a much greater knowledge of windows hardware problems than myself will be kind enough to help me out. My windows version is in the dutch language but I'll try to translate the information contained in the screenshots into English as best
 as possible.<br />
<br />
Device manager shows an Unknown Device with code 28. If I unplug my webcam this entry in the device manager disappears. It reappears if the usb cable is plugged back in again. If I try to find new drivers through device manager I get the following screens :<br />
<br />

<br />
Translation : There has been a problem during driver installation. A driver was found but not installed. Path not found.<br />
<br />
<br />
Windows update finds an important driver update but wont install it (failure 80070003 ). A PC cold boot also does not help :<br />

<br />
Can anyone advise me on the following steps needed ? I've done some researching myself here at the community and elsewhere on internet without success. If I need to dive into into the register to change some keys, please let me know (this does not worry me)
 !<br />
<br />
If you got this far through my post, thanks in advance for your time and any possible input.

<h2>            Outlook 2007 won&#39;t connect - continually prompts for password even though I have clicked to save password and all account details are right&#33;</h2>
                    I have just installed windows 7 and office professional 2007 on my laptop and everything is fine except Outlook.<br />
<br />
The problem is that Outlook 2007 continually prompts me to enter network password, again and again and again, endlessly and will not allow connection to send or recieve e-mails. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
It recognised my old loggin details and pre filled all the fields, POP, server, password, username etc. I have re-entered them several times since and know they are all correct! I have tried clicking to save password but still nothing!<br />
<br />
Any pointers would be fantastic.<br />
<br />
Thanx

            Whose scanner?&nbsp; If its Norton or McAfee, turning the scanner off has no effect.&nbsp; With either of these two, you have to uninstall them competely, run a special cleanup tool that each of these folks have come up with because their regular uninstallers leave
 considerable debris all over your system, then do a custom re-install where you can prevent the scanner from being installed.&nbsp; Email scanners&nbsp;are responsible for&nbsp;considerably more damage and system downtime than ANY malware they're supposed to keep out.&nbsp; The
 other thing to try would be a new Outlook profile; these sometimes get corrupted and can produce really bizarre symptoms...my bet&nbsp;is still on the email scanner.<br />

    <title>Windows Speech Recognition Commands - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jozefh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Speech Recognition Commands</h2>
                    Hello, I have more questions about speech recognition:<br />
<br />
1. I tried to do online search with Mozilla Firefox by pronouncing the word "ENTER" (after entering the search words/phrases), but it did not work - what is the correct command for that?<br />
<br />
2. I was not able to find a speech input icon with Google Translate (again using Mozilla Firefox) - how can I turn the function on?<br />
<br />
3. How can I play, pause and stop a video in Windows Media Player with Speech Recognition?<br />
<br />
4. Is there a way to open Desktop Calendar (I have to “left click” the time &amp; the date on the bottom right corner of the desktop screen) using Speech Recognition?<br />
<br />
5. What would be the command to tell Speech Recognition to flip (back and forth) PDF pages?<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />

<p style="margin-left: 30px">Say: "Press Enter"</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I was not able to find a speech input icon with Google Translate (again using Mozilla Firefox) - how can I turn the function on?</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I'm not familiar with Google Translate, and generally, Windows Speech Recognition works better in Microsoft Edge or Internet Explorer than it does in Firefox or Chrome. But you may want to try to learn about clicking on-screen objects
 by voice with the "show numbers" capability in WSR. That might help you to do what you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. How can I play, pause and stop a video in Windows Media Player with Speech Recognition?</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">The only way I could do this is with "Press Control P" to play/pause, and "Press Control S" to stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Is there a way to open Desktop Calendar (I have to “left click” the time &amp; the date on the bottom right corner of the desktop screen) using Speech Recognition?</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Say "Start Calendar." This works with most apps, like Start Excel, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. What would be the command to tell Speech Recognition to flip (back and forth) PDF pages?</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I'm not sure if you're using the built-in Reader app or Adobe Reader, but something like this should work: Press Page Down, Press Page Up, Press Right Arrow, and Press Left Arrow.</p>

<p>Oh, THAT calendar. I see what you mean now; you want to click on the time/date on the Task Bar to bring up the calendar panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, getting at stuff on the Task Bar by voice with Windows Speech&nbsp;Recognition&nbsp;is difficult. The only way I can see to do this is with the Mouse Grid feature, which lets you click anywhere on the screen. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Say "mouse grid." (A big grid with nine numbers appears.)</li><li>Say "nine" a few times until any one of the nine numbers is DIRECTLY over the time/date area in the lower right corner of the screen.</li><li>Say "click" followed by the number&nbsp;that is directly over the time/date.</li></ol>
<p>The desktop calendar should appear. You can say "cancel" to close it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also want to look into the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Speech Recognition Macros utility</a>, which is free from Microsoft. It allows you to create your own speech commands by essentially associating keyboard shortcuts and mouse gestures to a phrase (like "show the desktop calendar").</p>

<p>Although I have 10 years experience with WSR, from the beginning I learned you just have to try different things. One of the things to know is that WSR works very well with keyboard commands as well as with labels of items on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is how I figured it out:</p>
<ol>
<li>Issued the command, "Show Desktop." This was from this Reply window.</li><li>Said, "Show Desktop." It now shows in the speech bar, "Switching to desktop."</li><li>Now when on the desktop, issue the command, "Press tab." Now says, "Switched to taskbar"</li><li>At this point I glanced at that time, which was 11:56 AM and simply&nbsp;said 11:56 AM which opened the calendar you wish to work with.</li><li>You can now move around the calendar by saying either, "Tab," to move forward or, "Shift tab," to move backwards. When you get to the place you want like the up or down month caret, say, "Press enter."</li><li>To get to a different date in the calendar, say, "Show numbers."</li></ol>
<p>It took me a few minutes to figure this out, but when should get familiar with trying to use keyboard and voice commands and show numbers, you should be able to navigate anywhere on the screen.</p>

<p>Reading the time should work in any version of Windows since Vista. Are you sure you said Tab after saying Show desktop?</p>

<p>Instead of saying the time to click the clock, you can also say "system clock."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jozefh, to answer your earlier question about WSR Macros, here's an example. Right now you're figuring out a sequence of things to say to get the desktop calendar to appear. What if you could create a single saying that would run through that sequence of
 sayings for you? That's what WSR Macros can do. Here's one:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;command priority="50"&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;listenFor&gt;show calendar&lt;/listenFor&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;emulateRecognition&gt;switch to desktop&lt;/emulateRecognition&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;waitFor seconds="0.25"/&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;sendKeys&gt;{TAB}&lt;/sendKeys&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;waitFor seconds="1.0"/&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;emulateRecognition&gt;click system clock&lt;/emulateRecognition&gt;<br />
&lt;/command&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>The above macro allows you to say "show calendar," and then the macro runs through the steps to make it happen. Basically it allows you to make your own speech commands.</p>

<h2>            Why are some images on my computer distorted while it isn&#39;t on other computers&#63;</h2>

This is one of the images that appears "distorted" on my computer screen. If by "distorted", I mean the colors are somewhat unnatural and leaked... kinda like a painting of some sort...<br />
All of my computer equipments are working properly, and my screen doesn't show any distorted images except for some images like that given example on top.<br />
I have also updated my NVIDIA driver to the latest version and even reinstall it just to make sure!<br />
I am not so sure about this but... I think only PNG formats are distorted... but that is still unconfirmed...<br />
<br />
Anyway, please help! Thank You!<br />

            I have found out that my web provider is compressing images on the net for faster browsing.<br />
And to view and download web images successfully, I have found an alternative.<br />
I simply download a "User Agent Switcher" add-on for Firefox and switched to "Googlebot 2.1". After that all images that were wrong on the net went right.<br />
<br />
I am only posting this in case some other people are also experiencing my problem.<br />
<br />

    <title>Mouse click problem in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> w10rr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse click problem in Windows 10</h2>
                    I m using an HP laptop. As I feel more comfortable using a mouse I have attached a USB mouse to it and have been using it for long this way and I rarely use laptop's inbuilt mousepad. Lately I'm getting a problem and it is when I click mouse's left button
 (primary button), the right click options also show up a lot and its really irritating. A few weeks ago I had this problem and found a solution on the internet and it was over. But now after an update to Windows (which happens periodically), the problem has
 started again. I again tried the same solution but it didn't work this time. Is someone else also facing this problem and please tell me how to get rid of this problem permanently as I have&nbsp;tweaked various mouse options in Control Panel but the problem is
 still there? Please help and thanks.

            Thanks. I already had latest updated drivers for my mouse. And I again updated but it didn't help. Then I found a very unusual solution. Yesterday I was really mad at my mouse for behaving in such a manner even though it is relatively new purchase. I slightly
 hit it three or four times on my desk and&nbsp;lo and behold it started working fine again and it has been two days and its working fine.

            <p>So it indeed was the mouse itself, if it is new enough to be replaced under warrantee I would suggest that you do so before the warrantee period expires.</p>

            Yes it was mouse itself which caused the problem. Now I have totally replaced it.

<h2>            Controller Not Working&#63; -- Check Here&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><strong>How do I connect my controller?</strong><br />
If you are using a wireless controller, try to sync your controller to your console. You can doing this by turning on the console, and then&nbsp;pushing the sync button on both the controller (small circular button near the left bumper) and the console (on the original
 console, the small circular button by the power button; on the S console, the small square button near the front USB ports). The green lights should flash in a circle, then all flash, and then one light will remain indicating which controller position the
 controller currently is.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you are using a wired controller, try unplugging the controller for a few seconds and then firmly reinserting the USB connector. If it still isn’t working, try a different USB port as that particular port might be bad (if this is the case, you will want
 to use our&nbsp;<a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Service Center</a>&nbsp;to set up a console repair).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>My controller won’t connect (flashing green lights)</strong><br />
Does your controller turn on, but can’t seem to connect properly? Perhaps you already have four controllers connected. Are all four green lights around the power button on the console currently lit up? If so, you need to disconnect one of them.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To disconnect a wireless controller, press and hold the guide button for a few seconds, then select “Turn off controller” from the menu. To disconnect a wireless headset, press and hold the power button until it turns off. To disconnect a wired controller…
 well, I’m sure you get the idea.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>My wireless controller won’t stay connected (“Please reconnect controller” error)</strong><br />
Before troubleshooting, make sure any objects between the controller and console are removed, such as doors, shelves, or metal dividers. Also make sure that other wireless devices are kept clear of this are, including wireless routers, cordless phones, or microwave
 ovens. Sorry, you’ll have to make the walk to the kitchen to zap your ramen!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also check to make sure your batteries are fresh. If you use rechargeable AAs or Microsoft brand rechargeable battery packs, make sure they are fully charged. You can try using a different battery source to see if there might be an issue with your current batteries.&nbsp;If
 you are having trouble charging your Microsoft rechargeable battery pack, please check&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/rechargeable-battery-pack-does-not-charge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this support article</a>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Still having issues with your controller?</strong><br />
If your controller still won’t work, try connecting it to a different console. If it works on this other console, there is probably an issue with your console. If the controller still doesn’t work on the new console, there is probably an issue with the controller
 itself. If it was recently purchased, try returning it to the retailer for a replacement. If you can’t take it back, but it’s still within the Accessory Warranty period,&nbsp;you can use the&nbsp;<a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Online Service Center</a>&nbsp;to
 order a new one. If it’s been longer than the Accessory Warranty period, then you would want to purchase a new controller at your retailer. For more information regarding accessory warranties, check out our

<h2>            Realtek HD audio manager not found in Windows 10 notebook</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
I have an&nbsp;<strong>HP 15-ay516tx notebook</strong> running <strong>Windows 10 pro 64 bit v1703.</strong></p>
<p>Since, I upgraded to the Creators' update after buying my notebook 2 weeks ago, the
<strong>RealTek HD audio manager has disappeared</strong> and has been <em>replaced by DTS audio control</em>. No matter what I do, I can't find the RealTek HD audio manager. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the sound card drivers as well as Troubleshooting.
 However, it doesn't seem to work. Additionally, when I access&nbsp;RtkNGUI64.exe from C:/Program files/Realtek/Audio, it again opens the DTS audio control panel. Also,
<strong>installing the drivers from the manufacturer website doesn't work.</strong><br />
I also do not see RealTek HD audio manager in the Control Panel. Only the DTS Audio control is present in it. The drivers are also properly installed and the Windows is up-to-date.<br />
Please help; DTS audio control has very limited enhancements and they doesn't seem to work with my Bluetooth headphones or wired headphones for that matter.<br />
I'd like the RealTek HD audio manager back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly,&nbsp;<strong>no error message of any sort is being displayed.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.<br />
</p>
<p><strong><em>Moved from</em>:(Windows / Windows 10 / Devices &amp; drivers)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>

<p>If you're able to control your Realtek audio card using the Realtek HD Audio Manager before the installation Creators update, then this may be a software compatibility concern. The best option we can suggest is to get in touch with your computer or device
 manufacturer for further information regarding the installation and use of the Realtek HD Audio Manager.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
It seems that the DTS Audio Control Panel is the software that manages your Realtek HD Audio Manager. For us to verify this, please go into Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Taskbar. Under the Notification area, click Select which icons appear on the taskbar. If
 this page shows the information as shown in the screenshot below, then it is indeed the software that manages your Realtek audio card.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb151d1d-331f-4392-818b-2e6106ae6ead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fb151d1d-331f-4392-818b-2e6106ae6ead" /></a><br />
<br />
If you preferred using the RealTek HD Audio Manager, then we suggest that you get in touch with the device manufacturer for assistance.</p>
<p><br />
Let us know if you need further information.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Regards.</p>

                    Given that non-pro versions of Windows 8 don't have either Bitlocker or EFS, and that the current version of Truecrypt doesn't support Windows 8 (AFAIK) what application(s) are available to encrypt data on Windows 8.1 Single Language?

            <p>Hi Gordon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BitLocker Drive Encryption feature is available only in Windows 8.1 Pro and Windows 8.1 Enterprise editions. For additional info, see this article:
<strong><em><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831507.aspx#BKMK_HSRequirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What are the BitLocker hardware and software requirements?</a></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft does not provide any encryption software for the Windows home users. You may use your favorite search engine to find an appropriate third party software for data encryption for the home users and then download and install it on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Important: Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can
 be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>Hope this is helpful. If you need any further assistance with Windows Operating System, please post your query on Microsoft Community Forums and we’ll be glad to assist you with it.</span></p>

<p>I did all the port-forwarding as here: <a href="http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Technicolor/TC8305C/Xbox_One.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://portforward.com/english/routers/port_forwarding/Technicolor/TC8305C/Xbox_One.htm</a></p>

<p>I did not do port triggering but I have that option.</p>

<p>Destiny and CoD: Advanced Warfare BOTH give me messages that NAT type is strict, even when settings in xbox network show the Nat type to be open.</p>

<p>SIgh. AM I lagging or what? Multilayer + Connection tests passed as good.</p>

<p>The NAT settings on the One have been an issue since launch. Mine changes from time to time with no input from me, it's on Microsoft's end. It always seems to happen after a big MP game launch.</p>
<p>I'd give it some time to sort itself out, we shouldn't be needing to mess with port forwarding on a console when I haven't had to do it on my PC in years.</p>

            <p>Hey, guys! I found you over in the Xbox General Discussion forums, and moved you over here to support. I'm very sorry to see about the disconnect issues! If you could, I'm looking to find out which type of Xbox 360 you've got. You should have either the original 360, the 360 S, or the 360 E. If you aren't sure which one you have, you can determine this by the kind of power button you have:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Xbox 360 Original: White or Black power button (depending on which color console you have).</span></li>
<li><span>Xbox 360 S: Silver/chrome power button that is touch sensitive, larger circle.</span></li>
<li><span>Xbox 360 E: Silver/chrome power button that needs to be pushed in like the Original console, smaller circle.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>This will help us out a lot if you could provide this!</p>
<p>In the meantime, please check out our&nbsp;known issues thread&nbsp;on this device you have. You can set your firewall to low or disable it to help alleviate this issue. If that doesn't work, please reach out to Comcast for further troubleshooting. :D</p>

    <title>No drives detected, won&#39;t boot if there&#39;s a usb plugged in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yeetyeetus  say:</h3>
<h2>            No drives detected, won&#39;t boot if there&#39;s a usb plugged in</h2>
                    <p>I switched off my pc during a 'getting windows ready screen' that got stuck due to the fact I didn't want to leave it on over night. The next day when I tried to boot it, it let off a loud prolonged beep and got stuck in the now very laggy bios menu.
</p>
<p>Some research online suggested that it could be because it's trying to boot from usb, and so unplugging all the usbs got everything working perfectly and most devices worked fine when plugged in after the boot apart from my graphics tablet.</p>
<p>Since I need the tablet, I tried to change the bios settings by disabling the usb boot and making sure my drive priorities were correct but it appears that when I manage to get into the bios with an 'all usbs unplugged' boot, none of my hard drives are being
 detected as the only options in my hard disk drive priority setting in the bios utility is windows boot manager or disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I doing something wrong or is there a way to fix this?</p>
<p>It's near impossible to access the bios on a 'usbs connected' boot as it either loads in the bios laggy and unresponsive or cuts to a black screen after the acer logo with the same prompts to hit f12 or del as shown on the previous screen (this happens despite
 already hitting those keys, nothing happens on that screen when pressing either keys).</p>

            Hi, YeetYeetus
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode  to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

            Enter UEFI OR BIOS setup to check and report back Boot Priority order, UEFI, fast boot and Secure Boot Settings.

            The problem is obvious in that you have an EFI System partition on the Windows drive but the partition itself has been installed in Legacy (non EFI) mode as shown by the Active flag on the C partition which only appears on Legacy Installs.  
<br />
<br />It cannot boot possibly because CSM - which allows Legacy installs to boot on a UEFI system - is disabled in Setup.  If changing to CSM, save and exit boots it then it's indeed got System Files on whichever partition then shows up as System - probably C since the EFI System partition from a previous install wouldn't likely be overwritten by a Legacy Install.
<br />
<br />TBH I'm not sure how an EFI System partition can even exist on an MBR format hard drive which we know it is due to Active flag on C.  It must be from a previous install and I doubt it will have the present install to Legacy boot files.  But if it starts, again which which partition says System as that is the one booting it.
<br />
<br />If it' doesn't start with CSM enabled and the hard drive set first to boot (Windows Boot Manager is only for UEFI) , then what I'd do is disable CSM in UEFI Setup, set WIndows Boot Manager first to boot, trigger the installation media as a UEFI device, during a Custom install delete all partitions to reset the formatting to GPT, then click Next to let it auto format the needed partitions for a UEFI install and begin - this makes it foolproof.
<br />

<p>
<span><span><span>Burning a disc might take several minutes to complete.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>If you have more songs in your burn list than will fit on one audio CD, you'll have the option to burn the remaining items to a second blank CD.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>Because Windows Media Player doesn't support the CD-Text standard, the audio CDs that you burn don't include the media information from your original WMA or MP3 files.
 This means that if you burn an audio CD containing songs from multiple albums and you try to play that CD on another computer, the other computer might not be able to automatically display the names of the songs on the disc</span></span></span></p>

<h2>            Set &#34;let windows manage this connection&#34;  by command line, registry or any other way &#47;</h2>
                    <p>Hi community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am looking for any possibility, to automatically set "let windows manage this connection" for mobile broadband connections by cmd, script, registry, PS, xml or whatever.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>! BUT NOT BY CLICKING THE CHECKBOX, IT MUST BE AUTOMATIC ! </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot find anything to do that by netsh or by setting it via xml....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to manage 800 mobile clients with MBN connections, so it must be automatic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>best regards</p>

</p><p>Hi community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>ich suche einen Weg, den Haken bei&nbsp; "Windows soll meine Verbindung aufrechterhalten" für Mobilfunkverbindungen automatisch über cmd, script, PS, xml oder sonst irgendwie zu setzen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jeder Weg ist mir recht - ausser es manuell zu anzuklicken!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ich finde dazu leider keinen Weg, weder über netsh noch über xml import...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ich muss 800 mobile Clients mit der Mobilfunkverbindung konfigurieren, daher muss es automatisch sein!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Grüße,</p>

<p><span>If you're frustrated with Search (a.k.a. Desktop Search), you are not alone. Click the
<strong><span>Start</span></strong> button and type in
<strong><span>Search</span></strong> and click on the command "<strong><span>Change how Windows searches</span></strong>". Now click on the
<strong><span>Advanced</span></strong> button and select&nbsp;<strong><span>File types</span></strong> tab. Scroll down and locate your file type (in your case
<strong><span>.php)&nbsp;</span></strong>and make sure that the radio button "<strong><span>Index Properties and File Contents</span></strong>" is selected for the file type.<br />
<br />
Come out of the form by clicking the <strong>OK</strong> button but do not yet&nbsp;close the form where you clicked the
<strong><span>Advanced</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
Next, you may need to modify the indexing locations. If the folder wherein your files are located is not known to the search indexing, then search doesn't even bother to look there (a source of frustration for many users). Perhaps your files are on a different
 disk or partition unbeknown to the indexing engine. Using the expand icon and select/deselect options, make sure that at least the folders of interest are included to the
<strong><span>Indexed Locations</span></strong>. Hope this helps.</span></p>

<p>Good question, Eric. I'm typing this from an Inspiron that just yesterday Microsoft regressed (via bricking) into Win 8.1. -- Amber abstract wallpaper and charms! Cool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no intention of personalizing everything back to the way it was. I feel let down by both Microsoft and Dell over these FORCED FATAL updates. Who is looking out for the customers; who cares?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2018 and the Carnegie Mellon, MIT, et al Redmond experts can't figure out updates that at the ***damn least don't corrupt the pc's drives and recovery volumes. Holy Cow! Is this too much to ask?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also would like to request Microsoft corporate board members/stockholders to consider an immediate AUDIT upon the division responsible for updates including "Feature" updates. But they need not do it for my sake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, I am now going to start my very first GoFundMe campaign to see if people will help me purchase a Mac.</p>

<h2>            upgrade to Win 10 but Too Many Recovery Partitions from Win 8.1</h2>
                    <p>ok i have a question</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i upgraded to Win 8.1 from Win 8 the upgrade added a new 350mb Recovery Partition to my hard drive
</p>
<p>
</p><p>then i had trouble and had to restore my pc back to factory original (my pc is a HP pc) this took me back to Win 8 but did not remove the new 350mb Recovery Partition that i got with the first upgrade to Win 8.1
</p>
<p>
</p><p>so now after the restore back to factory original i install Win 8.1 again and Win 8.1 add's a new 350mb Recovery Partition so now i have 2 350mb Recovery Partitions and 1 351.8mb Windows RE tools
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defrag see these partitions as Local Disk (\\?\VOLUME and can not defragment them</p>
<p>
</p><p>now i found someone that had restored his computer the same way i did and had 13 350mb Recovery Partitions</p>
<p>
</p><p>Too Many Recovery Partitions<br />

Instead of trying to recover 8.1 from the factory reserved partition which might have been broken due to the extra partitions being created, I suggest to download the correct edition of Windows from the link below and start it fresh. Please refer to the article

            <p>hello and thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>i want to make sure you understand</p>
<p>first my pc is a HP p7 1439 it came with Windows 8 and the factory reserved partition is Windows 8
<br />
<br />
second the added 350mb Recovery Partition came when i upgraded to Windows 8.1 <br />
<br />
third i had to restore back to Windows 8 from the factory reserved partition still on the pc (the added 350mb partition is there still also)<br />
<br />
forth now from a fresh factory restore back to Windows 8 from the factory reserved partition i upgrade again to Windows 8.1 it add's a second 350mb partition now i have 2 and as you can see others have restored back to Windows 8 from there factory reserved
 partition more than 2 times the link i gave shows that guy had 13<br />
<br />
i'm not the only one who has done this and it looks like a bug in the upgrade to Windows 8.1 because you would think that buy restoring back to Windows 8 it would delete that 350mb partition or see that it is there and not add more<br />
<br />
so now i'm not sure if the upgrade to Windows 10 is worth it if i'm going to have trouble installing Windows 10 with those 350mb Partitions on the hard drive<br />
<br />
you guy's are in a world of poo lol when this go's live all those poor people that do not know about this<br />
<br />
so the best thing i can do is wipe my hard drive and use a ISO to upgrade to Windows 10 ?<br />
<br />
will you guys give me a ISO to download and KEY? from the KEY in my PC<br />
<br />
i think i need more info on this i know how to wipe and reinstall a OS but i see trouble with drivers and such<br />
<br />
<br />
please help </p>
<p>
</p><p>and help others that do not know if they upgrade to Windows 10 and have like 30 or 40 350mb partitions because they restored that much<br />
<br />
<br />
:)<br />

            So your solution to this problem requires an entire new hard drive? &nbsp;I assume Microsoft won't be footing the bill. &nbsp;I would have hoped that you could do just a little bit better than 'install everything from scratch on a brand new drive'. You are the people
 who pushed this dump of an OS on everyone, and these problems should have been thought of, and resolved BEFORE this OS came to market. &nbsp;But as usual, in the pursuit of yet more money, Microsoft releases yet another extremely buggy, almost unusable operating
 system where all of the offending components are so far integrated into the thing that they can't be turned off or removed (windows defender &amp; cortana, i am looking at you). &nbsp;While i know this is not your fault per-se Jayant, your 'advice' here is terrible.

            Are you thinking Secure boot keys are license keys of Software?
<br />The Secure boot keys shouldn't affect anything.

            <p>Hi Bill, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>It’s unfortunate that you are unable to go at What’s new feature in People app and it crashes. I do understand the inconvenience. I am here to help you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Basic apps information: <br />
1) UAC must be enabled <br />
2) To access the Windows Store and to download and run apps, you need an active Internet connection and a screen resolution of at least 1024 x 768
<br />
3) To snap apps, you need a screen resolution of at least 1366 x 768</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to perform the following methods in order to resolve the issue.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Check the Windows Firewall Settings</strong></div>
<div>a) Type in Control Panel on the Start Page. <br />
b) On the left side, click Control Panel. <br />
c) Click on Windows Firewall. <br />
d) On the left pane, click on "Allow an app or feature through Windows Firewall".<br />
e) Under the Allowed apps and features, look for Store. <br />
f) Make sure you have a click in Private and or Public. <br />
g) Then see if you can open the Windows Store. </div>
<div>If you have a 3rd party Firewall, you may need to change the settings to allow the app through the Firewall.<br />
NOTE: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon
 as you are done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: Check in Clean Boot</strong><br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 8 Release Preview by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />
Step 1: <br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.<br />
d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.<br />
e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.<br />
f) On the ‘Startup’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item that are enabled and select ‘Disable’.<br />
g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.<br />
Step 2: Enable half of the services<br />
a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.<br />
d. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.<br />
Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items <br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem,<br />
Repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.<br />
Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.<br />
Step 6: Resolve the problem.<br />
After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Alternatively, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the
 problem item.<br />
Step 7:<br />
The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions. When the scan is complete, the System File Checker tool indicates whether integrity violations were found. If integrity violations are
 found, the System File Checker tool lets you fix the integrity violations<br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</div>

<h2>            XP SP3&#39;s svchost.exe process hogging lately&#63;</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
<br />
Has anyone noticed Windows XP SP3's svchost.exe is hogging CPU a lot for MS updates? I noticed this today and yesterday to get the latest updates that came out on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance. :)<br />

            Svchost.exe is just a "host" for "services" (i.e., programs that run in the background and are often, but not always, *.dll files).<br />
<br />
If you have XP Pro, open a Command Prompt window (Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd &gt; OK) and type<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; tasklist /svc&nbsp; {press Enter}<br />
<br />
You'll get something like this --&gt; <a href="http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/tasklist.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/tasklist.jpg</a><br />
<br />
You can look up the services in many places; here's a helpful site --&gt; <a href="http://www.blackviper.com/service-configurations/black-vipers-windows-xp-x86-32-bit-service-pack-3-service-configurations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.blackviper.com/service-configurations/black-vipers-windows-xp-x86-32-bit-service-pack-3-service-configurations/</a><br />
(the names that are output from the tasklist command are the "Registry service name" (second column) on Black Viper's lists.<br />
<br />
If you have XP Home, the tasklist command is not available.&nbsp; You'll have to use a third-party tool like
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Process Explorer</a> or <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Process Monitor</a>.&nbsp; Both of those are powerful tools and have bit of a learning curve.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <ul>
<li>Open Task Manager (CTRL+ALT+DEL) and click the Processes tab.&nbsp; </li><li>If there is no column headed "PID," click View &gt; Select Columns and make sure that there is a check in the box for PID (Process Identifier).
</li><li>Click on the header of the "CPU" column to sort.&nbsp; You may have to click twice to get the big users at the top.</li><li>Make sure that the box at the bottom to "Show processes for all users" is checked.</li></ul>
<p>Make a note of the name(s) and PIDs of the processes that are taking a substantial percentage of CPU cycles.&nbsp; Do not forget that "System Idle Process" does not count!&nbsp; System Idle Process is a very simple task run by the CPU to make the total of all processes
 add up to 100%.&nbsp; Thus, if you are not using very much of the CPU's capacity, "System Idle Process" will have a high number, like 97, 98, or 99%.&nbsp; On the other hand, if there is an instance of svchost.exe, for example, that is using 55% of the CPU, "System
 Idle Process" can be no higher than 45% and likely will be a bit lower (because there are other processes running).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There will be several instances of svchost.exe running.&nbsp; This is normal.&nbsp; If you notice that one of them seems to be taking a large percentage of the CPU (and does so for more than a brief moment) make a note of its PID.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then run tasklist /svc as described earlier.&nbsp; Match the PID of the instance that's using the CPU to the instance with the same PID in the list of tasks output by tasklist and you can then see what services are included in that instance of svchost.exe.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For example, say that Task Manager shows that an instance of svchost.exe with PID 940 is taking 95% of your CPU.&nbsp; You run tasklist /svc and get the output as shown here --&gt;
<a href="http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/tasklist.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winhelp2002.mvps.org/tasklist.jpg</a>&nbsp; Examining that output, you see that the process with PID 940 is running 13 separate services.&nbsp; One of those is wuauserv.&nbsp; If you then go to
<a href="http://www.blackviper.com/service-configurations/black-vipers-windows-xp-x86-32-bit-service-pack-3-service-configurations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.blackviper.com/service-configurations/black-vipers-windows-xp-x86-32-bit-service-pack-3-service-configurations/</a>&nbsp; you'll learn that wuauserv is the name of the Automatic Update service ... supporting your suspicion that Automatic Update may be
 part of the problem (of course, your work isn't over yet ... it could be another one of the 13 services running in that instance of svchost.exe ... and once you figure out which service is the problem, you then have to figure out why.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you don't have XP Pro (or even if you do and choose not to use tasklist), Process Explorer and Process Monitor will give you a great deal more information, but using Process Explorer and Process Monitor is beyond what I can get into in this forum.&nbsp; You'll
 have to read up on it yourself.<br />

            Thanks again. So, there's no easy and quick way to figure out which service is hogging in a svchost.exe then especially when there are many.<br />
