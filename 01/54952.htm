<h2>            Problem with creating new partition</h2>
                    I'm trying to create a new in win7 using disk management utility. I already have 3 primary partition and&nbsp; want to create another partition(may be primary), as I know maximum 4 primary partition can be create. Cause the unallocated space is between two
 primary partition 'C' and 'F'. But Im not able to create a&nbsp; simple volume with this unallocated space due to the following error message,
<br />
"<span style="font-weight: bold">You cannot create a new volume in this unallocated space because the disk already contains maximum number of partitions</span>"
<br />
<br />
How can I fix this problem with create a new volume without extending another one?

<h2>            Critical Error - Your Start menu isn&#39;t working. We&#39;ll try to fix it the next time you sign in</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 about a week ago. In the beginning everything worked smoothly and I was very happy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since 5 days I've been receiving the following error when clicking on the Start Menu: "Critical Error - Your Start menu isn't working. We'll try to fix it the next time you sign in.", with a "Sign out now" button as the only option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've signed out and in many times but the problem remains. I've looked through the Microsoft community site and followed all the advises I could find (including "dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth", "sfc /scannow" and various Powershell commands
 - $manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest OR Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage
 -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}) - but nothing helped. Mostly I received something like 'no errors found' except for the case of the first Powershell command above, which gave the following:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Add-AppxPackage : Deployment failed with HRESULT: 0x80073CF6, Package could not be registered.<br />
error 0x80070002: Windows cannot register the package because of an internal error or low memory.<br />
NOTE: For additional information, look for [ActivityId] 27c73c88-d5b1-0007-6941-c727b1d5d001 in the Event Log or use<br />
the command line Get-AppxLog -ActivityID 27c73c88-d5b1-0007-6941-c727b1d5d001<br />
At line:1 char:94<br />
+ ... fest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manife ...<br />
+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + CategoryInfo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : WriteError: (C:\Program File...ppxManifest.xml:String) [Add-AppxPackage], IOException<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + FullyQualifiedErrorId : DeploymentError,Microsoft.Windows.Appx.PackageManager.Commands.AddAppxPackageCommand</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also read somewhere that this problem may have something to do with the login with a Microsoft account, so I tried changing back to local account, but now it still seems to use my MS account while saying it's a local one - trying to switch back is impossible
 (nothing happens when clicking "Sign in with a Microsoft account instead"). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I'm far from being the only one having those problems, but as I've been searching for solutions for days now and couldn't find anything that works I hope something could be done through the community..?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I've installed some Windows 10 updates, hoping that would solve the problem, but unfortunately it didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some further information that might be useful: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>system: HP Z400 workstation with 12GB RAM 64bit</li><li>right click on file explorer (in the taskbar) doesn't show pinned folders, etc.</li><li>right click on start menu shows various options.</li><li>left click on start menu results in the error message mentioned above, OR occasionally in an empty Start menu.</li><li>no apps seem to work - for example if I try to open the calculator I receive the following message: "You'll need a new app to open this calculator". Images open in the old (Windows 7) viewer, while after the upgrade the Windows 10 viewer was used.</li><li>it is possible to use most previously installed software, though I'm being asked every time if I want to use Firefox as my default browser).</li><li>the login screen is in Dutch, which is the local language (I'm based in the Netherlands), though Windows should be in English (Windows 7 was a UK version). Also the update messages were partly in Dutch.</li></ul>
<p>REALLY hope you could help - is there any patch coming from Microsoft, as some suggest?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm starting considering to roll back to Windows 7, which would be very much a pity, but if no good solution comes up I'd have no choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the reset/clean installation solution is certainly not an option!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance and looking forward your reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>BC</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regrets the inconvenience you have experienced. I suspect the issue might due to the corruption in the user profiles. Let follow the below mentioned steps and see if it works:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to add&nbsp;another Microsoft account by following the steps mentioned below and see if the problem persists:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">* Click <strong>Start,</strong> </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">* Navigate to <strong>Settings/&gt;Accounts/&gt;Your Account/&gt; Add a Microsoft account.
</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">* If you have another Microsoft account try to use that or else follow the steps to sign-up for new and switch with new Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">* Sign-out from the old and Login with new Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Once you're sign-in with new </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Microsoft account, then try to perform the actions and check if the problem still occurs. You can remove the existing Microsoft account from there if needed. Check
 and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Please ensure to backup you data if you wish to remove your old Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope this will address your query.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to follow your suggestion, but when clicking on "Add a Microsoft account" nothing happens. This is also the case when I try to click on "Sign in with a Microsoft account instead" under the Local Account/Administrator on the top of that section..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way to change that?</p>

            <p>Good day,</p>
<p style="text-align: left">I hope I can assist you all with your concerns with these troubleshooting steps that I have here. I'm not actually sure about the main cause of the issue but what I have here is a walk around for us to use Windows 10.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">1.&nbsp;Press CTRL+ALT+DEL to launch the task manager (if the windows is minimized click on 'More items'</p>
<p style="text-align: left">&nbsp;on the lower left of the task manager window</p>
<p style="text-align: left">2. Click on 'file' and then select 'Run new task' and tick the box which says, 'Create this task with administrative privileges.'</p>
<p style="text-align: left">3. Type in CMD and then click on 'OK' to open the elevated command prompt</p>
<p style="text-align: left">4.&nbsp;Copy these commands and paste it on the command prompt by&nbsp;doing a right click on the black box please tap on enter after each command. The first command is to create a new profile and the second one is to enable the built in administrator
 account of the computer</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">a.) net user test /add</p>
<p style="text-align: left">b.)&nbsp;net user administrator /active:yes</p>

</p><p style="text-align: left">5. Reboot computer and sign in to administrator&nbsp;(You can see the profiles on the lower left corner of the sign in screen)</p>
<p style="text-align: left">6. Click on the following, 'Start' and then 'Settings' and then 'Accounts' and then 'Family&nbsp;&amp; other users' and then look for the 'test' account click on it and then change account type to administrator</p>
<p style="text-align: left">7.&nbsp;Reboot computer and sign in to 'test' account.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">You can notice that the start button is working fine on this&nbsp;'test' account indicating that&nbsp;it is a problem with the&nbsp;old profile.&nbsp;The reason why I&nbsp;changed the test account&nbsp;type from standard to&nbsp;administrator is for us to have access
 with the old profile's files so that we can transfer those files to this test account. To disable the built in administrator account that we also activated you can follow the steps indicated above to activate it and just replaced the command from 'net user
 administrator /active:yes' to 'net user administrator /active:no'</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">Hope that this will help a lot of people to experience and enjoy Windows 10.</p>

            <p>The reason you have waited two weeks is simple - they don't have an answer to this growing problem. I assure you if they had an answer it would be posted everywhere. I have "fixed" a couple for myself and friends by the adding a new account then coping over
 the settings from the old user account to the new account. This does not give you all of your settings but close. App Data is a hidden directory in the user account. &nbsp;Better than doing nothing. Only one computer fixed with the new user account has had the
 "Critical Error Start not working" reappear&nbsp;in the new account. In that case I downloaded the StarDock's Start10 program which is a Windows 10 Start menu replacement - it works and solved the problem but does not work as well as the original Windows 10 start
 menu - but it works where Microsoft has failed</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw by post dates, here and other places, that Microsoft has been fighting this problem for some time with the beta releases. Seem like they would have not released the program with this problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is doing their best to send us all to Apple - which I in no way want to do but software that does not work is not an acceptable situation for me.</p>

            <p>Hi Billmort,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the extensive reply - yes - I feared it was something like that - though I really can't understand how something like that could still be an issue for such a long time for a giant as Microsoft.. I've been a loyal Windows user for over 20 years
 now, but not being able to use my computer properly, which is essential for my work, is really making me start considering some Mac alternatives, which I am neither happy to think of :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as for the issue itself (fixing the corrupt account) - actually yesterday I've been trying to follow similar steps to the ones you wrote - as described here: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/windows-10-start-menu-not-workingmaybe-have-a/9a173a10-cc96-410c-8a63-fe5e2e979cfe
 but somehow almost managed to render both accounts (the old one AND updated test one) useless. Finally I've been able to restore everything to the way it used to be (but still with the non-responsive start menu and now my GoogleDrive isn't there and reinstalling
 it doesn't help neither..), but I still really want to try it again. </p>
<p>Since I didn't manage and since you wrote you did a few times, I was wondering whether you may have any further tips (I've avoided copying any file containing "Ntuser" in it's name - or should I avoid any others too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>BC</p>

            Owning a game disk has nothing to do with a power cycle. Try fully shutting down the console and unplugging from the power (original Xbox one, from wall socket and back of Xbox) for 60 seconds. Plug back in and power up. If it still happens and only with
 that game, reach out to the developer.

<h2>            Red lines across the screen</h2>
                    I cannot seem to find this question asked anywhere so I will ask it now. Just earlier today, I booted up my computer and started doing things normally. I went online and started to watch a clip from Youtube before the monitor screen started flashing, going
 black and back to the screen and then back to black, while also showing red lines horizontally all across the screen. When it stopped flashing for a bit, the lines were clearly everywhere, almost like code seen similar in the "Matrix" movies. I haven't done
 anything out of the ordinary lately so I doubt its a virus but I did try restarting the computer and the lines are everywhere during shut down and boot up phases. Is it a display driver needing to be updated or do I really have a problem here bigger than a
 driver?

<h2>            Device Manager Refreshing - Related to Network</h2>
                    I noticed slight stutters when gaming recently and while troubleshooting device drivers found that Device Manager was refreshing every 10-12 seconds or so and sometimes two or three times rapidly. These corresponded with the stutters in games. I assumed
 it was a USB hub or device that was flaky but after much troubleshooting, I narrowed it down to the network card. When I disabled it, the refreshes stopped. Then I uninstalled and reinstalled and it was fine for a while but would eventually come back. The
 last time it came back, the uninstall/reinstall did not work at all. I disabled the wired NIC and connected to my wireless network and the same stutter occurred. So, I know it's not the network device but just being connected to the network. Back on wired,
 I decided to try disabling network discovery. That fixed it! However, I noticed my network type was set to public/guest so I switched it over to private and the refreshes came back. I made sure network discovery and file and print sha

            Hi Anthony.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br /> 
<br />Enable IPv6 in the network adapter settings: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enable-disable-ipv6-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the fixit from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852</a> (Re-enable IPv6 on all nontunnel interfaces) and reboot.
<br /> 
<br />Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br /> 
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>

<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />  
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version update then you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcabl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

I updated the NIC driver as part of troubleshooting earlier and it was on an older version before but it didn't help. I had the same issue with the NIC disabled and connected on wifi though too. It's an onboard Intel NIC and wifi/bluetooth. I've tried disabling
 wifi and bluetooth too, but no difference. I'm not actually having the problem now but only while I have the network type set to guest/public and network discovery turned off.

            I have IPv6 enabled. I am not having the issue while my network type is set to guest/public and network discovery is turned off but it did not matter whether I was on wifi or wired and all network drivers (NIC, Wifi and Bluetooth) were outdated when I
 noticed the issue but have now been updated to the current versions from Intel. I am not entirely sure when it started but I first noticed it a couple of months ago and thought I had solved it. I'm not sure how far back I would have to go on system restore
 and since it's not a guaranteed fix, I'd rather not try. The system is new as of January, but I was not gaming on the PC much until recently (New baby in the house so time is limited). The issue refreshes are not really noticeable in non-gaming apps. However,
 Adobe Lightroom also started becoming nearly unresponsive when converting my camera's raw files to DNG some time ago but might just be an Adobe thing... that was not happening when I first started using this PC though. I can try some of the

            Anthony -
<br />
<br />System Restore is your first line of defense if Windows ever malfunctions as it can run even from recovery media to get you back before a problem started.  It should always be turned on C drive with plenty of disk space (5-15%) configured.  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />You can undo a System Restore point if it doesnt' help. 
<br />
<br />If none of the indicated fixes work then I'd go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Do you have software installed to run the NIC?&nbsp; Sometimes if you uninstall the software and use the windows driver only.&nbsp; Then that should help.&nbsp; The problem with intel wifi/bluetooth (I think you have a laptop) is really the software and any updates to
 the intel software.&nbsp; So removing the software, going into device manager to remove the NIC, right clicking and scan new hardware and just allow windows to run it should work.&nbsp; I had a Dell Inspiron where the software was playing up but the device was quite
 fine.&nbsp; I eventually changed it to an Atheros because it had wireless N capability at the time.&nbsp; System restore wont work.

<p><span>Hi phy49,</span></p>
<p><span>It is not possible to move Windows from one partition to another without re-installing Windows. However, you can shrink the other partition to create
 free unallocated space and later extend the Windows drive with the free space created. Or else, you can also create a system image and then format the hard drive and restore it to the drive that has more space.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps below to shrink and then extend a partition.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start, type “diskmgmt.msc” (without quotes), to open Disk Management.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Right click on the partition that you want to shrink to create unallocated space and select “Shrink volume”.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Follow the instructions on your screen and enter the amount you want to shrink in MB (megabytes).</span></p>
<p><span>4. You will see unallocated space after shrinking the partition.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Now, right click on the partition you want to extend and select “Extend volume”.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Follow the instructions on your screen and enter the amount in MB by which you want to extend the partition.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Note:</span></em></strong><em><span>
 You can extend the volume with focus into next contiguous unallocated space. For basic volumes, the unallocated space must be on the same disk as, and must follow (be of higher sector offset than) the partition with focus. In other words, unallocated space
 should be on the immediate right of the volume that you want to extend. A dynamic simple or spanned volume can be extended to any empty space on any dynamic disk. Using this command, you can extend an existing volume into newly created space.</span></em></p>

    <title>How do I disable the touch keyboard while there is a physical keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beardieviking  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I disable the touch keyboard while there is a physical keyboard attached&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro 4 and like to use a bluetooth keyboard with it, but not necessarily a mouse. This means I prefer to keep it in tablet mode as the interface works a lot better for touch. It works fine with physical keyboard in tablet mode, apart from
 it seems to insist that you also use the touch keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the touch keyboard keeps popping up whenever I switch to a window where typing is possible. Sometimes it just flashes on the screen but sometimes it stays open until dismissed or I start typing, which is rather annoying and in some applications
 prevents me from working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how do I get Windows to not show the touch keyboard while there is a physical keyboard attached?</p>

            Are you in tablet mode by chance? Try switching to desktop mode and see if the keyboard stops popping up.

<br />Tap or click notifications icon in the lower-right corner of the window then select or close tablet mode icon to switch

            As I stated, yes I am in tablet mode. I'd prefer to use my tablet in tablet mode, so switching to desktop mode isn't really a fix, but thanks for the suggestion :)

<br />Stop and disable Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Service.

<p>Ok, but wouldn't that mean I have to manually do this (and then re-start it after I've disconnected the keyboard) every time I used a physical keyboard?</p>

</p><p>I found the setting to use the touch keyboard in desktop mode when there is no physical one, I just need help finding the 'opposite' setting.

<p>That did nothing, I am still apparently without an internet connection.</p>
<p>

<p>

            <p>Most likely not, because Windows XP will most likely be unable to deal with the hardware in a new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows XP was released 15 years ago and support for it ended 2 years ago.&nbsp; At some point, hardware manufacturers will decide, if they haven't already decided, that it's not in their interest to spend the resources to provide drivers for Windows XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's not a universal truth, however.&nbsp; Check to see if the computer that you might potentially purchase has Windows XP drivers.&nbsp; If you it does, then you can install Windows XP using your legal copy (assuming that legal copy is not an OEM version that was
 already used on another computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>A possible option is to buy a computer with Windows 7 Professional pre-installed.&nbsp; A diminishing number of these are still available, for example:
<a href="http://outlet.us.dell.com/ARBOnlineSales/Online/SecondaryInventorySearch.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dfb&amp;cs=28&amp;key=aFCHatj6DNUDC9ckT%2b%2bvoixoGa8vdlU9&amp;puid=adbffa4e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ONE</a>, <a href="http://outlet.us.dell.com/ARBOnlineSales/Online/SecondaryInventorySearch.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dfb&amp;cs=28&amp;key=gmAEb36C2NnP6%2f3Iw3Y4yw%3d%3d&amp;puid=e43e0655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TWO</a>, <a href="http://outlet.us.dell.com/ARBOnlineSales/Online/SecondaryInventorySearch.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dfb&amp;cs=28&amp;key=aFCHatj6DNUX4Tztk6rumobUFGmGIhar&amp;puid=27245b49" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
THREE</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then download (free) Microsoft's XP Mode for Windows 7 Pro --&gt; <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8002</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>XP Mode gives you a fully-licensed installation of XP Pro running in a virtual machine hosted on your Windows 7 Pro box.&nbsp; This will run almost all software that "needs XP" unless, of course, that "industrial equipment" needs some special low-level interface
 to the hardware.</p>

    <title>Internal Camera not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angelabear  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internal Camera not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My internal Camera has stopped working. There was nothing which I can say was the catalyst for this, it was just working one day for Skype meetings and next day, not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Device Manager, under Imaging devices, in order to make my camera show up there, I have to go into "View" and "Show hidden devices", for my camera to show up. When it shows (HD WebCam), it shows a 'greyed out', as though it is there, 'somewhere' but,
 perhaps in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed a YouTube instruction which advised to 'uninstall the driver' and then restart and stated that it would come back again - it did
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">not</span>! So I Googled other support which told me to 'right click' on HD WebCam and go into 'Properties', the message currently in "General" is "Currently, this hardware device is not connected to the computer. (Code
 45)". So I followed instructions to 'update drivers' but, apparently, I already have all the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, again I Googled, "I accidentally deleted my inbuilt camera drivers" - 'this' website came up with some answers, I followed the solutions and, hey, the camera made an appearance again under 'Imaging devices', however, still greyed out.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I looked for another solution and found one which stated to just 'restart' my laptop and&nbsp;the camera would&nbsp;return - and, hey, it did, but only for an immediate Skype meeting today&nbsp;then it disappeared again for the next meeting which was a few hours later
 and my laptop had had continuous use during this period - so had not gone to sleep or been turned off etc., (the laptop that is) just continuous use and the WebCam disappeared again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards,</p>
<p>Angela</p>

<p>Hello Angela,</p>
<p>
</p><p>An outdated camera driver could be one of the reasons why your camera isn't working as expected. As an initial troubleshooting step, we suggest that you run the
<strong><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">troubleshooter for devices and hardware</a></strong> and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, can you please verify if you have tried updating your camera driver directly from the manufacturer's website? If not, kindly do so. After ensuring that the correct driver is installed, check if the device is recognized in the Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 freezes randomly</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Win 10 freezes randomly and i need to restart my PC to get back to work. It's extremely annoying!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Win 10 Pro Version 1703 Os build 15063.540; CPU i7-6800K 3.40 GHz; SSD and I set to never switch off HDD power.</p>
<p>I did reinstall win 10 twice.</p>
<p>I followed the instructions here: https://appuals.com/fix-windows-10-freezes-randomly/ but I still experience the same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can somebody tell me what is wrong with Win 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Dominik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be caused by software conflicts. As an initial workaround, we suggest performing a clean boot&nbsp; to eliminate software conflicts. Refer to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to know how to perform a clean boot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, you can try doing a repair upgrade of Windows 10 and see if it will resolve the issue. Refer to this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">Forum Article</a></strong> created by Andre

<p>Hi Anne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately after a clean boot and Win 10 repair I still get my system to freeze. I've been testing it for the past few days and i get 2-3 freezes a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have more suggestions?</p>

<p>Hi Dominik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to further isolate the issue about the freezing of your PC, we need additional information. Have you made any recent hardware or software changes to your computer prior to this issue?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest that you start your PC in safe mode and see if the computer is still freezing. Here's the

    <title>Windows 8.1 Pro x64 USB3.0 acting like USB2.0 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seannnnn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Pro x64 USB3.0 acting like USB2.0</h2>
                    Essentially I my problems arose when I switched from Win7 to Win8.<br />
I could transfer at very high speeds on USB3.0 no problem on Win7 using Mobo Drivers.<br />
Then I upgrade to windows 8 Pro (clean install using disk), I notice that there are no USB drivers on the manufacturer website, and I do a quick search to find out that windows 8 supposedly natively supports USB3.0. Anyway, I thought nothing of it and upgraded
 to 8.1, then once that was done I wanted to transfer some large files, and I notice I'm getting a maximum speed of ~32 MB/s, so I plug into USB 2.0 port and get the same speed.
<br />
I repeated this with every 3.0 port on my computer and got the same results. I even used a 2.0 device and it got the same speeds as well.<br />
<br />
Things I've tried: <br />
I uninstalled ALL motherboard drivers, (never had any USB drivers) and as expected that didn't help.<br />
I also used device manager to uninstall all my usb root hubs and reinstalled them to no avail.<br />
I've restarted my computer multiple times<br />
Looked into poking around with the registry but I didn't find anything helpful there<br />
<br />
I know it isn't:<br />
My motherboard <br />
The ports<br />
My device<br />
These were all working when I had Windows 7<br />
<br />
This absolutely has to be a software related issue, I'm sure of it.<br />
If anybody has had a similar situation or has any advice, I'd greatly appreciate your input.<br />
<br />
Build(Custom):<br />
Motherboard - ASRock z87 Extreme6 Gen4<br />
Windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit<br />
Using a WD Passport (3.0) &amp; several USB flash drives (3.0 also)<br />
If you need more info on the other components ask and I'll update it, but this was all that seemed necessary at the time.<br />

            <p>Hi Sean,</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chipset drivers incorporate drivers for USB as well. So I would suggest you to download and install the chipset drivers for Windows 8.1 Operating System. If drivers for Windows&nbsp;8.1 are not available, then you may download and&nbsp;install Windows 7/Windows 8
 drivers in compatibility mode and check if it helps.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z87%20Extreme6/?cat=Download&amp;os=Win8a64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z87%20Extreme6/?cat=Download&amp;os=Win8a64</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If chipset drivers are not available in the motherboard manufacturer website, I would suggest you to contact Processor manufacturer website. Download and install chipset drivers for your computer model and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>To install the chipset driver in compatibility mode, I would suggest you to follow these steps.</font></span></b></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>a.
</font><font><font><b>Download </b>the latest chipset driver for Windows 7/Windows 8 from the manufacturer’s website and save it on your local disk.<br />
<br />
b. <b>Right-click </b>on the setup file of the driver and select “<b>Properties</b>”.<br />
<br />
c. Select “<b>Compatibility</b>” Tab.<br />
<br />
d. Place a <b>check mark </b>next to “<b>Run this program in Compatibility mode</b>” and
<strong>select Windows 7/Windows 8</strong></font> from the drop down list.<br />
<br />
e. Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</font></span></p>

            Thanks for the reply,<br />
Unfortunately ASRock doesn't have any downloads for win8 that I don't already have installed.<br />
Also, I tried running several setups from win7 versions that ASRock had, and Intel chipset drivers in compatibility mode. It gave me an error message saying that my Operating System didn't meet the minimum requirements to install it.<br />

            Hi Eduard.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Set the Windows Boot Manager first to boot always in a UEFI system, then trigger the media to boot using only the BIOS Boot Menu key for your PC brand here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />This avoids the flash stick restarting install when it reboots the PC during install.  If you are forced to set the UEFI flash stick in the UEFI Setup shown in your picture then you MUST unplug the flash stick during these restarts to avoid this.  But it is no longer correct to set it in the Boot Priority Order list, where the Windows Boot Manager must stay set to boot first always.  
<br />
<br /> During a Custom install, at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space, then highlight the space to Click Next which automates formatting and begins install to make it foolproof.   
<br />
<br />This is all  illustrated in the Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows 10 has disabled several setting on my monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ldkramer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 has disabled several setting on my monitor</h2>
                    <p>I am vividly unhappy with my display since upgrading(?) to windows 10. Settings such as contrast and auto-adjust have become “unavailable”. When I swap the monitor back to my old XP pc it works just fine so it is not the monitor (Samsung 2232GW). I have
 re-loaded drivers from Samsung with no correction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The root of all of this is the painful reduction of visual options in Win 10. There are so few ways to adjust and personalize your windows it feels like having a Ferrari with XP and being reduced to tricycle with a flat tire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft PLEASE give back our abilities to FULLY personalize our PCs!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a degenerative eye issue that makes all of this a nightmare to use my new PC. I guess I should have jumped ship and gone to Apple like everyone told me to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hate nearly everything about Win 10, I even tried to install my old XP disks to the new PC but Win 10 PREVENTED me from doing so… very shady Microsoft!&nbsp;</p>

            hello TheFreeOne,
<br />Avast in really well known for bad détections and causes lots of troubles in W10.
<br />The solution is tu uninstall that problematic antivirus with avastclear and use Windows Defender

            Hi TFO.    I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends Avast since it bloated up and started causing issues 8 years ago and every expert stopped recommending it.  
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanner install and run a full scan with Malwarebytes free scanner: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />You can turn off the free trial at any time in the app's Settings &gt; Accounts.  
<br />
<br />Then once you have the bloatware removed see what Defender and Malwarebytes say about the driver update, which is likely a false positive.  The last word I'd take is Avast.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
<br />If you receive a popup asking if this solved your problem please ignore it, as it may remove my ability to help you and others may also not help.  Please wait until after the issue is resolved to answer the popup or mark your question answered to help others.

            Do you currently or have ever in the past used DriverBooster?
<br />Are you downloading from Windows update or a third party program?
<br />If neither then yes you may have a virus.
<br />An .exe is a program intended to install a program but it can be used to install a virus along with the program.
<br />If the url is being blacklisted by Avast check the url here: <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/#/home/url" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.virustotal.com/#/home/url</a>

<p>Do you have any Slimware Driver or Cleaner utilities installed? I had hoped you'd run Malwarebytes by now which would have found and quarantined any Slimware or other related PUP's, so please don't ignore the steps I gave you but follow them, as they are
 based on ten years experience helping in forums daily. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Slimware installed at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, click on it to Uninstall, restart the PC and then run Malwarebytes scan, clean up whatever it finds until it runs without finding anything.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then run System File Checker from https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-use-sfc-scannow-to-repair-windows-system-files-2626161</p>

</p><p><span><span>Thank you for making me aware that a change in security permissions for the Windows Media Center storage location “Recorded TV” will prevent the Windows Media Center Receiver Service and Windows Media Center Scheduler Service from starting and
 restarting as it should.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I have two Windows 7 computers on which I use Windows Media Center. I had a look at the Security Permissions under Properties for the “Recorded TV” folder on both computers and confirmed that the security permission had been changed on the computer
 on which I was having issues.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>It seems that giving “Network Service”<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>read/write permission as jk sdkfj did is not the only group/user name for which you have to change security permissions. Rather than add the ehSched and ehRecvr group/user
 name and whatever else may be missing from the list of group or user names under the Security tab and allow the correct permissions manually, there is a much simpler solution.</span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for bringing up your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I realize this may be frustrating. Now that you have me with you, let me take care of this.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Have you installed any third party security software on your computer?</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>An outdated or incompatible network adapter driver can cause connection problems. If you recently upgraded to Windows&nbsp;10, it's possible that the current driver was designed for a previous version of Windows.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sometimes, security software like Antivirus and firewall can cause this issue.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have installed any third party security software, I suggest you to
<span>disable the antivirus software (and any other security software) and firewall on the computer as a test and check if that fixes the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer</strong><span>: Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</span></span></span></p>

</p><p>I tried everything you suggested and have finally come to the conclusion, that it is nothing to do with my machinery. &nbsp;I have contacted my ISP supplier once more and finally they are sending out a 'specialist broadband engineer' because at last they have

<p>I'm having the same issue w/ Archer. The exact same problem happened to me before earlier in the month, and it seems to have happened again.
</p>
<p>Re: my situation - I bought the season pass for Archer, but the latest episode (which aired five days ago) is only available in the market place for purchase, meaning that I can only view it if I pay essentially for the same content twice. I've contacted
 the support analysts something like 6 times, and while each one has been polite, they each had but one solution to proffer: clear my cache and my digital rights database and try again - which had no effect,</p>
<p>Each bout has been about an hour w/ the online support folks. </p>
<p>The price of a season pass is comparable to buying the dvds and is billed as a substitute or improvement over watching it on cable. My experience has been neither and entirely unsatisfactory for two reasons:
</p>
<p>1) Unpredictability of Content Release. The unreliability/uncertainty of when content will actually be available when the system does work. Episodes seem to be made available for season pass holders at random times. I understand that this is a function of
 the deal MS worked out w/ FX and that FX controls when the content "goes live," but it was shortsighted of MS not to insist on a release time or window in their contract.
</p>
<p>2) Unsolved System Glitches. A broken system for managing that content. I am grateful for the individual analysts and they were very professional, but it was immediately clear that there does not seem to be an established diagnosis for why season pass holders
 cannot view content even when it is release to the marketplace. It appears to be a glitch and one that MS has not been able to either a) identify and/or b) permanently fix - leaving customer and support person alike to sit in befuddled awe of what should not
 be a problem in the first place.</p>
<p>An analogy is like going to a store that does not keep regular hours or their shelves stocked. If you want to go buy milk, but the store is randomly closed or doesn't have milk available to sell, you stop going to that store because it's a waste of time
 and energy. Same principle applies here.</p>
<p>After this experience, I will not be purchasing any more season passes on Xbox Live. I had been an evangelist for Xbox Live, telling folks about how great it had been to buy content from MS instead of paying skyhigh cable bills, but no more. I cannot in
 good conscience recommend this service for others, nor while I continue to be a patron myself, especially when there are so many competing services offering the same product. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Have you tried refreshing your purchase history? &nbsp;I noticed in your thread that they suggested you clear your cache and delete the rights database, but didn't see anything about purchase history refreshing. &nbsp;This will typically resolve the problem where
 the episode is asking you to pay for it again when you've already purchased the Season Pass.</p>

<p>That seems to have done the trick. </p>
<p>I only wish that the six analysts I spoke to before had that information before I spent something like 5-7 seven hours working with the various staff members to isolate the problem.
</p>
<p>Perhaps MS would do well to make sure this information was disseminated to the entire support team. The last analyst I spoke w/ was extremely kind, but was only aware of isolated cases involving the Walking Dead show. She did not seem to know whether this
 issue was systemic or whether any other cases &nbsp;had been reported. </p>
