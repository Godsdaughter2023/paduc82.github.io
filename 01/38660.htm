<h2>            Windows 10 is not launching .exe files and I&#39;ve tried everything</h2>
                    So I've been using Windows 10 for a while and 4 days ago I was having 100% disk usage problems. I determined that this was caused by my anti-malwarebytes, Avast. I have since deleted Avast and the problem was fixed. However, I tried to launch some of my
 .exe files, borderlands 2 and chummer 5 (a game and an RPG character sheet maker) and found that they weren't launching. Originally I tried reinstalling my Display Adapter but it didn't work. I found that when I ran the .exe files they would stay in the background
 on task manager and would cause my disk usage to shoot up to 100%. Task manager said that the background launchers weren't using CPU, memory, or disk, but when I forced the launcherd to end the disk would return to normal. I have tried many different fixes:
 I've reinstalled windows 10, checked for malwarebytes using avast and malwarebytes (not installed at the same time), I've defragmented my disk, and gone through most of the solutions on this site (except the creating a new u

            Hi Humam.  I'm Greg, an 8 year Microsoft Windows MVP, here to help you.
<br />
<br />1) Please work through this Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs are done: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />2) If any steps cannot be performed then try whichever method works to enter Safe Mode with Networking which may work better to perform the steps:  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2984712/windows/how-to-enter-windows-10s-safe-mode.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2984712/windows/...</a>
<br />
<br />3) If no  Safe Mode, from the Advanced Startup Options use the Command Prompt at boot to run the Repair Commands in the Checklist:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If nothing else works then you can reinstall Windows while keeping your files, programs and most settings by running a Repair Upgrade. Install the Media Creation Tool from this link, choose Upgrade Now, follow the prompts:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   If this doesn't help, do it over and choose to Save Nothing, which comes close to a Clean Install but doesn't clear the hard drive to get it cleanest.  
<br />
<br />The Repair Upgrade in Step 3 will also update you to the latest Version 1803 (which you need anyway) if you don't yet have it, and by the most stable method. 
<br />
<br />4) Or you can create the bootable media to do the gold standard Clean Install in this link, which compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />5) There is also an automated Refresh which reinstalls Windows while leaving out the factory bloatware that throttles Windows and causes endless issues, lets you save your files.  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            fingerprint sign in</h2>
                    A few days ago I set up windows hello on my device and it was working. I was signing in with a fingerprint and all that. But it's not giving me an option to sign in with a fingerprint anymore so I went to account settings and signing in options and it
 said that windows hello is not compatible with my device. I find that very interesting since literally yesterday I was able to sign in with a fingerprint (meaning that my device was compatible but it suddenly isn't anymore).

    <title>Not enough memory SSD - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mgp01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not enough memory SSD -</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard"><span>I purchased a new computer from HP Win10, 64bit, 16GB RAM with 1TB SSD hard drive. I was shocked that after just a few
 days it gave an error message "Not enough memory." (COMPLETE SOLUTION BELOW.)</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>After some research, I opened DiskManager (</span>diskmgmt.msc) and THOUGHT I saw that the computer had a partition in
 the hard drive leaving only 120GB in the C:\ and 900+GB in a drive labeled D:\ (Data). I could not extend the C:\ because the D:\ was not "on the right side" of C:\ . Deleting the D:\ just left unallocated space which was also not on the "right side" and there
 for could not be used for extension.</p>
<p>I reinstalled Windows but the "partition" remained.&nbsp;<span>I have had HP computers for years and until now they have had an impeccable record in helping
 me and backing up their product. So I got on chat with HP support hoping for a quick solution.</span></p>
<p><span>The first Tech I spoke told me to BUY high end support from HP!! for a NEW purchased computer with extended warranty... YIKES.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I finally got through to a second guy who assured me he knew all about hard drives and my problem and ultimately told me that they would mail me a new Windows media disk in
 5-7 days for a re-install!! I could only get it sooner if I purchased the disk.... NOT HAPPY. I told him I was doubtful that it would solve the problem (because I already did a Windows reinstall) but he assured me that it would. I insisted that he could and
 should send the disk overnight or provide a download link, but he was insistent&nbsp;that was the best he could do and refused to allow me to talk to his supervisor.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>After some thought, I realized I could download Win10 directly from MS, which I did onto a thumbdrive and reinstalled Windows from there. IT DIDN'T WORK, the SSD memory allocation
 remained.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Then, thank you God, I was inspired. I remembered something from years ago working with BIOS. I saw on DiskManager "Drive 0" and "Drive 1" and the light went on and I realized
 this stupid computer has TWO SSDs!!&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The smaller one had Windows and was C:\ UGGH!</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>SO... if you have this problem, you can figure it out yourself, as I did (thanks to combining other postings and wasting time with some really bad methods) or do the following
 (why this isn't done automatically for us, I have no idea):</span></span></span></p>
<p>1. &nbsp;In your D:\ create a new USER folder. If you have multiple users, combine them under one folder called USERS (it is better to use standard Windows
 file names).&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Open BOTH folders, C:\[USER1] and D:\[USER1] in separate windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;COPY all files from the C:\ [USER 1] to D:\ [USER 1].</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Delete the ONLY the OneDrive folder from [USER 1] (We will come back to this)</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Go to the first file in C:\[USER1] and right click then click "Properties"</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;Click the Location tab, click "Move" and then navigate to the SAME folder in D:\[USER 1] and select it. Back in the Location Tab, Click OK. The C:\ folder should DISAPPEAR and Windows will now recognize the new folder in D:\ [USER1] as the Windows folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. This is TRICKY... Open OneDrive and associate the NEW OneDrive folder in D:\[USERNAME 1] with it. The option to select a new folder (D:\) is in one of the first screens, after putting in your MS account info, but it is VERY SMALL hyperlink and you have
 to go slow and look for it, DO NOT speed through the process!! If you get to the screen where you pick the files to sync and didn't change the drive, exit out and start over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE:</p>
<p>DO NOT delete the USERS folder or [USER NAMES] in C:\</p>
<p>The file "Roaming" will NOT relocate, nor will hidden files (e.g. Application Data). Just leave them alone.</p>
<p>IF YOU MAKE A MISTAKE like I did by moving a Windows User file to the wrong folder, you can first try to move it to the right one or (like I did) re-install Windows and start over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of Luck!!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Jeizas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately E105 system errors usually cannot be troubleshooted and will need to be repaired or replaced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have tried all of the suggested troubleshooting on this thread then the next option would be to service the Xbox through Microsoft device support or upgrade to a new console. Follow this support guide to help you with the repair process:

<h2>            Xbox One turns on but does not connect to TV</h2>
                    
<p><span>My Xbox One powers on, and the light stays on and isn't flashing and connects to my controller, but it won't display on the TV. My TV tells me that it isn't getting a signal from the Xbox. I went out and got a new HDMI chord thinking maybe that was

<p>This didn't happen until a game I was playing froze. I tried exiting out of the game by going back to the home screen, but that didn't let me do anything, so I tried restarting the console. That is when I started having issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>As the HDMI cable has been disconnected it's always just worth checking that the cable is in the correct HDMI port on the xbox, it's the port nearest to the power lead.</p>

<p>having exact same problem which started today. done everything from using different t.v.s, to switching ports and devices, re-booted, and still my xbox isn't recognized by t.v. &nbsp;mine asks "is xbox turned on, can't find device". yes, it's on,!!! it seems
 to have lost whatever ability to be recognized. and support techs have no solution to change that fact. Do not want to restore to factory and lose everything- don't know if that would even work to fix. if anyone knows of a solution please HelP.!! thanx</p>

<p>With the xbox powered off press and hold the bind button and eject button, press the power button, keep bind and eject held, do you get a page of options open up at all ?</p>
<p>If all else fails a factory reset is always worth a shot, you can do that using a USB flash drive, see link below.</p>

<p>I am having the same problem, the console is sent to repair 2 days ago and waiting now.</p>
<p>Here is my story.</p>
<p>I bought xbox one s 2tb at launch, it was working fine on my full hd samsung led tv (5 series), playing almost everyday, and week ago i bought new tv. Samsung tv 7series suhd 4k. I set the resolution to 4k, Console was working fine on my old tv (1080p),
 After playing forza horizon 3 demo and fifa 17 demo i lost signal, i rebooted and got the &nbsp;signal back, but when i turned on console the next time i wanted to play, i could know get the signal, tried diffrent hdmi cables and tvs but no signal on screen, every
 possible way to fix but no way to be found to fix the problem.</p>
<p>I personally think that having console on 4k resolution for few days or playing new games demos like forza horizon 3 and fifa 17 got graphic adaptor or hdmi port something that triggered this issue. Lets hope that this does not happens when i receive it
 back.</p>

<p><br />
From the hadrware device manufacturer.&nbsp; You visit their web page, you find the device in the downloads section, you find the operating system you use for said download and you download and install said drivers.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
So - if I am correct - your support for that device comes from Motorola.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
They may or may not support Windows 7 for that device, but only they can tell you that.<br />

<p>Right-click on your desktop, select Properties. Go to the Settings tab. Under the little monitor it should show something like "NEC 430v on NVIDIA GeForce 9600 GT." In this case, it's a Nvidia 9600GT.</p>
<p>If you have a notebook, it may show a little differently. Go to Start, Settings, Control Panel, and open System. Go to the Hardware tab, then click on Device Manager. Click on the + sign next to Display Adapters and you'll see yours. Double-click on it and
 go to the Driver tab. That will show you who the driver manufacturer is and what version is installed. Then you can go to your PC manufacturer's site (if it's a notebook or an onboard video chip in a PC) for drivers, or if it's an add-in card, go to the card
 manufacturer's site for newer drivers.</p>
<p>Is there any particular problem you are having that makes you want an updated driver, or are you just trying to stay current?</p>

<h2>            Since Win10 PC freezes and black screen in certain games but not graphic intense other ones</h2>
                    <p>I've an odd problem since upgrading to Windows 10 a few weeks back. The screen goes black and then starts switching between analog/HDMI as if looking for the signal before it goes into sleep mode. The sound freezes, PSU fan keeps running, no windows dump
 file is generated (tried WhoCrashed) and no "did not shut down properly" message comes up. Only way of getting it back to react is hot restart, keyboard etc is all dead.</p>
<br />
<p>The system is fine mostly in idle mode but sometimes (rarely, twice in the last two weeks) the same freeze happens even when in idle mode. I have the suspicion it might be the graphics related, the games it crashes now in have played fine under Windows 7
 64bit. The card is only a few weeks older than the Win10 upgrade but maybe this is a graphics driver problem under Win10? Especially since Landmark is a DX10 game with very little graphics performance needs and Subnautica is DX9 or 11 and freezes the same
 - while BDO (DirectX11) with very high demands runs perfectly fine for hours. In the games it does crash in, it either happens after roughly 5-10 minutes or nothing happens for hours. But usually it just takes a few minutes and that was it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sleep mode works well on the PC and this is neither hibernate nor sleep (different fan/reboot behavior).<br />
I've run HW64info in logging mode and all seems perfectly normal, temp is fine, CPU volt core is a bit jumping (between 1.375V which it is most of the time to 1.475V which is according to EasyTune 6 the target value ... is that normal)? I've run Memtest quite
 extensively and found nothing.<br />
<br />
My PSU is old so I'm going to replace it now but as I said, it looks fine in HW64info besides the few cases where it switches to 1.475V suddenly for a few seconds. CPU cores are at 20-30% when that happens. So it crashes long before any values of CPU/GPU even
 go above 50% - but I don't know if the HW64info log contains entries from right when it freezes/crashes, there might be a peak it does not catch?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the specs:<br />
BeQuiet 500W E6 (as I said, I'm replacing that)<br />
16 GB Ram, dual channel 4x4 (2x Skrill, 2x Corsair, exactly same specs)<br />
Gigabyte 990xa-UD3<br />
Phenom II X6 1055T<br />
MSI GTX 960<br />
Windows 10 x64<br />
<br />
All drivers up to date as is bios firmware. Graphics drivers are Nvidia 368.39.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a suggestion?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps: No overclocking or any of that whatsoever, the system runs on normal default settings.</p>

            <p>Some update.</p>
<p>I've replaced the PSU on the weekend as planned. The game I had the black screen/dead PC every few minutes into starting it had an update at the same time. At least Sunday it ran smoothly for hours. Not sure if it was the patch or the PSU.</p>
<p>Another game I had infrequently the same problems in full screen (but not in window mode) I had no issues Sunday since replacing the PSU. No patch there but I had no time yesterday, not convinced yet it was enough time to assess if the problem is really
 gone for this one too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After going over the readings from HWinfo with the old PSU and the new PSU I realized that the readings are not 100% identical, the old PSU was always a bit below 3.3V - not a lot but 3.292V usually. The new PSU is at 3.31V mostly.</p>
<p>Not sure if that indeed could make such a difference but since the 3.3V rail supplies the graphic card too ...?</p>

<p>Hi Pete,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need more information so that we can identify the cause of the issue. What is the OS of your other device? If it's not the same as your Windows 10, it's possible that this might be a compatibility issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hi Radney, thanks.. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the latest IOS on the phone/ipad and Windows7 at my laptop.. everything works fine</p>
<p>On my desktop, windows10 is running. I've deleted and uninstalled EVERYTHING which had to do with Apple and cleared all the registries. Installing the Icloudsetup.exe brings me to the setup and log-on screen. Then it's done. No settings screen shows-up (where
 I can choose what to synchronize). Starting&nbsp; Icloud in the menu, shows me nothing, but a icon is opened at the right bottom where i can choose t open Icloud on the web or open my settings.. clicking on "open icloud settings"&nbsp; return no action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a week ago I've executed the clean resetting of windows10 so everything should be at the latest versions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your support, this is really weird.. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards, Peter. </p>
        </p>

<p>Thank you for the information. It seems that the issue is with iCloud's compatibility with Windows 10. It is best to contact Apple/iCloud support regarding this issue, you can also ask if there's a version of iCloud that is recommended for the latest Windows
 10 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted.</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360s Freezing&#47;Lagging Badly</h2>
                    Hi everyone. This morning I decided to play some xbox, right? I turn on my tv, my console, my controller. I sign into my account. I stay on the profile page for about 30 seconds. After a while, I freeze on the main menu, and can't do anything. Just freezes
 up for an hour or more. Help?

<p>Check if there are any corrupt files on your storage device.</p>
<p>Go to settings - &gt; System -&gt; Storage</p>
<p>Then select your storage device then look for corrupt files. They usually have a yellow exclamation mark by them.</p>
<p>Delete all corrupt files you find then see things improve.</p>
<p>Also you should clear the system cache which you do by highlighting the storage device, &nbsp;pressing 'Y' then select 'Clear system cache'</p>

<p>Malacath is spot on with his answer the only thing I can add to that is... Make sure your xbox is in an &nbsp;open, well-ventilated area, away from all other electronic devices. Also &nbsp;your screen freeze problem might be related to your hard drive. To see if this
 is the case, temporarily remove the hard drive. For more information and solutions about xbox's freezing please visit

 an error message is displayed&nbsp; that says 'Windows Module Installer&nbsp; has stopped working and needs to close' then the updater freezes and never completes the update. The Update log gives the following information.<br />

            If you dont want to go this way you should call dell and request a recovery media replacement.&nbsp;
<div>And maybe ask for a straight copy of the OS without any OEM software or any settings changed. ( a retail copy of the DVD)</div>

            Hi k8_jackson, that folder is created by Windows Update, when you upgrade Windows 10 or get a major update.
<br />
<br />Check inside this folder, to make sure you have all your files out of that folder before you delete it:
<br />
<br />C:\Windows.old\Users\
<br />
<br />Then you can safely delete that folder, to remove that folder, use Disc Cleanup:
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer
<br />Click on your hard drive
<br />On the Manage Tab, click Cleanup
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete
<br />
<br />Start Disk Cleanup again
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />This time in the resulting dialog, click 'Cleanup System Files'
<br />Let Disk Cleanup run another scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete

            Hello G. Mark,
<br />
<br />You can run the windows disk clean up until it’s to clean up installation files and caches.

<br />
<br />It is also recommend that you bigger files that you are no longer using, such program installers, movies etc.
<br />
<br />I also like to use a third party program called WindirStat that shows me exactly where my data is. It can help find old files/programs that I once installed and forgot existed. You can read more about that here: <a href="https://windirstat.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windirstat.net/</a>
<br />
<br />Good luck,

            Hi G.Mark,
<br />
<br />I would first recommend running a disk cleanup to find any temporary data such as logs, cached files etc. You can do this by following the below steps:
<br />- Open Settings
<br />- Select System
<br />- Select Storage (left-hand side)
<br />- Select Free up space now (under the Storage sense heading)
<br />- Tick the option it presents (read their descriptions if you are unsure of what they are)
<br />
<br />I would also then use TreeSize to see where your data usage (sorted by size): <a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />
<br />Please let me know how this goes.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan

<h2>            White Box in Outlook 2016 after computer goes to sleep</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a white / blank box that appears in Outlook 365 after my computer goes to sleep. The only way to get it to go away is restarting Outlook. It doesn't seem to be the Send / Receive dialog. When I press ESC nothing happens. Any ideas how to fix this?</p>
