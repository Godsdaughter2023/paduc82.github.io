<h2>            Call of duty ghosts installing problem&#40;s&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, i hope someone can help;</p>
<p>i recently bought a brand new disc copy of cod ghosts for xb1. When inserting the disc at 46% installed i get an error saying install stopped, disc may be dirty etc. The disc is fine.</p>
<p>other games have installed fine. I have tried installing 'offline' but still the install fails at 46% - the disc cant possibly be the issue as its not got a mark on it. Ive unplugged the Xbox at the wall and still doesnt work.</p>

<p>please help!!</p>

<p>Hello and while uncertain if your issue has been resolved I would like to offer a potential solution. I see you unplugged the system, but for how long and did you do a full power cycle? If not here are the steps to perform it:</p>
<p><strong>Follow these steps to power cycle your Xbox One Console:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>While the console is on, press and hold the console’s&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;button for 5 seconds.</strong>
</li><li><strong>The console will power down.</strong> </li><li><strong>Wait 30 seconds, and then turn your console back on by again pressing the&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;button.</strong>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note&nbsp;If your console is in Instant-On power mode, the above steps will shut the console completely off. Instant-On mode, or the ability to turn on your console by saying “Xbox On,” won’t be enabled until you restart the console.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>Please let me know if this helps you out and if not I will gladly work with you to find a resolution.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How much hard drive space do you have? I am asking just because it could potentially be a size issue. And no problem btw. I will keep working with you until we get you online and enjoying your game.

<p>Also Radebe57 I would recommend disconnecting the internet, doing the power cycle, and then install the game. Don't connect the internet until after the install. That way it installs only the game and not updates first.

<p>Well currently with cod installed 43% i have 304 gb free. Plenty right?</p>
<p>Ive tried to install when not connected to the internet and still it stops at 43% . Its insisting its the disc but i honestly dont think so. The disc is almost flawless and other games ive got have been preowened and worked fine!</p>

<p>But have you tried to install offline after doing a fresh power cycle? It could make a difference. And yes you certainly have plenty of space to install COD. And while rare yes the disc data could still be corrupted regardless of no scratching or damage
 to the physical surface. Did you buy this at a local video game store or big chain? If so surely they have a policy regarding an exchange.

<p>Im sure i could exchange it but have a feeling its nothing to do with the disc. I suppose i will try though i do feel this is more of an xbox issue, ive never known a brand new disc fail before</p>

<p>While it could be uncommon and still could be something with the system I am just not sure with other games working just fine correct? I am just trying to eliminate options to ensure we cover our bases and look at all the issues and facts at hand. Let me
 know if you do go the route of switching the game disc out and let me know if the problem persists. Again I am committed to resolving this issue and getting you online.

<p>I decided to go back to the store and swap the disc. It has now installed. Really odd though as the original disc was brand new and in a sealed box!

<h2>            Lista negra</h2>
                    
<p>Quais os jogos que vcs se arrependeram de comprar e pq</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Um jogo que não recomendo pra ninguém é The King of Fighters XII</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Além do jogo não ter sequência na história. Parece que foi feito as pressas. Gráficos mediocres pq apesar de ser em 2D era em baixa resolução. E os movimentos eram todos borrados. O multiplayer travava demais. Sendo impossível fazer as conquistas em multiplayer.
 E nem dava graça jogar. Você enfrentava apenas 5 equipes e nem tinha um chefão fodão. Mto fraco essa edição.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>Se alguém se interessar....kkkk</p>

<p>é, NFS já foi bom... sinto falta mesmo do NFSU, mas até o NFS MW clássico ta valendo</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>fallout 3 está na minha lista dos descartados, eu peguei o game pois também o pessoal falava bem, que era legal, até li "umas coisas" a respeito dele e fui pegar pra ver como era... '-' que era aquilo?! não gostei de nada do que vi, graficos, jogabilidade,
 até história e talvez o pior, as quests, sempre eram tarefas que requeria muito mais de mim do que tinha a disposição (armas, Lvl, skils, basicamente tudo), enfim, esse game não deu certo para mim, outro que por conta desse eu prefiro evitar é Skyrim, falam
 bem dele assim como falavam do Fallout, que alias ele se assemelha ao outro...</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>outro que eu não gostei foi Marvel vs. Capcom 3, comprei ele na verdade pensando no arcade Marvel vs. Street Fighter, pensei que ia encontrar a mesma coisa, acabei vendo que não se tratava do game que eu queria...</p>

<p>Arrepender de nenhum, mas jogos ruins...</p>
<p>Mindjack- acho que é o pior jogo que tenho para o XBox 360, jogabilidade travada, jogo sem nexo e confuso, você pode sair do seu corpo e deixar ele no "modo automático" e "hackear" outra pessoa ou máquina e controlá-la, multiplayer apelão pois e adversário
 pode controlar todos os inimigos da "cena" e temos que matar todos (mas quando é o contrario da até pena de quem está do outro lado) até hoje não consegui terminá-lo pois da desanimo de jogar...</p>
<p>Sonic Free Riders- simplesmente não funciona, você fica quase virando um contorcionista para que o bicho vire para os lados...</p>
<p>Kinectmals e Fantastic Pets- são os mesmos jogos praticamente, mas um tem animais o outro animais mutantes, ficar fingindo fazer carinho e jogar bola para os bichos é foda...</p>
<p>Kinect Disneyland Adventures- os mini games até são bacanas, mas a parte de "guiar o guri" pelo parque é sofrivel, tem que ficar com o braço esticado para frente o tempo todo, chega a doer o braço, se não fosse por isso o jogo subiria 2 pontos...</p>
<p>Michael Phelps: PTL- o jogo até funciona bem, e tem boa captação de movimentos pelo kinect, mas ficar dando braçadas no ar não é o que eu considero um bom jogo, claro que um jogo de natação seria isso, mas...</p>

<p>eu gosto de the king of fighters mas dps de ver a analise no canal do zangado passo longe... o que eu mais me arrependo de ter comprado foi o supreme commander 2, o jogo eh td akilo que eu vi e sou apaixonado por jogos de estrategias mas vai ser um saco
 fazer as conquistas dele... sem contar que o grafico podia ser um pouquinho melhor, pro que o jogo é paguei caro até, foi 50 reais em promoçao nas americanas pq o preço que eles dizem ser normal eh 220 reais o que NAO vale mesmo ,talvez tivesse sido melhor
 ter pego halo wars já que com 50 reais comprei jogos melhores do que esse... </p>

                    My laptop won't turn on. &nbsp;When I press the power button, the orange light flashes 4 times, then nothing. No other buttons are lit even though it's plugged in.

            <p>Hi ,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night before I went to sleep I did another installation of windows 10. I read the article you linked however The &nbsp;First half of reply from
<strong>Bennet Martin</strong> address the DOWNLOADING of windows 10 and at this point I have no problem with. The second half of his reply mentions &nbsp;certain percentage &nbsp;ranges that may have longer than normal wait times, However my installation doesn't get
 that far nor even produce an error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is the screen that I have been stuck on since beginning to try the upgrade</p>

            Why do you guys keep referencing that completely useless post? Seriously? unplug USB devices to speed up your 50Mb network connection? I can download the complete ISO file in 12 seconds! Why does it take 3 days to download the update and still not complete?
 No, installing from a DVD doesn't work either from Windows 7. If you run from within Win7 it crashes, if you run it from boot it tells you that you MUST run it from Win7 and not from boot. Real useful. Wake me when MS gets things figured out and can actually
 get things working correctly.

 have downloaded and tried to upgrade three times. &nbsp;Each time the process freezes during the copy files process. &nbsp;So, I am going to revert to Windows 8.1 and keep using it. &nbsp;I do have Windows 10 on another computer and I like it, but basically it's the same
 as 8.1 with a few tweeks to the user interface. &nbsp;I need to get work done and am unwilling to waste more time trying to install Windows 10. &nbsp;I will only curse each time Microsoft reminds me to install my free Windows 10 upgrade.</span>

<h2>            How do I transfer documents &#40;photos&#41; from one file to another without having to drag &#38; drop. I have windows 7 but am use to XP.</h2>
                    XP allows you to select 1 or more photos &amp; then alows you to select what file you want them moved or copied to. I have been unable to figure out how to do the same with windows 7. I can only move them now by draging &amp; dropping which is time consuming when
 moving multiple photos.

<p>Click Organize, rest the mouse on Layout and then click Menu bar.</p>
<p>This will make the Edit menu (and others) visible.</p>

    <title>On battery laptop works with BIOS, not Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dimadesu  say:</h3>
<h2>            On battery laptop works with BIOS, not Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I own a laptop Samsung RF710.&nbsp;It had Windows 7 installed. I bought a replacement battery a couple months ago, it worked well. I did upgraded to Windows 10 without saving any settings or programs&nbsp;(had to replace wifi card otherwise update could not finish,
 but don't think it is important). Afterwords the problem started occurring - if I unplug AC it lasts for couple seconds and shuts down without warning.<br />
<br />
Things I know that are not an issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am certain my battery is good.&nbsp;The battery has also has the button I can press and see the charge with indicator&nbsp;lights.<br />
<br />
I updated BIOS to latest version there was. BIOS has S.M.A.R.T. calibration. It ran that it did not help. But I noticed that on battery I can boot into BIOS and battery lasts well, but as soon as I try to boot Windows it shuts down.<br />
<br />
I tried updating battery drivers as well as uninstalling them and restarting Windows. It did not help.<br />
<br />
Samsung has utility to limit charge to 80%, I played around with that, no much difference.<br />
<br />
I tried different power modes, running windows troubleshooter - all in vain.<br />
<br />
I could not find anything similar on the internet. Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
I cannot boot to Safe mode when on battery.<br />
<br />
It is not overheating.<br />
<br />
I know it has something to do with Windows 10, probably drivers, but the only driver it has is from 2006 I think. So I am running of ideas.<br />
<br />
The only test I can come up with is to install 2nd OS and see if it works well with that, but that seems like too much effort.</p>

            Actually, I discovered shutdowns are somehow related to high CPU usage (possibly Turbo Boost feature). I set minimum and maximum processor states to 0 in power settings for the battery + there was a setting BIOS to slow down CPU a bit (I don't remember
 exact setting name) and it seems to solve the issue. I decided to leave the solution here in case other people also have it.<br />

<p>Hi Paulina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're glad to hear that your network connection is now fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Media Center Extenders are devices that are configured to connect over a computed network to allow the use of Media Center and its features to play and view media contents, watch live televisions, and use DVR functions. These hardware devices are discontinued
 but still works with Windows 10. You can either allow or block Media Center Extenders from
<strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>System and Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Defender Firewall</strong> &gt;
<strong>Allowed an app or feature through Windows Defender Firewall</strong>.</p>

            At the beginning of the installation process you get an opportunity to delete any or all disk partitions. You ask "Is it safe?" It depends on what you mean by "safe". Deleting partitions will, of course, delete all existing data stored on them.

                    <p><span>hello sir.... I no longer have an active administrator account in Windows 8.1. My question is how do I make the &nbsp;administrator active? At present I cannot access any number of tools and facilities as I can only log-in with standard access. For only
 one example I cannot access System Restore let alone use it!<br />
<br />
I have created administrator account &nbsp;but while changing the password it went wrong</span><span>. I have gone through much searching to find ways of making the hidden administrator active. As I do not have administrator rights implementing such methods and
 procedures end with `Access denied' or `System Error 5 has occurred. Access is denied'.&nbsp; As one example I have tried running command.exe to execute the command line `net user administator /active:yes' only for `System error 5. Access is denied.' to be displayed
 in the Command Prompt window. and also i tried by setting command prompt as administrator &nbsp;but it showing "access denied".. A second example is using Computer Management | Local&nbsp; Users &amp; Groups | Users | Administrator | Properties and unticking Account is
 disabled displays `Access denied'.<br />
</span></p>
<p>I am at the point of reinstalling or boot the Windows as the only solution apparent to me.&nbsp; But before doing so I would like to ask here if there is a remedy for my problem.&nbsp; Can I activate the &nbsp;administrator account ... and if the answer is yes how to do
 it. pls help me sir .............&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Vishwam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for providing the detailed information regarding the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your efforts for trying several troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How many user accounts does you have on the computer?</p>
<p>2. Are you logging to a standard user account or Administrator account?</p>
<p>3. Do you have any other administrators account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can be caused if you haven’t created any administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to refer the methods to enable the administrator mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any administrator account, login to that account change&nbsp;the Standard user account to an administrator account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps to change the standard user account to administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Log into your computer using your administrative account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span>1.&nbsp;Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys on the keyboard to open the “Settings” search..</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>2.&nbsp;Type “User Account” in the search box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Click on the icon “User Accounts” to open it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;4.&nbsp;In the “User Account” window, click on “Manage another account”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Select the user account that you would like to change.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>6.&nbsp;Click on “Change account type”.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>7.&nbsp;Select “Administrator” and then click on “Change account type”.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don’t have an administrator account you need to use the Windows 8 dvd to boot into WinRE&nbsp;and from command prompt try enabling the default admin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps to <span>enable the Default Admin account from WinRE.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Use the Windows 8 DVD to start the computer in Windows Recovery (WinRE)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. In WinRE, open a command prompt. To do this, follow these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. On the Install Windows screen, select the appropriate Language to install, Time and<br />
currency format, and Keyboard or input method options, and then click next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Click Repair your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Click the installation that you want to repair, and then click next.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Click Command Prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Open command prompt and type the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net user administrator /active: yes </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>8.&nbsp;Restart and login to the default admin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Create a New Admin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Make Sure to disable the hidden admin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open command prompt and type the following command in command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net user administrator /active:no</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted on the result. If you have further queries, we will be happy to help.</p>

            <p>I too have no administrator privileges with any user (I am the ONLY one using this PC, but have 2 user accounts).&nbsp; I have never had administrator privileges and I have tried EVERY suggestion made in this and other forums.&nbsp; I do not have a Windows 8 CD therefore
 I cannot "redo" the installation.&nbsp; If I was to purchase a CD for installation, I would definitely NOT purchase a Windows 8 OS, I would get Windows&nbsp;7 or another OS completely.&nbsp; I am very disappointed in Windows 8.&nbsp; I need to know how to get administrator privileges

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Intel Support. Of course it is a discontinued board so there may not<br />
be any further available BIOS, chipset, or on-board drivers made available.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The "this shows the board is compatible" was about the lower link and in error.<br />
<br />
Sorry I misread the chart so you are right Intel does NOT indicate that board in Windows 8<br />
compatible.<br />
<br />
Since it is Windows 7 compatible it might run Windows 8 though it should be fully updated<br />
with the latest BIOS, chipset, and driver to give it the best chance of satisfactory performance.<br />
<br />
The best source of information is Intel Support.<br />

I have already checked with Intel Support and here is the information that I got:
<br />
the DP45SG is a discontinued board and as such Intel has no further information coming concerning the DP45SG.&nbsp; (Intel has completely abandoned their customers, that was done less than 3 years after I obtained that board.&nbsp; I guess it's a good thing it's not
 a car that I got from Intel).&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Has anybody installed Windows 8 with the Intel motherboard DP45SG? <br />

<br />
To my knowledge no manufacturer guarantees that a hardware device will be compliant

with an unknown future operating system. The board does still work with the OS's&nbsp;for
<br />
which&nbsp;it&nbsp; was designed.&nbsp;<br />

            I have already run the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant.&nbsp; The Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant Report only identifies the board DP45SG but it does not contain any conclusions concerning the board's compatibility.&nbsp;
<br />
As mentioned before the statement made by Microsoft that the Intel Desktop Board DP45SG Motherboard is "compatible" with Windows 8 with the condition "<a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/SearchResult.aspx?lang=eng&amp;ProductFamily=Desktop+Boards&amp;ProductLine=Intel%C2%AE+4+Series+Chipset+Boards&amp;ProductProduct=Intel%C2%AE+Desktop+Board+DP45SG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Free

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
In many cases the Windows 7 drivers will be sufficient. When they are not it "usually" is<br />
for video, sound, network or similar devices that can be removed or disabled and replaced.<br />
<br />
So it seems the best information you have is from the Windows Compatibility Center.<br />
<br />
Unless you can find someone that actually has upgraded such a system there is no way<br />
to know unless you try.<br />
<br />
Wish I could help more.<br />

            <p>Yes Daniel, I have an Intel DP45SG mobo, with Intel CPU CoreDuo 9550 and installed Windows 8 Pro 64 two weeks ago. Everything seems running fine!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this information will help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I'm wondering if I have to install the Intel mobo CHIPSET drivers for Win Seven 64 bit or it's better to leave the Windows drivers... Anybody knows what is better to do in my situation?</p>

            Thank you so much Sergio for this information.&nbsp; Now I am confident that the upgrade should work.
<br />
<br />
(This is great news especially that on Saturday the installation of Windows 8 Pro 64 ended for me with the message:<br />
"We couldn't install windows 8. We've set your PC back to the way it was right before you started installing Windows 8".&nbsp;
<br />
With the help of Microsoft Tech Support, I found out that the program "Intel Wired PROSet for Windows" had to be uninstalled before Windows Setup could continue (see
<a href="http://www.intel.com/support/network/sb/CS-033868.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/support/network/sb/CS-033868.htm</a>).&nbsp; The Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant had NOT caught that one before I tried my first go at installing Windows 8 Pro 64, and neither did the
 Windows 8 Pro 64 Upgrade installation program)<br />

<h2>            Logon screen missing at startup</h2>
                    
<p>original title:&nbsp;Logon screen gone</p>
<p>I too, am having the same truoble, " NO LOGON SCREEN". It disappeared after a recent automatic update. Same exact things, logon flashes once or twice, then disappeared. If I tap a few keys, then hit enter, within a minute, the failure screen shows up and
 I can click OK, then switch user and logon any user, but I shouldn't have to. Microsoft upated my computer and they should have a resolution to fix this. Running Vista Basic has just become again, very depressing to use. It seems it is always one thing or
 another. MICROSOFT, Please fix this problem, it is a chore anymore just to get on my computer.</p>

<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work (and it should), then uninstall the problem update (if it is even still there after the System Restore).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Disable automatic updates until this problem is resolved so the problem update doesn't re-install and cause the same problem again.</span></span></p>

    <title>&#34;Date Modified&#34; of folder containing subfolders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaygourley  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Date Modified&#34; of folder containing subfolders</h2>
                    <p>I observe that on my Windows 10 computers, the File Explorer "date modified" field in details view of a folder with subfolders sometimes reflects the most recent modification date of a file in any subfolder down to any subfolder level. &nbsp;And sometimes it
 doesn't. &nbsp;I can find both conditions among folders on the same Windows computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On individual files, the "date modified" is always exactly what I would expect it to be. &nbsp;So this post only applies to "date modified" for folders. &nbsp;So what is "date modified" on a folder supposed to mean? &nbsp;And is there a Windows setting that controls this
 on a per-folder basis? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not having a "date modified" that represents the last date any file in that folder's subfolder was modified is a big nuisance. &nbsp;Not even knowing what the date I see represents is an even bigger nuisance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some other threads on this forum that address this, but I believe they are mostly outdated and without answers.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Jay,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Since when did the issue started appearing? Have you made any changes in settings prior to the issue?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform the following troubleshooting steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Perform SFC Scan.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can try to run SFC scan to find missing or corrupt files that may be causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
System File Checker (SFC) checks that all Windows 10 system files are intact and not corrupted, changed, or damaged.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and select Run as Administrator.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click Continue or supply Administrator credentials if prompted..&nbsp;In the Command Prompt</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>window type the following, and press Enter:</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></p>
<p><span><br />
You should see the following on-screen message:<br />
Beginning the system scan. This process will take some time.<br />
Beginning verification phase of system scan.<br />
Verification % complete.<br />
Once the scan has completed, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved or not.
<br />

            Hi Aswan Anand-- &nbsp;Running SFC is usually the first thing I do. &nbsp;I don't have any file corruptions. &nbsp;And this situation has been true for a long time. &nbsp;As for changing setting, I change settings in Windows all the time, like everyone else, and don't keep
 any records. &nbsp;What should I conclude from your questions about what Windows File Explorer is supposed to do in this situation.

            <p>Hey facing the same problem too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is irritating for me is that my folder's 'modified date' changes, just by simply opening a file inside the folder, esp. an office file. I would wish that such date on the Folder only changed to current date, if I actually worked/changed the file and
 saved it back.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that is being asked for here is how Windows works ie how it is meant to work.&nbsp; jaygourley isn't asking about corrupt file systems or putting forward a suggestion.&nbsp; Please just answer the question, somebody!<br />
<br />
 not change when the file is added to 'photos from 2017', presumably because it still has the same contents as before...the list of files and folders within 'All My Photos' are the same ones, even if the modified date for 'photos from 2017' has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is logical in one sense, but not always what's wanted.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question is...can behaviour be changed (system-wide or per-folder) so that the date modified for 'All My Photos' reflects the date *anything* within it, right down to the bottom of the file tree, gets modified (ie a file is changed and saved, or a
 subfolder gets a file added or deleted).&nbsp; So I know just from looking at the Date Modified for 'All My Photos' if something was added/changed/deleted somewhere within its tree.&nbsp; Or is there another attribute other than 'Date Modified' that would show this?</p>
<p>

<p>I cannot find him anywhere. I finished the DB questline, after going to DB sanctuary to kill off all the soldiers that set it a blaze. He was with me there, but I then warped to the new hideout for DB. I got the frost horse/purchased a horse, I went back
 to get Shadowmere, and he is not there. Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>Buying a new horse will replace Shadowmere as your primary mount. When you say you went back to get Shadowmere... do you mean the new hideout or the old one? If you mean the new one, trying going back to the old one and look around that area, particularly
 near the pond he came out of. He -should- be where you left him but hey, stuff happens. &nbsp;If, by any chance, he died, I've read that he'll respawn at the place of his death after 10 days. You might have a good hunt on your hands. :/ &nbsp; Hope you find him soon.
 He shouldn't be lost permanently.</p>

<h2>            File History does not backup another drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just did a complete reset of Windows 10 after some weird GPU-hiccups, which was a perfect time to test if "File History" backup actually works. It seems fine for now, but when I started it I noticed that it recovered about 31 GB, not 181 GB I expected. After
 looking through the files for the backup, I noticed that the entire (D:) drive was missing from the recovery. This is especially strange, as when I open the backup drive (Z:), I can find all of the contents of the (D:) drive just sitting there. (I also did
 some backups manually, I have not lost any files). How do I enable recovery of the (D:) drive?</p>

            Hi Mallignos.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />File History is dysfunctional and may be being phased out in a future version.  I suggest using a better backup like the experts's choice free Macrium for both file and System image backups to external, then have one other Cloud backup so your files are safe from fire and theft and easily accessible via the internet just like email.
<br />
<br />  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />A better file backup to external disk is free Macrium which is the choice of the experts:
<br /><a href="http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Backing+up+files+and+folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/B...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>
<br />
<br />As to the missing D drive backup, see here for the exact steps to recover File History if it's going to work (which isn't assured):

<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <pre>File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).
Learn more: https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-system-image-best-free-alternatives/
Detailed steps:
Macrium Reflect – Installation
Let’s start off with Macrium Reflect (Free) (https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree). Macrium provides a small click to run the installer, but I chose the offline installer, which required finding the download agent (http://updates.macrium.com/reflect/v5.0/reflectdl.exe); this downloads the full installer at around 800 MBs. Included are a collection of preinstallation environment tools based on Microsoft’s Windows Image deployment solutions.
Setup was quick and easy but needed a restart to complete changes made to the system.
The Macrium Reflect interface is a bit more jam-packed than what you would normally find in Windows 10. But this a powerful alternative offering a range of options for creating and managing backups. Macrium integrates heavily with Windows—examples include support for attaching and browsing backups; boot image backups in Hyper-V; generating PowerShell scripts to automate backups; creating batch files and of course, scheduling backups. You can also find handy options such as cloning and standard file and folder backup.
For these instructions, we are going to focus on image backups. Similar to the System Image backup feature in Windows 10 and previous versions, this lets you create a replica of your current installation state. You can be granular with your backups by choosing only the partitions you want to save as part of your image.
To create your first image, click the menu Create an image of the partition(s) required to backup and restore Windows.
Under Destination, click the Browse button, then point to your external drive where you want to store the backup, create a new folder, select it then click OK. Click Next to Continue.
 
This phase of the wizard lets you create a Backup plan if you want. It’s optional, but lets you choose different methods of backups which include full, incremental and differential. For now, I am going to choose a schedule just to make things simple. I recommend you review the retention rules to save on disk space. Users can retain a number of backups using any method; this can quickly eat up disk space over time, so I will reduce the amount for each to about two. Click Next to Continue.
What are Incremental and Differential Backups and which should you choose?
A full backup gives you one backup file that restores your entire system up to that point. Full backups are a comprehensive way to go, but they take a long time to create and if you have multiple backup images, you end up duplicating a lot of the same data. Incremental and differential backups are two ways to address this inefficiency.
Incremental Backup – This maintains a regular backup in addition to changes that have been made since the last full or incremental backup. Incremental backups are often preferred because they use less disk space; not to mention, they are faster, too. So, if you created new Word documents since your last backup, those are added to the backup.
So, let’s say Backup A is a full backup you made on Monday. On Wednesday, you can make an incremental Backup B which only includes the new data since Backup A. On Friday, you can make Backup C, which only includes the new data since Backup B. In this way, you are storing no duplicate data. The downside is that if you want to restore your image, you have to use all three backup files: Backup A, Backup B, and Backup C.
Differential Backup – This creates a backup of the differences made since the last full backup. So, if you made changes to a few Microsoft Word documents, those changes are applied to the backup. A disadvantage is that differential backups use more space, since you need to maintain a full backup in addition to changes since you created your last backup.
How is that different than an incremental backup? Let’s say you make a full Backup A on Monday. On Wednesday, Backup B contains the differences since Backup A was made. On Friday, Backup C contains the differences since Backup A.  In this way, if you want to do a restoration, you just need two files: the last full backup and the last differential backup. This means you only ever need two files, compared to the incremental backup method. The downside is that, as you can imagine, your differential backup image file gets bigger and bigger as the time since your last full backup increases. And after awhile, you end up with a quite a bit of duplicated data across your various differential backups.
So, which should you use? Either one is fine. It all depends on how much storage space and time you have. Incremental backups are faster and take less space during the backup phase. Differential backups take more time and space during the backup phase but are easier during the restoration phase.
Review the image summary to ensure you chose the right options. If you maintain a dual boot configuration, make sure each partition is checked as part of your backup. Click Finish to begin the backup.
Click OK to start the backup immediately.
As with all image backups, it will take some time, so, sit back and relax as your image is saved. Click Close after your image is created.
Restoring Your Macrium Image
There are multiple ways to restore a backup. You can start the restore process from within a running installation of Windows 10 with Macrium already installed. But in most cases, restoring an image would take place after booting into a recovery environment similar to System Image in Windows 10.
Create Rescue Media
One important task you should complete after creating your image is to create rescue media, which will facilitate restoration of the image. This is perfect for scenarios where your computer won’t boot or you installed a new empty hard disk. Click the Other Tasks menu then click Create Rescue Media.
This will start the create bootable rescue media wizard. Remember, as we mentioned earlier, Macrium downloads a full installer at around 800 MBs. This is where the preinstallation environment tools based on Microsoft’s Windows Image deployment solutions are used. Macrium adds its own recovery tools to facilitate restoration of the image when you boot from it. Click Next.
You can add drivers in advance for hardware that might not be supported by the restored image. Click the Update Driver button to do so then point to the source. This can minimize the chances of Windows 10 not booting on new hardware; especially if you are changing motherboards.
Depending on the architecture of your Windows 10 image, you can choose either a 32 or 64-bit recovery image. For this particular case, I am restoring a 64 bit Windows 10 installation, so I will choose that. Click Next to begin the creation.
Bootable media can be prepared using a blank DVD or USB drive or you can create a bootable ISO image instead. Choose your desired method, then click Finish.
Restore Image – Macrium Reflect
Configure your computer to boot from the installation media (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/) on the target computer. Attach your external drive where the image is stored, then power it on.
Under the Restore tab in Macrium, click the menu, Browse for an image or backup file to restore.
Browse to the image file, select it then click Open.
Click Select a disk to restore to… then click the selected image that appears. Click Next to begin the restoration.
After the image is successfully restored, click File &gt; Exit to reboot.
That’s pretty much all that’s involved in preparing a system image of your Windows 10 installation using Macrium Reflect. Macrium feels a little complex and overwhelming at first, but once you familiarize yourself with it, you should feel comfortable using it in no time.

<h2>            Bluetooth mouse connects automatically but doesn&#39;t work after windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I own a Dell WM524 dongleless blutetooth mouse and before the last Windows 10 update, whenever both the mouse and the computer were on at the same time, they would simply connect and work flawlessly.
</p>
<p>Now, when I do this, the mouse &nbsp;does not work and, when I check the connection, they seem to be connected. The only way I can put it to work again is by removing it and pairing again, which is a real sore and takes out all the practicity it had before...</p>
<p>I already tried updating the driver, uninstalling the mouse through the device manager and reinstalling the driver, removing and pairing again and none of this has worked.</p>
<p>Is there anyway I can fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

            <p>Hi Sachin,</p>
<p>Sorry it took me so long to answer,</p>
<p>I tried both fixes and, unfortunately, none of them worked.</p>
<p>What I noticed, though is that, in the Manage Bluetooth Devices page of the settings app, the computer says the mouse is paired and, when I turn it on, the computer detects it, a loading bar starts to load and the status changes to Connected, but after a
 few moments it very briefly displays the message "Setup incomplete. Connect to the internet" and the status changes back again to paired and it starts all over; in no moment of this cycle the mouse works.</p>
<p>Thank you once more!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrading Windows 10 S to Windows 10 Pro is done via <strong>Settings</strong>. In
<strong>Cortana </strong><strong>search </strong>type <strong>Settings </strong>and press
<strong>Enter</strong>. Select <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Activation</strong> &gt; Select
<strong>Go to Store</strong>. From there you will be notified for a switch and the
<strong>Install</strong> option will be present. Switching to Windows 10 Pro is one-way. If you make the switch, you won't be able to go back to Windows 10 S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you were able to find the Install button for Windows 10 Pro.</p>
        </p>
