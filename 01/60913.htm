            <p>Hi Pradeep,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are unable to install Windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have occurred due to some third party application conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the methods.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to <strong>temporarily disable the antivirus security software program installed</strong> on your computer and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disclaimer: Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software and\or troubleshoot any
 pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to <strong>reset Windows update components</strong> and try to install the update in a clean boot state.</p>
<p>Refer the link given below.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971058</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tells you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft
 Knowledge Base: </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">322756 (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/</span></a> )
</span></span></p>
<p><strong>How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to perform <strong>clean boot</strong> and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue and try to install the update.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You
 may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform
 a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps. </p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section <strong>“How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>

<p>Hope this helps. Please let us know the results. We will be glad to assist your further.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse Not Working</h2>
                    I have a&nbsp;Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Mouse, Keyboard, and Numbers pad. They all work properly on my HP laptop. Only the Keyboard works on my Lenovo Desktop. The mouse does not work. There is no pointer. I don't know about the numbers pad. I haven't tried
 that. My main concern is getting the mouse to work with my Lenovo Desktop which is running Windows 10. Any and all help would be greatly appreciate. Please don't tell me to update the driver. I have done that three times already and the problem still persists.
 The batteries are good, otherwise the mouse wouldn't work with my HP. Also, I am going to repeat that the keyboard and mouse work with my HP laptop so I know the problem is not them. The problem is an as yet undiscovered software issue with my Lenovo. I have
 contacted Lenovo and their technical support was totally useless.

 </blockquote> <p>Thank you for checking and getting back to me.</p><p>OK, as you can see that xbox live is there, can you try removing the profile that you have bought the Xbox Live Subscription on and re-adding it again to the console, to see whether or not this makes any difference.</p><p>Another thing, if not already then try making sure it's set to the home console. Usually if it's the first profile on the Xbox it's done automatically. but if not then you can follow the steps here:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox</a></p><p><br /></p><p>If these steps don't help, please let us know and contact an official Microsoft Agent by using the support portal.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The best of luck</p>

<h2>            Ease of Access - On-Screen Keyboard not working&#8230;</h2>
                    <div>My on-screen keyboard was working just fine 20-40 times, I'm not exactly sure how many times I've opened it…</div>
<div>It just all of a suddenly quit working, when I would click on the desktop icon shortcut I created for it…</div>
<div>The kind of thick little blue circle shows up next to the pointer arrow for a split second or two, then… Absolutely nothing.</div>
<div>Nothing happens at all, not even a message box saying that Windows is looking for a solution…</div>
<div>I really liked the on-screen keyboard that Windows provides, I've went to CNET and tried several different kinds… They all have their pluses and minuses, but…</div>
<div>Being a quadriplegic, I've found that the on-screen keyboard that ships with Windows works the best for me.</div>
<div>I have even right-click on the shortcut icon looked at the properties to see where it's targeting, it's all pointing to where everything should be…</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was hoping that updating to 8.1 would fix this, no such luck…</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any feedback on this would be greatly appreciated…</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>While I'm at it…</div>

</div>
<div>When I'm working on my desktop…</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What happened to my windows being able to snap to the left or to the right?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It seems that only the start menu tiles are capable of snapping to the left or to the right, which really sucks!</div>

            I used the chat in MIcrosoft and after a couple of hours we figured out it was ipv6, so go to "Command Prompt" and type:<br />
netsh winsock reset catalog (enter)<br />
netsh int ipv4 reset reset.log (enter)<br />
netsh int ipv6 reset reset.log (enter)<br />
<br />
and restart the computer

<p>Hello andreas1794,</p>
<div>Microsoft Silverlight cannot be used in browsers running in 64 bit mode.</div>
<div>You might try the Google Chrome Beta version to see if you can get it to work.<br />
<div>You can also post in the Silverlight forums. Click <a href="http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here for a link</a>.</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

    <title>Windows Explorer does not show recently saved files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom112358  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer does not show recently saved files</h2>
                    Recently, after saving Word or Excel files into a particular directory, they do not appear in windows explorer. They also do not appear in the dialog box within my email program when I try to attach them to an email. On top of this, many files appear in
 that same directory (viewed through windows explorer) that should not be in that directory.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can also repeatedly "save as" the file into the same directory, with the same file name, and windows does not ask me if I want to overwrite the existing file - so it appears that windows really does not see the file. However, if I save the file to "desktop"
 and then copy it from there to the offending directory, then windows tells me that the file already exists, and asks whether I want to overwrite it. If I say no, and then to go windows explorer, then suddenly the file appears.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have seen some similar questions in this forum, but I have not seen any answers to this problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am running a new version of Windows 7 Home Premium with Office 2010 on a new (as of 9/12) HP desktop machine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Very strange. Any help is greatly appreciated.</div>

<h2>            1809 Update Stuck on Initialising</h2>
                    I have an HP laptop (I3 processor 4MB ram - Kaspsersky anti virus turned off for the update currently on Windows Version 1803 - OS17134.471).&nbsp; The 1809 Feature Update has started but my update message has said it is initialising for over three hours. (
 I have a very slow internet connection of 1.8 Mbs).&nbsp; The router lights suggest something is happening but this seems very long compared to previous big updates which usually initialise quickly and then take ages to download).&nbsp; Do I need to be patient or is
 something wrong?

            Hi,
<br />The speed is a bit slow. I can give an alternate to you-download the ISO file directly through your web browser and perform an In Place upgrade.

            I left it for an hour and when I came back it was part way through.&nbsp; Still better than the latest mini update that has stopped me logging in after a restart and defies all attempts to fix it.&nbsp; Why can't Microsoft just leaves things alone!

<p>there's a problem with xbox live marketplace.&nbsp; 8c230002</p>
<p>I've been getting this for 24 hours.&nbsp; I thought maybe the market was down, but the status page indicates it's not.&nbsp; I cleared system cache and deleted Marketplace cache and rebooted each time to no avail.&nbsp; I don't see this particular error code anywhere,
 so I'm really stumped.&nbsp; My account is in good standing, so what else could this be?</p>

<p>The same happened to me as well, When i boot up my Xbox a box pops up saying Xbox LIVE is temporarily unavailable, and that some things won't work, and i then get status code 80072746. The Xbox Dashboard then has bing removed from it, and the games and i
 think apps marketplace icons are grayed out. &nbsp;Then, when i try to view any item in the marketplace, download an update, or even redeem a code, i get status code 8C230002, the same as yours. I've been getting this for two weeks however, not just 24 hours. I
 downloaded the new update, and all my previous problems were fixed, but then this happened less then a week later. I paid for a game two weeks ago that i haven't been able to play yet thanks to this. Even when i download it from my computer to the Xbox, it
 goes from 1% completed, to this item cannot be downloaded. (This stinks, because i've been having problems with this Xbox ever since i got it, and when things are finally fixed, this pops up!) When i reboot my system, I don't get code 80072746 anymore, and
 bing and the marketplace icons return to normal, but when i click on a marketplace item, i get 8C230002. I then decided to connect to wired Xbox Live connection, but i got 8007274c instead of 80072746!! What?! Other problems! Microsoft, do something!!</p>

<li>Is your billing information up to date and valid? This information can be found at <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/27/p/900207/reply.aspx/billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">billing.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;</li>

<p>I have had the same issue. &nbsp;I have found a temporary fix though. &nbsp;My symptoms are the same and apps like netflix will not stream. &nbsp;Bing will disappear from the dashboard as well. Also it will kick me off xbox live every couple of minutes. &nbsp;I have to connect
 my 360 directly to the modem, turn the 360 on and sign in. &nbsp;Everything is there and fixed. &nbsp;Then I hook up my router into the system again and sign in and all is fixed. &nbsp;However, it doesn't last forever. &nbsp;The first time I did it, it was fixed for a week. &nbsp;The
 next time it was fixed for about 2 days. &nbsp;I did it once more and I am currently on day 2 with no problems. &nbsp;While the dashboard is down, I don't have problems playing online. &nbsp;As long as I'm in a match or a party I won't disconnect. &nbsp;I get the same error message
 along with a message saying the dashboard is temporarily unavailable. &nbsp;I did not have these problems prior to the Dec 6th update. &nbsp;I hope this is helpful.</p>

<p>Ya, as a matter of fact, when i plug my Xbox directly to the router, i get another error code. The same box comes up, the one that says some parts of Xbox Live are temporarily unavailable, and instead of 80072746, i get 8007274c! I think this has to do with
 the router itself. Maybe it isn't compatible? Oh well, we're getting a new isp and router in January anyways, I can play my Wii in the meantime :P</p>

            <p>Hey sonic - that last error code indicates your connection has timed out. Are you able to plug directly into your modem, or is your device a combination router/modem? If not, give plugging directly into the modem a try, and let us know the results. </p>

<p>My device is a modem and a router together, and yes, that is what I have been plugged into the whole time. It's a new day, so I'll give it another shot and post the results, I guess. Thank God it's Christmas Break! :)</p>

<p>Well, I started up the Xbox and I didn't get an error code, but then I tried to view an item in the marketplace, and I got 8C230002 again. So close! Oh well, sometimes error code 80072746 comes up, sometimes it doesn't.</p>
<p>P.S. I only got 8007274c twice and those each happened when i first plug in the wired connection to the Xbox. Afterwards, I still get the typical 80072746</p>

<p>Why did you do a "registry check?"&nbsp;&nbsp;Some Registry Cleaners do more harm than good...</p>
<p>Did you have another antivirus program installed when trying to install Norton 360?&nbsp; If so, you should uninstall it to include using the appropriate software removal tool for that AV product.</p>

<h3> melissahuerta  say:</h3>
<h2>            Toshiba laptop touch screen not working after update</h2>
                    <p>I hadn't updated my laptop in several months until today. Once the update completed, my touch screen no longer worked. When I checked to make sure this function was enabled in my device manager, it showed it was not only enabled but working, however it does
 not work when I try to use it. How do I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I was able to resolve this issue by disabling in device manager, rebooting system and then re-enabling.</p>

            Uninstall/delete the drivers and reinstall from the Toshiba website using your model number, and that should restore your touchscreen function. This also happened to my dell inspiron xps

            Hi Melissa.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See steps for troubleshooting touch screen here:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-unresponsive-windows-10-touchscreen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-unresponsi...</a>

<br />
<br />Check the Support pages here for your exact Toshiba model to see if there are bulletins or troubleshooters for it's touch screen, also Update your drivers if any newer are posted:  <a href="https://support.toshiba.com/support/modelHome?freeText=1200008312" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.toshiba.com/support/modelHome?f...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Will DLC Benedict Arnold AC3 be available&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I recently contacted the Ubisoft's support for information about this DLC for Assassin's creed 3, which is currently only available for PS3 and they told me that his release on Xbox live depends on you, so the question is:
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>will you release on Xbox live this DLC?</strong></span>
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>If not, why?</strong></span></em></p>
<p>Looking forward for your feedback I offer my most cordial greetings.</p>
<p>Ubisoft answer about this:</p>
<p>Gentile,</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting the Customer Service for assistance Ubisoft about Assassin's Creed 3.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Microsoft is the only one who so decides and not made availab at least for the moment the dlc. You can contact them and ask about any news.</p>
<p>Because it just depends on their choices are not informed of these choices.</p>
<p>Looking forward to its eventual stop, I take this opportunity to extend my most 'best regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there CatalyticFour94,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This specific DLC is a PS3 exclusive DLC. I imagine that it will remain that way indefinitely, but that is just my opinion. What I do know, is that you wont be given any details about timescales in relation to DLC that has not already been publicly announced.
 Support will probably tell you the same thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps,</p>
<p>Cloud</p>

<p>The DLC s not confirmed for xbox, but usually Ubisoft adds things to xbox such as the Far Cry 3 bundle pack seeing as some items were preorder for Bestbuy, and Gamestop, and also amazon.

<h2>            Headset Issues - Microsoft LifeChat LX4000</h2>
                    <p>I have two&nbsp;Microsoft LifeChat LX4000 head sets, one device connects perfectly however the other connects as a USB audio device and can not hear any sound. I have attempted to set it as a default device in Playback Devices, however it does not register as
 a&nbsp;Microsoft LifeChat LX4000 like the other headset does. I can test the microphone phone and this registers but there is no playback for sound. any idea why this device isn't connecting properly?</p>
<p>running windows 10. both headsets previously worked fine.</p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />It's odd that one headset works while the other doesn't. That suggests to me that the one that doesn't work has some hardware issue, like a faulty cable or circuitry, but let's work under the assumption we can fix it with Windows. Try these steps:
<br />
<br />Firstly, I would see if the troubleshooter fixes the issue. Click Start and type "troubleshoot" then select the first result. Scroll down and choose Hardware and Devices. This may automatically resolve the issue.
<br />
<br />If not, press Windows Key+X and choose Device Manager. See if you can find the headset, and right-click it and uninstall, then unplug and plug it back in. This may fix the issue.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, try performing a clean boot:

<br />Boot into Safe Mode to see if the problem persists:

<br />Run the System File Checker tool:

<h2>            Windows Updater is giving me an error&#59; 80072efb</h2>
                    
<p>My computer has been out of use for about a year. Last it updated was feb. in 2009. I lended it to my boyfriend since his broke, and now its not updating. Comes up with the error; 80072efb. He tried using the command prompt with the code; netsh winhttp reset
 proxy&nbsp; ] But that didn't work either. I have norton internet security 2010 on that computer, it is a vista home premium with SP2, 32bit. And if you need to know more about the specs just ask. It was updating fine when I had internet hooked to it, and then
 I moved and couldn't have internet to it since the apartments dumb. Anyways, it hasn't been used in a years time and it use to update fine. The windows updater suggested adding website exceptions to any firewalls that may be blocking it from coming in and
 updating, but I and my boyfriend have yet to find where to enter website exceptions for Norton Internet Security 2010 or the Windows Firewall, which windows updater says it should already be on that firewall, and I don't use it anyways so it isn't the windows
 firewall and must be the Norton smart firewall, or whatever. Also my internet provider is Cox, and they give free Mcafee internet security aswell, so I don't know if its that either. Could someone help me?</p>

    <title>Surface Book losing pen and multi-touch functionality - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hamiltongerlach  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book losing pen and multi-touch functionality</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with my Surface Book that keeps bugging me. Within a given time of use - I mainly write notes and sketches in OneNote - the pen cursor suddenly disappears and multi-touch (pinch to zoom) functionality on the touchscreen no longer works. The
 problem goes away as soon as I reboot the device, but this is very annoying if I'm in a class or a meeting. I have updated everything and tried reinstalling various HID drivers, which didn't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have further noticed that it often seems to be triggered after pressure is applied on the top half of the screen, or rather the bottom half in clipboard position, roughly where my palm rests when writing. Maybe this is a structural issue with the touchscreen,
 or even a defective digitizer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be glad for any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Addendum: my device is a i5 256GB/dGPU Surface Book, <strong>I'm on the Slow Ring
</strong>and have noticed this issue way before the Anniversary Update)</p>
<p>

            <div>the issue is with the fall creators update. if you install an older Win 10</div>
<div>version and don't upgrade to FCU, you won't have this issue. the downloadable</div>
<div>recovery image <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage</a> should</div>
<div>be the older version. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As for the issue that occurs with the FCU - This has impacted customers after</div>
<div>installing the Fall Creators Update.Others have found that going into device</div>
<div>manager and disabling/enabling the "Intel(R) Precise Touch Device" in device</div>
<div>manager made both the pen and the multi-touch work again. Less disruptive than</div>
<div>restarting. And the problem will probably re-occur. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Open device manager,&nbsp; Click on human interface devices to expand it and it</div>
<div>should be near the bottom of the list. This is a temporary fix and the issue</div>
<div>will return until Microsoft issues a new driver, but for now, it is the only</div>
<div>work around. Engineering asked that anyone afflicted with this use the Feedback</div>
<div>Hub App to send in a bug while in the bad state before disabling/re-enabling so</div>
<div>that they can get the logs.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I ask Microsoft daily about a fix for this. All I get is silence..</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt;I tried clean install to fall update system without insider build, a clean install done by Microsoft support technician with nothing installed, the problem is still there. </div>

<p>If it isnt some foreign players lagging the game its people rushing 2 minutes in or teammates quitting as the game starts for no reason. Got to also love the brigadier people and lower who rush and get 500 points. Good job at that rate you only need to do
 that 1,000+ more times.<br />

<p>Here's a tip on how to DECREASE the frustration of dealing with quitters. Play "Deathmatch 2v2". These people are much less likely to quit. They are ruthlessly serious gamers. Also, if your teammate does quit, continue the game anyway if it isn't an obvious
 loss. You will LOVE the satisfaction you get when you successfully manhandle 2 opponents. See you there buddy.</p>

<p>The game itself doesnt suck, but i do agree with OP. &nbsp;This game is filled with noobs who think they´re good because they watched a rush video strategy on youtube. Or quitters who quit for no apparent reason. This game was good back when I first got it, but
 now it´s either rushers or quitters.</p>

<p>Jon5481, I completely agree. The campaign mode is great and the game overall is a great game but the multiplayer can suck if you cant get anyone to stay in the game and see it through. Everyone wants to have the upper hand and most of the noobs want to try
 to rush you. As soon as you destroy their rush attack force, they dont want to play anymore. If you manage to find someone that doesnt rush or quit, SEND THEM A FRIEND REQUEST because you just found a rare player. I am not a fan of shooters but I love RTS
 games. I had never played ANY Halo game before and to this day, I have only played Halo Reach. Halo fans may or may not like this game but coming from a true fan of RTS games in general, this is one of the best RTS games I have ever played. I put it right
 up there with Red Alert, Starcraft and Warcraft (Warcraft was originally a RTS series). My only complaint is that they never made a sequel</p>

<p>I love the game but hate when the enemies quit when they see the ranks of the players on their team. I can't even count how many times i have to search for a game where someone does not quit, go away, or disconnect from the game. Like someone else said play
 2v2 i find people quit less compared to 3v3.</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with "rushing." &nbsp;Halo Wars is at its best when both teams are actively trying to make the other team lose form the very beginning. &nbsp;That's where the real intense, epic battles take place. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't like "rushers" my advice to you is to start emulating these strategies you have a problem with. &nbsp;Eventually you'll begin to learn how to actually play Halo Wars, and you'll find that when both teams are "rushing" the games are way more fun and
 interesting than doing nothing for 20 minutes every game as you build an army.</p>

<p>The game just didn't age well. &nbsp;It is fun in single player but I felt it has plenty of limitations online and many scrutinizing RTS players are probably primarily playing PC RTS games (myself included). &nbsp;With a diminished population you will see stuff like
 what the OP mentioned, making it harder and harder to find good games. &nbsp;If you are generally concerned about better quality of multiplayer games you may want to pick up a different RTS that isn't on console or find a dedicated group of buddies to play with.
 &nbsp;Even in popular games playing with friends is often more fun.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>But yes, people have said it is easier to get to General by rushing, and because of that rushing seems almost encouraged rather than just "an option." &nbsp;Of course rushing exists in every RTS and part of increasing your skills is overcoming them but it gets
 boring when it is almost always expected. &nbsp;I also found when playing online way back that the late game seemed to encourage monotonous tactics of either leader-heavy strategies or super unit spams because it ends up being the most viable option. &nbsp;All strategy
 games have the capacity for rushes, annoying tactics, etc. but when the game design encourages it, and you do not like dealing with it, the game may just not be for you.</p>
