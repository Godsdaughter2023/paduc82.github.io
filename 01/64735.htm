    <title>Windows crashing after Windows 1803 update - only power button works - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bobbda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows crashing after Windows 1803 update - only power button works &#40;sleep&#41;</h2>
                    HELP – The Windows 1803 update has messed up my system. It gets “stuck” after a few minutes —&gt; all basic windows and explorer functions stop working — the Taskbar doesn’t respond, Start menu won’t appear, Alt+Tab doesn’t work, I am stuck INSIDE whatever
 window I am currently in — even the Minimize, Maximize buttons and resizing and moving of the current window will not respond. Neither will Ctrl+Alt+Del, Windows key, or any other key for that matter, except for the Power/sleep button.<br />
<br />
The only way to get out of this is by pressing the power physical button which in my case puts the computer to sleep, and then wake up out of sleep. And then again the cycle begins all over again – gets stuck after a few minutes of using.<br />
<br />
This problem started right after the 1803 update installed and the system restarted.<br />

            There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates.  
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1709.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1709 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1709
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1803 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1803, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1803 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

<p>I have isolated the problem to be happening only when using Google Chrome.</p>
<p>When I don't use Chrome, it's fine.</p>
<p>So it seems to be something with Chrome and 1803.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The statement is accurate. Here's my experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just did a fresh build with an X470 board with Ryzen 5 2600x and just bought Win10 Home on May 6th. and of course the build downloaded was 1803. Did a clean boot on an M.2 drive and nothing else, installed Prepar3D and it runs anywhere from 1 minute to
 20 minutes max resulting in a hard lock up or BSOD. But if you look at the Administrative Events in Event Viewer it's a total nightmare from module faults to network disconnecting to permissions being denied to Security Center faults name it it's all there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I think ms has put a hold on win update since two of my clients are not updating to 1803 still on 1709. I'm going to install 1709 and see if that fixes anything.</p>

            For me, rolling back to 1709 is not a viable option.&nbsp; 1709 has network conflicts with cards that use Broadcom chipsets (Qualcom chips aren't affected and my other computers can function on 1709).&nbsp; If I roll back to 1703 on one particular computer running
 Windows 10 Home, I cannot delay or hide updates, so it tries to update to 1709 nearly every hour.&nbsp; Sometimes, I can roll back to 1703 after an update, but sometimes the rollback feature does not work and I've got to reinstall everything.&nbsp; I've been online
 and given remote control to MS techs 3 different times for this one computer, and the latest advice was to go ahead and update to 1803.&nbsp; The first update installed, but experienced the bug which prevented booting after the first time the computer was shut
 down.&nbsp; I rolled back to 1703 and contacted MS support again.&nbsp; He did 'something' to prevent the boot issue and the computer ran fine for about 36 hours.&nbsp; Now, the taskbar and other features will not wor

            Hi, Cameron,
<br />
<br />When you change Motherboards there is a process you must follow otherwise you are considered to have created a New PC which does require a New License to activate.
<br />
<br />"When installing Windows 10, the digital license associates itself with your PC’s hardware. So, if you make significant changes, such as replacing your motherboard, Windows will no longer find a license that matches your PC."
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />Start &gt; Select Get Help app
<br />The Virtual Assistant will appear

<p>Is this a computer that came with Windows preinstalled? If so it's an OEM copy of Windows. OEM copies have several disadvantages, the most serious of which is that their license ties them permanently to the first computer they are installed on. And Microsoft
 considers that changing the motherboard makes it a different computer.<br />
</p>
<p>So if it's an OEM copy, technically, you can't do what you want. But you can try calling Microsoft and asking them for help. They've been known to sometimes allow reactivation in such cases.</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the very same problem. I have tried your suggestion and everything is set correctly but still no sound. I get a notification box in the top-right hand corner just no sound. In fact I have tried everything I can think of. The problem appeared out of
 the blue, I&nbsp;started off &nbsp;getting the email and calendar alert sounds and then all of a sudden they just stopped. I wonder if it's some kind of dodgy Microsoft update that has caused the problem.</p>

            <p>Thank you but I have already sorted it out myself. The Calendar and Mail apps are just too finicky with .wav files, it turns out that they have to be 16bit .wav files which is a little bit petty and inflexible. This needs to change, the apps should be made
 to use any kind of .wav file..&nbsp;</p>

<h3> andrewspace777  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mortal Kombat XL</h2>
                    
<p>Здравствуйте. Подскажите кто либо, почему сейчас MKXL стоит дешевле простого MKX, в чём подвох? Или это просто сборка со всеми дополнениями, без игры? И что самое странное, в браузере на странице с игрой не указан размер, точнее указан, но он составляет
 0мб. Цена конечно заманчивая, но как-то не очень хочется купить и в итоге получить просто сборку с дополнениями. Подскажите, кто либо.)</p>

<p>Добрый день. Сказать почему "XL" дешевле чем просто "Х" думаю смогут только издатели/разработчики. А по сути - да, "XL" это сборка всех дополнений, но - именно с самой игрой "Х" в комплекте. От сюда и размер в 0мб - прокрутите страницу "XL" ниже, и вы увидите
 всё, что входит в сборку и внизу страницы указание, что и игра "Mortal Komabt X" так же туда входит.</p>

Communication bans for stupid reasons ,i have been temp banned from communication features on the xbox multiple times for saying stuff like p**** or suck a D*** being which i have said these thing through an M rated Game which mean 17+ and when people message me i cant reply back</p><p>Please xbox

            <p>Sorry to hear about all the issues you are having, you must have some bad luck or something because I have yet to experience anything you have mentioned. If you do not end up getting a PS4, I would suggest getting a new Xbox One because the one you have now has problems. I do agree with you on the whole communication ban, I think people should just press that mute button if they find something offensive or upsetting. </p>

            <p>I have experenced # 1 from your list many times and agree that rated M games&nbsp;should not be policed at all. If parents buy their kids rated M games and allow them to play said games online, then they&nbsp;have no&nbsp;bases to file a complant. </p><p>Its like parents who allow their kids to smoke, then blames society when they die of lung cancer. </p><p>Yet MS and Sony loves these things bc&nbsp;bans (account or other) is a way to strip you of content/console/account, then resell it to you again at a later date. So for them, finding ways to ban you is just.&nbsp;Good 4biz. &nbsp; </p><p>Sony, who banned and stripped a person of all his digital content bc his parents, at his birth, simply gave him a name that in english means terrorist. No way this could have happened, but Sony and MS chose to display your proper name to everyone, unless you went into settings and changed it. I myself complained of this loooong b4 said person was stripped of his content. Yet those here on paTROLL defended th

            When trying to start the Print Spooler Service, Error 1068 means "The dependency service does not exist. or the dependency service or group failed to start."&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Error 126 usually means that some module, named in the error message, can't be found.<br />
<br />
In general, it's much more helpful if you quote the entire text of error messages, without paraphrasing.<br />
<br />
Without more information from you, my guess is that you used to have a Lexmark printer (or a Dell-badged Lexmark printer) and then uninstalled it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
So ...<br />
What are the makes and models of all printers currently installed?<br />
Did you ever have a Lexmark or Dell printer installed?<br />
What happened to your system prior to the problem occurring? <br />
<br />
To return your printing system to its "normal" configuration, <br />
Click Start, then click Run.<br />
Type the following in the "Open" box and click OK<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>sc config spooler depend= RPCSS</strong> <br />
<br />
make sure that there is a space after the = sign but not before it<br />
<br />
You should be able to print without those errors now.<br />

            <p>Hi Julie, thanks for your answer. Yes I have done all that. This morning I have been looking at resetting winsock catalog, ip etc. When I run this command netcfg -v -s a in an elevated prompt it show my I219-V intel network adapter. Its showing in device
 manger that it is running ok. Here at the command prompt it is showing it. It is not showing it when I choose it in Windows 10. The TCPIP protocol are not binding to the card. Everything has been working for about a year when suddenly the other day, I think
 about 16 -20 March, I think there may have been a Windows update, no network or internet! My last successful install was on the 17/03/2017 KB3150513. Every update since then has failed. The last fail was on thee 29/03/2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. I've not reached the hair pulling out stage yet!</p>

            <p>Hi Both Julie and Greg,</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest and suggestions. Very late last night I discovered what the problem was. I ran a virtual machine using VMware Windows 7. It booted up and the network card was recognised and I was able to go onto the internet. I now knew it wasn't
 the card. I looked at the Ethernet properties of the card and there were only 4 items listed TCP/ip4v etc.</p>
<p>I then closed down the virtual machine and looked at the Ethernet properties of the card under Win 10. There many more items in the Ethernet properties box and I un-ticked this one&nbsp;<strong>Jump Start Wireless Filter Driver</strong>&nbsp;and Wow I had the network
 and internet back. I must have looked at this item's box 100 times! If only I had read it! Thanks to both of you. I will now mark this as solved.</p>

<h3> judasmaster  say:</h3>
<h2>            No ADMINISTRATOR permissions when I am the Administrator&#63; 9 hours to copy 20 Gb&#63;&#63;&#63; when in XP or &#40;even better&#41; in LINUX it takes but just a few minutes&#63;&#63;&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>Why Do I need to use a Linux Live CD in order to have FULL PERMISSIONS on my OWN system, and to avoid hours waiting to copy files, which takes minutes on Linux or XP? Why do I have to do technical fixes and "work arounds" in order to "hack" MY OWN operative
 system in order to be able to simply copy a folder in to my C:\ Drive? Why am I&nbsp;denied access to diferent processes stating that "Administrator Permissions" are required When I AM (supposed to be) THE ADMINISTRATOR?</p>
<p>How come it takes 9 hours to literally copy 20GB from one external drive to another one while in any other system out there it takes just about a few minutes... Seriously? And I have a i7 quad-core processor with 8 GB&nbsp; ram</p>
<p>I know I will in the end find my own way to do what I need to do with MY&nbsp;computer and MY FILES, but I just cant understand why on the damn earth should I have to go through all this stupid little restrictions to use my own system just because of this EXTRAMELY
 LOUSY OPERATING SYSTEM??</p>
<p>In the end of the day I will just go for UBUNTU as my main Operative system and perhaps I will keep windows XP installed as a Virtual Machine if I ever need to use something that requires it.</p>

<p>Dude... I know it doesn't directly affect the speed to copy a file... it was just meant to denote that this is using a pretty decent and up to date workstation... but obviously you couldn't catch the idea...</p>
<p>Anyway I work as well with XP, MAC and Linux workstations and servers on a daily basis and I have never experienced such a lousy performance in such simple task (specially coming from an allegedly high end performance OS)... since you says that you have
 worked with Windows 7 just a bit, then I am guessing you are absolutelly not familiar with the issue Im talking about... check the forums everywhere, its a very well known issue...&nbsp; give it a try whenever you have a chance to paly with Windows 7 again...</p>

 go ahead, but please have the same input to PROVIDE AN ANSWER that has been asked all over this forums with not one single SOLUTION.</p>

<p>Most Windows 7 installs transfer data very quickly, this thread has some fixes that people say have helped:</p>

<p><strong>How to Grant Permissions in Windows 7 </strong><br />
<br />
1. Locate the file or folder in which you want to take ownership in Windows Explorer.<br />
2. Right click on file or folder and select Properties from the Menu <br />
3. Click on the Security tab, then click the Edit button. Click OK to confirm UAC elevation request if needed.<br />
4. Select user/group from permission windows or click add to add other user or group (you may need to do this for multiple users - ex: administrator and your own user account).<br />
5. Now under the Permission section check the rights which you want for the user i.e check "Full Control" under the "Allow" column to assign full access rights control permissions to the user.<br />
6. Click OK for changes to take effect, and click OK again to exit from the Properties window.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Disable User Account Control (UAC) on Windows 7</strong> <br />
<br />
1. Type UAC into the Start Menu or Control Panel search box.<br />
2. Click Change User Account Control Settings.<br />
3. In the windows that pops up drag the slider up or down, depending on the setting you want.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -If you drag it all the way to the bottom, you will disabled it entirely.</p>
<p>Please note that disabling UAC completely is not recommended.</p>

<p>Thank you TrekDozer,</p>
<p>I mentioned that this was still a question because it was changed back by the moderator...</p>
<p>I have done those steps before to change permissions, and I have my UAC disabled already, it's pretty much the same start fix you can find around, however I it seems that I must from now on do this for every single folder I work with??, and this fixes doesn't
 seem to apply to the root, as for what i have read you need to have some Trusted Installer account in order to really be the administrator of the system... seems like you are unable to change this settings for certain folders (system) or the root...</p>
<p>And about the link you sent me, seems like the same story I have read all over the internet, I can see that it seems to work "ok" for 2 or 3 people out of 100,&nbsp;however&nbsp;haven't seen yet one single post that says "HEY THAT WORKED, thanx!"</p>
<p>They mention stuff like reboot in Safe mode and copy in safe mode... if it works its a 3rd party program... some say its the antivirus, well I have no antivirus and still, and if we think of the ammount of programs that people use out there, you would think
 that the problem is not this or that program, but the OS which obviously cant handle them... I read somewhere as well an interesting post mentioning that it was windows indexing every file and creating previews for it while&nbsp;you were copying or even deleting
 them (it was something like that)... file by file.. now imagine 20 Gb of files... no wonder it will take it 9 hours to go through my hundreds of thousands of files...&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I will read the full post and see if I can find any good idea I haven't tried yet.. then againI dont think the end user should be going through this to fix an evident major bug affecting a lot of people...&nbsp; If I ever find fixes (Before I decide to
 install another OS) i wll make sure to post them all over...</p>
<p>Thanx you have been the first one to post something useful.</p>

    <title>Battery saving mode sets screen backlight to zero percent and disables - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> viridwhisper984  say:</h3>
<h2>            Battery saving mode sets screen backlight to zero percent and disables USB ports while paying games.</h2>
                    <p>ever since i bought my laptop with windows 10 few years ago, i am having this one problem to which, unfortunately, i could not find any solution to this day.</p>
<p>i am traveling a lot and i need to use inverters for charging my laptop and while i am charging - all is fine, but when the charging ends, my laptop instantly dims the screen lighting to 50% (this is what i have set it to do) or straight out to 0%, in which
 case i need to set it back to 50% again and all is fine after that - not a big problem.</p>
<p>the main issue that i am frustrated with, is when i am playing games, my laptop decides to go to battery saving mode at a completely random times - dims the display to 0% and disables usb ports. if i minimize the game - usb ports get enabled again. and this
 happens anywhere from 70% of remaining battery to 28%</p>
<p>i have my battery saver turned to 20%</p>
<p>i have tried all i could think of and all things that i could find on the internet, but nothing helped</p>
<p>some people suggested to add a reg key to prevent this from happening - did not help</p>
<p>went to power management to specifically choose the option to NOT disable usb ports when power saving mode starts - did not help</p>
<p>there were many more things that i have tried, but since this problem is so old, i simply can not remember everything i tried out</p>
<p>and it happens with any "bigger" game - small ones that do not use many resources are not causing trouble.</p>

    <title>.MPG files not working in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> claytacia  say:</h3>
<h2>            .MPG files not working in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Like with most things in Windows 10, I'm having some trouble with making and playing .mpg files. &nbsp;They won't playback properly without downloading another media player like VLC. &nbsp;Also, encoding from .mpg to .wmv makes a file that has audio but scrambled
 video. Why are there problems with .mpg files in Windows 10? &nbsp;I can't find a codec to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was so excited to get Windows 10 but it's so bad and slow that I regret the decision to "update" from 8.1 and 7. &nbsp;My machine that ran 7 just flat stopped working last week. &nbsp;Just won't respond to anything after booting up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            What he is probably seeing is the same thing I am. A handful of MPG/MPEG files, usually smaller than 640x480, have decoding errors that manifest as large squares of greens and scrambled colors that appear to be noise on files that will play normally on
 an older system running Windows XP, through Windows 7.

    <title>Dual boot Ubuntu with pre-installed Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anirban ray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual boot Ubuntu with pre-installed Windows</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Inspiron 3543 laptop, which came pre-installed with Windows 8.1. I upgraded it to Windows 10 back in 2015, and currently I'm using Version 1903 OS Build 18362.175.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish to set up a dual boot with Ubuntu 18.04.2 on this laptop. Is it possible to do it with keeping the existing Windows 10 installation unaffected? I've backed up my personal files, but I'll obviously prefer if those remain unaffected.<br />
</p>
<p>In case it matters, let me state that it has only one hard drive (C:), and I never modified disk partitions. Currently, it has about 750 GB of free space. If possible, I'll prefer to access my personal files from both Windows and Ubuntu, but that's not necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>
                </div>

            Hi  Anirban 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Yes, you can, see the following steps:

<br />If this is your first time doing this, as a precaution, I would still make a backup before attempting the steps:

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got around the above problem using cipher and defrag using cmd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I've two questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Can I re-enable the Secure boot after I've installed Ubuntu?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If I want to uninstall Ubuntu later and get back to Windows being the only OS, what are the steps for that?</p>

<p>
</p><p>2. Log in to Windows, format the Ubuntu partition, merge it with the appropriate partition, and delete Ubuntu entry from the boot settings.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 I guess,</h2>
                    <p>Well I downloaded free Windows 10 from Windows 7, I have nothing but trouble. At first it worked fine except I couldn't find a lot of my programs.
</p>
<p>Now Windows 10 isn't working, I can't find my button to log off, start menu, recover, nothing! I can't find my Microsoft office, which I use all the time! Usually when I sign in, I go directly to my server website, that's not happening.</p>
<p>I finally found recover it only went back to 8/16? Where's everything at? HELP!!
</p>
<p>I don't know what to do? Oh I had Cortana, not now!</p>
<p>I am so afraid of losing everything on my computer!! Everything appears hidden I can't find anything!</p>

            <p>I never did get my computer fixed after downloading Windows 10. I've tried to find a way to get it off my computer so I could reload it again and see if it will fix it. But I can't even find it! I can't find my normal menu, it's gone, my start menu is gone!
 I found a link which is abnormal to be able to even use my computer! I am able to get on line through this but it's not a regular connection. I don't want to lose all my pictures, documents, etc. I am not computer literate per say. I know some but not enough
 to work on my computer. do you think if I just tried to load up windows again it would help?</p>

<h2>            Pen clip broken after 3 days of normal use</h2>
                    The little pocket clip on the Surface 3 pen simply came off after 3 days of use. This is very annoying and further reduces the already limited portability of the pen. I had the Surface brought all the way from the US to Pakistan, and now I'm not sure what
 I can do to solve this. Anyone else facing the same issue? Anyone know of a&nbsp;way I can try to fix this problem myself. Does Microsoft a any internal diagram for the pen which I can use for a teardown?

    <title>Stop antimalware service executable &#40;Windows defender automatic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aaronshenhao  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stop antimalware service executable &#40;Windows defender automatic scan&#41; on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am aware that there are several posts on this, and I have tried to follow the solutions given, but this problem still exists. I have tried changing its settings under 'Task Scheduler' to only idle and when AC power is connected, but it still runs when
 the computer isn't idle and when not on AC power. I have also attached a screenshot showing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems like a problem native to the recent Windows 10 updates. Before Windows 10, this was never a problem. As you can see from the screenshot, the process takes up 30% of the CPU, at times it can go up to 50%. This is horrendous, not only for CPU dependent
 applications, but for my computer. Using 'HWMonitor', I can see that the CPU temperature peaks at 70+ Celsius. This is not normal for this computer. Normal CPU temperatures are usually around 40-60 Celsius (usually 50-60 for high CPU draining applications).
 And all these results are just with Chrome open and a few system tray tasks. I also found that the computer has gotten much hotter. The heat from the computer can be felt while working, which can't be good for the lifespan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure why this is an issue again. Previously, it used to happen, but it used to go away after a while. I suspect the recent Windows 10 updates must have messed something up again, especially since the defender app was updated. I had my computer on
 for the 2 days and this process has not stopped. All through the night, the fans could be heard very loudly. With just Chrome open right now, the overall CPU usage is at 72%, which is something I might expect with several apps open and when connected to multi
 monitors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me fix this problem? All help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Aaron.</p>

            <p>Hi Syed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. I followed all the steps: ending the explorer.exe task then re-enabling it. However, the issue still seems to persist. From the time when I posted that post until now, the antimalware service executable is still running. I heard that
 it is meant to stop after scanning all the files, but it doesn't seem to stop. I have attached another screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main concern is that it will affect the performance of other apps by hogging the CPU (it only leaves 2/3 to 1/2 of the CPU free for other apps to use). I am also concerned that it will cause unnecessary wear on the CPU and other components by the increased
 heat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, it also seems to be pushing my disk usage high into the red zone, the screenshot shows it pushing my disk usage above 95%. And this is just with one application open, which is Chrome. This is quite a powerful laptop, it should not be doing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help,</p>

            <p><strong>Thank you Krishna for your reply.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here's an update:</strong></p>
<p>I seem to have resolved the issue (by luck?). I'm not sure whether this was main cause for solving the problem, but the antimalware service seems to hardly using the CPU at all (0.2%) right after I did this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I dug up a couple of popular posts, and one of them suggested that installing a third-party antivirus software would disable Windows Defender. I chose a free one called Avira, because I read a lot of positive reviews about it. Note that this did
<strong>not </strong>solve the problem. In fact, it made it worse. The Avira antivirus took up an enormous chunk of the CPU and Disk usage, which is like having dual antimalware services running at the same time! I thought that Windows Defender had not yet
 recognized that another antivirus software, since it wasn't disabled, so I restarted the computer. However, this did not work. Windows Defender simply did not disable to allow the third-party antivirus to do its job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the second antivirus was causing issues, and I also found the popup notifications annoying, I decided to uninstall Avira. After uninstalling, I restarted the computer, and the antimalware service high CPU usage was now gone. I'm not sure why this happened,
 but it seemed to have resolved the issue somehow.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The problem is happening again. This time it is using more than 30 percent of my CPU without any apps even open! And after Windows 10, the disk usage has been 100% for no reason . I'm not an expert on how operating system manages a computer, but I'm definitely
 sure that loud fan noises 24/7 are not good for the computer at all. I'm also not sure what's up with the 100% hard drive usage. I'm sure that my hard drive can go faster than that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me solve this problem. The recent windows 10 update seemed to be worse than windows 8 in terms of performance.</p>
<p>

 because of this stupid thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all started with the most recent set of Windows 10 updates in August. My computer never used to do this before those updates. Microsoft has created a serious problem here and it's been going on for almost 3 months now with no fix. Get your act together!!!!</p>

            <p>I have been fighting this for over a year. And as aaronshenhao says-it is worse since the last update. Has been running non stop.</p>
<p>I think it is appalling that Microsoft cannot come up with a fix that actually works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After much surfing myself online I did find one thing that has worked. </p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.deskdecode.com/antimalware-service-executable-high-usage-fix/</p>
<p>Used option #2</p>
<p>
</p><p>He says:</p>
When you’ve right click on that “<strong>Antimalware Service Executable”</strong>&nbsp;process in your task manager and select the open file location option, it will lead you to the file name
<strong>“MsMpEng.exe”</strong> which is normally located in the Windows Defenders program files.
<p>And that’s the file who’s creating this problem:</p>
<p>By given that file path in your defender’s <strong>“Excluded files and locations”</strong> setting, it will skip that location to scan, I’m suggesting this
<p>
</p><p>This makes sense to me...plus it is an easy fix. Has totally fixed the problem (so far)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it works for you!</p>

            Thank you for responding.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp; Its connected by USB. (same connector as I use for my MP3 player which downloads from windows media player with no problem).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; No error message (actually states its been&nbsp;completed)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3.&nbsp; Computer recognises device, whilst its connected,&nbsp;computer says the music has been downloaded. (the&nbsp;Kindle says no music on device or in cloud player.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As you may realise I am completely useless with any kind of technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spoken to the kindle helpline and they said the music has to be converted to MP3 format, I have no idea what this means, they&nbsp;gave me instruction on&nbsp;downloading a converter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately
 it didn't link to the media player and was so confusing I couldn't understand it.&nbsp; I also don't understand why I need to do anything different than I do with my MP3 transfers.&nbsp; I have even tried deleting all from my MP3 music and downloading again and everything
 worked.&nbsp;&nbsp; I checked that I had the latest media player installed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I have tried the kindle&nbsp;support site and&nbsp;it keeps telling me I should be able to download my music from my computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hope the above helps you to to help me.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Getting desperate my next dilemma is trying to download to tomtom a paper receipt to claim my free for ever map updates.&nbsp; But don't worry about that one yet.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks in anticipation of a simple to follow solution.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Xbox elite controller drift</h2>
                    <p>so my controller is now experiencing this drift that everyone else is talking about. I don't remember if I'm still under warranty or not, it's been awhile. From what I've read, it seems that Microsoft is doing nothing to rectify this issue and it is a very common issue (which screams defect). Has anyone considered a class action lawsuit?</p>

    <title>Wish List in Windows 10 Store&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wish List in Windows 10 Store&#63;</h2>
                    <p>As I am pleased to see a great selection of games and apps&nbsp;in Windows Store, I wish there was some way to add ones that catch my interest to a "wish list." That way I can go back and check them out when I am done browsing the store. Otherwise the title and
 location&nbsp;of the app will become forgotten as I continue to browse. I frequently use the wish list on my&nbsp;android phone in Google's play store, and it is a big help. If such a place exists already in Microsoft's Store, where do I find it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just some feedback. :)</p>

    <title>Skype Premium with Office 365&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baldain68  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Premium with Office 365&#63;</h2>
                    I get 60 minutes of free Skype World Minutes, but can you upgrade to a Skype Premium account at a discount when you have Office 365 Home Premium? I seems redundant to purchase Office 365 at $9.95 a month and then purchase Skype at another $9.95 a month....
 Can Skype features be added? Like Group Calling as an add-on to an existing account, or to Office 365?
