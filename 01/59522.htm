<p>That's Microsoft BS!&nbsp; My Daughter switched with her college roommate and the different keyboard worked. Why supply "inexpensive" not profitable replacement parts when they want you to purchase brand new.&nbsp; Never buy another Microsoft POS again!!!!!</p>

            Hi MahmoodPiash,
<br />
<br />I'm Nathan, a fellow Microsoft customer and expert user here to help.
<br />
<br />If you perform a Windows reset/reinstall, your copy of Windows will activate automatically upon successful reset/reinstall. The license gets tied to the PCs hardware (specifically the motherboard). 
<br />
<br />If the hardware (specifically the motherboard) is going to change, I would suggest looking at the following Microsoft website: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/20530/window...</a>
<br />
<br />If you wish to use an older PCs Windows license key, it depends on if the license is OEM or retail. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan       
        </p>

            Hi Mahmood.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If this is the key you activated Windows 10 with then it should stay activated but if not you can always reinsert it.  You're entitled to reinstall the same licensed version of Windows in any way you want:  Reset, Fresh Start or the superior Clean Install.
<br />
<br />Steps for resetting here: <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/reset-this-pc-complete-walkthrough-2624538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/reset-this-pc-complete...</a>
<br />Compare to the Fresh Start here:  <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-fresh-start-feature-in-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use...</a>
<br />and the Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />It's likely your key was converted to a Digital License.  If you sign in with a  Microsoft Account it should link the license to it in case you ever need to reactivate.  Check at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation to see what Status and Edition is listed at top.   It will say there if you have the Digital License, and also if it is linked to your MS Account.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Elky,<br />
<br />
Have you upgraded to Windows 10 from a previous version? This could be related to filter drivers in the BluRay storage stack that were not migrated successfully. Kindly follow these steps to fix the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start</strong> menu, type <strong>regedit</strong> in the Cortana search box, and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Locate and then click the following registry subkey:
<ul>
<li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</li></ul>
</li><li>If you see <strong>UpperFilters</strong> in the pane on the right side, right-click
<strong>UpperFilters</strong>, and then click <strong>Delete</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes</strong> to confirm the removal of the UpperFilters registry entry.</li><li>If you see <strong>LowerFilters</strong> in the pane on the right side, right-click
<strong>LowerFilters</strong>, and then click <strong>Delete</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Yes </strong>to confirm the removal of the LowerFilters registry entry.</li><li>Exit Registry Editor, and then restart the computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For
 added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft

<p>
</p><p>please can someone advise what to do when system restore hangs in windows 10. The screen says it is &nbsp;restoring the registry but has stayed like that for over an hour and a half.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the computer seems to be whirling away, and the circle of microsoft dots are still whizzing in a circle on the screen, but i am assuming its hung and stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help and ideas appreciated as to what i should do?</p>

            Hi Martyn
<br />
<br />This is a well reported issue with the System Restore process in Windows 10
<br />
<br />You have no option but to perform a hard shut down, then see if your system boots correctly . . .
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Power button on your PC for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down
<br />
<br />Then boot your system up to see if it will successfully boot
<br />
<br />If not, try running another System Restore operation, to see if that completes . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
        </p>

            Hi nomad-45,<br />
Can you provide any more detail?<br />
Like what were you doing when it happened?<br />
<br />
Does it always happen at the same time of day or at the same interval.<br />
<br />
Have you checked the Hardware Compatability List to make sure that all the parts within you box are certified?<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Is it a PC or laptop.<br />
<br />
How old is it.<br />
<br />
Did you dump coffee on it or kick it around the room? (It happens!) :-)

<h2>            Cannot login with microsoft account on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Can not login with microsoft account</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to login with my Microsoft account I get the following message, 'Oops, something went wrong. This service isn't available right now - Please try again later.'</p>
<p>I have cancelled the account once and after a month I created a new one using different details but still get the same message. I have reset the password and still get the same message. I have tried many times on different days and always get the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to actually login with a Microsoft account, what is the account used for and where is it needed?</p>
<p>Should I persist with this account or just delete it instead?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to use 'Edge' but can not sync because it says I have to use a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I do not want to login to my computer using a Microsoft account!.&nbsp; I want to be able to login in other situations where a Microsoft account is required. At the moment I can not login to Windows Store nor can I login to send feedback or get support for Edge.
 I have decided the I will not be using Edge as I cannot get it to do much of anything, I will stick with an internet browser instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only place that the Microsoft account works is when I login to the 'Microsoft Community' and this indicates that the account does exist and the details are correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As yet I have not been able to find what the purpose of a Microsoft account is for.
</p>
<p>It concerns me that there seem to be a lot of other people also having problems with a Microsoft account and without knowing what the point of a Microsoft account is, I will just not use it and avoid any programs that require it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will stick with my Google account as it has never failed to work for my phones, email and other places such as social media sites when signing in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may reconsider a Microsoft account when it becomes stable, reliable and when I can find a use for the account.</p>
<p>Thanks for your efforts in trying to resolve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>
<p>John</p>

<p>&nbsp;point 1, I don't login to other computers that are not mine.</p>

</p><p>point 2. I don't know what Windows Store&nbsp; contain but it unlikely if I will ever use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>point 3. I don't use Twitter or Linkedin. Facebook always works ok and I cannot use Outlook.com anymore because within an hour of creating and Outlook account it was closed by Microsoft for suspicious activity even though it was never used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>point 4. I can't use Onedrive and I do not share photos or documents.</p>
<p>

 the computer.</em></span></p>
<p><span>I followed the link but it does not tell me how to create another Microsoft account, only how to sign in with my existing Microsoft Account, but now it seems that it has duplicated my existing Microsoft account and I still cannot sign in. I tried to
 delete/remove both the Microsoft accounts, but it won't remove either them.</span></p>
<p>On thing has changed however, when I now try to send feedback from 'Edge', I now get the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Feedback is blocked</p>
<p>Your diagnostics and usage data setting is managed by your organization and currently doesn't allow using Windows Feedback.</p>
<p>For more info go to settings.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to settings, I get the following message under 'Feedback' which says 'Some settings are managed by your organization'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what those settings are but I have not changed any of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still don't know why I can use the Microsoft account to sign in to the Microsoft Community but not sign in to anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can see having a Microsoft account has no use for me and seems to be causing problems, so I will attempt to remove/delete/cancel them, If that is possible.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>To Likhitha V, thanks anyway for your efforts to solve my problem. But since I cannot login to anywhere with a Microsoft Account (except for Microsoft Community), it is pointless to keep either of the two Microsoft Accounts I have.</span></p>

<h2>            Minecraft  &#40;Xbox One&#41;&#58; Friend Cannot Join My Game</h2>
                    
<p>Hey there! I've been playing Minecraft quite a bit within the last few weeks and have had no trouble when it comes to inviting my friends over to one of my games so we could play together; but, for some odd reason, my boyfriend is unable to join any of my
 games and he keeps receiving a message saying,<span>&nbsp;"Cannot join game because you are not friends with anybody in the game." Him and I are indeed friends with each other on Xbox Live, yet he cannot join any of my games. However, if he invites me to one of
 his games in Minecraft, I am able to join him without any trouble. Is there a way to fix this? I have never had this problem when using the Xbox 360 version. I greatly appreciate any help!</span></p>

<p>I would have you both delete your profiles then re download them , I would also send each other a friends request and see what it says ...then maybe "remove friend" and send each other invites again....all this assumes you have both hard reset your xbox
 ones , modems and routers...</p>

 which said that I should make windows install the drivers automatically once i connected the printer to the pc. however I still get the error message.

            <p>You can't mount a 64 bit Windows 7 and start the installation within a 32 bit version of Windows. So, mounting and installing is not an option in this case since you will have to boot from the 64 Bit installation medium to install it over 32 bit Vista.</p>
<p>Make sure all your personal files and settings have been backed up:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/</a></p>
<p>Also understand that all your applications must be reinstalled along 64 bit native drivers.
</p>
<p>32 vs 64 bit</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions
</p>
<p>Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7</p>
<p>Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers.</p>

<h2>            AMD R6 Graphics &#40;Primary&#41; Not Working After Windows 10 1903 update</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop with AMD A10-7300 with R6 graphics.</p>
<p>The graphics "AMD Radeon R6 Graphics" is not working after the Windows 10 1903 update.</p>
<p>The error message that I get is "Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device works perfectly well in Windows 10 1809 and all previous windows 10 builds.</p>
<p>It doesn't create any issues when I rolled back the Windows 10 1903 update to Windows 10 1809.</p>
<p>When I scan for hardware changes in Device manager or if I try to install AMD Display drivers, the display goes black except the cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also tired clean installing windows 10 1903 using the ISO files but the same issue persists.</p>

            Hi  Lewis_G
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />This is likely to be a compatibility issue with Windows 10 1903 and your display driver.
<br />
<br />I would also recommend you file a bug report; send me the short link so I can vote on it and bring it to the attention of the Windows engineers.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-submit-a-suggestion-or-bug-report-in-windows-10-using-feedback-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-su...</a>
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/block-windows-10-feature-update-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/block-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />Recommendations:
<br />If your system is working fine under Windows 10 1809, keep it with that version for now. Windows 10 1903 is still new and there might be some issues with certain hardware configurations that needs to be rolled out first. 
<br />
<br />Information in the above link is sourced from a trusted Microsoft MVP blog.

<p>Thanks for your quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the solution for this problem by trying various combinations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps that I followed were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install Windows 10 1903 via the update assistant.</li><li>Windows will alert that no drivers are installed for the AMD device on completion of installation of Windows 10 1903.</li><li>Go to Device Manager</li><li>Uninstall the device(For my case the R6 graphics, that had error code 43).</li><li><strong>Do not scan for hardware changes.</strong></li><li>Install AMD display driver (19.7.1 is the one I installed)</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Note:&nbsp; The display remained black for 8minutes, in my case, while installing the AMD driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Done.</p>

<p><span><span>To create 2 backup tasks under windows 7 (both x86 and x64) Pro (and higher, I don't know about more basic versions).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&gt;&gt;Use Windows 7 "Backup and Recovery" to schedule the Image backup for 1 time every week on a day you select.<span>&nbsp;</span>Note: I only checked the small
 box at the bottom for include Image and did not check the box for "C:" drive as this should already be included.<span>&nbsp;</span>You (should) will find the link for setting the schedule day and time.<span>&nbsp;</span>You can run this config using
 "Backup Now" and see the results in the "D:" drive in directory/folder "WindowsImageBackup" (in my case about 33 GB).<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&gt;&gt;Ok, now that you have configured the Image backup with a schedule the next steps are: 1. Using Windows Explorer go to C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\<span>&nbsp;</span>and
 create a new folder (right click New ) "WindowsImage".<span>&nbsp;</span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Navigate (click on) “WindowsBackup”<span>&nbsp;</span>and then copy the File “AutomaticBackup” to<span>&nbsp;</span>“WindowsImage” folder.<span>&nbsp;
</span>3.<span>&nbsp;</span>Rename this File in “WindowsImage” to “AutomaticImageBackup”.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&gt;&gt;Next Steps:<span>&nbsp;</span>1. Start "Task Scheduler" and naviate to \Microsoft\Windows\ and then on menu click "Action" and select "New Folder" and enter
 name "WindowsImage".<span>&nbsp;</span>2. Click on the new Folder "WindowsImage" and then go back and click on "Action" and select "Import Task" an navigate to<span>&nbsp;</span>C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsImage change file type
 to *.* and select AutomaticImageBackup click OK/Select.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&gt;&gt;Now you have the Image backup you want finish configuring the Task.<span>&nbsp;</span>1. Click on General in the middle screen and then in the right hand screen
 click on "Properties".<span>&nbsp;</span>2. Under General Tab input the Description you want to describe this Task.<span>&nbsp;</span>3. Under Trigger Tab use Edit to set the schedule you desire (make sure "Enable" box at the bottom is checked.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>4.
 Under Conditions Tab ( I selected) check the 2 boxes under "Power".<span>&nbsp;</span>Click OK and you are finished with - Image Backup with a schedule-.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&gt;&gt;For the “data/user/files/“ backup setup; Go back and use Windows 7 "Backup and Recovery" to schedule.<span>&nbsp;</span>1. Select “Change settings”, then select
 “D:” drive and “Next” button.<span>&nbsp;</span>2.<span>&nbsp; </span>Select “Let me choose” (I did; you could Let Windows choose) and “Next” button.<span>&nbsp;</span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Expand the “C:” drive and select all the Folders you want backed up daily.<span>&nbsp;</span>(I choose to have my own Folders for Data Storage as this computer shares data/applications with 3 other users).<span>&nbsp;</span>I selected<span>&nbsp;
</span>Data (contains all common data for all users), Pictures (same reason), QK (Quicken shared users), Users (all user files on computer are under this folder; including “Data Files” listed first).<span>&nbsp;</span>4.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Make sure the box “Include a system image of drives –etc” is not selected and click on “Next”.<span>&nbsp;</span>6. Select “Change schedule” in the middle, check the “Run backup on a schedule and select (I do Daily) at 11:00 P.M.
 (Note: if you want to select the minutes<span>&nbsp;</span>you must go back to Task Scheduler) and click OK.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>7. Now “Save settings and exit” and you are finished.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: under” Manage Space” it will say your Image schedule is not set, but this is because it cannot handle cleanly 2 different scheduled backups.<span>&nbsp;</span>You
 (the Administrator) must keep track of how much file space is being used on “D:” drive and delete only files.<span>&nbsp;</span>I am still learning on this part.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>All the above " " should not be included as they are for highlighting!&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            this does not work. &nbsp;When the task runs it executes only whatever the current setting in backup is. &nbsp;There must be another step.

<h2>            &#34;Specified login session does not exist&#34; error and NovaBackup</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a real problem with our backups. We run a Windows Server 2012 to host a huge drive where our workstations back up our data. We use Nova Backup, and part of our configuration is that we define the destination directory on the server as a Device.
 We enter the path name, a login account, and its password. We all use the same account, which has Admin access.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I do this, I frequently get an error message stating that "Unable to verify security credentials. A specified login session does not exist."</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick Web search reports that a fix for this involves changing a network security setting so that the computer stores passwords (using gpedit.msc). Well, I've done this, and I still get the error message.
<br />
<br />
To make matters worse, this message occasionally doesn't happen, and I'm able to define the Device normally... but a few moments later, I get the same error on the same device configuration. So it may be a transient problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of our local machines are Windows 7, and the server's version 2012. I'm a novice at using a Windows server, so if there's any kind of advice that'll let me run our backups reliably, I'd be grateful.

Modern UI Style Apps are running in a sort of sandboxerd environment. They have also another API -&gt; The WinRT API ... And Modern UI Apps are touched optimized. Design specs states that Modern UI Apps should only be good at one thing. Mail app for mails, calendar
 app for calendar stuff and so on... Unlike desktop Applications, which can be good at multiple things.

Windows 8 Apps are built under an App system similar to the ones with Smart Phones and Mac
<div>They are downloaded/purchased from Store App in Windows 8 and are linked to your Microsoft account</div>
<div>Their updates/installation/removal are handled by the App system</div>
<div><br />
<div>Desktop applications are independant from the App system, run directly under Windows and aren't linked to anything by default</div>
<div>Their updates/installation/removal are handled by the user (there are some exceptions like application's developer can configure the program to update itself)</div>

            <p><span>Hi Iacob Adrian,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>Have you made any changes to the computer?</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the
 issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the
 option Load startup items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click
 ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the ‘StartUp’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab,
 right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span>g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check
 boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining
 check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected
 service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</span></b><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine
 which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check
 boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining
 check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem,
 the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine
 which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program
 manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you run the Modern UI App troubleshooter and check.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</span></a></p>

            Do you have at least one picture in the "Camera Roll" section of the Photo Albums on the iPhone?&nbsp; If yes, it should be recognized and automatically show up.&nbsp; If not, (and assuming you have a fairly recent version of iOS) the phone won't be recognized.&nbsp;
 That is due to a change Apple made (in iOS 4 if I remember correctly, but may have been 5).&nbsp; I think their reasoning was that since the only thing you can do directly in Windows (not iTunes)&nbsp; with the phone connected is to move pictures from the Camera Roll
 on the phone to the computer -- therefore if there aren't any pictures in the Camera Roll there is no reason to even recognize that the phone is attached.<br />

    <title>BSOD due to BUGCODE_NDIS_DRIVER attempting to upgrade to Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            BSOD due to BUGCODE_NDIS_DRIVER attempting to upgrade to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to update from Windows 8 Pro to Windows 8.1 Pro. The download and install progress fine until after a few reboots and Getting Degices Ready, Getting Ready counting up a few percent then it hits a blue screen of death (with smiley) indicating</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUGCODE_NDIS_DRIVER</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then it reboots and restores the OS to Windows 8.&nbsp;With error code:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;0xC1900101-0x4000D</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;double-checked my network drivers in Device Manager and all are&nbsp;up-to-date.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have three network drivers listed: 1. My ASUS Wireless PCI-e card (drivers up-to-date for Windows 8 64-bit), 2. Microsoft Multiplexor driver, 3. Realtek Ethernet driver (on-board motherboard Ethernet).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to find out why it's getting the BSOD? Can I send in the dump files it's creating (I see it count up as it creates the dump files).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice for getting this machine to upgrade to 8.1?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I initially had&nbsp;exactly the same problem and continue to do so after successfully upgrading.&nbsp; I have a Zyxel AC240 WLAN adapter.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was able to upgrade by disconnecting the AC240, but still can't use until Microsoft or Zyxel came out with an update for
 the driver, since even after uninstalling and reinstalling it goes right to the BUGCODE_NDIS_DRIVER error and reboots.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>DrGreenPower,</p>
<p>I have a Toshiba Satellite S855D-S5120 and successfully upgraded to 8.1 after a number of issues.&nbsp; I can't remember it all but you have to run some things prior to upgrading using Toshiba Service Station.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Once you do get it to upgrade you will need to run Service Station again.&nbsp; This was, at least for me a long process.&nbsp; I have an AMD system, the video, hdmi video driver, Realtek wlan driver and Toshiba Video Player all need to be updated.&nbsp; Also, be aware
 you for these installations you have to uninstall the previous version for the updates to work.</p>

            <p>This is exactly what I see too. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also have an ASRock Motherboard -- will check the model when I'm back at that computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried disabling the onboard Ethernet due to other reports related&nbsp;to Relatek drivers. I only use the PCI-e WiFi for connectivity.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I searched the ASRock site for 8.1 drivers and BIOS but only see Windows 8 drivers listed. Maybe we need to wait and hope for ASRock to catch up??</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I believe the BSOD dumps are stored in C:\Windows\Minidump so tomorrow I may be able to look at it with Visual Studio at work and see if I can tell what might be crashing though it would be much better if Microsoft would supply a tool to examine the issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can anyone from Microsoft help?</p>

<p>I am using an ASUS N15 WiFi PIC-e card in my machine,&nbsp; I updated it to the latest ASUS drivers for Windows 8 64-bit but that didn't help.&nbsp;

            <p>Two other threads have posted the solution for this problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disabling the non-Microsoft services in MSCONFIG.exe before attempting the install allowed everything to work and the install finished fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to these threads:</p>

            When you turn these services back on after the installation, how does the system behave? &nbsp;Are there any negative repercussions?

            I tried the procedure of turning off all of the non-Microsoft services, but the result was actually worse. &nbsp;The system didn't even attempt to install, rather it quickly went to the screen that says reverting to previous operating system. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I also have a Zyxel AC240 USB 3.0 wireless adapter in this system -- I have tried to remove it and uninstall the driver, but also did not have success and reached the same blue screen frown. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am not sure what the situation is here, but I do feel its related to the AC240 -- I think its up to Zyxel to fix this - I will post a review over at Newegg on the product page explaining the issues we are having here and see if Zyxel responds as it is
 pretty important to update this issue if they want to sell their stuff going forward.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any other ideas?</div>

            <p>This is what I did to fix this.</p>
<p>First I just downloaded W8.1 from the W-store and when that was done it gives you the option to reboot/restart now
<strong>or</strong> later ( in 15 min).<br />
So in those 15 min I went to device manager and uninstalled the drivers for my network adapter, after that I removed the adapter (from my pc) and rebooted the system.
</p>
<p>Windows did it's thing and it worked!<br />
for me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope this helps</p>
