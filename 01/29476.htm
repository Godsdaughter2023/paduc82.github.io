            <p>The last command is not running correctly. The red text is a rather long account of what is happening but the common thread appears to be "Deployment failed with HRESULT :0x80073CF6,&nbsp;Package could not be registered.
</p>
<p>Error 0x80070002<em>: </em>"Windows cannot register the package because of an internal error or low memory"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The task bar began playing up after a recent update, restoring the PC to an earlier date worked until the update was reapplied.</p>
<p>If there are any further suggestions it would be appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

            I am in the same situation. Microsoft Edge and Store Icons have disappeared and start button not working. Was OK until I switched the computer on this morning. I have tried "Restore" (which fails) and the solution above without success. Can anyone help
 please?

            <p>I have had this problem since upgrading to Windows 10. I was really hoping this last big update would fix it but no luck. Everyday I have to right click on my Start button and restart to regain functionality of the taskbar. I tried the solution above but
 it was unsuccessful.</p>

            <p>I have had the same issue of intermittent problems with the taskbar (start menu not showing up, action center not showing up, ect.) and the only easy solution for me had been to restart Windows Explorer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. On your keyboard press Ctrl+alt+delete</p>
<p>2. Click Task Manager</p>
<p>3. Under the Processes tab, find Windows Explorer</p>
<p>4. Right click and press Restart</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a quick and fairly simple way to temporarily fix the issue (at least for me). Hopefully a future update will permanently fix this common problem though.&nbsp;</p>

This is what I found on another forum and it is the best way to fix this issue...I just fixed mine in literally 4 minutes.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
1. Go to the desktop. &nbsp;Right click anywhere, hover mouse over New and click Shortcut</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
2. When making shortcut it will ask you to type a location. &nbsp;Type in "msconfig" click Next and then it will ask you what you want to name the shortcut...name it anything you want it isn't important.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
3. A shortcut for msconfig will show up.. Double click it and click on the Boot tab at the top. &nbsp;Once in the boot tab enable Safeboot and then click Network underneath it and then click Apply and then OK. &nbsp;It will ask you to restart...REstart computer.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
4. Once it is restarted, go to msconfig again and turn off Safeboot and then apply and Ok and restart again. &nbsp;Things will be back to normal.</p>

            I had to reinstall Windows 10 entirely (so without keeping any programs and files in C:) and it seems that the problem went away. Finally.<br />
Good ol' reinstall, that may solve many problems...<br />
<br />
I think if you upgrade from Windows 7, your "whole" Windows Search may be damaged.<br />
<br />
Very thank you for the answers.

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>DrSweetSurvivor</span><strong>,&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>Sorry you're having issues with your console. First, with the Xbox turned off, try wiping down the front of it with a towel to ensure there are no smudges or something else that could be impacting the touch. After that if it's still no working try
 unplugging the console for 5 minutes, plug it back in and test it. If you're still having issues then I would recommend submitting a<a href="https://devicesupport.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> repair here</a> as your front panel may not be functioning correctly.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Google Hangouts app, closes unexpectedly and shortly after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kilroy_73  say:</h3>
<h2>            Google Hangouts app, closes unexpectedly and shortly after opening...on Window 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10, from Windows 8.1, and now the Google Hangouts app which runs via Google Chrome closes unexpectedly, and fairly shortly after opening (around 10-30 minutes). &nbsp;I used to open the app and let it run in the background all the
 time, and then I would receive real time messages from friends whenever they were on-line, and I had just gotten accustomed to letting it run 24/7, but now on Windows 10 it seems to shut down if not used within an alloted time, would anyone know is there a
 setting for this, or is this just another issue with Windows 10? &nbsp;(I have received several error messages relating to unrelated issues, and this does not have an associated error message, so I am hoping that this is a settings issue, but have no idea where
 to go to fix the issue.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Sadly no, the issue isn't confined to the Google Hangouts app; I am having MAJOR issues with Window 10 all over the place and I thought that this might have simply been a stand alone issue, or one that could be solved without needing to solve the 50 +/-
 other errors that I have been having with Windows 10. &nbsp;The Windows Store app trouble shooter app freezes when ran, and there are no app updates for me to try and download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error codes that I have been receiving are: 0x80240020</p>
<p>0x8246010</p>
<p>0x8000ffff</p>
<p>0x80072efd</p>

</p><p>And I was scheduled for a tier 2 tech rep to have called me back last Wednesday, and again on Thursday, however, I guess that they forgot. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi sharifamalek,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I'm tempted to jump on the bandwagon and say "format the drive and do a clean install," I'm not going to do that because the simple fact here is that we do not know the cause or how they are getting in (or if the events are active or passive events).&nbsp;
 A clean boot may solve the problem, but that may not be where the issue is located.&nbsp; Until the problem is identified, I recommend holding off on radical procedures and try some of the less invasive options and test to see if we can locate where and how you
 are being controlled.&nbsp; We can always try this as a last resort if all other things fail, but I don't think we're there yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, it is a good idea to change ALL your passwords - the login password for every existing username on the computer, your ISP password, your e-mail password, your router password and especially the router security key (which means changing the access
 settings on all the connected computers to the new key).&nbsp; If the router isn't secure, make sure you make it secure.&nbsp; Also, while configuring the router, change the default passwords used after a reset to something else that you won't forget (if you forget,
 your router is hosed) because everyone&nbsp;who does this kind of thing knows the standard defaults used by the major manufacturers (admin/admin, administrator/password, etc...) and it makes no sense to give them such an opening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, if you are using an Adminstrator account for day-to-day activities, create a standard account for that and use the Administrator account only when required (and be sure to have 2 or 3 Administrator accounts - some which you may never use - as backups
 in case something happens to your real one since that could be a serious problem if you don't have another to use to repair things).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Firewall does an excellent&nbsp;job and you don't need get a 3rd party firewall product.&nbsp; The trick is making sure it is only excluding those items you absolutely need and/or use and removing those that you'll never use (since each represents a hole in
 your security).&nbsp; Check it out and pare it down to your personal basics.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With those holes plugged, now let's verify that this can't be resolved by removing malware infections (which is what I suspect is at the root of the intrusions as is quite often the case and just scanning with Norton isn't enough to rule that out by any
 means).&nbsp; Please proceed as follows (or just skip ahead to the bold section and contact Microsoft Support as per those instructions to get expert assistance from malware-removal experts):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a> and SuperAntiSpyware:<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a>
 and then run a full ESET online scan: <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner</a>. These may or may not remove the infections, but will probably not repair any damage caused by them. Even if they or your current AV software seem to work or indicate you aren't infected, you shouldn't completely trust
 them and need to continue with the recommendations that follow (so it's up to you if you want to try them first or just skip over all of this and get the expert help you really need as described below).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Properly and completely removing such infections can be complex and often require manual removal procedures (which may or may not be entirely effective either). Even if they work, I'd suggest the following anyway, so we may as well start there (you can ignore
 the above removal methods if you want as this is really the way to go, but it won't hurt to try them).</p>

<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll check out some other options - we still aren't yet ready for "last resort" alternatives.&nbsp; Yes, eventually a clean install may be required - I admit that possibility - but I just do not believe it's where we
 should start (since even it isn't&nbsp;guaranateed to work if they've gotten access through your phone lines or your router or some other way).&nbsp; I'd be more comfortable doing that if we identified the method of access first (or either&nbsp;the clean install&nbsp;may not
 work or&nbsp;the problem may stop for a while and then just start over again - like mowing dandelions).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; Also consider the following general security procedures and implement any that aren't already in place:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow this excellent advice from Stephen Boots - MVP:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>-Make sure that the Windows Firewall is enabled. </span></strong><span>No other firewall truly offers better protection or is needed. This one is perfectly fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that all important/critical updates, including service packs for the operating system and programs are installed from Microsoft Update (Windows Update).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure Internet Explorer is at version 8 or 9 and updated with all patches.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-In Internet Explorer 8 or 9, use the SmartScreen Filter.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that IE Internet Security settings are at least set to medium-high (default).</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Enable the pop-up blocker in IE.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-On Vista and Windows 7 make sure that User Account Control (UAC) ON and not running with elevated privileges.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Make sure that Windows Automatic Updates are set to at least notify, but the preferred setting is to download and install automatically. If you update manually, be sure to update as soon as possible after being notified of available updates.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-<u>Make sure that installed applications, especially Adobe Acrobat, Adobe Flash, and Java are at their latest versions. Many vendors are regularly updating and patching for security holes.</u></span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Never click through links from unknown sources and use caution even if they are from a "trusted" source.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Never open unsolicited email attachments.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>-Practice safe web browsing.</span></b></p>

Show me where I actually here, in this thread, recommended MSE?&nbsp; I did recommend some supplemental products to check for and possibly remove malware.&nbsp; With malware suspected, it would be inappropriate and ill-advised to install MSE (or any product like it)
 on an infected computer - so at this point I would suggest whatever real-time primary AV product being used be left there for the time being until the system is cleaned.&nbsp; And I support that with the following:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_scanning/can-i-install-mse-to-clean-up-my-already-infected/87058857-d181-4019-a723-efd9a49d9275">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_scanning/can-i-install-mse-to-clean-up-my-already-infected/87058857-d181-4019-a723-efd9a49d9275</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only reason MSE came up in my post is that the process for getting Microsoft Support malware-removal assistance differs whether or not MSE is installed&nbsp;(since knowing it's there possibly allows them to&nbsp;take a different path or try tools in a different
 sequence or even use or not use certain tools)&nbsp;- and thus not knowing what is currently being used, I needed to provide instructions which would provide a method in every situation.&nbsp; This is not the time or place to discuss which program is the best to use
 once all this is over and the problem is resolved.&nbsp; There are other threads that cover that already or you may start your own if you wish - but it is not an issue in how to resolve this problem at this point in this thread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem here is to resolve the problem in the least intrusive way possible.&nbsp; Wouldn't the discovery and removal of some infections, having the system blessed as clean by the specialists, and finding that all the issues are resolved be easier than backing
 up data which may or may not be infected, doing a clean install with a full format, re-installing the hundreds of updates and service pack(s), re-installing all the software (if it can be found and if the original isn't so old that it isn't compatible which
 means buying it again or doing without it or finding a replacement), reconfiguring all the system and program settings including setting up the networks, installing updated drivers, setting up email accounts, downloading who knows how many add-ons that weren't
 saved or if saved have since been upgraded so many times that upgrading from what was saved isn't possible and using new ones is needed (hopefully free but possibly at a cost), restoring the backup (and hoping it works and nothing was lost), installing appropriate
 AV/AM/AS software (at which point we can THEN provide opinions on which is the best choice or refer to other threads where it has already been discussed many times) and setting it all up, and countless other chores that go with a clean install?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am recommending we not propose a clean install until all other options have been exhausted and we are backed into a corner with no other rational or viable alternatives.&nbsp; If the above doesn't work, then at least we'll have ruled out malware and infections
 and improved some of the security practices - which makes backing up far safer and we may be able to include more than usually done (if it comes to that).&nbsp;&nbsp; There are other options to then consider before jumping all the way to a clean install based on very
 little verifiable information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take care.</p>

<p>You might note that&nbsp;you are posting&nbsp;in the forum provided by Microsoft for&nbsp;users of Microsoft Security Esssentials.&nbsp; We do not recommend pay to remove malware products on this forum nor do we recommend paid antivirus products.
</p>
<p>It's been my experience that several "free" products such as MSE do as good if not a better job of protecting computers than many of the pay products.</p>
<p>If you wish to praise other antimalware products you really need to go to their forums instead of encouraging their use on the MSE&nbsp;forum.&nbsp; We do not go to forums for Gdata, BitDefender or Norton and criticize their products or encourage&nbsp;their readers&nbsp;to&nbsp;use
 MSE and you should have the courtesy and professionalism to act accordingly regarding MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards...</p>

            <p>Hi Angel,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Answers.&nbsp; I see you joined only a short time ago - in fact 11 minutes prior to this post where on your first login to the forums you found a thread addressing the exact problem about which you needed assistance (especially given all the unique
 symptoms described by the OP and so soon after posting this issue).&nbsp; On top of that, you did this without use of the Search function since this thread does not have an answer marked yet, so it would not have come up in a forum search.&nbsp; Most people would have
 at least attempted a search first and spent time looking at answers to related questions - but you chose/knew to bypass that (or you never could have posted here so soon after joining as searching would have taken time).&nbsp; Many would then wonder which was the
 appropriate forum, but you must have immediately&nbsp;chosen MSE first - there wasn't time for another choice, looking around there, and then coming to MSE in time to post so quickly after joining&nbsp;(thus ignoring the Security section in your operating system or
 Networking section in your operating system - as the issue was identified in the title as hacking and not malware so I assume your issue too is a concern about being hacked and not about malware yet you came here instead of there when both are possibly more
 appropriate for hacking concerns vs. malware issues).&nbsp; This may be a new world's record for speed or luck, especially&nbsp;given the extremely uncommon&nbsp;method used to somehow locate what you needed by intuition or some form of extrasensory gift when almost everyone
 would start with a search.&nbsp; Being new, I'd like to make sure you know about the Forum's
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/Page/faq#faqCodeConduct1">
Code of Conduct</a>&nbsp;- and especially point out the existence of this violation: "Attempting to manipulate the forums, including ranking and reputation systems, by violating any of the provisions of this Code of Conduct, colluding with others on voting, or
<strong>using multiple profiles"</strong>.&nbsp; But I'm sure that isn't relevant here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then when deciding which suggestions to try first, you chose those from someone who&nbsp;also just joined today&nbsp;(after finding and reading all the posts in this thread and checking the profiles to see the qualifications of everyone who offered advice).&nbsp; You elected
 to go with an extremely radical suggestion rather than try to diagnose the problem and perhaps fix it without needing to start from scratch.&nbsp; If I may use an analogy, this would be like taking your car to a mechanic because&nbsp;it won't won't start and deciding
 to replace the engine before even checking to see if the problem is a loose connector on one of the spark plugs.&nbsp; Still, it is your computer and your decision to make.&nbsp; I can only offer recommendations based on my experience (which is in my signature and bio)
 as others do and it's up to you to decide which to take.&nbsp; Then again, given the highly unique symptons described by the OP, I find it difficult to believe yours were exactly the same (especially given you provided no information about your problem whatsoever)
 and so perhaps some other factors were in play that made that a better choice (more information than we had available) though I can't remember the last time my first choice was what I consider to be the "last resort" (and yet, I have encountered many situations
 where a clean boot became the best or only choice - but not until I'd tried everything else I could think of that might resolve it some other way).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I urge&nbsp;you to review&nbsp;my suggestion (if&nbsp;it's not already too late) and reconsider your decision; however, it is your computer and you need to live with the choices you make and choose based on what you feel is best and then follow through on the decision
 you made.&nbsp; If you choose to start with mine, you can switch to his at any point&nbsp;without consequences (and if we can resolve it without a clean install that will probably be better for you,&nbsp;but I won't say it may not take more effort than what has already been
 stated if that doesn't work or that a clean install&nbsp;won't be at the end of that road as well - I only say that it may identify less radical options that do the trick first).&nbsp; If your situation is indeed like the one described above, we aren't even certain
 if a clean install will resolve things because we don't yet really know the source of the problem - but&nbsp;my method&nbsp;will rule them out trying to identify the cause before taking action rather than the one you selected which is taking action before even knowing
 the cause.&nbsp; And remember, if you choose to start with his, there's no turning back once you start down that road (while with mine you can choose to switch to his at any time and the only loss will be the time spent trying less extreme solutions).&nbsp; And you
 decided on this course before even learning what the OP did or if it worked (as most people tend to search for related threads which bring up answered questions so some confirmation exists).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps and that your decision turns out to be wise or at least one that solves the problem.&nbsp; If I can help in any way along whichever path you choose, don't hesitate to post.&nbsp; It's better to get it right the first time than to hear about it after
 you tried what you thought was correct and the situation got worse instead of better.&nbsp; It's much easier to explain the process in greater detail than to fix whatever was done (which may be MUCH harder and perhaps not possible depending on the situation).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck and best wishes!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I was so glad to find this post. I have been hijacked and only by reading this post and then calling my ISP did I realize, and they realize that although they have roaming IP mine never changed... it was locked on maybe even as long as a year ago. As time
 goes on I get smarter and start checking things on my computer and next thing you know I am locked out of everything. Now I am not that smart as it has taken me many months to figure this out. Thinking it was malware or something like that but I have been
 jacked and everyone who experiences something like this should check with their ISP or change ISP. Personally, I know so many others are going thru this and I cannot help but think it is DHS related, but maybe not. MY FIRST BIG INDICATION WAS WHEN I SUDDENLY
 GREW LIKE 40 USER ACCOUNTS AND THEY WERE IN EVERYTHING. PRIMARILY IT IS AN UNKNOWN USER S-1-5-21 OR S-1-5-18 OR 19. IN ANY CASE THE THING IS PURE EVIL. At this point I am not sure how this will turn out but thought I would let others know

<li>First is to please try <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clearing the console cache</a>. </li><li>Then please try deleting and reinstalling all your GoW2 content. &nbsp;There is no need to delete any save files.

Does that work any better?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Why not return the computer and purchase one pre-loaded with Windows 7 instead? Some newer computers pre-installed with Windows 10, especially some Intel Skylake models are not compatible with Windows 7.</p>

Depending on how large your Windows 10 installation is, it can use a lot of space, so you should invest in an external USB hard disk with a lot of space. In this article, we take a look restoring the system image on a larger hard disk.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Where can I get Windows 7:</strong></p>
<span>
<p>Because Windows 7 is in limited stock because Microsoft ended sales in October 2013, this has created demand because of its scarcity. This means retail boxed copies demand a premium, while OEM System Builder copies remain affordable.</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Full version (Retail):</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrade version (Retail):</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>OEM System Builder version:</p>
<span>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
</span><span><span>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>There is nothing wrong with using it too, especially since all future releases of Windows will be full versions anyway.
</p>
</span></span>
<p>
</p><p>You can find OEM System Builder software from dozens of online merchants. The current price for OEM Windows 7 Professional at

<p>There are no technical limitations to prevent you from using OEM software on your own PC, although this software will work only for a clean installation and not for an upgrade. In the past, Microsoft has been remarkably inconsistent in its advice to customers
 about whether this practice is allowed.

<p>Please note, Microsoft's approach to updates is very different than earlier releases. They are partially mandatory because of Microsoft's past history with customers sometimes failing to install important updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See options for managing how and when Windows Updates are installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 1:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set your Internet connection as metered:</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manage-windows-10-data-usage/</span></a></span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 2:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use Active Hours and Restart options:</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windows-update-behavior-using-active-hours-and-restart-options/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/managing-windows-update-behavior-using-active-hours-and-restart-options/</span></a></span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 3: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?</p>
<p>Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can download it at the following link:</p>
<p><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 4:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can create a stop and start script for Windows Update. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a Notepad file with each of the following and save them with the .bat extension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>stop-updates.bat:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sc config wuauserv start= disabled</p>
<p>net stop wuauserv</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sc config bits start= disabled</p>
<p>net stop bits</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sc config dosvc start= disabled</p>
<p>net stop dosvc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>pause</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>start-updates.bat:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sc config wuauserv start= auto</p>
<p>net start wuauserv</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sc config bits start= auto</p>
<p>net start bits</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>sc config dosvc start= auto</p>
<p>net start dosvc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>pause</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you can simply right click on stop-updates.bat and select ‚ÄúRun as Administrator‚Äù
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 5.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press Windows key + R</p>
<p>Type: services.msc</p>
<p>Hit Enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows Update</p>
<p>Select it then right click it</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p>Under the General tab, choose Startup type to DIsabled</p>
<p>Click Stop</p>
<p>Click Apply then OK</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 6:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive.
 Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the ‚ÄúENTER‚Äù key after you type each command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net stop wuauserv</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net stop cryptSvc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net stop bits</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>net stop msiserver </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Option 7:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro which can pause updates for up to 35 days or block them for a year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation</p>
<p>Click the link ‚ÄòGo to the store to upgrade or enter a product key‚Äô</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the $99 button to make your purchase (the price might vary by region or depending on the edition you are upgrading from or upgrading to).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the on screen instructions to make your purchase.</p>
<p>Within 5 to 10 minutes, your system will be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro, your personal files, apps and settings preserved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You won‚Äôt get a product key, you get a digital license, which is attached to your Microsoft Account used to make the purchase.

    <title>Xbox Live is a Scam - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live is a Scam</h2>
                    
<p>Thats right I said it. Ive finally took my blinders off to this. Im fed up with it. Xbox Live is nothing but an EXTORTION SCAM.</p>
<p>First of all what in the heck are we paying for? Just having a live membership is expensive enough for some people. But what does that give?&nbsp;what benefits? NONE, other then the fact you can play online. But why? I know im not paying for bandwidth, thats
 what ISPs are for. and PSN doesnt seem to have any issues with people playing online without a monthly fee, and if you do choose to get a PLUS membership you get free games, beta access to new titles, and tons of benefits, plus their releasing new games for
 free to PLUS members pretty often. And all my save info and what not is saved on my own hardrive not stored on a server somewhere, other then acheivements and such, but thats probably encoded to a textfile that doesnt take more then 20 Mb max. Then they have
 the nerve to charge you 10 dollars just to change your gamertag... Really?!?! 10 dollars to change a text file linked to an account??&nbsp;EXTORTION!!!</p>
<p>Then you have DLC of course. Talk about a rip off. Paying 10-20 bucks to fix a game that got released unfinished oh and here have a couple of new maps, or a nerf here and a revamp there. When if you got the PC version of most those kinds of games, you get
 Fixes, updates&nbsp;and patches way faster, way more often, and guess what ?? Their absolutly free! I think XBOX has made a habit of releasing unfinished console titles just so they can get another 10 bucks on top of the 60 you just spent to play a game.</p>
<p>I tried that Zune app, 14 day free trial right? Nope instantly charged me 9.95. then after the 14 day trial, it automatically changed the auto renewal to yes, charged me again. so I took my payment info off so it couldnt do that again and steal my money
 right out from under my nose, then it wouldnt even let me use zune for the month worth of money it stole from me. EXTORTION!</p>
<p>None of the 'Free Apps' even work. Youtube signs me out of live everytime i try to use it. Still havent ever seen what the app looks like cuz i cant open it with out getting disconnected..

And it seems everytime they do a Dashboard update, they make the layout even more horrific, unorganize, non user friendly, and just over complicated for something that could be way more efficient with simplicity, if i could id perfer useing the original dashboard.<br />
<br />
and then you got avatars... oh lord. they are awsome dont get me wrong. But they hardly give you any options to choose from as far as custimization goes. and if you want more you gotta buy it... really XBOX? dont you scam people enough. You want&nbsp;people to pay
 money for virtual clothing just to get their individuality&nbsp;of their presence on live.&nbsp;isnt microsoft makin enough money as is. I mean bill gates is pouring millions into researching genetical altering innoculations already and microsoft is the closest thing
 to a monopoly already, it literally owes its existence to Apple.</p>
<p>So what exactly are we paying for. Answer me that, in detail. "for the bandwith you use and server space" is not a legit answer. If PC games and PSN can run their own servers provided for all the world to access without haveing to pay a dime, you should
 be able to as well XBOX Live, Especially with all the other extras charges, and fees you scam people with your apps that arent even worth my spit on the ground, and your silly gamertag fee, and virtual clothing, and patches and updates. Even Themes Cost money....</p>
<p>So once again.... WHAT ARE WE PAYING FOR???</p>

<p>your just smug cause you obviously dont know what its like to struggle.. if they want a membership fee, fine atleast provide some services and benefits with it. If you wanna charge for services and benefits and extras, fine but dont charge for a membership
 that gives you nothing in return. &nbsp;They should do one or the other, not both. I understand they make a crap ton of money off of all of us fools that pay for it and theyd never dream of changing it with their greedy hands. but its pretty ridiculous, and an
 obvious rip off. the ONLY thing they have to show for it, is customer support. which isnt that much better then most. especially when 50% of the time ive called them i have to get redirected to a supervisor and wait forever cause half of them dont know what
 there doing...</p>
<p>Of course if your pretty well off, or a spoiled child, your not going to think twice about this cause you have no problem throwing money away.</p>

<p>plus it took them forever to make a console that doesnt break after a month or 2 of use. im on my 4th xbox, probably 8th if you include all the times ive had to ship it in to get fixed, 2 of those times, it took well over a month to get it back, and all
 they were doing is resetting the motor on the disc drive, i started doing it myself until finally it quit recognizing discs were in the drive all together. I love xbox, But man do I hate the service &nbsp;and the money hungry scam you have to deal with.</p>

<p>Dude... Seriously... They consider your posts whining and irrelavent. Didn't you read Major Nelson's article?</p>
<p>.....</p>
<p>Listen this is what you do, go to FTC.gov and file a complaint.</p>
<p>////</p>
<p>Many do not realize or know that Microsoft pays media partners not to show articles about them being exploited or when they become under penalty of FCC or FTC. They pay many partners like AP &amp; Rueters &amp; NBC to ensure that a notion about Microsoft harvesting
 user data never meets the public eye.</p>
<p>\\\\</p>
<p>Many also do not know that Microsoft's Xbox LIVE harvests data. Small information about you that they sale to advertisers and other companies making constant REVENUE on you.<br />
Need someone OFFCIAL TO TELL YA...&nbsp; watch this video.<br />
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5OsQsB7Hg4&amp;feature=youtu.be<br />
<br />
Small information about you is sold to companies by MICROSOFT... AND YOU PAY TO GET SURVEYED, JUST BY USING XBOX LIVE.<br />
Isn't that insane... They need to rename the Xbox console too ... SurveyBox360 . YOU pay for the internet, you pay to be surveyed, and even if you do not pay you are still being surveyed. You also share a fraction of your bandwidth with the XBOX live cloud
 and YOU ARE NOT EVEN AWARE OF THAT. Even if you are a free member you share a fraction of your bandwidth, either way.</p>
<p>/////</p>
<p>You can file a complaint against Microsoft &amp; Xbox @ http://www.ftc.gov&nbsp; ... That organization forces companies to be fair. IF you are a US citizen.

<p>As far as Im concerned all Apps like Youtube, Netflix, etc should be available for Silver accounts to use, but MS should still charge a sub for online gaming. &nbsp;Even if online gaming was free I would not even bother with it. &nbsp;These days I dont even go online
 due to my console being moved to another room in my home.</p>

<p>////</p>
<p>LOOK at that video.</p>
<p>That is called data harvesting. It can make company millions, CONSTANTLY. There is no reason at all for Users to be charged, when the person is getting surveyed when using the device.</p>
<p>|||||</p>
<p>HAVING A Xbox is placing a survey device inside a person's home. Would you want someone borrowing your internet connection OR taking notes on what you do. Would you mind using a webcam, THAT I COULD SURVEY FROM.</p>
<p>Did you answer NO to any or all of those... IF SO, yOU shouldn't be paying for Xbox LIVE.</p>

<p>[/quote]This is a good point, and also M$ pays for a lot of other things with this money that you don't get on PSN. And at the end of the day it isn't a scam and it isn't over priced, so if you are too dumb to realise that then don't subscribe. But don't
 go complaining about it because nothing will ever change it.</p>

<p><span>Hi Mikee1313,</span></p>
<p><span>To run Eve Online game in windowed mode you need to check the game settings for any options related to run the game in windowed mode. These settings
 are game specific and can be only changed if the game has the option to run in windowed mode.</span></p>
<p><span>You can post your query in Eve Online forums for better support.</span></p>

<p>Typically not.</p>
<p>Most games capture the mouse when in fullscreen, a mouse click outside will minimise them.&nbsp;&nbsp;There's a few&nbsp;games now which&nbsp;support windowed modes with no border so they can look fullscreen but actually aren't to get around this problem.</p>

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set<br />
VIEW to&nbsp;Hide Microsoft drivers - update those&nbsp;with&nbsp;Dump in their names.&nbsp;(Also <br />
update the BIOS&nbsp;and chipset drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are <br />
the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab -
<br />
write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything <br />
as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT <br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback)<br />
and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get <br />
their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System <br />
Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot -
<br />
check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR <br />
SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using <br />
the methods above is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker <br />
and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations<br />
in Windows Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install <br />
drivers which will usually be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new <br />
driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones manually if
<br />
you wish.<br />

<h2>            Screen saver wont work Windows 7</h2>
                    A minor annoyance, but still... Screen saver on clean installs of Windows 7 Beta and 7 RC fail to activate. None of the Windows screen savers will work.

            Hi vsolrac,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting your responses.<br />
<br />
Has the ScreenSaver ever worked?&nbsp; Have you tried a system restore to a point in time that it did work?<br />
<br />
Will the Screen Saver work in a clean boot?<br />
<br />
I would suggest trying a Cleanboot to see if the problem happens. If it doesn't happen when you are in a cleanboot then you can use the steps in the article to narrow down the cause of the problem,
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a>.&nbsp; The article referenced is for Vista, however, the steps are also applicable for Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Step 1: Perform a clean boot
<strong>Note</strong> If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer
 unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.
<ol>
<li>Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights. </li><li>Click <strong>Start
<div>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fkbgraphics%2fPublic%2fEN-US%2fVistaStartButton.jpg" /></div>
, type <span>msconfig.exe</span> in the <strong>
Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />
<br />
<div>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fkbgraphics%2fPublic%2fEN-US%2fSecurityShield.jpg" /></div>
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong>Continue. </strong></strong></strong></li><li>On the <strong>General tab, click <strong>Selective Startup, and then click to clear the
<strong>Load startup items check box. (The <strong>
Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.) </strong></strong></strong></strong></li><li>On the <strong>Services tab, click to select the <strong>
Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click <strong>Disable all.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points.
 Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.
</strong></strong></strong></li><li>Click <strong>OK, and then click <strong>Restart.<br />
</strong></strong></li></ol>
<p>Note:&nbsp; Remember to put your system back in the normal mode state prior to returning to normal activity on your system.&nbsp; To do this, follow the instructions in the article link above to return to a normal setting.</p>
<p>Also, in ScreenSaver settings what is the minutes set to before activation?&nbsp; Have you tried setting it to one minute then seeing if it activates.&nbsp; If the screen saver time is set too long it may be that different components are set to hibernate prior to
 the time the screen saver activates and doesn't allow the screen saver time to engage.<br />
<br />
Also, try the following to verify the integrity of your system files;<br />
<br />
If you are logged on as administrator - click the StartORB / in the search line type "SFC /SCANNOW" without the quotes and hit enter.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Let the system file checker verify the integrity of the system files.&nbsp; Let us know if it finds errors.&nbsp; If it finds errors that it cannot correct, put your system installation DVD in the DVD drive and run the process again.&nbsp; If it still cannot correct errors,
 try to input what errors you receive into the posting.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

<p>I found this DOS-code work-around on the "Unofficial MagicJack Forum."&nbsp; It definitely works better than anything else I've seen, as it actually overrides the commands MagicJack uses to disable the screensaver and power management.&nbsp; It gives you back complete
 and normal functionality of these two things.&nbsp; Also, the patch will stick, even after a reboot.&nbsp; Just be sure to use the first set of commands shown to find the correct path for your machine.&nbsp;The differences are shown by&nbsp;the question marks (<strong>?</strong>).&nbsp;Then
 execute the second set of commands using that path.</p>
<p>This was posted by "Satoru," who got the information originally from dslreports.com:</p>

<br />
The following command shows MJ has a request to prevent display and system power savings. If you get an error, you need to run the command prompt as an Administrator:<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span><strong><span>Code:</span></strong></span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C:\&gt;powercfg /requests&nbsp; <br />
DISPLAY:&nbsp; <br />
[PROCESS] \Device\HarddiskVolume<strong>?</strong>\Users\<strong>????</strong>\AppData\Roaming\mjusbsp\magicJack.exe&nbsp;<br />
<br />
SYSTEM:&nbsp; <br />
[PROCESS] \Device\HarddiskVolume<strong>?</strong>\Users\<strong>????</strong>\AppData\Roaming\mjusbsp\magicJack.exe&nbsp;<br />
<br />
AWAYMODE:&nbsp; <br />
None.&nbsp; <br />
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<span>
<p><br />
<br />
<span>The following commands will override (disable) the power request:<br />
<br />
</span></p>
</span>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span><strong><span>Code:</span></strong></span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><br />
powercfg /requestsoverride PROCESS magicJack.exe DISPLAY <br />
powercfg /requestsoverride PROCESS \Device\HarddiskVolume<strong>?</strong>\Users\<strong>????</strong>\AppData\Roaming\mjusbsp\magicJack.exe DISPLAY</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<span>
<p><br />
<br />
<span>Notice one command has the full path as it appeared in the requests output. Be sure to use the path from your requests output. You need both or the power savings won't work.<br />
<br />
This patch will survive reboots. You can check by running the command before and after a reboot<br />
<br />
</span></p>

            Hi Billy,
<br />
<br />My name is Roger W, an independent advisor trying to help. Let's try with the following suggestions, please:
<br />
<br />To disable driver signature enforcement do the following:
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Shift key on your keyboard and click the Restart button.
<br />driver-signature-enforcement-restart
<br />Choose Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Startup Settings and click the Restart button.
<br />When your computer restarts you‚Äôll see a list of options. Press F7 on your keyboard to select Disable driver signature enforcement.
<br />Your computer will now restart and you‚Äôll be able to install unsigned drivers.
<br />Bear in mind that this method only temporarily disables driver signature enforcement, so be sure to install all the unsigned drivers as soon as you can.
<br />
<br />Let us know if the solution above works for you.

&nbsp; &nbsp;Signing out then signing in to the current user enables the mouse to click on everything perfectly. Plugging out and plugging in the mouse or restarting the pc replicates the issue.</p>

<p>3. Copy the following command and press enter after each line:<br />
<strong><em><br />

    <title>Burning a CD at highest bit rate&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Burning a CD at highest bit rate&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>havent burned a CD in a while first of all.... I've tried burning on a few programs, but lets stick with Windows Media Player which I always found was one of the easiest applications to use. This is my problem...I set up everything to start burning as a
 CDA. (Audio disk) But in past I could always choose the bit rate I wanted. Usually 120 or 160, although you could go lower I think. Anyway I always used a160 Bit Rate. Now it seems when burning as a CD, (CD Audio), I dont have a choice of bit rates wanted!
 Am I missing something? Is the highest bit rate 160, the default bit rate and you cannot change? Please help me.... Am I missing something? (Also, it doesnt matter on here but same situation burning with Itunes or a couple of free burners I tried.</p>
<p>Thank You,</p>
<p>Roger... INXS7144</p>

    <title>Does Windows 10 automatically recognise that a SSD has replaced a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grangeland  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does Windows 10 automatically recognise that a SSD has replaced a HDD&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have recently replaced the HDD in my Windows 10 laptop with a SSD. As I understand it, Windows periodically runs a defragmentation in the background on a HDD. However, SSD drives do not require defragmenting and running such a tool can shorten the life
 of a SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SSD was a clone of the HDD and not a new installation. Will Windows 10 recognize that the laptop now has a SSD and stop its background defragmentation or do I need to take specific steps to prevent this activity occurring on the SSD? If I need to take
 action please advise on the steps I should take.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any advice anyone can offer.</p>

            <p>If the result of the command:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>fsutil behavior query DisableDeleteNotify</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>=0 it indicates that Trim is enabled therefore the O/S has recognised the disk type as SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although generally accepted that SSD do not require Defragmentation there are housekeeping tasks to be performed. If you follow the old route to defragmenter the dialogue opened now is described as Optimiser. This new version handles SSD correctly and should
 be on. The renamed Defragmentation dialogue box shows Solid State Disk in the second column</p>
<p>
</p><p>SSD rarely come with toolbox software but can normally be downloaded from the Manufacturer site.</p>
