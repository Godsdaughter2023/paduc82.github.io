    <title>File order on a FAT32 USB stick - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aardvark_65  say:</h3>
<h2>            File order on a FAT32 USB stick</h2>
                    I have Win XP Pro SP3.<br />
<br />
My car can play music files from a FAT32 USB stick, and according to the car’s manual it plays the files in the order that they are found on the USB stick; and elsewhere I have read that the order of the files on FAT devices is in the order that they are written
 to the device (unlike NTFS), which is what I want – I copied the files to the USB, one by one (well, actually I created a BAT file to do it), in the order that I wanted the files to play.<br />
<br />
However the car plays the files in a different order, and when I do a DIR listing on the USB device (i.e. from the Windows command prompt, with no sorting options specified), it shows the files in the same order as the car plays them, which is not the order
 that I copied them to the USB.<br />
<br />
I have found that just renaming the files also changes the order that they are displayed with DIR (still with no sorting options specified).<br />
<br />
The USB was initially blank, and I created a new directory just before copying the files, so it’s not that it’s putting the new files into “holes” in the directory caused by previous file deletions. It happens on more than 1 USB stick. It is consistent, i.e.
 it always seems to write the files out of order, and it seems to be in the same order, although I haven’t checked that thoroughly (there are about 250 files).<br />
<br />
The USB is optimised for quick removal, so write caching is disabled on it.<br />
<br />
I have found programs that will sort the file order on a FAT drive. However that’s not what I want, since I want the files in a specific (not alphabetical) order. I am finding it very hard to frame a Google search on this problem – I either get millions of
 hits that have nothing to do with what I am searching for, or no hits at all if I try to be very specific in the search.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any ideas on this? Is there a way to force a FAT disk/USB to order the files in the order I copy them?<br />

            <p>Maybe&nbsp;your in-car player's manual is badly worded?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The in-car player is apparently playing in an order that is pre-detemined for any USB stick and (presumably) cannot be altered. This order is probably alphabetical, but you must experiment to prove or disprove what the play order really is because that is,
 I fear, what you are stuck with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us assume that it is alphabetical:-</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have less than 27 tracks you could rename the files on the USB stick by putting a single alphabetic character at the start of the file name to get them to play in the right order.</li><li>Or you could prefix the track file names with a sequential number which you would have to zero fill, for example, for more than 9 but less than 100 tracks you could prefix with 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11 etc.</li></ul>
<p>Communication with&nbsp;the support department for the manufacturer of your in-car player might be in order to either verify or disprove my suspicions.</p>

            The car player definitely plays the songs in the order that it finds them on the (FAT32) USB stick, which is the same order that they are listed in the USB's directory, and is not alphabetical for FAT - and in other forums people have said that it is the
 same with their cars. Those people want their songs to be played in alphabetical order, but I don't.<br />
<br />
I have considered prefixing the file names with 001, 002 etc, but I don't want to do that if it can be avoided, since the car player uses the file name for the song title in the display - why it doesn't use the song title from the ID3 tag I don't know, because
 it gets the artist name from the ID3 tag (??). But if it can't be done any other way, I'll probably have to do that - I have found a program that will sort the file names in the directory of a FAT formatted disk into alphabetical order.<br />
<br />
What I am really asking is, why don't FAT formatted USB sticks write file names in their directories in the same order that the files are copied to the sticks (which is what FAT formatted disks supposedly do), and is there a way to "fix" it - I just included
 the stuff about my car's player as background to why I wanted to do it.<br />

            <p>OK. I am going to start out by saying that playing audio is not a big thing for me so in that area my expertise is limited. I am predoiminantly&nbsp;a Windows/Microsoft man.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither am I an expert in in-car players and their foibles. However, you keep referring to "the car" as if you think it matters whether it is a Ford or Datsun. What matters is the brand and model of the player. also, two identical Ford models are not forced
 to have exactly the same player. Apologies if this is already understood, but your text is too vague for me to get a handle on just how deep an understanding you have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From a Windows perspective, I have copied 3 files individually to a memory stick formatted with FAT32 in reverse alpabetical order. Windows 7 continues to list them (by default) in alphabetical order when using Windows Explorer to view the source or the
 destination. However, a dir listing from a command prompt lists them in reverse alphabetical order, i.e. the order that they were copied. I repeated the test using Windows XP with the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe this is to do with the way you are copying the files? As I said, I did three files as three separate copies. If you are copying bunches&nbsp;of files in one operation from an explorer window, they may not get copied in the order that you are seeing on the
 screen.</p>

            O.K., I guess I keep referring to "the car" because the player is the standard player that comes with the car, and as far as I'm aware there is no option to be able to specify a different player when ordering the car (2014 Toyota Corolla). I'm no expert
 on car players either, but it has a touch screen as part of the player which is built into the car, and I imagine it would be very difficult to replace it with something else. But disregarding all that, as I mentioned before, I have noticed on other forums
 that it seems to be common that car players use FAT formatted USB sticks, and that they play songs in the order that the files appear in the directory.<br />
<br />
Yes, I think when only a small number of files are copied to a FAT disk, they are written in the order they are copied. However I am copying 250 files to the first directory, and eventually I plan to have about 4 directories, each containing perhaps 150-250
 songs. I find that a few files seem to be written in the order that I copy them, but then suddenly the order changes, and the files are not written in order. After each test, I delete all the files from the directory and then delete the directory itself, so
 that the USB is empty again before the next test. Sorry, I should have mentioned all that earlier.<br />
<br />
I am using a BAT file to copy the files, along the lines of<br />
<br />
xxcopy song15.mp3 "f:\music dir 1"<br />
xxcopy song3.mp3 "f:\music dir 1"<br />
xxcopy song22.mp3 "f:\music dir 1"<br />
.<br />
.<br />
etc, where f: is the FAT formatted USB drive (xxcopy is a replacement for the xcopy command)<br />
<br />
i.e. the BAT file consists of about 250 xxcopy commands, plus a few extra commands at the start. Hence I am effectively copying the files individually, in the order that I want them to be written to the USB stick.<br />
<br />
I have also found that even just renaming the files can change the order, e.g. if the order is<br />
<br />
song15<br />
song3<br />
song22<br />
<br />
and the songs are renamed, you could end up with, e.g.<br />
<br />
newnamesong22<br />
newnamesong15<br />
newnamesong3<br />

            <p><span>Let us assume that a command prompt dir defines the order that your in-car player will use.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First, I can confirm that renaming a file does appear to change the order of files. This means you will have to do any renaming before you execute the batch file. Watch out for dodgy characters in file names&nbsp;that might mess things up, either in the
 copy phase or when the in-car player comes to play the tracks (e.g. decimal points, single/double quotes, * and ?). You might want to put
<strong>pause</strong> commands at strategic points in the batch file so that you can monitor for error messages.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>format the stick</span></li><li><span>create your folder on the stick (in your example above <strong>music dir 1</strong>)</span></li><li><span>execute the batch file</span></li><li><span>click Start, click Run type <strong>cmd</strong> and hit enter</span></li><li><span>in the resultant black command prompt window type the stick's drive letter followed by : and hit enter, e.g.
<strong>E:</strong></span></li><li><span><span>type&nbsp;<strong>cd&nbsp;music dir 1</strong>&nbsp;and hit enter where (using your example)</span></span></li><li><span>type <strong>dir /p</strong> and hit enter</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Does the dir listing agree with the batch file order?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If not, I can only tell you that I performed the above procedure for one album (18 tracks) and the dir order was exactly the same as the batch file order. My batch file used COPY rather than XXCOPY. I then repeated using XXCOPY with the same results.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the dir order is not the order that your in-car player uses then you need to find out exactly what order your in car player does use. You can either experiment or contact the manufacturer.</span></p>

 than reformatting it between tests, but I have reformatted it once or twice, and still the order is wrong. The car player always plays the songs in the directory listing order.<br />
<br />
The listing of the batch file in my previous post is simplified a bit - it does check the result of each xxcopy step. The file is actually like this (but only including a few of the actual xxcopy lines):</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">@echo off<br />
f:<br />
md "\Mid 60s"<br />
cd "\Mid 60s"<br />
call r:\xxcopy.bat "E:\data\music\Roy Orbison\Monumental hits\14-Pretty woman.mp3"<br />
call r:\xxcopy.bat "E:\data\music\CDs\Troggs-Wild thing.mp3"<br />
call r:\xxcopy.bat "E:\data\music\Singles\Rockin' Berries-Midnight Mary.mp3"<br />
call r:\xxcopy.bat "E:\data\music\Beatles\Please Please Me\01-I saw her standing there.mp3"<br />
call r:\xxcopy.bat "E:\data\music\Singles\Johnny Young and Kompany-Caralyn.mp3"</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">and xxcopy.bat is</p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">@echo off<br />
<br />
r:\xxcopy.exe "%~1" "%~2" /TCA /TCC /TCW&nbsp; /KS /NX %3 %4 %5 %6 %7<br />
<br />
if not errorlevel 1 goto end<br />
echo.<br />
echo **********************************<br />
echo *** XXCOPY failed trying to copy<br />
echo *** "%~1" to "%~2"<br />
echo ***<br />
echo *** See messages above ***<br />
echo **********************************<br />
echo.<br />
pause<br />
<br />
:end</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">(I realise there are some inconsistencies in xxcopy.bat, i.e. %2 is blank because I'm not specifying the destination drive/directory but am instead using the current drive and directory - it was easier to create the batch file that
 way. I might tidy it up later).<br />
<br />
It looks like we're out of options. Thanks anyway for trying to help.<br />

            <p>I am not a huge batch file expert but I suspect that the use of call might be your problem. Extract from</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/call.mspx?mfr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/call.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p>"Calls one batch program from another<em> without stopping the parent batch program</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, if I am interpreting the above correctly, you could have simultaneously executing batch files trying to copy files to the stick. On the occasions I have used batch files, I have never had the need to "call" so I cannot speak from experience
 but, it seems to me it would be a bit like two PCs writing to a shared memory stick at the same time, the order that tracks were received by the stick would not be predictable. Googling reinforces my suspicion about the use of call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try not using call, just start the next batch file at the end of the previous batch file without using call. This, I believe, would be analagous to the batch file that I constructed for a single album of 18 tracks.</p>

            The original version of my batch file, before I put in the errorlevel checking, didn't use call statements, and I remembered that it still got the files out of order. But just to be sure, I just set up another batch file without call statements and ran
 it, and it still got the files out of order.<br />
<br />
I have used call in batch files a few times over the years, and I don't recall having problems.<br />
<br />
I think the Microsoft article is just badly worded. Instead of "....without stopping the parent batch program", it should say "...without ending the parent batch program". And I just looked up an old MS-DOS 5.0 manual, which describes call as "runs a second
 batch program, and then returns to the first one", implying that the first batch program waits for the second batch program to finish before it continues - like a subroutine in a programming language.<br />
<br />
The inclusion of "without stopping the parent batch program" in the description is most likely due to the fact that the call statement didn't exist in early versions of MS-DOS, and when the call statement was introduced Microsoft probably wanted to emphasise
 the fact that the first batch program didn't immediately stop running if call was used.

            <p>I&nbsp;cannot explain why it does not work for you but does work&nbsp;for me. I do not know the ins and outs of the FAT32 system and how it handles and/or allocates entries in the table, which is why I formatted my my stick before running the batch file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did some of the files fail to copy making it appear that the dir was not reproducing the copy order?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than do experiments with batch files, why don't you prove one way or another whether your batch file processing is at the root of your problems by just doing a series of manual copies one track at a time? You could do it by right click/Send to from
 within Windows Explorer to save time (compared with issuing command prompt copies or xxcopies). Following each copy, check what is happening with a&nbsp;dir from a command prompt. I would recommend formatting the stick before doing each experiment.</p>

            All files are copied O.K.<br />
<br />
I looked more closely at the directory order vs the order that the files were copied by the batch file. Everything is fine for the first 10 files - they are order. Then things go a bit haywire. The 19th file copied ends up in 11th place in the FAT32 directory,
 the 81st file copied ends up in 12th place, 18th in 13th place, and so it goes on.<br />
<br />
I formatted the USB and tried a test where I paused the batch file for 3 seconds after the 10th copy, to see if that helped. However the end result was the same - the files ended up in the same (wrong) order as before.<br />
<br />
I wiped the USB and then copied just the first 10 files with a modified batch file, and then started copying them one by one at the command prompt (copy and paste the appropriate line from the batch file), doing a dir listing after each copy to check the order.
 All was well up to and including the 17th file. However the 18th file copied ended up in 11th place. Then the 19th file copied was in 11th place, with the 18th file copied now in 12th place. I copied one more file (20th), and it is in 14th place. I haven't
 gone any further with this process.<br />
<br />
Hence the batch file would appear not to be the cause of the problem. I should add that the batch file I am using for these tests doesn't call another batch file - it directly runs xxcopy.exe

</p><p>If yes, then I suspect that the problem lies with the drivers. Suggest you to check and download the latest Windows 10 mouse and keyboard drivers for your device from device Manufacturer website. You can search them using device model number. If you don't
 find the latest drivers or if problem still persist, then try to install legacy drivers (I.e. Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 drivers) to see if they make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You can also try updating the <strong>drivers </strong>

<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b) Spot and expand the “<strong>Keyboards</strong>”. Now see if any yellow exclamation show again the driver. If yes, double click on it to see the error message.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c). If nothing, then right click on the driver and select “<strong>Update Driver Software</strong>”. When it prompts to choose an option

<p><span><strong>Hi,</strong></span></p>
<p><span>1. Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
2. Were there any changes made prior to this issue?<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1: </strong><br />
<br />
This error is known to be caused by registry cleaning software. If you have downloaded and used registry cleaning software you can use the restore (back up) feature of the registry cleaning software to go back to the first time the registry was cleaned. Going
 back to the previous version of a registry will probably fix this issue, but software that was installed after the registry cleaning occurred might need to be reinstalled.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2:</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure that the Volume Shadow Copy service is started.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click<strong>Start</strong></span></span><span>and
 type Services into the Start Search field.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click<strong>Services</strong> from the list of programs. If a User Account Control message opens, click Continue.</span></p>
<p><span>c. A service window opens.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Scroll down the list of services and double-click the Volume Shadow Copy service.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Select<strong>Manual</strong> from the Startup Type field if it is not already selected.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Click the<strong>Start</strong> button under Service Status.<br />
<br />
g. Click on Apply.<br />
<br />
h. Click on OK.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Hope this helps.<br />

<h2>            Xbox One Controller Bricked after Update Error</h2>
                    Hi.&nbsp;I turned on my Xbox and when I turned on my control; the console notified me about an update of the control to which I proceeded to install, after a while it remained at 46% of the update; then I decided to reconnect my control to try again, the control
 only turns on but does absolutely nothing, the Xbox button light only blinks and I can not pair it or anything. My Controller is an original one, with headphones jack and without Bluetooth. Is therea way to fix it? Because i have seen a lot of people having
 this issue.

            I have already tried the troubleshoot. Nothing works sadly. Also my Controller is out of warranty and im not even from US. So i wanted to look for any fix available.

            Hi, not sure this will work for you but remove the batteries/battery pack, connect the controller to your Xbox using the USB charging cable. Press and hold the Xbox button and the menu button on the controller for 10 seconds. Then see if you controller
 recovers. If not then do the same process but just keep pressing and holding the Xbox button on the controller a few times.

<p>Hey there David!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to use your controller.</p>
<p>If it keeps happening, it might be a smart move to try this after resetting your console. I would try a soft reset so that you don't have to reinstall any game.
<span>
<span>It's a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Just
 make sure that before you go ahead with it, that you do know all of the sign-in information for any/all of your accounts</span></span><span><span>(as</span></span><span><span>they
 will be removed) </span></span><span><span>and
 have easy access to your internet network</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">

<h3> jordanrowe  say:</h3>
<h2>            DW1501 Wireless-N WLAN Half-Mini Card Windows 8 Support</h2>
                    Hello!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently upgrade my Dell Inspiron N5010 from Windows 7 to Windows 8. Everything works fine except there is a problem with my network card. Since upgrade I have noticed that my internet has slowed down quite a lot and I am unable to play online games
 like EVE Online because I seem to disconnect from the internet for a split second causing me to disconnect from my game.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am not the only N5010 user to noticed this and thus far there seems to be no fix or real solution to this. Apparently this is something to do with a driver installed by Windows 8 that should make network cards work but there is a bug for my type of network
 card (and some others I believe) however, I am not entirely sure what the cause is.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Because of this I have had to reinstall my Windows 7 which I find disappointing as I do mostly like Windows 8. I do hope there is a solution or fix for this as I don't want to have a copy of Windows 8 Pro that I cannot use.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for any help.</div>
                </div>

    <title>How is it possible that a device with a static ip steal an ip from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gomer556  say:</h3>
<h2>            How is it possible that a device with a static ip steal an ip from another device with a static address&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    We have device A which has a static IP 192.168.10.32 Device B has a static IP 192.168.10.111 two very different devices. Device B is reported to not work, a ping is sent out and we get a reply. go to the web interface and it comes up to Device A. Look
 at the network settings and sure enough it took on Device B's address, when we go to look at Device B (at B's location) and it still has it's 192.168.10.111 address thus causing an IP conflict. We change Device A out with another one and give it the IP 192.168.10.32
 it should have and everything is good for about a day. Device A takes on another static IP of Device C thus causing another conflict. These devices have not changed in the past year they have been in place. Any ideas????

</span></span></span><span>If you do an Ipconfig /release and Ipconfig/renew does the devices get the same IP address?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you checked the pool of IP addresses the DHCP server is assigning? The static IP address may fall into the DHCP range for the local network.

<p><span>Make sure the routers and switches have updated firmware.</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply, Device A is netCommander NPC-22 which controls a device that rings our break bells, lunch bells, end of shift bells etc.... Devices B and C are both Datamax I 4210 Label priinters. The address' of these devices are not in the pool
 of IPs assigned by DHCP.</p>
<p>No new configs on any of the switches or routers.</p>
<p>The problem occured about three weeks ago, I was at one of our other facilities across the country and now that I am back, they have tasked me with fixing the issue.</p>
<p>This is above my knowledge level</p>
<p>Thanks again!!</p>

<h2>            windows 10 chrome google search  voice &#34;no internet connection&#34;</h2>
                    <p>latest chrome windows 10 browser</p>
<p>Logitech pro 4000 microphone</p>
<p>
</p><p>with chrome browser google search, clicking requests microphone "allow" which selects the correct microphone. Clicking the microphone icon shows "speak now" but immediately replaces the message with "no internet connection" but the microphone does not respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some other may help (or not):</p>
<p>1. Skype works ok with the Logitech microphone either via the browser or as a windows10 app.</p>
<p>2. Added chrome browser app voicenote II - notification microphone pro 4000 selects "allow", as before. Clicking the app microphone (like "speak voice" before) immediately shows "no internet connection", very briefly, as before. The microphone does not respond
 further.</p>
<p>3, Logging in the first user account does not work with "search voice" does not work with the microphone BUT logging with a second user account works perfectly with "speak voice" and voicenote II using the pro 4000 microphone perfectly. There is NO "no internet
 connectivity".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that another mobile device may be causing (something to do with the "OK google" issue which was introduced way back ??) the PC's first user login. Maybe not. Very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similar problems have been reported by many frustrated users, but I'm struggling anywhere with help solutions.</p>

<p>Good afternoon Anne,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you not listen to the original poster? He stated that his microphone works in Skype and on his another account, so there is no way this is a hardware issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was having the same exact issue as him, when I try to search on Google by clicking the Microphone button next to the search bar, it replaces the "Speak Now" with a "No Internet Connection" error. I can confirm that my internet is running and I can also
 confirm that my microphone works in Discord/Skype/Steam Voice/Ventrillo. I have also plugged in my microphone into a spare computer I have on my network and the voice search WORKED! So for me, this is a computer bound problem and not an account bound issue,
 because, I have re-installed Chrome and made sure it was up to date without me being logged in and I was still UNABLE to voice search from my main computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My microphone is a Blue Yeti</p>
<p>My OS is Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance to anyone who has answers!</p>

<p>Hi there Doktor,<br />
<br />
I'm really sorry to hear you're having issues with your child account after the family plan conversion.<br />
<br />
This could be tricky with nothing but that placeholder e-mail. You may be able to use our
<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Account Recovery Tool</a> to help recover that account.<br />
<br />
<br />
If that doesn't show you any love, you'll want to get in touch with our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Phone Support</a> for further assistance in getting back access to that account.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please keep us posted on how everything goes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Accidentally Converted External Hard Drive to &#34;ESD-USB&#34;</h2>
                    Ever since I got my Yoga 3 I have been having numerous problems with Windows 10. Finally, I decided to do a clean install of Windows 10 which involved installing the OS from an external drive. I did not know when downloading the pertinent installer onto
 the external it would format it into a ESD USB (I have no idea what that means). I have come to terms that I lost everything on the external, but it says the drive is only 31GB when in reality the external was 1 TB. Is there anyway to revert the external back
 to normal? Please, do not tell me I ruined a perfectly good 1 TB external hard drive.

            That isn't my problem, I can hear sound coming through it when I play a game with 5.1 surround sound support or if I use the windows sound test utility. If i do anything else like play a song in a media player or watch a movie or watch a video online with
 my web browser I am forced to use the Speaker Fill option in my realtek manager but it reduces the sound quality. I want to know if there is another way of applying the 5.1 surround sound to everyday use without using the Speaker Fill option. It will normally
 only use 2.1 channel whenever I do not have it selected. But when I do it reduces my quality of sound. I want true 5.1 for whatever I do.

            <p>hello Vijay B,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have got a same sort problem.<br />
i have tried the same steps you have said but under </p>
<p>audio channels there is only an option for stereo.<br />
Specs:</p>
<p>Asus H87M-Plus motherboard (integrated sound)<br />
os: windows 8 home premium x64<br />
<br />
in the users guide of the board they explain how to connect </p>
<p>a 5.1 system but i only hear the rear and bass. The plugs are <br />
in the good place. Only the green plug works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i hope anyone can help me.</p>
<p>(sorry for the bad english)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>greets,</p>

            i have figured out that the windows driver that runs the audio basically just lets the green (stereo speakers) plug and the black (subwoofer) work. I had to rig mine to work but i does thanks to a splicer.

<h2>            Fishdom &#40;and other games&#41; Blank Screen issues</h2>
                    <p>I'm having issues with multiple games on windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fishdom, Throne Together, and Samurai vs' Zombie defense are three I know i have issues with. &nbsp;There may be more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that when the game loads, they load up to a black screen. &nbsp;When I mouse to the bottom left to bring up the side bar, it appears, and at that time I can see the game. &nbsp;but as soon as I move away from the side bar, the screen goes back to black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the things I have tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1: updated all security patches, and windows updates.</p>
<p>2: uninstalled all games</p>
<p>3: followed the steps given on the xbox forums that are below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows Key + R</li><li>In the box, type wsreset.exe&nbsp; and press Enter</li><li>This will relaunch the Windows Store</li><li>Reinstall game</li></ol>
<p>4: updated all drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>While it sucks I can't play throne together or samurai vs' zombie, the only one I am really upset about is Fishdom because I paid for the game. &nbsp;And after posting on the xbox forums about my issues, and attempting to get help there, and from the microsoft
 people on facebook, I have had no luck. &nbsp;And they have not been able to either get the game working, or explain who I can contact to get a refund since I am unable to play the game I purchased. &nbsp;Does anyone have any other suggestions on what to try, or how
 to get a refund?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>&nbsp; The Fishdom 3 game that is in the windows 8 store is not a Big Fish Game. &nbsp;It is actually published by Microsoft. &nbsp;Big Fish has no access to that game to help troubleshoot the issues. They have no access to the game itself, or the microsoft store to give
 a refund.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other thoughts on who to contact, or how to get a solution or refund?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link to ghost recon while interesting, doesn't really help I don't believe. &nbsp;I don't think there is really any way to turn a game purchased through the windows 8.1 store windowed. &nbsp;If there is I have not yet found it.</p>

            I have contacted playrix. &nbsp;But I'm curious why you keep insisting that the game is a company other then microsoft? &nbsp;The microsoft windows 8.1 store itself says the game was published by Microsoft Studios. &nbsp;Shouldn't this be a question that needs to be
 answered by microsoft studios itself?

            <p>A publisher and a developer are two different animals, a bit like a book if you like where you have an author and a publisher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The developer will be more in tune with their own software and will likely be aware of any issues with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft on the other hand merely provides the shop window (the Windows Store) and takes a 30% cut of the profits.

            <p>I'll take a look to see if any non avast related help in that post will do anything. &nbsp;currently I have no antivirus running on the machine other then the built in stuff from Microsoft. &nbsp;it's only connected to the internet to connect to the Microsoft store
 to download apps. &nbsp;it's never online for anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this issue did happen from a clean install of windows 8.1 on this machine as well.</p>

    <title>1&#58; System Restore Error 0x80042318__2&#58; Windows Media Player 11 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> godoffire04  say:</h3>
<h2>            1&#58; System Restore Error 0x80042318__2&#58; Windows Media Player 11 Will not open__3&#58; Internet Explorer 8 Freezes as soon as opened.</h2>
                    I have these three program Issues after Reinstallation of Windows Vista and attempted (mostly unsuccessful) use of Windows Easy Transfer to move and reinstall my programs and files. My computer was having some startup issues before, (it would almost always
 give me the blue screen at startup and go into the startup repair). The Startup repair would not fix anything and just waste about 20 minutes of my time. Eventually it would not even load at all and startup repair wasn't helping so I finally decided to reinstall
 Windows Vista. This worked perfectly until I stupidly decided to try and use Windows easy transfer to hopefully "move" my programs over to this new copy of Windows Vista.<br />
<br />
So now my issues are: Windows Media Player 11 will not open at all. I can not see thumbnails of videos that would open with Windows Vista either. Oddly enough though I can use Windows Media Center just fine. I also have the Quicktime player installed and these
 seem to work just fine.<br />
This hasn't been disastrous but mainly an annoyance. I've been using VLC player to handle most of my videos just fine, but liked using WMP before.<br />
<br />
Secondly: I cannot create any restore points at all. Any time I try I get this error message:<br />
"The restore point could not be created for the following reason:<br />
An error was detected in the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS). The problem occurred while trying to contact VSS writers. Please verify that the Event System service and the VSS service are running and check for associated errors in the event logs. (Ox80042318)
 Please try again."<br />
<br />
Lastly, for some reason after the transfer, possibly after Internet Explorer automatically updated it will completely freeze when I open it. It gives me the prompt to open the previously crashed session, and if I attempt that or close the dialog box to just
 open the home page, it will completely freeze, even the blue loading circle beside the tab name.<br />
Thankfully I have Firefox and Google Chrome installed, both work just fine.<br />
<br />
Any help is greatly appreciated. I'm not entirely fretting over IE8 and WMP 11 but I would really feel less stressed if I know that I have a System Restore Point in case my previous issues start to happen again.<br />
<br />
Here's my system specs, in case that is in any way helpful.<br />
<br />
Dell Studio 1535 Laptop<br />
Windows Vista Home Premium 32 bit<br />
Service Pack 2 Recently Reinstalled<br />
Intel Core 2 Duo Processor 4 Ghz<br />
3 GB Ram<br />
4.0 Windows Experience Index/Rating<br />
<br />
Major thanks in advance to anyone that can give any little glimmer of help. I've tried searching for these issues online and found no help. My next stop is Dell Tech support (.. not looking forward to it)!

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>All these might be related and there might be corrupted system files on your computer that might behind this behaviour and error messages. Before
 trying SFC scan, let perform clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try doing a Clean boot. To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers
 and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After starting the computer,follow the steps in the article: “How to perform clean boot”.
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><em><span>Note:</span></em></strong><span> Please ensure that the computer is set to
 start as usual by following the step 7 from the article <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a> <span>
&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above doesn’t help try and use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to check and fix system corrupted files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To do this, follow these steps: </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Steps to perform SFC scan</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click the Start button</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. From the Start Menu, Click All programs followed by Accessories</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the 'Run as administrator' option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening. You may simply need
 to press the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. In the Command prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. A message will appear stating that 'the system scan will begin'</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>9. If any files need any replacement SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Vista DVD for this process to continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>10. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>11. After the scan has completed, Close the command prompt window restart the computer and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the link below for more information.</span></span></p>

            Do you have these problems if you for testing purposes create a new user?<br />
<br />
Some other things that you can try after trying "Sreenkanth T's" suggestions is to run the ChkDsk program.<br />
<br />
Try running ChkDsk to check your drive for errors. Right-click your Drive icon/ Properties/ Tools/ Error Checking.&nbsp; Try it first by not checking either box (this will run it in a Read-only mode) to see if it flags any hard drive or file problems.&nbsp; If it does,
 restart&nbsp; it by ticking both boxes, and rerun it to allow it to attempt to fix any found problems<br />
<br />
Windows Easy Transfer doesn't move installed third party programs across, it only moves their settings, your data files, and Windows settings.<br />
<br />
As you have just reinstalled Vista, where were your old programs and files (on what machine) when you used Windows Easy Transfer, do you still have access to these?<br />
<br />
Perhaps you should do the reinstall once more but forget about your settings, and just manually copy across your data?&nbsp; This way you will be giving yourself a clean start with no old settings from any other machine?<br />
<br />
You can also look at this third party program (costs a little bit of cash) but it can move everything, including installed programs.<br />

<p>Hello, RestingGnat22,</p>
<p>What was the reason for deleting your profile from your account? If you wanted to change it's E-mail address it wouldn't really need to be re-downloaded before or after. I don't think it's even possible for 1 E-mail address to hold two gamertags 'Gamertag
 A &amp; B. By the looks of it something has gone wrong no doubt. Can you try a couple of things for me please?</p>
<ul>
<li>Signing in on Xbox.com (Use the e-mail address you changed it on Gamertag A, and what Gamertag displays at the top right?
</li></ul>
<p>Note: When you say you have deleted the e-mail address for Gamertag A does that mean you deleted the Alias for gamertag A at account.iive.com ?</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you tried re-signing in to the E-mail address that you said has been deleted as a Microsoft Account? Gmail and Microsft Accounts are two different things as you know you can sign up for a Microsoft Account using a third party e-mail provider such as
 (Yahoo, Gmail, ISP E-mail, Your Own Domain - If you have one) </li></ul>
<p>At this point it is a bit hard to determine a recommended solution because I don't think it's detailed enough. Mainly because you say you have deleted the E-mail without the specification of if it was an Alias you deleted or something else. There may be
 something you are missing because it should be impossible to link two gamertags to one E-mail.</p>
<p><br />
What you could try at this point:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is your Gamertag A associated or has been associated with any Family Pack/Family plan or is it a Child Account linked to an Adult Account? Is it a part of any Family Members on an Xbox One Console<br />
(Solution for this would be to download the primary account with the parent Microsoft Account &amp; Password on the Xbox 360 Console, as it should prompt you to try and download a family member that is attached to the primary/parent account - I am assuming you
 know your password it's just the e-mail address you are unsure of) </li><li>Contacting Microsoft Xbox Chat Support<br />
(Tell the Microsoft Xbox Agent the problem you are experiencing, no one on the Xbox Forums will have the ability to load up accounts and find out sensitive information in regards to your account. Type to them what you have typed to us on here, and provide them
 your affected Gamertag and for them to load up your account by sending out a Security Code, this will send it either to your alternative e-mail address which is used to retain a forgotten password, or when you access Xbox.com Billing Section, Or anything else
 that requires account verification before proceeding) Once you have passed verification the Agent should then be able to fully load up your affected Gamertag A and tell you your current set E-mail address. If it is the one you tried and it does the same thing
 still, then you must stay on the chat session with the Agent to escalate this issue to Tier 3 (Higher Support) who can fix account issues when problems occur. please chat to them now at:

<h2>            Windows 10 Anniversary Update&#58; &#34;Setup has failed to initialize working directory...&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Howdy y'all. I've tried several times to install the W10AU (x86) on a Dell Venue Pro 8 5830 tablet using the Media Creation Tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I populated a 16-GB USB flash gizmo and connected it to the Venue with an OTG dongle. All seemed to go well but the update took so long that the battery was depleted. The update was auto-magically rolled back to version 1511. I decided to add a
 32-GB microSD card as disk D: and copied the MCT distribution from the USB gizmo to the microSD card. I reran the AU but still saw the error message. Other posts indicated that the error message occurs when there's insufficient free space on C:, so I removed
 the obsolete recovery partition and now have 12.2 GB free on C:.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The AU still doesn't get past the error message so I think that files are corrupted or permissions are incorrect. How can I fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks kindly for your suggestions.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your note, André. I read the note that you referred to, but the&nbsp;installation never gets to the "Windows needs more space" message. I have a 64-GB USB gizmo ready but I don't expect to need it because C: has 12.2 GB free and D: has about 24 GB
 available. That's why I think that there's something outta whack in the directory structure that AU expects, or maybe file permissions. Is there a log file the AU installer? Where is the "working directory"?</p>
<p>

            Hi Chip
<br />
<br />Please explain this in more detail . . .
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Are you seeing what looks like a new Desktop, with the default Windows Desktop Wallpaper?
<br />
<br />If so, most likely you have received a Windows 10 update and it has not completed correctly and you are logged into a Temporary profile:
<br />
<br />Before you do anything or move any files around 
<br />Restart (not shut down) your PC 4 times in a row, this will fix this issue a lot of the time . .. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise: 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see a user folder that look like yours? 
<br />Open that folder and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.) 
<br />
<br />If you still have not found your files, look for a Windows.old folder on your C Drive, expand that to open the users folder contained inside - check there for your files, icons . . .etc. 
<br />
<br />If you do find your files . . . etc. there, copy them out as soon as possible as Windows will remove the Windows.old folder in time 
<br />NOTE VERY IMPORTANT: Do Not copy your files into the Temporary profile you are currently in, when the situation is corrected, your files will be deleted with the Temporary Profile and will not be recoverable !!

<p>One question first, is your Win 10 OS 32 or 64 bit ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is 32 bit, then 4GB RAM is max that can be used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not then I may be able to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to action center&gt;&gt;settings&gt;system&gt;&gt;about</p>
<p>
</p><p>system type -&nbsp; 32 or 64 bit</p>

<p>HMMM Mine is at 0.9MB reserved. Pretty similar comparisons here. Let me look into some system settings to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f007323-d774-4866-93a3-fa5e2e077fd9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f007323-d774-4866-93a3-fa5e2e077fd9?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Click on bottom "Open Resource Monitor" then look under Memory. Here should show and tell you where this 4GB is being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/528cc26a-453c-46fd-a3f1-9c40a36dacec?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/528cc26a-453c-46fd-a3f1-9c40a36dacec?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also what is your processors usage at idle??</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/233e6473-9f15-4309-8e7f-e6b212b4b544?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/233e6473-9f15-4309-8e7f-e6b212b4b544?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What kind of&nbsp;Graphics do you have. Inboard graphics, AGP, PCIe, PCI ????</p>
<p>Maybe check your BIOS settings.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I suggest to run a full memory diagnostic check, *8 pass*</p>
<p>I also suggest to run disk check and system file checker</p>
<p>It could be because of your chipset drivers need updated, your BIOS may need firmware update (FLASH)</p>
<p>settings in your BIOS may be incorrect</p>
<p>I see you have 2 - 4GB sticks of&nbsp;memory</p>
<p>maybe your board can only take 2GB per slot up to 8GB max, and that 2GB on each stick is a total waste and that is your 4GB lost reserved.</p>
<p>also, mix matched memory is a bad idea as you should always install in pairs. This could also cause a conflict and be the problem.</p>
<p>It could be many things. I would have to have the PC to find the reason or issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>call your PC manufacturer first and ask them if your board supports more than 2GB RAM per slot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>
