            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my opinion :</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone your disk in the state it is now. This way you'll save your documents even if you have to reinstall Windows frow scratch. If you can't clone your disk, copy your documents on another (external) disk. If W10 doesn't start, you can boot with a linux
 standalone DVD and then copy your documents within linux.</li><li>Revert back to your previous OS. If W10 starts, do it with the integrated function. If it doesn't or rollback fails, reinstall the system. either with the DVD given with the machine or with a fresh Windows ISO. You'll be asked to key in the serial number
 during install (5 x 5 characters you can find on&nbsp;the Windows sticker probably glued at the back of your laptop).</li></ol>
<p>The DVD given with the machine (if you have received one) will put your computer back to the state it was in when you bought it. Hence the necessity to save your documents before (or better clone your disk) on a dedicated disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Easy to say, more difficult to do, I agree...</p>

            <p>I think this (your)&nbsp;Win 10 upgrade is an anomaly, for me anyway. MY 5600U came with in Win 8.0 then I upgraded to Win 8.1. I did upgrade the memory to 16&nbsp;G, but that is all the hardware I changed. Later when Win 10 came out - last July 2015- I ran the MS
 Win 10 compatibility program&nbsp;and it OK'd my Aspire 5600U upgrade and I did upgrade with no problems. Last week it automatically upgraded to the Anniversary 10. Each time I had no problems.&nbsp; The whole family has different brands of computers&nbsp;( ten computers
 and one MS Lumia smart phone) and have upgraded to Win 10 anniversary without issues. Everything seems to work well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think making sure all the latest updates are installed&nbsp;is important too. Also, did you update from Win 8.0 to 8.1 before proceeding??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am curious to know whether Acer with have a bios update for the Aspire 5600U for Win 10 though. So far, I have not seen this.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Doesn&#39;t Automatically Connect to Network after Sleep or Hibernate</h2>
                    This just started two days ago after Windows 7 ran an automatic update.&nbsp; Whenever I wake my laptop up, I have to manually connect to the wireless network.&nbsp; It used to connect on it's own.&nbsp; I didn't change anything with the network or router.&nbsp; I have the
 connection set to automatically connect but it doesn't.&nbsp; It will, however, automatically connect when I boot the computer.&nbsp; I've tried all the tricks from past problems....I see the network and it will connect and work fine after I manually connect to it.&nbsp;
 Just can't figure out why, all of a sudden, it stops connecting.&nbsp; Again, this started 2/10 after a Windows automatic update...it looks like all the updates were security fixes and I'm hesitant to uninstall them since I really don't know what any of them are.&nbsp;

            Yes! I think I fixed it. I tried all of the above to no avail. Then it hit me. Turning off the "allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" is fine and good, but what about the USB port? They can do this too. Go to the device manager and
 right click, yes, the network adapter and clear that check box, but also do it to the" USB Root Hubs" under "Universal Serial Bus Controllers".<br />

    <title>Cannot enter Recovery Environment&#47;Advanced Startup Options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> federico_it  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot enter Recovery Environment&#47;Advanced Startup Options</h2>
                    Dear all,<br />
<br />
luckily my Windows 8.1 laptop boots fine for now, but I was trying to check the Recovery Environment just in case of future need.<br />
<br />
Surprise - can't get into it at all - tried the three documented ways I could find: hitting Shift as I select Restart, "shutdown /r /o", and from PC Settings. In all three cases Windows just restarted straight into the normal Windows environment.<br />
<br />
I am 99% sure that this is due to me cloning the hard drive in the past to move my Windows installation from a disk drive to an SSD. I was careful to preserve all partitions but I suspect some offset/boot record/partition table order/partition ID was modified,
 leading to this effect. Of course I checked that Windows was booting fine but only now I am also checking the other options and finding that they don't work.<br />
<br />
My disk layout is as follows (from Disk Management):<br />
<br />
1000 MB, "Recovery Partition"<br />
260 MB, "EFI System Partition"<br />
912 GB, NTFS, C:<br />
350 MB, "Recovery Partition"<br />
17.22 GB, "Recovery Partition"<br />
<br />
This 5-partition layout is inherited from the factory installation (from Lenovo) and, as far as I know, is basically a straight clone of the factory HDD install. To be honest I have no idea why there are so many recovery partitions nor how to identify which
 does what, I assume some may contain Microsoft code and maybe others Lenovo code or images. (I guess I could assign them drive letters to see what's inside each but I preferred not to, yet, in case of side effects).<br />
<br />
Now, my question is - how to set up the system so that it is able to boot into the Windows 8.1 Recovery Environment/ASO? I have found references to the "bcdedit" command and I have downloaded the EasyBCD software. The latter shows the current configuration
 as reported below.<br />
<br />
Can anyone please help me figure out which setting went out of place, or what to investigate next? Thanks in advance!<br />

<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>In Windows 8 and Windows 8.1, the “Recovery Partition” is a locally stored copy of the operating system installation files in
 a INSTALL.WIM file format., called a “Recovery Image”. This WIM file could contain an un-customized copy of the Windows installation files, such as what you’d find on the Windows installation media, or it could include a customized copy of the installation

 recovery partition is, and you'll need a USB flash drive at least that big.</font></font></font></p>

            Hi John,<br />
<br />
excellent, thanks for the pointer. Following your suggestion I could locate the image in question in Partition 5 of my disk, which was indeed the only one large enough to hold it (and way more - so Lenovo added lots of stuff to it or left empty space).<br />
<br />
================<br />
<br />
PS C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt; reagentc.exe /info<br />
Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE) and system reset configuration<br />
Information:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows RE status:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enabled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows RE location:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \\?\GLOBALROOT\device\harddisk0\partition5\Recovery\WindowsRE<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Boot Configuration Data (BCD) identifier: 91c71fd5-5ca6-11e3-be71-5c514f7374ee<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recovery image location:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recovery image index:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Custom image location:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Custom image index:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0<br />
REAGENTC.EXE: Operation Successful.<br />
<br />
================<br />
<br />
I do not need to save space at the moment, but I will still make a recovery stick as you mentioned, in case disaster strikes.<br />
<br />
Now the other point of my question is - how is the Recovery Image related to the Advanced Startup Options? When ASO is requested (e.g. when Shift+Restart is issued), is Windows supposed to boot into this Recovery Image or is there another environment somewhere
 on disk that should be booted?<br />
<br />
If the former - then I think I have almost all the pieces I need - I just need to re-teach Windows to boot into Partition 5 when ASO boot is requested. Interestingly, from the info I posted earlier, it looks like this line is already present (but evidently
 not enough):<br />
recoverysequence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {91c71fd5-5ca6-11e3-be71-5c514f7374ee}<br />
<br />
Otherwise, it would be great if you could point me to what else must be located.<br />
<br />
I would really like to get this up and running again, as another layer of safety.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />
        </p>

            You may want to use Diskpart to check your partitions on the drive.&nbsp; Disk Management does not show the MSR partition.
<br />
<br />
The 8.1 Winre.wim, which is the image for the Recovery Tools, is in the 350 MB partition which the 8.1 update added.<br />
<br />
If you can't get into the recovery options by using the Charms bar and PC Settings and Recovery, you may have to reset the reimage setting.&nbsp; Right now it looks OK, but it gets a little complicated if you have copied the original partitions from another drive.<br />

            Hi Saltgrass,<br />
<br />
thanks for the advice. Indeed diskpart shows another partition at the beginning of the disk:<br />
<br />
================================<br />
<br />
DISKPART&gt; list partition<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Partition ###&nbsp; Type&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Size&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offset<br />
&nbsp; -------------&nbsp; ----------------&nbsp; -------&nbsp; -------<br />
&nbsp; Partition 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reserved&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 128 MB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17 KB<br />
&nbsp; Partition 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recovery&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1000 MB&nbsp;&nbsp; 129 MB<br />
&nbsp; Partition 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; System&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 260 MB&nbsp; 1129 MB<br />
&nbsp; Partition 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 912 GB&nbsp; 1389 MB<br />
&nbsp; Partition 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recovery&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 350 MB&nbsp;&nbsp; 913 GB<br />
&nbsp; Partition 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recovery&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17 GB&nbsp;&nbsp; 914 GB<br />
<br />
================================<br />
<br />
...it's really funny how many of them are deployed :-D So the partition number is now shifted by 1 compared to the original post. (Actually from what I can see "Partition 1" is just empty, so the other tools are quite right in only listing 5 partitions).<br />
<br />
OK, so it is my understanding now that partition #5 contains the ASO boot environment while #6 a full OS image for system restore. By merging information from the various tools I get this picture:<br />
<br />
Partition 1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reserved&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 128 MB<br />
Partition 2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recovery&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1000 MB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WINRE_DRV<br />
Partition 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EFI System&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 260 MB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SYSTEM_DRV<br />
Partition 4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Primary&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 912 GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows8_OS (C:)<br />
Partition 5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recovery&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 350 MB<br />
Partition 6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recovery&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 17 GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lenovo_Reco&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {91c71fd5-5ca6-11e3-be71-5c514f7374ee}<br />
<br />
Still trying to figure out what's wrong in booting into the ASO environment... You're right that copying partitions from another disk complicates matters, but then again I think this shouldn't be a forbidden scenario in the real world... people need more space,
 faster disks, and sometimes just need to rescue their stuff from a broken system...<br />

            One thing that needs to be mentioned is the position of the MSR partition and its offset.&nbsp; Normally that is the third partition and you only see it set up the way you show if you convert a drive to GPT in Windows.&nbsp; If you convert it to GPT from the recovery
 environment, it does not add a MSR partition, but an install will and place it third.&nbsp; I do not know for sure this will hurt your system but the offset is a different place that most installs, although an OEM configuration may be different.&nbsp; Below is my non-OEM
 system.&nbsp; This is an original 8.1 system, so no second small recovery partition.<br />
<br />

Your bcdedit listing is only partial.&nbsp; If you use <b>bcdedit /enum all </b>you should see a boot loader showing as Ramdisk with the identifier you show in the Windows Boot Loader above for recoverysequence.&nbsp; It will describe where it thinks the Winre.wim file
 is.<br />
<br />
I don't think I can supply any more info about your situation, but if you know how to use

<h2>            ADD Printer__ Windows Cannot connect to the printer. Access is denied</h2>
                    Have Laptops just loaded with Windows 7 Pro on my domain. Trying to load printers from a print server. Print server running Windows 2003 R2.<br />
<br />
When I log on&nbsp;with a user profile&nbsp;I go to devices and printers \ Click add printer \ select network printer \ I see a list of printers on the print server - pick the printer I want to load \ asked if I trust this printer - click install drver \ Coping files
 window opens -green bar moves like it is loading drivers \ then just before you get the window to ask if you want to make this a default printer \ Get window open that says - Add Printer&nbsp;&nbsp; (RED X) Connect to Printer&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows cannot connect to the printer.
 Access is denied<br />
<br />
Have made changes to device installation settings to allow user to load drivers. Checked security access (everyone has permissions) for that printer on the print server.<br />
<br />
Turn off the UAC control on the laptop. Group Policy changed Point and print restrictions.<br />
<br />
<br />
But this same user can log on to another network computer, that has XP Pro Loaded and can load the same printers that are denied with windows 7 pro<br />
<br />
<br />
As a network&nbsp;administrator I can log on to the laptops and&nbsp;load the printers&nbsp;A B and C.<br />
<br />
Then I can log on as the user and I then can load printers A B and C&nbsp; but as a user if I want printer D I get the&nbsp;same message as above.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks in advace for your help

<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. As per the problem description, I understand that, you have an issue with computer performance. I would request you to send us additional information as listed below to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></li><li><span>Which antivirus application are you using?</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>I would suggest you to try this method and check the issue status.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Check if you can experience the issue in ‘Safe mode’; if safe mode works fine then set the computer to ‘Clean boot’ state to check for software conflicts.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>Start your computer in safe mode. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>Keep the computer on a clean boot and check for the issue status. If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem. Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.
 After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software you can consider uninstalling it.</span></p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Once you purchase the XBOX Live Gold Family Pack - 12 month, it lets the person that purchased the account to add 3 more people onto the account as secondary accounts which will all have XBOX Live Gold.<br />
<br />
The accounts need to be added on the same XBOX 360, but after they are successfully added they will be able to move the gamertags to their own consoles regardless of where they are.<br />
<br />
So to answer your question it's your own account (the person that redeems the code or purchases it) and then 3 more people (for a total of 4 people). This is a good thing to have if you have multiple people in your family that want to use XBOX Live Gold on
 multiple consoles or on the same console.<br />
<br />

    <title>How To Back Up Surface 2 Pro Out Of The Box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shadowsports  say:</h3>
<h2>            How To Back Up Surface 2 Pro Out Of The Box</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>Is it possible to back up the Surface 2 Pro out of the box?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've attempted to search for the answer.&nbsp; I know the device has a recovery partition and understand how&nbsp;to use&nbsp;it.&nbsp; I have reviewed the steps for recovery (restore, refresh), as well as&nbsp;how to start the device from an external storage or boot device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I'd really like to know and have is the option to back up the device out of the box, prior to start up, configuration,&nbsp;adding an account or&nbsp;any user information, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this possible?&nbsp; Could I use Back Up Exec, Acronis True&nbsp;Image (or other) bootable
 media for example?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am attempting to evaluate the Surface 2 Pro for use in a business environment.&nbsp; Software can get corrupted.&nbsp; Recovery partitions don't always work (for whatever reason).&nbsp; I am looking for&nbsp;a guaranteed solution&nbsp;to restore and/or deploy Surface 2 Pro &nbsp;with
 these types of options:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Restore Surface to a factory state (never started)</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;Restore to a default customized configuration for my organization.&nbsp; This might&nbsp;include preinstalled software, apps, and being joined to a domain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand the device has some of these capabilities, but they all seem to depend on the device being able to start.&nbsp; If it can't or won't, I'd like to know that I can recover the OS and all partitions regardless.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My second question is&nbsp;in relation to building a system recovery disk.&nbsp; All of the knowledgebase and support articles I could find say the size requirements for the disk&nbsp;needed varies (depends)?&nbsp; This information is not helpful at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the documentation, the media used for recovery is wiped and formatted prior to creation.&nbsp; It is also recommended that the media not be used for file storage, etc.&nbsp; This makes sense, except for one thing.&nbsp; How much space will I need?&nbsp; Certainly
 there must be a general guideline for this depending on the Surface device you are backing up?&nbsp; If you are creating&nbsp;recover media for a Surface 2 Pro 64GB you will need media with xx available free space.&nbsp; If you are creating recovery media for a 256GB you
 will need media with xx available free space. ??&nbsp; Please remember I am primarily interested in backing up the device out of the box.&nbsp; Not after I have added or installed an undetermined amount of user data or software.&nbsp;&nbsp;Having this information would be extremely
 helpful.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, you have to guess or hope that the media you have chosen is large enough or take a chance of buying a larger storage device that what is needed only to have 1/3 of its space used while it sits on a shelf.&nbsp; This is not practical.&nbsp; There are different
 scenarios for each situation, but in the end, I am looking for a way to restore the device regardless of it's ability to start on its own "bare-metal" restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,
<br />Most probably your device doesn't support Windows 7. Does Dell provide drivers for that?
<br />
<br />If no, unfortunately, you would have to stick with Windows 10.

            Hi Praveen
<br />
<br />The first thing to check is, are Windows 7 device drivers available for that Dell laptop from the support page on the Dell website. If Windows 7 device drivers are not available, there is no point in downgrading to Windows 7, because, Network, Audio, Display and Chipset are very important to the running of that laptop . . .
<br />
<br />What is the exact Model No. of that Dell Laptop, - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . . .

<p>As previously posted you need to check Dell support for Windows 7 on that device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no such thing as a pre-activated DVD for Windows 7 you need a licence key to activate Windows 7 once you have installed it. You need to boot from the DVD to clean install Windows 7 and delete all partitions for Windows 10. But first be absolutely
 sure you have Dell support for the device.</p>

<h3> rickadkins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t find solution to this problem&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased another computer running Windows 7 64 bit. It works great except that every five to ten minutes, a message pops up in the lower right corner along with a British female voice that says "Unknown computer found". The message box also reads
 "An unknown computer was found on your network". &nbsp;I have checked everything conceivable but have found nothing on my network that's not supposed to be there, also no problem devices, no evidence of anyone trying to hack in, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is driving me crazy! Any idea what might be causing this, and, more importantly, how to make it stop? I've used every Windows OS since Win95 and have never encountered this problem. I did a search online but this problem is not listed in any of the
 results. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated!!! Thanks.....</p>

            <p>How&nbsp; about the female? can you pass me her phone, only if she is pretty of curse. I get the girl you can have PC. Then I really can fix Windows 10 for good. And you Newer again you will have any problems with females. Microsoft is Specialist to make people
 crazy. I have been there, but manage to escape and now I'm free.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro HOT, locking up no over heating warning cant shut off - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jennifergross313  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro HOT, locking up no over heating warning cant shut off</h2>
                    <p>I have a surface pro that is used very little. &nbsp;It's been a perfect computer up until this Microsoft update starting on 2/6/2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will completely lock up on me I can't use the touch screen or keyboard. &nbsp;However, I can swipe the screen saver screen and it takes me to the login page but I can't type to login and it won't even hard shut down. &nbsp;I have tried the volume up button and
 the power switch trick and nothing. &nbsp;The fan will become very loud then and the computer gets hot. &nbsp;The computer will cool down but remains locked up. I normally have to wait for the battery to die before I can try to use it again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, I can do that trick the screen will go black and the keyboard will no longer light up just like it's powered down. &nbsp;But, I plug my phone into the port and the computer responds with the tones that it recognizes that I plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can happen several times a day or be fine for 5 days and lock up. &nbsp;There is no rhyme or reason to it that I can find. &nbsp;Other then it always happens when the computer goes to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; When I put the computer down I normally keep the keyboard on it and lay it on its face because the back gets so hot. &nbsp;Once I forgot and it left a discoloration on my dresser from the heat of it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have tried to force shut down and restart to see if the update was not successful and I get no messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took it in to Best Buy on 3/11/2016 while it was locked up. Since I purchased it on 1/14/14 I knew I was out of&nbsp;manufacturer warranty and my extended warranty. &nbsp;I asked them for an estimate for repair. &nbsp; &nbsp;The gentleman looked up my account and since I
 have an Elite status with them he was going to go ahead and fix it and check for viruses. &nbsp;He started typing in some information and went and got his manager. &nbsp;He said see I have forced it twice and it refuses. &nbsp;The manager said see this? &nbsp;as he pointed to
 the screen. &nbsp;We can't take this in the store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that he turned the screen around to show me a red skull and cross bones. &nbsp;I said what does that mean? &nbsp;He said, it's a recall and fire Hazzard from Microsoft and due to its dangerous issues we can't even take that computer into the store. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked again.. A recall from Microsoft? &nbsp;No one contacted me I have only seen that the power cord was an issue and I received a new one. He said Mam I am really sorry. &nbsp;I said a fire Hazzard? &nbsp;He said yes mam a Dangerous fire hazzard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They could only give me Microsofts phone number. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Since 2/6/16 it shows it updated &nbsp;2/11/2016 , Twice on 3/2/16, &nbsp;and 3/12/16.<br />
</p>
<p>I called Microsoft and they seem more worried about the burn or discoloration mark on my dresser then fixing the computer. &nbsp;They kept questioning me about the dresser and all kinds of weird questions that did not help the computer situation. &nbsp;I told him
 I was sorry I even mentioned my dresser. &nbsp;He had the nerve to tell me that Microsoft cares about my safety and this issue about the burn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I told him with OBVIOUSLY YOU DON"T. &nbsp;You tell Best Buy its a fire Hazzard and a recall but you NEVER informed the public. &nbsp;So, I have to upload pictures of my dresser and wait. &nbsp;I NEED MY COMPUTER FIXED and I HAVE 3 MORE OF THESE. &nbsp;I purchased one for my
 husband on the same date as mine and a PRO 3 in February of 2015 that is doing the same thing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So at this point I have no information no resolve and a computer that decides when it will work and when it wont and I have to becareful how &nbsp;I set it down and where I sit it down</p>

            <p>I have been experiencing the same issues with my surface pro 4. I need for the previous commenter to think and make sure that Microsoft service employees admitted that there was a recall, and most important , what is the

<p>
</p><p>As, for the condescending remark of "think and make sure" &nbsp;Read more careful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FIRST, a friend took his Pro 3 into Best Buy and they took his and gave him a full refund.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>SECOND, it was a Best Buy Geek Squad Tech who showed me his screen with the skull and cross bones with Dangerous Recall on his screen. I have a Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIRD, &nbsp;since it was a Microsoft update that started this It doesn't matter what configuration my machine is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, Microsoft has since seen my pictures and sent me a FEDEX prepaid box and has my computer. &nbsp;I will update when I get my results.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I think you misunderstood my reply. I just got an RMA from bestbuy based on yours and others temarks and experiences. I've just learneed through experience that a really first class company like Microsoft needs every piece of evidence so they can make not
 only the right decisions for us but others. It's becoming just too easy to call any successful company evil or gasp, profit driven. Hey, Apple is the richest of them all and is still given slack because they are the underdog.</p>
<p>Just trying to put things in perspective.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Type Cover Fails - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Type Cover Fails</h2>
                    <p>Got Surface Pro 3 from Microsoft store yesterday. Attached type cover and started doing software &amp; app installs. Was working ok, but a couple of times the screen keyboard popped up. Went to look for updates and began brining things up to date. Then the type
 cover stopped working. No backlight even with repeated re-attachment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found steps for troubleshooting and tried them all. All the way to a full reset to a clean machine. Nothing worked with eth type cover: no keys, no touchpad no backlight. Looked in device manager and could not even find the Surface Type Cover recognized
 or driver installed. Looked in all the device groups and it was nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Called support and worked it through with two-button refresh. Still nothing at all. Support then sent me an email saying to return the keyboard for a refund.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went to Best Buy and bought a new keyboard. Did another full reset to get the machine to the factory state. Attached the new type cover for Surface Pro 3. Backlights came on, and started setting up the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I did the account sign in and others, the screen keyboard popped up. the Type cover was not functioning for input either keys or touchpad, so used the screen keyboard to fill out info. As soon as set up, I started to do Windows Updates, with keyboard
 attached, to bring everything up to snuff before doing anything else. As the updates progressed, I noticed that the backlight was not on anymore on the type cover. After all updates were processed the keyboard remained dead. Went to device manager and could
 not fine the Surface Type Cover device anywhere and no drivers either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found a KB article that had the firmware update for the Type cover. Ran the link and the dialog box said "no surface type cover found, please connect."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Leaving for a 2 week vacation with a tablet that functions on screen, but not the Type cover.&nbsp; Attached the wireless USB plug from my desktop keyboard/mouse, and that works. Feeling very frustrated at my end. Wish I still has MS-DOS 1.1 right now.</p>

Bob and VickieWoods,</a><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Welcome to the Surface Community!&nbsp; I apologize for the frustration and inconvenience you are experiencing with separate non-functioning Type Covers on your new Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; Thank you for taking time to provide us in great detail of the troubleshooting
 steps you have attempted for this issue.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When you return from your vacation, please take a moment to review the following suggestions.&nbsp; If none of these resolve the Type Cover issue you are experiencing, please contact
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Assisted Support</a> to discuss warranty options.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Have you tried interchanging different Surface Pro 3 Type Covers from working models at the Microsoft Store or Best Buy?&nbsp; This will help isolate the issue to your Surface or Type Cover (or both).<br />
</p>
<p>- With the Type Cover attached, does the <strong>Windows Device Manager</strong> display an
<strong>Other</strong> device group?&nbsp; Click on the <strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong> icon located on the toolbar.&nbsp; Does Windows detect any new or unrecognized devices?<br />

            <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>I'm running in a very similar issue:</p>
<p>On my 1st tablet the type cover works fine. BTW: this surface and type cover are German versions.</p>
<p>On a new tablet, bought 5 weeks later during an assignment in Canada, it is (the German type cover)&nbsp;not recognized, only a HID compatible device is listed under keyboard in the device manager.Because I installed Windows in Canada onsite I didn't use the
 type cover. I configured a blue tooth keyboard, which works till today great. But it is not suitable for travels ... So I would like to use both keyboards. And I should add: Because of this fact, there are two HID keyboards in the device manager showing up.
 But on the German tablet the type cover filter device is popping up only in the case, the type cover device is attached. When I remove it, it is disappearing from the list of devices.</p>
<p>This is not the case on the new tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I read the kb article, tried all the steps and instructions.</p>
<p>I also read here on the forum and followed your advice to clean the magnetic connector.</p>
<p>I did a couple of resets, full, quick&nbsp;- the type cover was plugged in during the new installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The type cover is still in use on the old tablet, it is working as a charm.</p>
<p>Frankly said, I doubt, it's problem with the hardware ... Everything else is working, Bluetooth, usb drives and other devices too. The metallic balls/connectors are just fine looking. Rather firm snapping into the connector it seems.</p>
<p>The only difference: I'm using a windows german on the old machine and a windows Canadian on the new tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any additional hints, what I should try?</p>
<p>Pls. don't repeat your posts as in the past again and again, I have done a refresh. I have read the kb article!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Alexander</p>

<div>Your post is a little confusing, but it sounds like you bought the SP3 in Canada</div>
<div>and have a German Type cover that is not working properly on the SP3 you bought</div>
<div>in Canada. You don't see the type cover in device manager on the Canadian SP3</div>
<div>even when it is attached. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This is a WAG - shot in the dark, but does anything change if you change the</div>
<div>language on the Canadian SP3 to the same German language on your original</div>
<div>Surface?</div>

            My Type cover stopped working after I installed Visual Studio Community&nbsp;2013. After hours of searching for a solution on Internet the Type cover resumed working after running Windows Update via Control Panel until no more updates were found. Three times
 with system restart were necessary although I had "Automatic updates" set.

            <p>The type cover for my 128GB SP3 model has suddenly stopped working after powering it off last night. I've tried all of the options posted on the MS support page, and even searched through a few questions here. None of them have worked thus far, and I even
 went as far as to restore my device, followed by a factory reset.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently charging my device so I can install the latest Windows 8.1 updates from the factory state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly enough, the surface type cover isn't even listed in the device manager. Not even in the other devices drop down menu. The closest think to it is Surface Cover Telemetry</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for a background on the condition of my sp3, I've had it since late October and I keep it in a folding case, and the keyboard has no wear or tear. Also I regularly scan for viruses so I know it isnt some form of malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope I provided all the relevant info in this post. I'm sort of starting college soon and not having a working keyboard is a bit worrisome.. Being in a country without a Microsoft Support centre doesnt help either.</p>

            <p>Welcome to the Surface Pro 3 typecover problem. Mine stopped working some months ago for no reason I could discover. It was working and then it wasn't. It turned into the heaviest, most expensive screen protector I've ever owned. I posted about it at the
 time and no one could come up with a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My own feeling is that the SP3 has at least two firmware problems: the non-working battery, that might or might not have been caused by a firmware update last year; and the non-working typecover problem that, as far as I know, has never had an attempted
 fix by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you've got a good case to carry your tablet around in. Mine is a soft case so I have to keep the typecover in with it to prevent the glass breaking. I also now carry a Bluetooth keyboard to add to the weight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was really pleased when I originally bought my fully-working SP3. Right now I feel sick about it.</p>

<p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Found an answer for Vista, which should work for you in Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reset the game statistics, you need to delete some files. These files will be automatically recreated the next time you play the game. The files are located in the following location: 'C:\Users\[UserName]\AppData\Local\Microsoft Games\[Game]', where [UserName]
 is your account name and [Game] is the name of the game (in your case, Solitaire). Simply delete the contents of the folder, but DO NOT delete the folder itself.</p>

Hi David,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Did you make any changes prior to the issue?<br />
2. Does the issue persist on all the windows including Windows Explorer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Make sure the down arrow key is not stuck on the keyboard.</div>
<div><strong>Step 1: </strong>Run online virus scan<br />
a. Visit <a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</a><br />
b. Click Full Service Scan button.<br />
c. Complete the instructions on the wizard and complete the scan successfully.<br />
d. Check if the issue persists.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the issue still persists, check if any non Microsoft program is causing this issue<br />
a. Open the article: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
b. From the article, follow "Step 1: Perform a clean boot" Executing these steps will disable all the non-Microsoft programs running on the computer.<br />
c. Check if the issue persists.<br />
d. If the issue does not persist in clean boot, it means that some non-Microsoft program is causing the issue.<br />
e. To find out the program that's causing the issue, try "Step 2: Enable half of the services" to "Step 6: Resolve the problem"<br />
f. Once you find the culprit, check if there are any updates or patches for the program. If you find any, install them and check the difference or reinstall the latest program.<br />
g. From the article, follow "Step 7: Reset the computer to start as usual"<br />

<h2>            How to remove printer that doesn&#39;t show up in Printers &#38; Devices</h2>
                    Hello all!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a laptop running Windows 7 which is running into an annoying problem. &nbsp;We have a network printer thats name ends with PCLc. &nbsp;When the laptop in question tries to print something, there's a printer option that's PCLc and another that's PCLe. &nbsp;I have
 no idea where the PCLe came from, and they look similar enough, (and his eyes are old enough) that about 50% of the time he picks the wrong printer. &nbsp;When he does this, nothing happens either on his computer or printer, it just vanishes.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I went to remove this PCLe from his computer, it's nowhere to be found in "Printers and Devices" folder. &nbsp;Any ideas how to get rid of it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks so much!</div>
                </div>
