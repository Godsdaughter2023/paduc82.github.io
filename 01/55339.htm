<p>Some games do require an actual HDD for certain game options or features. Try contacting the game publisher/developer to see if this is the case with this game.

<h2>            Explorer.exe shows error msg&#58; &#34;This file does not have a program associated with it.....&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>PROBLEM:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clicking on Windows&nbsp;"Explorer.exe" (either the shortcut or the actual program itself) causes the following error msg. (under the header:&nbsp; "explorer.exe"):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<em>This file does not have a program associated with it for performing this action.&nbsp;
 Please install a program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel".</em></p>
<p>ADDITIONAL INFO:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A successful work-around - though not ideal - is as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp; When I right-click on the windows&nbsp;explorer shortcut,&nbsp;a list of previously selected 'frequent' folders pops up.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I chose one,&nbsp;windows explorer then opens&nbsp;correctly, and
 is pointed to the selected folder.&nbsp;&nbsp; From there, I can nagivate to any other directory/folder correctly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am concerned, however, as to why the shortcut/program file themselves are causing the error message.</p>

    <title>Media players freeze when external device added - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Media players freeze when external device added</h2>
                    Bought new PC with 64-bit Vista installed in Summer.&nbsp; Due to house move it stayed in box till November so upgraded to Windows 7 before starting to use machine.<br />
<br />
I-tunes downloaded but failed to sync with iPod - System freezes whenever iPod attached.<br />
<br />
Went through all the "normal" solutions<br />
- used different USB slots<br />
- downloaded latest version of iTunes<br />
- selective startup programs to avoid conflicts wiith other software<br />
- synced in "disk mode" etc<br />
<br />
IPod works fine though&nbsp;in old XP machine.<br />
<br />
Gave up on iTunes and have tried to sync with both WinAmp and Media Monkey - same problem, program downloads and operates fine until I connect my iPod and the program freezes.<br />
<br />
Have picked Hardware and Drivers forum but could be anything!<br />
<br />
Any thoughts greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
F-P<br />

            Hi FunPolice,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting in Micorsoft Windows forum<br />
<br />
Have you tried<strong> Safe Mode</strong> ?<br />
<br />
Try booting in safe mode and connect your Ipod and check if it still freezes.<br />
<br />
<strong>To boot into safe mode, follow the below steps: </strong><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.<br />
<br />
Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do one of the following:</strong> <br />
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon
 prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER. For more information about options, see Advanced startup options (including safe mode).<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.<br />
<br />
When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of the display. To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let Windows start normally.<br />
<br />
Refer the below link for more details:<br />

<br />
<br />
If it does not work, then it is an apple issue because I've seen many users with similar issues in apple forums. See :

<br />
Post your issue in the same link and hopefully they should come up with a solution.<br />
<br />

            Azeez - haven't had time to follow through on safe mode yet but interestingly when I ran USB troubleshooting it seems my Windows 7 default setting was not to check for most up to date driver when device connected - this might help.<br />
<br />
Mark - assume you mean PC as opposed to iPod(which is an 80Gb&nbsp;Classic) - Motherboard is&nbsp; ASUS P5KPL-AM with Intel G31 chipset - haven't read of any similar problems.<br />
<br />
Will let you know how safe mode runs at weekend.<br />

            As a temporary measure, try uninstalling your antivirus software (before you do, make sure you have the necessary product keys and media to allow you to do a reinstall) and see if it makes a difference when you try to copy files to your ipod.

            I have had the same issue, with multiple USB devices and 4 different versions of Windows 7.&nbsp; I first experienced lockups with USB devices (printers, cameras, phones, and especially external HDs) with Windows 7 64 bit beta, then RC release, then commercial
 Windows 7 Ultimate and now commercial Windows 7 Home.<br />
<br />
Also, I am using an AMD Athlon 64 bit FX62 dual core with ATI video (not Nvidia...as I understand there is aleady a hotfix in place for this system).<br />
<br />
I have not found a solution.<br />
<br />
DS<br />
<br />
PS:&nbsp; The same PC does not exhibit the issue with Windows XP or even 64 bit Windows Vista.&nbsp; Also experienced the same issue an a Gateway Laptop, with AMD dual core chipset.

<h2>            Windows 10 activation</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i bought a laptop (Samsung&nbsp;NP740U5L-Y02US) one and half years ago. It came with windows 10 pre installed and licensed. I lost all of my hard drive info, and with that i lost the recovery partition. Is there anyway to revalidate the windows key if i installed
 from microsoft download site? I dont have any other media to recover more than internet. If there is no way i have to buy another windows copy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Lucian0 , no need to worry, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you will not need a product key, activation will be automatic and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10       
        </p>

            If you had your Windows 10 license activated previously, you got a digital license. You will never need the product key again once you get digital license. Since, you have a digital license, hence when you do clean install, the license information is automatically picked up from Microsoft activation servers. Windows will activate your Windows license from this information.
<br />
<br />Make sure the version installed is same as it was previous. For example, if it was Windows 10 Home, you need to install Windows 10 Home only not Windows 10 Pro. If at any point during installation it asks for the key, choose you will do it later on / skip.

            Hi Lucian.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can reinstall WIndows as often as you want, as long as it doesn't involve a motherboard change it should reactivate with the Product Key embedded in UEFI firmware chip on the motherboard, or Digital LIcense if it's established one, and shich you can also link to your MS Account by signing in on the PC.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated steps here for the best possible Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />As you bought Windows 10 pre-installed, it may have OEM license. So you can reinstall Windows 10 and it should be automatically activated.
<br />
<br />Here's how to check the type of license installed on your system.
<br />
<br />1. Open administrative Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />2. Type slmgr /dlv and press Enter key.
<br />
<br />3. Note the Product Key Channel section Windows Script Host box:
<br />
<br />If it mentions OEM &lt;method&gt;, you’ve OEM license installed.
<br />
<br />If it says Retail, you’ve retail license installed.
<br />
<br />If it mentions GVLK, VOLUME_&lt;method&gt; then you’ve volume license installed. Note that GVLK stands for Generic Volume License Key.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<h2>            Skype video not working on MacPro 13</h2>
                    <p>Hi, Skype video does not work anymore on calls. &nbsp;Green light comes on and video shows on my end, until the call is picked up, then it defaults to my screen shot. &nbsp;I can hear and see everyone, but they can only hear me and see my screen. &nbsp;If I cycle video,
 it does no good. &nbsp;I've checked through all the settings and have reinstalled without any luck. &nbsp;Any insight would be helpful. Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>May I know when did the issue started? Is it happening to a specific contact? For the meantime, I suggest you follow the instructions below.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1. Uninstall and Reinstall the Skype application with the latest version.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Check on your video settings and make sure that the camera device you’re using is listed.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>4. Make sure that the software drivers of your camera is updated.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Try using a different camera device.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. Check on the privacy settings. In the menu bar, select Skype &gt; Preferences &gt; Privacy. Under Allow video and screen sharing from, make sure that either Anyone or Contacts is selected.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. Also, you may delete the shared.xml and config.xml. See the steps below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><span>Quit Skype by selecting <strong>Skype</strong> &gt; <strong>Quit Skype</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Open <strong>~/Library/Application Support </strong>* you will see there the Skype folder.</span></span></li><li><span><span>On the Skype folder, find and delete the <strong>shared.xml </strong>
file. If file extensions are not displayed on your computer, the file will just be called

<h2>            How to mute a USB microphone in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a Logitech USB microphone to use with DJ / mixing programs, but I cannot mute it on my desktop computer running with Windows 81. &nbsp;The computer recognises it and says the driver is up to date. &nbsp;The sound quality is fine, but the microphone is constantly
 on and can be heard in the speakers or headphones while I have it turned off in the programs. &nbsp;I have tried front and back USB ports and three different programs and it is always the same. &nbsp; &nbsp;I have an older laptop using Windows 7 and the microphone works
 perfectly with full control. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be most appreciated. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried each suggestion you made and everything looks fine, but I still cannot get the microphone to mute in the background. &nbsp;To complicate things further, I am currently in France, using a French computer, so I have to convert the words such as "troubleshoot"
 "update "drivers" etc before doing anything. &nbsp;With every attempt, I can see the driver is up to date, the device is the default one etc. &nbsp;I can hear it perfectly when I do not want it, so the actual microphone is perfect. &nbsp;The manufacturer does not have a
 download for it. &nbsp;Again, when I use it on my older laptop running with Windows 7, it operates perfectly; quiet in the background and only can be heard when I select it in my chosen mixing program. &nbsp;It just insists on being constantly live on my main Windows
 81 computer. &nbsp; &nbsp;Strange. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi - do you mean copy (rip) discs onto your computer or make CD copies of them? If it is the first check the setting shown highlighted in the image below. If the library location is missing click 'Add' and then 'OK'.</p>
<p>WMP is part of the OS in W7 but it probably needs sorting out rather than re-installing, and the 'library corrupt' message is pretty standard -&nbsp;often relating to a lost link to an unwanted file, so not a matter for concern usually.</p>
<p>If further help is needed please update with a bit more detail about what you wish to do... Thanks - Ric.</p>

            <p>This should all be straightforward stuff. Have you successfully copied music to your mp3 player from this pc previously? I need to know a bit more background so that I can try to figure out the cause. In the meantime (unless you have already tried this)&nbsp;it
 may help to run the system file checker to see if that finds any issues... follow the online instructions for W7 from this link and update. - R.</p>

            <p>Cariad... I'm sure we can figure this out but you have to help me understand the problem...</p>
<p>How - and to what - were you copying the CDs when it was 'extremely slow'?</p>
<p>Typically to copy a CD to your mp3 player you need to copy it to your media library in mp3 format first and then copy it from there to the player. Is that what you have done?</p>

            <p>Apologies for the delay in replying - my internet connection has been out for a while.</p>
<p>Twenty minutes is a bit slow... read/write speeds vary from disc to disc but 10 minutes would be more typical for a full CD's worth.
</p>
<p>Let's see if we can get WMP working again. Go to Control Panel - Programs - Choose Default Settings for media etc.</p>
<p>and you'll get the 'Choose what happens...' page. Scroll down to CDs and in the dropdown next to Audio CD's check that 'Play with WMP' is showing... if it is but WMP is not responding when you insert a disc we'll have to make further checks. Did you try
 running SFC? - Cheers, Ric.</p>

            <p>OK - just try getting it to respond with auto-play on a few different discs - if it fails to open or recognise any of them I reckon this is more likely to be the optical drive causing the problem... it may simply need a clean but optical drives particularly
 in laptops are often not that great. If it is a laptop you can try cleaning it yourself - be very gentle with the lens (arrowed)&nbsp;- a soft water-colour brush and just tickle it - the other areas that may need cleaning are shown in the image below by yellow
 lines. For a tower pc you'll need a suitable cleaning disc. Hope you have some success. - R.</p>

            I have played other disks on my desktop and copied them from the 'd' drive direct to my MP3 player, but this only seems to work when one disk is involved;&nbsp; when I want to copy an audio book with more than one disk, it does not work, which is why I resorted
 to WMP.&nbsp; I have cleaned the drive, but nothing has changed.&nbsp; Getting very frustrated here!

                    My Windows 7 computer was recently fried by a storm, so when I bought a new computer, I got Windows 8, and installed my backup. Now, many of the folder and file icons are gone. I can still access the files, but folder icons of "outside" software just show
 blank rectangles. (( specify "outside" because I've read a lot of questions here, and it's not Windows icons that are missing - it's other software.) Would greatly appreciate some help.

            I found the answer. The icons that were missing were from outside software. I had to open the properties of those individual files, and assign them to the software, and the icons appeared for all similar files on my computer. One app was only on the Windows
 app screen, so I had to re-download that software as a Windows 7 software so it would save directly on my desktop (rather than the Windows screen) and then those icons appeared too.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I'm not a fan of Windows 8 at this point.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Thank you for your help. Maybe by the time I get it all figured out a new version will be out. LOL!!</div>

</p><p>I am having issues with family safety blocking every website. I have a paper I need to do on google documents and I can't! My&nbsp;mom won't be home for two weeks, and I asked her, but she can't do anything about it. The paper is
<em>due</em>&nbsp;in five days. Is there <em>any</em> way to turn&nbsp;family safety&nbsp;off without the password?! I need the internet for school in general, and can't do what I need to do.

<p><span><span>We regret the inconvenience caused to you.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As an initial step I suggest you to start your computer in safe mode and check if the issue appears there as well. If it does not appear in safe mode place the computer in clean boot state to identify
 the culprit program running in the background creating this error. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Safe Mode</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<strong>Safe Mode</strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the article below to start your computer in safe mode</span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Applies to Windows 10 as well</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Alternatively</strong>: Lock the screen, from the lock screen hold the Shift key on keyboard and click on
<strong>"Power button" </strong>click on <strong>Restart. </strong>It takes you to recovery environment click on "Troubleshoot" click on Click on "Startup Settings", Select

<p>Hi Thoss,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear this. Your voice really matters to us. So we can assist you accordingly, we’d like to know when the issue started.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned “Many time windows 10 was automatic add keyboard English (Singapore) on my surface pro 4.” “After found problem I open keyboard setting but not found keyboard Eng(SG). “, How did you notice that your device added the English (Singapore) keyboard?
 Was it when you turned your device on or in the Welcome screen? Are you getting a prompt message notifying that your device automatically added English (Singapore) keyboard? Also, what other troubleshooting steps have you tried as an attempt to resolve the
 issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be best if you can send us a screenshot showing the information under<strong> Administrative language settings</strong>. Kindly, go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Time and language</strong> &gt; <strong>Region and language</strong> &gt;
<strong>Administrative language settings</strong> &gt; Click <strong>Copy settings</strong>.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 update problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dkocian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update problem</h2>
                    <p>I have a Toshiba Satellite M115 S3154 laptop running Windows 10. I get a message from Microsoft that I must update to version 1709 or in April I lose support. I have tried a dozen times. Gets to 33% and the install crashes and the system restores to prior
 version of windows.<br />
Microsoft gave me the following error message last time:<br />
OxC1900101-Ox30018<br />
The installation failed in the First_Boot phase with an error during SYSPREP operations<br />
- I have not only turned off all antivirus programs, but have removed them. (Avast in particular)<br />
- Turned off the firewall<br />
- Incompatible driver -&nbsp;I went through the computer and disabled everything I could, one by one, running the update each time to see if removing that one would fix it. Did not help.<br />
- tried installing it over both wireless and cable. As suggested, disabled the wireless card. Not only that, but I also created a USB disc, and disconnected all internet access, and tried running it that way. Did not help.<br />
- removed every USB device, except when I disabled the touchpad on the laptop, I had to keep the usb mouse plugged in.<br />
- ran sfc/scannow - ran it several times, especially after messing with the register as required by some of the links<br />
- updated everything from Windows (except this current update) and updated BIOS to current version. Even tried some of the automatic driver upgrade programs but all I got was a load of viruses on my machine that I had to clean off.<br />
- of course, before doing this, I ran Avast complete scan, and then clean files and cleaned the register with CCleaner.<br />
- every time I get the BSOD, it sends out the logs (or at least it says id does) to Microsoft.&nbsp; No help so far.<br />
- Removed everything from the computed. I have no personal files left on it at all and removed all programs other than windows.<br />
- I could not run setupdiag.exe - I have NET Framework 4.7 installed. Article says I need 4.6 and I guess that is why setupdiag.exe would not run.<br />
-&nbsp;Ran troubleshooter - no help.<br />
- error logs - spent some time trying to decipher these. There is one for each time I tried to load the upgrade.&nbsp;They all have "Panther" in them somewhere. Some were not accessible. Not sure why. Bottom line is that there were a lot of error codes and they
 were not consistent. The last one had 0xC1800104 and several instances of -x800705BB. One before that was zero bytes. One before that had one error code of 0x000000b7 - failed to create Window PE rollback directory. I think this one had to do with the restore
 after the failure.<br />
Note that the DC WATCHDOG VIOLATION did not show up in an error log but was shown on the BSOD message. That is the one that got me looking on the Microsoft site to see what it meant and led me to chasing down a possible AHCI issue and the lack of such choice
 on this laptop<br />
Went to the link dealing exclusively with the Ox30018 error code. It was good, but I have done every task mentioned there, including all the ones which are the same as in the first link you sent, plus disabling sound adapters in BIOS, running the DISM tool,
 using Media Creation to create the USB and running the upgrade from the USB, running the pnpclean registry hotfix. However, I did not try the registry key creation and modification they discussed. Just too much messing around in the registry, especially since
 I don't know how these would react with the other registry fixes.</p>
<p>Today, I decided to do a clean install (I already tried clean boot, but no help there).&nbsp; Ran the install program and got the following error code:</p>
<p>0x8007001F-0x20000</p>
<p>Apparently, I cannot even do a clean install.</p>
<p>I have been running Windows 10 on this laptop with no issues for years, since Windows 10 first came out.&nbsp; If there is a compatibility issue, it should have shown up long ago.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Can you check the following folder?: 
<br />
<br />C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\Sources\Rollback 
<br />
<br />In that folder is there a file called setupmem.dmp ? 
<br />
<br />If so, can you make the setupmem.dmp available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?

            That is the full pathway however the $WINDOWS.~BT folder may be "hidden" so you may have to "show hidden files and folders".
<br />
<br />Can you also check this folder (if it exists) :
<br />
<br />C:\Windows\panther\newOs\rollback 
<br />
<br />Is there a setupmem.dmp in that folder?

</blockquote>
<p>If you are using the Modern UI Mail App, your groups are brought in through the account, so if you are using Outlook.com (formally Hotmail) you can set up groups via the Web Site. If it is work email you would need to create your groups through Outlook Web
 Access (OWA) or through the Full Outlook Client. Again if this you ISP provider email account, setup either through their web interface or through Outlook and import those contacts into Outlook.com.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you are using the Outlook 2013 client groups are setup just like they would be on your Windows 7 machine.</p>

            <p>I had tried that myself with 8.0 and had a group in the Outlook.com contacts list and the Mail app refused to display the group list but did show my regular contacts only.&nbsp; I have not tried it since then and was just using Outlook.com until 8.1 Preview came
 along and then I set everything up with Outlook RT and no problems.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Outlook.com did work pretty good and am using it now since my ISP had a malfunction with the sendmail server and can receive only now with them.&nbsp; I have not tried the Mail app since but I have been hearing rumors of Microsoft is developing a Metro UI version
 of Outlook and may be the replacement of the Mail app.&nbsp; That is a rumor though.</p>

    <title>Code 19 Error - Mouse Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mudassirac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Code 19 Error - Mouse Not Working</h2>
                    I have been having a problem since yesterday. I tried to uninstall Kaspersky Pure 2.0 using their removal tool in safe mode. When I rebooted, the software was gone, but my mouse wasn't working. I opened up device manager and under the mouse, it had an
 exclamation next to it being identified as "Code 19."&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I Googled the error and apparently it happens when there is a driver conflict? I tried uninstalling then re-installing the drivers but it didn't work. Upon further Googling I found some people suggested to remove entries in the&nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E96F-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}
 called UpperFilters? Deleting this is supposed to automatically cause the drivers to be renstalled, so I deleted it, rebooted, nothing. System Restore also did nothing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried going in safe mode, but the mouse still won't work. I have contacted Kaspersky Technical Support but they didn't do anything, and Microsoft Phone Support wants to charge me $99 dollars to fix my registry.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Windows 7 upgrade disk but my computer won't recognize it if I try booting from it. The CD is not corrupted however.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Running on Windows 7 64-bit, HP Pavilion a1430n desktop. This is an old pc, so I can't find any chipset drivers.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Help?&nbsp;</div>

<p>
</p><p>What happened with me was I was unable to find a solution and no one was able to help me (for free, I might add) so I ended up reinstalling Windows by ripping the files from the CD onto a different computer and creating a bootable USB. It was the easiest
 solution I could think of on my own. You could try that, or any of the other methods I mentioned that I had tried in the first post.</p>
<p>

    <title>My issue with syncing game data from the cloud has been resolved&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mosquitosmasher  say:</h3>
<h2>            My issue with syncing game data from the cloud has been resolved&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So lately i have been having a lot of issues with the Xbox One constantly trying to sync my savedata from the cloud. When i loaded a game i would always see the message that it was trying to get my savedata and it took ages to finish, plus that it barely
 ever finished and resulted in a error message. What seemed to be a problem that was not gonna go away soon (after having tried pretty much anything...) i have solved it. If someone else gets these problems too, i hope this will help:</p>
<p>**------------**</p>
<p>I loaded the game up, when it started to sync, i waited it out. It can take a long *** time and most likely will result in a error, but that's ok. When it gave the error:</p>
<p>We couldn't sync your data with the cloud just now. Try syncing again or use this game or app offline. (8083201d)</p>
<p>I noticed that when it has synced about 80 to 90 %, it will have all your local savedata. I chose to stop syncing and let the game load. Load my most recent save and after that made a new one or let it autosave. Quit game and took the Xbox One offline. I
 load the game again and this way avoid the cloud. I load the latest savefile and make a new one/autosave and quit game. went back online, booted game, this time the syncing was much quicker and it STILL gave an error around 70% but i chose to try syncing again
 and....it worked. This was for The Witcher 3. I then tried it for GTA V and this time i didn't even go offline and it worked just as well. So now i am not sure if you even need go offline, but try it anyway if the problem persists. Now when i boot up my games,
 i don't get that horrible nonsense anymore. I have to do this trick to all my affected games though, but that's ok.</p>

<p>@ Smasher, </p>
<p>Glad you got it working but ..</p>
<p>Not wanting to throw a spanner into the works but are you ( or anyone else ) sure it's ok to manually stop any game synching? I ask because in the past I have seen people say you shouldn't manually stop it, can result in problems, some even reported doing
 this resulted in them losing their saves altogether.</p>
<p>Like FullHornet posted, unless at the time there's a problem Xbox LIVE end then resetting your modem and/or hard resetting your console usually does the trick.</p>

<p>I had the same issue, I had fully reset my console a while ago and games needed syncing, this resulted in long waits and failures, quickest way around this is let it start syncing, then quit the game fully and start it up again, shoots through syncing really
 fast then.</p>

<p>@ Lofty</p>
<p>Well, i was in chat with MS a week ago and they actually advised me to let it finish first and then when it gives an error, stop the syncing they said. For me it was already so far gone that it couldn't get much worse. This trick helped amazingly for me.
 Resetting my modem would have only resulted in having to open my ports again. I truly tried it all.</p>

<p>Ahh ok!</p>
<p>Sorry mate, I read it and thought you were stopping the synch like at 10% or something before letting at least try and finish.</p>
<p>Don't mind me, I'm losing the plot :/</p>

            Try running Windows Updates. Its possible your wireless adapter is out of date. The computer may be new...but it may have been sitting in a box for months while a slew of new updates came out.

<h3> meltedsumoxiii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Any 2&#47;3 monitors work, but not all 3 at once&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After a forced windows update last night I have been encountering an extremely strange problem with my triple monitor setup. I have been running triple monitors for months without issue. However as of this morning, I can only get 2/3
 of my monitors to work at one time. I can get ANY two working together however as soon as I connect the third monitor it stops my main one (144hz asus VG248) from receiving signal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note my three montors are connected as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Asus VG248: Displayport - Displayport</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-BenQ VW2245Z: HDMI - DVI (adapter)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-HanssG HE225D: DVI - DVI</p>
<p>
</p><p>All connected to a GTX 1060 6GB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to re-iterate I can get any two screens working, but connecting a third to my GPU causes the 144hz (displayport) to receive no signal. This has been working fine for weeks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help/suggestion is greatly appreciated. This is driving me crazy</p>

            Hi  MeltedSumoXIII
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If the update is not installing or making your system unstable, I remove the update and block it from installation. 
<br />
<br />Due to the millions of configurations out there, some might not be fully compatible with a particular cumulative update.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart into Normal mode then check if stability/functionality is restored. If it is, proceed with the next steps.
<br />
<br />What I recommend you do is block the update for the time being and report it in the Feedback Hub so the Windows engineers are aware of the issue. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-submit-a-suggestion-or-bug-report-in-windows-10-using-feedback-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-su...</a>
<br />
<br />The update will try to install again, so use the following to block it:
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes. 
<br />
<br />Information in the above link is sourced from a trusted Microsoft MVP blog.

            You should do clean uninstall and install of Skype on your Mac.
<br />
<br />    Open your Applications folder and drag your copy of Skype to the trash.
<br />    Then open ~/Library/Application Support * and drag the Skype folder to the trash. The ~ sign      represents your home folder. To find your home folder, open Finder and, from the menu bar, select Go      &gt; Home.
<br />    Quit Skype by selecting Skype &gt; Quit Skype.
<br />
<br />Important: If you’d like to keep your chat and call history, skip this step.
<br />
<br />    Open ~/Library/Preferences and drag com.skype.skype.plist to the trash.
<br />    Open Finder and search for “Skype” using the search feature in Mac OS X. Move all of the results returned to      the trash.
<br />    Click Ctrl and the trash icon, and select Empty Trash.
<br />    Restart your computer.
<br />    Download and install the latest version of Skype.
<br />
<br />Library folder is hidden. To show the Library folder, in the Finder, click the Go menu, and then hold down OPTION.
