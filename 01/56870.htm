<h2>            Reset Windows 10 without CD or log in</h2>
                    Hello<br />
I have a Lenovo Z50-70 with Windows 10 and today it started acting up. It all started with it freezing randomly. I wasn't able to do anything and my music was stuck repeating the same part non stop so I decided to force turn it off by holding the power button
 down for 4-5 seconds. When it turned off, I turned it back up, logged in and was able to use my laptop again for like 5 minutes. After these 5 minutes the laptop became extremely slow. All my apps would take 5 minutes to respond. Closing the window of an app
 was impossible. I waited a bit thinking it might be because the laptop was still loading stuff in background but then I got the message 'Microsoft Window is not responding. Waiting might solve the problem. [STOP] [WAIT]'. I pressed on Stop to see if that could
 solve it but it left me on a black screen. I then force turned off my laptop again and when I turned it back on it said something like 'Checking disk for errors'. I waited for it to finish but once it reaches 63% that froze too. So I turned off my laptop again
 and now it would give the message 'Repairing disk errors. This can take more than an hour'. After ~45 minutes the lock screen appeared but I couldn't open it to log me in so I force turned off my laptop once more. When I turned it on again I was able to login
 but nothing loaded. The installed apps wouldn't show on my homescreen and the navigation bar at the bottom would just show the Windows logo and Cortana. I waited for ~30 minutes and nothing has loaded. I force turned off again (because if I pressed the windows
 logo nothing would happen) and when I logged in again still the same problem. I have been looking around on the internet for a way to factory reset my computer without having to login (because if I log in I am not able to go the settings anyway since everything
 is frozen) but I read that in Windows 10 the recovery partition was deleted (great job Microsoft! :sarcasm: ). I don't have an installation disk of Windows either to run that.&nbsp;<br />
What should I do? If I need to factory reset to fix this, how do I proceed to the factory reset?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.

            <p>Hello, since posting this I again tried changing the format, I changed it &nbsp;from .wmv to .avi and it can now be played in &nbsp;VLC and Windows media player now, but unable to be opened by sony vegas pro or windows movie maker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the code 0xc00d11cd (0x800700ea)</p>
<p>
</p><p>But prior to today I was getting a different error code which when I searched for it the results came up as missing codec. (although I have the proper codec) but as said before I download the codec packs just to rule it out 100%</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. I've made no issues to my computer other then a new water cooler. which would not be the root of the issue :P - damn you cooler! &nbsp;</p>

<h3> phil ip  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Host Process &#40;rundll32.exe&#41; High CPU Usage</h2>
                    <p>New high CPU usage scenario that, I think, only started after the May Tuesday updates. Similar to the other high CPU usage instances, Task Manager shows "Windows Host Process (rundll32.exe)" using a constant 28-30% CPU some time after boot. When you look
 at the Command Line, aeinv.dll is mentioned which is connected to the Customer Experience Program. As such, I opted out of that program. I had it come back again today but, this time, it was only using 8-10% CPU. I left it for about half an hour plugged in
 and it was still going. On a desktop machine, that's not so bad since you're always plugged in but, on the Surface, it eats into battery life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell, you can safely force close the process but I'd rather not have to keep worrying about my battery being drained at random times. Is there a way to fix this?</p>

    <title>Need to clear space on C Drive, unsure which programs &#40;listed some - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Need to clear space on C Drive, unsure which programs &#40;listed some below&#41; are safe to uninstall when trying to clear up my C drive&#63;</h2>
                    I was wondering if anyone could help me by suggesting how to properly uninstall programs -which are safe to uninstall??? I know not to do any dll or 32 file exts, but I have programs that I don't use, and don't know what they do that came on my laptop.
 I have done all of the temp file and cache memory dumps, internet, history cleared, disk cleanup, have updated current virus protection, defrag'd, deleted old restore points, and lowered %'s on recycle bin storage/restore point memory, etc. and still have
 no space on my hard drive C. I don't download anything from the internet like graphic games, mostly the occasional email attachment that may be a picture. I do have pictures from my digital camera, but that's about all. Not big into graphics or pictures for
 backgrounds, but at this point, my next big download was trying to get messenger for IM. It didn't download and though it may be some other reason, I would assume that my C drive being in the red and all but a bit filled, it might have something to do with
 that, or my pc running poorly. The biggest and only cd program I have on it is Mavis Beacon Typing,&nbsp; I'm also wondering why I have a D drive titled Data D drive which is practically empty and if I should in fact transfer some of the programs to this drive.
 I'm having issues because of what appears to be a duplication of my files, one titled Program files, the other titled Program Files X 86 and I don't know the difference or if they are both needed or mistakenly somehow duplicated some time ago. I'm wondering
 specifically about a number of certain programs as far as being safe to uninstall, including:
<p>Microsoft Visual C++, 2 of which are listed, one of 2005 and one of 2008 and I have never used it nor do I know what it is or need it.</p>
<p>Microsoft NET Framework programs are listed, have no idea what it is, never use it and if I don't need it would like to uninstall but I am unsure I should as it could be important and actually run in the background while I'm using the
 pc for other tasks.</p>
<p>Cyberlink</p>
<p>ATI Catalyst Install Manager</p>
<p>Synaptics Pointing Device Driver-I use only the touchpad for my mouse or a USB wired mouse for my pointer on the laptop I'm referencing as my "pc".</p>
<p>Microsoft Silverpoint,</p>
<p>The above programs are only from briefly looking over a list of programs that appear when I open the uninstall program from the control panel that I have never purposely installed or downloaded or where there when I got the pc (I'm assuming
 that). All of the above programs are listed in the Uninstall box, but I don't know that just because they are listed means they are safe to delete and uninstall. I simply don't know if these are part of needed programs for the OS or not. I can't be sure since
 I don't know the programs and I've never sought to use them on purpose to operate them so I have no idea what it is they do, though for this purpose, I really just need to know-Can I indeed uninstall them to clear up space on my computer without causing damage
 to the pc working? <br />
</p>
<p>I also wonder why only some programs show up as opposed to all programs when in the Uninstall box? Granted, that may be the answer in that what appears on the list can be uninstalled…? I'm not sure, so I ask for any assistance and help
 in this whole thing. I see lists of my programs on both Program Files and Program Files X86. It seems like it’s a complete duplicate of all the files I have on my computer, and I have no idea why it’s there, unless the makers or Microsoft meant this to be.
 I really appreciate your time and any advice or ideas you may be able to offer! </p>

            <p>First - look in your "Documents" and "Pictures" and "Music" folders.&nbsp; How much of that could be stored on "D"?</p>
<p>As for JDiskReport - it requires Java to work.&nbsp; Here's the steps I would take to get it installed.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the latest version of the Java Runtime Environment: <a href="http://javadl.sun.com/webapps/download/AutoDL?BundleId=49024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
JRE 6 Update 26</a><br />
&nbsp;(Saving it someplace obvious and easy to locate - like your desktop.)<br />
&nbsp;(The filename will be jre-6u26-windows-i586-s.exe.) </li><li>Download and save the latest JDiskReport: <a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/download/jdiskreport/jdiskreport-1_3_2-win.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
JDiskReport R1.3.2</a><br />
&nbsp;(Saving it someplace obvious and easy to locate - like your desktop.)<br />
&nbsp;(The filename will be jdiskreport-1_3_2-win.exe.)&nbsp; </li><li>Restart your computer and log in. </li><li>Right-click on the jre-6u26-windows-i586-s.exe file (Java) and choose "Run as Administrator" and if asked, enter your administrator password and answer all questions it asks in the affirmative.&nbsp; (Install, (Yes if asked), Close, etc.)
</li><li>Once it is done installing, restart your computer and log in. </li><li>Right-click on the jdiskreport-1_3_2-win.exe file (JDiskReport) and choose "Run as Administrator" and if asked, enter your administrator password and answer all questions it asks in the affirmative.&nbsp; (Next, Next, Install, Finish, close the README if it
 opens.) </li><li>Once it is done installing, restart your computer and log in.</li></ul>
<p><br />
Run it from the shortcut on your desktop.</p>
<p>It may *still* pop up, telling you that Windows is searching for a file (javaw.exe), which is annoying, but you can just click "Browse..." and its location - depending on whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Windows - will be (look in this order):</p>
<ul>
<li>C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre6\bin (you have 64-bit Windows) </li><li>C:\Program Files\Java\jre6\bin&nbsp; (you have 32-bit Windows)</li></ul>
<p><br />
Once you point it to the javaw.exe, it should run.&nbsp; On the first screen, click "Next".&nbsp; On the second, click the radio button for "I accept the terms in the license agreement" and THEN click "Finish".&nbsp; It will appear with two choices, you want "Scan a file
 tree".</p>
<p>It will then let you choose where to scan.&nbsp; You should expand "Computer" by clicking the [+] to the left of the word and choose (click on once to highlight blue) the "Local Disk (C:)" and click on OK.&nbsp; It will begin scanning - it will take a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(Do this all even if you already installed it, know you have Java, etc.)</p>

    <title>Most Recent Microsoft 10 Update is stuck, creating complete havoc with - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ljshuck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Most Recent Microsoft 10 Update is stuck, creating complete havoc with my computer</h2>
                    <p>Last Monday, I attempted to log into my computer and was dismayed that I could not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I noticed a rectangular box that indicated that if I restarted, all would be well. The other option was to dismiss, with the warning that things may become lost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I restarted, no luck.</p>
<p>Second, I dismissed, losing acess to my admin account, plus the start button would not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a note, my admin account is the main account; if I am able to repair or have someone repair, I lose everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being a NOVICE, I decided that without being able to use the start button &amp; did some research on my ipad specifically for this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beginning Tuesday, I conducted a sfc scannow Powershell. It took until late Saturday to complete. The result was that there are no integrity problems with my computer; I understand this to mean that the problem is fixable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then attempted a Recovery but got message that the hard drive was locked; clueless I restarted the computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my surprise, whatever happened between the last two thing I did, the Start button was working again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Getting into the system, I found that the Windows Update status bar is flat out stuck. Will not budge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Recovery and Restore. &nbsp;Cannot find my recovery disk, of course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do next &amp; how do I accomplish it without permanently losing everything, if I already haven't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get my admin account back?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I screwed? Do I just take it to a repair person, which there doesnt seem to be many reputable ones in my area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And how can Microsoft release updates, knowing it may well screw up peoples computers and offer no monetary compense for damages?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The issue may be caused by an improper Windows Update installation. For example, a Windows Update installation interrupted by a crash may result to a corrupted system file. To assist you with your concern, we suggest that you perform
 a system restore. <span><span>This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the
 restore point was made. To do this, follow the steps below:</span></span></span></p>

<p>Thank you for following up to see how things worked out with my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After failing to obtain good results with both recovery and reset processes, I decided it best to take it to a Tech Repair service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it turned out, I was indeed dealing with a software issue; something I suspected even before contacting the forum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, the technician was able to back up my photos and most of my documents. Once that was completed, he basically stripped the computer back to its factory settings and install Windows 10 and its components.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was especially awesome was that the technician knew within the same day what was going on, how to fix and of course, how much. When I called him the next morning to ask him to go forward with the repairs, he said ok and informed me I could pick it up
 within a few hours! All of this in less than 24 hours!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cost $200; much less than a new computer. Pleased.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, thank you for your assistance. Once I realized I wasnt going to be able to go beyond the suggestions here, I quit. Had I not contacted the forum, I may have pressed on and really messed things up.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            New USB flash drive is not detected in Win 10, but OK on other pcs</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a new flash drive (SanDisk Ultra Flair 32gb USB 3.0) which worked fine when I got it a few weeks ago. I copied files to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This week I can not get my PC to recognise it (Dell XPS 8920 with latest Win 10 home) but it works fine on all other PCs in the house (win 10 and win 7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have other older flash drives which work fine, so that leads to to believe the PC and flash drive hardware is fine, so possibly a Windows issue.<br />
</p>
<p>I've tried investigating in the 'Disk Management' tool, uninstalled the USB root hub from 'Device Manager', updated all the drivers to latest from dell's website. I can't find a similar issue from other users, so I'm really stumped. The only thing I can
 think of that has changed recently are some windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Simon</p>

            Could you check if the drive shows up in your BIOS? 
<br />
<br />You could also try resetting the BIOS:

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a look in the BIOS but there is no feature on mine to see usb drives (as far as I could see)</p>
<p>Today I flashed the BIOS with the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded that utility Kapil, it found an issue with a device that can't be ejected (F:) but that is my SD card reader (which I tested again to make sure and it reads and ejects my SD card fine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to double check, all my USB ports work with my mouse, keyboard etc... and my old flash drives. It's just the new flash drive acts as if it is dead now but will work fine in another PC. I can't return the flash drive as it does work, and I'm not sure
 what support Dell can give me because all other usb devices work (wacom, xbox controller, external hard drive, old flash drives, sd card reader)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen Error Evert Hour Regularly</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having a lot of blue screen errors couple times a day. I have clean re-install Windows 10 on 10/11/2018 and all the drivers are all up-to-date. Below shown how often ever since the clean installation. It was actually improved after, before the
 re-install, the error would pop up about every 2 hours regularly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen a lot of different kind of error. The most I have seen is MEMORY_MANAGEMENT. Also I have seen&nbsp;KERNEL_MODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED,&nbsp;ATTEMPTED_WRITE_TO_READONLY_MEMORY,&nbsp;PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA,&nbsp;IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ran disk check with cmd:&nbsp;<span>chkdsk /f /r and memory diagnostic test. Both came out clean. I have created a memory_dump.zip
 but I can't attach it here and I have no idea how to open it. Please let me know what info. you may need in order to solve this. Thank you so much!!</span></p>

            Hi Ciara, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />

            Hi Ciara, sorry the minidump file did not point to anything specific like a device river or virtual driver from software, it just mentioned Memory Corruption, but that can have many causes
<br />
<br />If/when your system crashes again, if more minidump file(s) are generated, please post a link to those and I will have a look at those for you . . .

            I suggest you to  Run memory test for at least 8 passes, prefarably Overnight.

<br />If you have a DDR4 RAM, use MemTest86 rather than MemTest86+
<br /><a href="https://www.memtest86.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.memtest86.com/</a>
<br />
<br />When the test completes post back the Image(You can use your phone's camera).

<p>
</p><p>I have suspected that before. Would it be because I am mixing the RAM? So I took out 2 4GB 2132 RAM a while back ago. Blue screen with MEMORY_MANAGEMENT still keep popping up regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It sounds like you could have a virus or other malware. Get your antivirus program up to date and boot into
<u>Safe Mode</u>. Note that some viruses can hide themselves from your antivirus program in normal mode, so you really need to scan in
<u>Safe Mode</u>. To get into Safe Mode when you first power up, hit F8 about once a second until you get the menu and select Safe Mode. Then run a full system scan. Forum moderator Keith has some suggestions along this line at
</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3"><u>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3</u></a></p>
<p>If that fixes it, fine. If not, use System Restore to go back to a date prior to the beginning of the problem. To run System Restore, click Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; System Restore. Click the box that says
<i>Show more restore points.</i></p>
<p>You can check for corrupted system files. Open an administrator command prompt and run SFC if the above doesn't help. Click START, then type
<u>sfc </u>in the search box, right-click SFC.EXE and click <i>Run as administrator</i>. Then from the command prompt type
<u>sfc /scannow</u><i>.</i></p>
<p>Finally if all else fails, you can check the rather cryptic system event log. To do so click Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Event Viewer. Once in Event Viewer click on the system log and scroll through the entries looking for those flagged
 "error" to see if you can find hints as to where the problem could be.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Good luck.</p>

<p>As I've said before, DX12 will only be a game changer if it is on as many platforms as possible.</p>
<p>It is only really quite recently that DX9 has stopped being supported in a lot of releases (though it still is for a great many.)</p>
<p>Why? because it was only, relatively speaking, recently that Windows XP stopped being the most used OS (and it still holds a fairly decent market share.)</p>
<p>DX12 is rumoured, on the PC, to be a Windows 8 and up exclusive. Meaning that Windows 7 users will be left in the cold. Given that Windows 7 holds the greatest market share, developers aren't suddenly going to stop developing with DX11.</p>
<p>This is the problem the One will have. DX12 might be a great feature with first party exclusives but what about multiplatform titles?</p>
<p>Are developers working on a game for One, PS4 and PC really going to take the time to make the most out of DX12 when two out of three wont be using it. More likely we'll get the visual equivalent of a Kinect lean.</p>

            It likely is, they must reselling MSDN licenses at too good to be true prices.
<br />
<br />About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys 
<br />They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN) or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.
<br />
<br />In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused and blocked the key from further use.

            Hi BKPKnt 
<br />
<br />Those licence keys are volume licence keys, they will initially activate, but will very soon deactivate automatically.
<br />
<br />This is because those keys are meant for a company environment and that version of Windows will require the licence to be re-armed on a regular basis form the Company Key Management server.
<br />
<br />You will not be able to do this as a private user
<br />
<br />Honestly, don't waste your money, it is not worth it!

            I also had the same problem, even when my BITS was disabled, it was pretty sure the some OS component was only causing this data consumptions as it was clearly visible all the services that were listed belonged to OS itself, So finally using the elimination
 method i found "Server" aka LanmanServer was the problem not sure wht this service does but according to many blogs it is responsible for LAN network and RPC calls though i didnot face any problems yet after disabling it i saw significant drop in data consumed
 and a side effect of faster boot...

<h3> pabresler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Brother MFC-8950DW scanner driver keeps getting corrupted by new version of Win 10</h2>
                    <p>I have had a Brother MFC-8950 printer/scanner now for several months with no problems. In the last couple of weeks the scanner driver has become corrupted, with an error message that the Brother utility cannot connect to the scanner. After I reinstall the
 Brother drivers and reboot it works again, but after the computer is shut down and rebooted I again am unable to connect to the scanner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have called Brother a couple of times. They have verified that the Windows fax/scan program does work, and therefore say the problem is not there's but that of MS. Unfortunately the MS fax/scan program does not scan to PDF files, which are essential for
 me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this problem started after one of the uncontrollable Win 10 updates. Please help!</p>

<h2>            Xbox Streaming Lags With very good Internet connection</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have this issue when I try to use the app for streaming from my Xbox one. The Xbox and the pc are both connected to internet with cables (not wifi) and my internet speed is pretty good, 90 mbps download and 20 mbps in upload. My pc is new, it has a GTX
 1080 graphic card, an AMD Ryzen 7 and 16 GB of RAM. Still, if I try to use the app and stream the game with OBS, for example, on Youtube, the game lags very often at "Low Quality"! And even if I'm not using OBS, I can never use "Very High Quality" cause the
 game freeze or lags often.</p>
<p>There is a way to fix this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>

            thank you for your answer, I stream on Youtube. I use the Xbox app and I catch the game window with OBS and then I stream it to Youtube from OBS itself. When I stream games from Steam I can get the game setted on Ultra in all setting and I'm able of stream
 at 1080p60fps, when I try to use the Xbox App I always need to decrease the quality to Low and I see the game laggy and pixelated but the stream itself on the YT works fine. When I had my old PC I thought was the CPU that coudn't handle it but now is not&nbsp;
 that the problem for sure. (I hope my english is ok I'm not a native speaker, sorry)

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated. Since the stream is being broadcasted through OBS and YouTube, we recommend reaching out to the support teams for those programs. The Xbox app utilizes
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/browse/mixer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mixer</a> to stream your games. If Mixer was being used, we would be able to provide more support options. There may be some settings with OBS or YouTube that are affecting the quality of the stream. We hope this helps!</p>

    <title>ATI FirePro 2450 and Windows 10 1703 1709 BSOD VIDEO DXGKRNL FATAL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brad grorud  say:</h3>
<h2>            ATI FirePro 2450 and Windows 10 1703 1709 BSOD VIDEO DXGKRNL FATAL ERROR</h2>
                    <p>SUMMARY: Since the release of Windows 10 1703 (and subsequently 1709) the included ATI FirePro 2450 driver is not compatible and causes a BSOD.&nbsp; After the 1703 update and I first had this issue, I was able to find and force revert back to the driver from
 the 1607 version of Windows 10.&nbsp; However, after deferring the 1709 update the maximum number of times, when prompted to update and not given the option to defer, I just hit the ESC key rather than click the OK button.&nbsp; As a result, Windows took this as my
 consent to install, updated, and my system has not been stable since.&nbsp; If windows is booted with this driver loaded, it will BSOD every time with the error&nbsp;VIDEO DXGKRNL FATAL ERROR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WORKAROUND: The only way to use the system is to boot up into safe mode, uninstall the display adapters from device manager (it is listed twice as the ATI FirePro 2450 is a Quad display adapter) and reboot.&nbsp; After it reboots up to normal mode, the screen
 will flash a few times white it sets up the driver, and will load the driver without a reboot.&nbsp; The system will then run stable for basic office tasks, but any attempt to run video, or some graphical web sites (such as CNN) will cause the computer to BSOD.&nbsp;
 If the computer is ever restarted, it will not boot and result in the same BSOD.&nbsp; The only drivers available for this graphics card are the ones built into windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>STEPS I HAVE TRIED:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean install of Windows 10 1709 - same issue</li><li>Brand new version of the exact same video card (The card is older, but originally I purchased 2, but only ever used it in one of my workstations so I had the spare)</li><li>I am unable to find any alternative driver to use</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT I AM LOOKING FOR: First I wanted to post this in case anyone else is having this issue, as the number of people using this video card on Windows 10 might be limited.&nbsp; I hope that posting this will at least make others aware of the issue.&nbsp; What I am
 hoping is someone knows a way for me to extract the ATI driver from an earlier build of Windows 10 so that I might force that driver to be used in my current install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions anyone has to offer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Brad</p>

            Hi Brad. I am not sure of a way to "extract" the older driver.

<p>Thanks Brad.&nbsp; I have same issue.&nbsp; Been trying to figure a work around, but so far nothing works.&nbsp; Argh.&nbsp; I may have to purchase new video cards (I run 8 screens) and had used two of these video cards with windows 7 very well, but needed windows 10 to run
 other software and the dreaded blue screen. &nbsp; If I find a work around I will let you know</p>

    <title>Vivitar Vivicam recommended drivers not working, so how do I force - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulhudson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vivitar Vivicam recommended drivers not working, so how do I force Win7 to use the older Vivitar drivers&#63;</h2>
                    I need to pull pictures off an old Vivitar Vivicam 3765 onto a Windows7 machine. &nbsp;The OS sees the device and installs what it thinks are appropriate generic drivers. &nbsp;Regardless of it showing as a "digital camera," no dialog box appears when connecting
 the camera to download the pictures, no proper camera device shows in Windows Explorer (to attempt a manual transfer), and the original ULead software (which runs okay without using compatibility mode) cannot see the camera to get at the pictures.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Though I downloaded the latest Vivitar drivers for the device, Windows7 will not use them over its preferred drivers; going into the device properties, selecting "Update Drivers" and pointing it at the Vivitar folder where the drivers have (from all I
 can tell) been properly installed does nothing but have the OS confirm that it has selected the right drivers and that the device is working properly (which it isn't).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there a way to force Windows7 to use the Vivitar drivers over its generic ones? &nbsp;So far, all the research and every angle I've tried leads me back to Windows7 assuming the drivers it has selected work fine without giving me the option to use the Vivitar
 drivers.</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Help would be greatly appreciated (heh, other than the obvious suggestion that I get a newer camera, which won't help with the pictures currently on this older one).</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to run
 the automated troubleshooting services.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Refer the article provided below:</span></b></p>

            I failed to mention specifically I had already run all the automated self help features in the OS, and while they are usually sufficient, in this case all roads lead back to Windows claiming the "correct" drivers are already installed. &nbsp;So specifically,
 I had already tried the troubleshooter, I had already used the device manager to wipe drivers and try again (complete with reboots)--this tool I have been using since the Win2000 days. &nbsp;(There is nothing wrong with the USB ports; they are no unresponsive,
 so messing with them would be unproductive, at best.) &nbsp;And I checked the self help web pages, including the one "Tips for fixing..." which simply repeats to try steps I have already tried. &nbsp;This was all done before I ever posted for help.
<div><br />
<div>Am I seriously going to have to find an older machine running WinXP that will let the camera work? &nbsp;Is there no way to force Windows7 to accept and use the older,
<i>correct</i> Vivitar drivers?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Remember, Windows7 initially thought the device was working properly; it sees no reason to change anything when I run the troubleshooters, and only through messing repeatedly with it did I get a warning error of any kind (and then the troubleshooters had
 no solution for it, other than linking to online solutions I had already been trying).</div>

<h2>            screen mirroring from a windows 8.1 ultrabook to a wi-fi-enabled tv</h2>
                    <p>Hello support guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to mirror the screen of my windows 8.1 ultrabook to a Wi-Fi-enabled Samsung-TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">On the TV</span></p>
<p>I select screen mirroring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">On the ultrabook</span></p>
<p>I select "Devices" on the RHS menu.</p>
<p>Then I select "Project".<br />
</p>
<p>I can then see the "[TV] Samsung" icon and I select it.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>C. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">On the TV</span></p>
<p>The message "Ultrabook is now connected" is displayed.</p>
<p>Then the message "Loading" appears with an icon showing that the TV is now attempting to mirror the ultrabook's screen.
</p>
<p>But the TV cannot proceed beyond this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looks, at first, like a TV-problem. But when I do the same with my smartphone, then everything works fine, i.e. the TV is able to proceed beyond the "Loading" message and mirror the smartphone's screen. So I have to assume, that it is a problem with Windows
 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

            <p>In the beginning screen mirroring worked fine, however it stopped working after updating Windows I guess? I was having similar difficulties. TV connected OK, but hung on a black screen with mouse pointer visible and moveable, but nothing else...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my ultrabook:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Samsung ATIV Book 9 plus. NP940X3G-K04US<br />
Windows 8.1 (64-bit) Intel® Core™ i7 Processor 4500U (1.8 GHz up to 3.0 GHz, 4 MB L3 Cache)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 40" and a 32" Samsung Smart TV + a 55" UHDTV Smart TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After searching and reading about people's issues, the solution that worked for me was to install Intel Widi driver from this page. Choose your OS:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/63392/Intel-Wireless-Display-Intel-WiDi-</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing I was able to use the app to mirror my screen as an extension. Then I changed it to duplicate and now screen mirroring works without the app :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess a piece of missing (or deleted by an update) software got reinstalled and now it's works as it did previously.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t Update Windows 10 PLEASE HELP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n&#39;yoma diamond  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Update Windows 10 PLEASE HELP</h2>
                    <p>So, I'm having a huge issue with windows 10 right now. &nbsp;I am currently part of the insider program I am using the windows 10 pro insider preview, now here is the issue: for some god-awful reason I am stuck in build 10074, and have been for multiple months
 now, which was fine until windows decided to tell me that since i am running an outdated version of the OS it will "[restart my PC] every few hours, and eventually will
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">fail to start</span>," AKA BRICK/KILL MY COMPUTER. so the logical response is to click more info and go to the page it brings me to, where it then tells me that i need to go into my settings and update windows from there,
 which is all fine and dandy until I get this error:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8ea67df8-561c-4f5c-93c7-d6cab425fcd7" /></p>
<p>so again, the logical thing to do is to go to the internet and look up a solution, EXCEPT NOTHING WILL WORK! none of the solutions i can find appear to do anything to make it work, zip, nada, nothin'. &nbsp;(by the way i have spent a long time trying to deal
 with this, since one of the things i tried doing was cleaning the image and the hard drive which took multiple hours), so after everything fails i decide to start backing up my entire c:/ drive into crashplan (i already had crashplan at the time except only
 had it set up to back up the User directory in case i just happened to lose a few files, not a whole system), let it go over night except over night windows decided to restart my computer. WHAT KIND OF MARKETING IS THIS!? "Oh, i see your computer is running
 an old version of the operating system, how about i threaten to kill your computer?"&nbsp;</p>
<p>So after sleeping on it for a night I come back and log into the computer and then get given a new message saying that my license for this evaluation copy of windows has expired and that i need to go to the store (software, not brick and mortar) and install
 the latest version of windows. now this is all fine and dandy until i go to the store and it gives me this message:&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/844d5c85-f1d9-4e57-bb9f-db27e44b4527" /></p>
<p>so i (logically) press the "Update now" button and then get the "Updating store" screen for half a second and then it just closes, every, single, time. And again, nothing i can find online to fix this works. It just doesn't make sense. How can a multi-billion
 dollar company like microsoft make something this broken and dysfunctional? I mean yeah it is an evaluation copy for the insider preview, but not even that should be this broken. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you manage to boast auto updates, and then have them break without warning or alert (windows never told me it couldn't update or that there
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">even was</span></em> an update, there was no error warning at all so how am i supposed to know that this is a problem that i should fix so i can update and
<em>not</em> have my computer killed?) which then makes it so i can't update and when the evaluation copy expires i am suddenly in a hurry and a panic to fix this so my computer doesn't get murdered by its own operating system! And then when i do the other
 option it gives me it STILL doesn't work, crashing every single time, consistently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just doesn't make sense, why restart my computer every few hours until it dies? why not just say "Your license for this copy of windows has expired, update now or your OS will be terminated" NOT THREATEN TO KILL ME COMPUTER! That is like going into someone's
 home and giving them a cease and desist because they didn't buy a new car last summer. It is outrageous! AND HOW CAN IT BE SO BROKEN!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just don't understand it and need a solution, because i'd rather my computer didn't die on me because windows is so dysfunctional. This is why people buy Apple products, because they aren't so dysfunctional that they don't warn you when something breaks
 and then precede to threaten to kill your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I have a 2 year old laptop with Windows&nbsp;</span><span>8 (rubbish), I upgraded to 8.1 (better), when I heard about 10 I&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>thought great, then I was offered an early way to get 10 by becoming a&nbsp;</span><span>'Pro Insider', so I signed up and it
 was download. Now I have the best&nbsp;</span><span>of both worlds, upgrade to full 10 or go back to 8.0/8.1.</span><br />
<span>Just before&nbsp;</span><span>10 was launched in July I was upgraded to Windows 10 Pro Insider&nbsp;</span><span>Preview
 Evaluation, build copy 10074 (see attached file), I quickly&nbsp;</span><span>clicked on some tab's. A short while later as it was booting up, a&nbsp;</span><span>message
 flashed up stating that due to me not allowing it to upgrade it&nbsp;</span><span>will every 2 hours shut down, until one day it stopped. To make it&nbsp;</span><span>worse
 I am a Lecturer and I had a PowerPoint Lecture to give in a&nbsp;</span><span>week's time.</span><br />
<span>HELP</span><br />
<span>So a kind friend (who is an I.T software engineer)&nbsp;</span><span>had a go at it, many hours later he confirmed that he could
 not get it&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>to upgrade to full version of 10 or go down to 8.0/8.1. He advised that&nbsp;</span><span>I will have to buy a copy of 8 and upgrade
 to 10.</span><br />
<span>Then I telephone&nbsp;</span><span>Microsoft, set up a time for them to ring me back, which they did and I&nbsp;</span><span>was
 told that it was my fault for stopping the automatic updates and&nbsp;</span><span>not having my original production I.D for 8.0, goodbye!</span><br />
<span>So I have had&nbsp;</span><span>to buy a new copy of 8.0, wipe my harddrive and install 8.0, then&nbsp;</span><span>update
 to 8.1, this took almost a day.</span><br />
<span>That's how Microsoft will make&nbsp;</span><span>you pay for your copy of Windows 10!</span><br />
<span>The quickly I go over to Chrome&nbsp;</span><span>the better....</span></p>

<p>1: Start | All Programs | Startup Folder. Remove any program listed there you do not want to start.</p>
<p>2: Start | Run and type in <strong>msconfig</strong>. Under the Startup Tab, uncheck any program there you do not want to run at startup.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Recovery Disk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raineydawn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Recovery Disk</h2>
                    <p>How do I create a simple recovery disk? I have windows 10 home edition. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/how-to-create-recovery-disk-for-windows-10/86854cb6-6cc9-487b-b5d2-5c3faa65912c">
this thread</a> and it's confusing to me... everything seems to linked to creating a USB. I've downloaded the Media Creation Tool&nbsp; but seems pointless because it says "installing windows 10" - I already have windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still confused on how to create a simple recovery disk - that's all I want to create right now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help in advance! </p>

            <p>Thanks Ramesh but the article doesn't help _ I tried that earlier and again just now. I can't hit the next button at all. It wants a USB flash drive -- I have a blank disk in the CD burner with no option to use it. I just want to use a back-up disk.
