<h2>            Xbox Live Rewards Pesquisa de Agosto </h2>
                    
<p>Bom dia.</p>
<p>Em relação a pesquisa de Agosto, no segundo item da pesquisa, seria interessante haver a opção de Whatsapp. Muitos jogadores participam de grupos onde realizamos troca de informação. Além de Facebook e twitter, vejo whatsapp como uma grande ferramenta de
 divulgação.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Sound malfunctions - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sound malfunctions</h2>
                    <p>Good day,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've&nbsp;been using Skype for several years on my laptop almost daily with no problems. After installing the latest update, a few issues have arisen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, the individual whom I'm&nbsp;conversing with on Skype can hear all of MY sounds. For example, if I am watching a YouTube video, they will clearly be able to hear every bit of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, my audio tends to cut out randomly. Sometimes if I talk louder then usual, my microphone would cut out all the sound and stop working for a few seconds before returning back to its normal state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any suggestions on how to fix these annoying occurrences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>MichelleLof</p>

            Hi MichelleLof,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing.
<br />
<br />If you are using speakers, what I believe is occuring is that with the new change of sensitivity of your microphone that came with the new update, the other persons audio picks up all these sounds, which then goes back to you and this keeps bouncing and creates the effect that the other person cannot hear what you're saying next for a couple of seconds. I'll list some possible solutions:-
<br />
<br />
<br />Decrease Microphone Sensitivity (so it picks up less sound)
<br />1. Launch Skype
<br />2. Click on your profile picture at the top of the screen
<br />3. Scroll down and Select 'Settings'
<br />4. Select 'Audio &amp; Video' 
<br />5. Under Microphone, Uncheck 'Automatically adjust microphone settings' if it is already checked, and set it to a smaller value than 10. Alternatively, if it was already unchecked, you can check it to see if it helps.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, you can download Skype for Windows Desktop instead and see if the issue is happenning on there:-
<br /><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a>
<br />
<br />Select the drop-down arrow and select 'Get Skype for Windows' instead of 'Get Skype for Windows 10'. 
<br />
<br />I hope that one of these solutions will help.       
        </p>

<p>Hi Dan thank you for taking the time to help me resolve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I already had Skype for Windows already downloaded, but for good measure I did download it again and still no result. I also did try to set my&nbsp;microphone settings to different levels under 10, but all failed to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not quite sure what to do now, if you could help me find another solution it would be much appreciated.<br />

            We should try the reverse application and see if there is any difference. I'd suggest that you try the Skype for Windows 10 App, which can be found in the Microsoft Store and come back with the results. It is not essential that you delete the Desktop Version before using the App version.

<p><span>Hi Mrs.Allen79,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers!</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which version of internet explorer (IE) are you running on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>Script error messages are displayed by Internet Explorer when there is a problem with the JavaScript
 or VBScript code on the website you are viewing. Occasionally a script error can be caused by an error in downloading a webpage, but
<strong>more often it is an error in the webpage itself. </strong>In most cases,
<strong>you can ignore them</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To be sure it isn't an error in downloading, refresh the webpage (click the
<span><strong>Refresh Current Page</strong></span> button). If the error persists, and you are not a developer testing a website, you should click
<span><strong>No</strong></span> to ignore the error.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To avoid script errors in the future, you can turn off script debugging and notifications in Internet
 Explorer.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Turn off script debugging and notifications in Internet Explorer
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Script error debugging and notifications are turned off by default. If they have been turned on, follow these steps to turn them off again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open Internet Explorer by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Internet Explorer.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the Tools button, and then click Internet Options.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click the Advanced tab, select the Disable script debugging (Internet Explorer) and Disable script debugging (Other) check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. Clear the Display a notification about every script error check box, and then click OK.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may want to try the following steps to fix the magic jack issue:<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
Step 1: </span></strong><span>Firstly, update the software provided by the device manufacturer.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update - Looping - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tensileattic918  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update - Looping</h2>
                    <p>I let my computer run over night for an update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wake up to a blue screen asking for a keyboard layout. Then it gives me options to rollback, use another operating system and troubleshoot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some options have me looping back to this blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Others bring me to the desktop, but it is black with only the recycling bin. I can't access any of my files or the internet. However, I can run Windows + R. I typed in msconfig and tried setting it to start up in safe mode, but it loops me back to the blue
 screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any restore points, so system restore doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what it's asking for for the system image recovery. It tells me it cannot find a system image on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the command prompt, it says at the top, "not enough memory resources are available to process this command."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried sfc /scannow, but it says Windows Resource Protection could not perform requested operations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I select "go back to the previous version", there are four Windows options - Windows Rollback, Windows 10 Vol. 2, another Windows 10 Vol. 2, and Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist.</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Choose Troubleshoot Options, then Advanced, then More, then Go back to old Version.
<br />
<br />If it won't go back this means that the User profile has corrupted and cannot start, the reason you're seeing a blank desktop.  It will also not Reset so you only option may be to Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Your files should be in your old user account at C:\Users or archived by the installer at C:\Windows old.  Here's how to rescue them from Command Prompt if they are not properly backed up:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then More, then Go back.  If that fails try Troubleshoot Options &gt; Reset.  
<br />
<br />If all repairs from onboard and booted media options fail then choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

<p>Thank you for responding!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify before I do anything because I'm not tech-savvy:</p>
<p><br />
I'm not worried about backing up my files or programs because they're already saved on an external hard drive, which I had bought in the very beginning when I first got this computer for occasions such as this. Also, I have disc for my TP-Link Wireless USB
 stick, so that should be fine as well.<br />
</p>
<p>I just bought the 8gb flash drive and need to install the Media Creation Tool for another PC.<br />
<br />
So, I make sure everything is unplugged. Plug in the flash drive. I have an Asrock, thus I'm pressing down F11 or Del + F2 when I boot up my PC?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, a screen will pop up and I choose UEFI if applicable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I don't have a product key for Windows because it was Factory installed when I got the computer. And so, I remove all the partitions that will show. I can click next because it will automatically create partitions for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, connect to the internet, turn on System Restore, check Device Managers for missing drives, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<li>Right-click My Computer and select Properties</li><li>Press the "Windows logo" key and the "Pause/Break" key simultaneously</li><li>Type "winver" (without quotes) in the Search box and press Enter</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Did you get any error messages when you installed the printer?</li><li>How did you install the printer?&nbsp; Did you download the appropriate Windows 7 driver from Dell?</li><li>How is the printer connected (USB, parallel, or networked)?<br />
</li><li>Does the printer appear in Devices and Printers without any warning icons?</li><li>Assuming the answer to the question 4 is Yes, right click, select "Printer properties" and then select the "About" tab (unfortunately, not all printer drivers include the "About" tab; post back if yours is missing).</li></ol>

    <title>Starting Problem in Windows 10, grub issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jayshil2327  say:</h3>
<h2>            Starting Problem in Windows 10, grub issue</h2>
                    <p>Dear there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For long times, I used both Windows 10 and Ubuntu on my laptop using dual boot. But, now I have no longer need of Ubuntu. So I decided to uninstall it.&nbsp; I had installed ubuntu by partitioning my disk. So, what I did was just delete those partitions and extend
 my&nbsp;C drive, and thus mixed up those partitions with C drive. It works better here, but there is a&nbsp;little problem every time I started my laptop. They show a message like the following picture,</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c3e65e2-873f-4e51-855a-3f37c7d986f2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c3e65e2-873f-4e51-855a-3f37c7d986f2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It shows that there is some problem regarding 'grub'. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And then I have to write 'exit' command to close that window. Then opens the boot manager, which shows like,</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a15051d-a8b8-4ec3-9eb7-4b80b6c4d001?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a15051d-a8b8-4ec3-9eb7-4b80b6c4d001?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And after selecting the option, 'Windows Boot Manager' in it, finally my windows get started. How to fix it so my windows start automatically?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it have to do with the partition style, MBR or GPT? If so, then my disk has GPT partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi Jayshil2327,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To uninstall GNU GRUB you must delete all Ubuntu partitions or reformat it with a Windows file system. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the <strong>Start </strong>menu and select <strong>
Disk Management</strong>.</li><li>Find the Ubuntu partition.</li><li>Be sure you have the correct partition</li><li><strong>Right-click</strong> the partition and delete or reformat it with a Windows file system.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>I had already deleted all those partitions of ubuntu, and then mixed up them into C drive by 'Extend Volume' option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But still, I think, grub didn't uninstalled, that is why I ended up with that grub screen every time I start windows.</p>
<p>

<h3> vincent94  say:</h3>
<h2>            hptsvr.exe Error, Image Mastering API upon Start Up</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Everytime I start my PC I am greeted by three errors. One says "hptsvr.exe has encountered a problem and needed to close" another that says "Image Mastering API has encountered a problem and needs to close" and another that says "this version of intel audio
 studio does not support the board detected." </p>
<p>Right now the PC is slower than ever and I have already installed all Windows XP updates, checked for viruses through Windows defender and Avast Free anti virus, run registry cleanup programs, and I have restarted the PC many times, but I still get these
 three problems and the slowest PC on the planet. </p>
<p>I built this PC recently, it has a Gigabyte GA-H67M motherboard, Intel i3 Sandy Bridge CPU, 4gb DDR3 and a Seagate 500gb 7200rpm hdd. I don't have a RAID config and my Windows XP license is genuine.
</p>
<p>Anyhelp would be greatly appreciated. </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hello Vincent,<br />
<br />
Since the current problem is unknown at it would take much work to diagnose it through text communication, I would like to ask you if you would like to accept remote support via
<a href="http://www.teamviewer.com/download/TeamViewer_Setup_en.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Teamviewer</a>.<br />
<br />
It is much easier for me to help you if I am at the computer at need and able to check everything real time. There will be too much to do to cover in text.<br />
<br />
I will check all areas of the computer for you, remove those error messages for sure, and go over optimization settings with you or anything else you would like your computer to have.<br />
<br />
Check out my email address on my <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/da17bac0-4e9f-48b1-8e15-b107eed04915">

<p>Well, this is what I wrote before: "I get error code 80070570 when I try to update my Windows 7 Professional with Service Pack 1 for x64 based systems, update KB9769<u>23</u>.", but I made an error that didn't help anybody help me.&nbsp; the update&nbsp;I can't install
 is actually update KB9769<u>32</u>.&nbsp; Sorry about the mistake!&nbsp; Any suggestions about what to do?&nbsp; It has happened about 10 times, now.&nbsp; Very frustrating!&nbsp; But I did get a helpful response from Posada--Thanks!&nbsp; (I tried out Methods 1 and 2--unfortunately, no
 success.)&nbsp; Hope this corrected explanation means something to anyone who has a solution.</p>

<h2>            How to make folders and shortcuts for Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Have been getting very frustrated just trying to do those simple things, have just bought a HP 2000 Notebook PC with Windows 8 and am unable to do those things, the booklet and Support Assistant were no help. I've uploaded many things from my old laptop
 to the internet and also have been downloading some programs that I also used before but they will only save it in one place, that's the download folder that was already there, it's under the favorites section. When trying to create a new folder there it won't
 let me, an icon says to go ctrl/shift/N to make a new folder but nothing happens, can make a sub folder in the downloads folder but don't want that, want to create different folders for my various things,
<u>can you make a</u> <u>new folder in the favorites section</u>? Also when downloading the sites won't let me save a picture in the pictures folder because it's in the Library section, what solution is there for these issues, just want to make some new folders,
 don't understand why something that simple cannot be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also as far as shortcuts go been having a problem making them, for instance if I want to make a shortcut for Yahoo it's saved in the start menu but can't make a shortcut from the link nor from the homepage of it, should be a two second process but it's far
 from that, any suggestions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help that can be given, sure I'll be coming back for more help once I start doing more on this laptop.</p>

<p>You're right, it should be and normally is simple, at least for most of those things.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For downloads, if you&nbsp;select 'save as' you can&nbsp;download the file&nbsp;to any folder. When the Downloads window is open you can preset the default download folder by clicking the Options link in the bottom left corner. (IE Tools- View Downloads)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think you may be having an issue with permissions. Logged on with administrator priviledges I am able to create folders almost anywhere my user account has access to, including Favorites.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like you are trying to use folders that were&nbsp;created under&nbsp;a different account name than the one you normally log in with. Windows can limit your access to those folders and files. Same thing can happen if you&nbsp;copy over folders/contents&nbsp;created&nbsp;with
 a different Windows OS or computer, in which case you need to&nbsp;re-assign ownership of them&nbsp;in Win8 to your log-on account.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try a program called Start 8 by Stardock... it's $5 with a 30 day free trial...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will restore most of the missing features you are used to having... almost like Win 7, with Win 8's features available as well... it will boot directly to the desktop if you wish...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then dealing with the other issues might be a little less frustrating</p>

            Most of the stuff I read says you can only do it for a specific application (memory sketchy). &nbsp;Certainly another
<i>feature</i> we'll have to work around. SO... here is what I do: &nbsp;(don't spend your $$)
<div><br />
<div>You can still create shortcuts on your desktop as before. Do that. &nbsp;Then drag (copy) it to the location you want the short cut to work. &nbsp;You'll have to grant admin&nbsp;privileges&nbsp;if you're in another account to do the copy.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just think; novice users can't miss something they've never had.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Live long and prosper.&nbsp;</div>

<p><u>can you make a</u> <u>new folder in the favorites section</u>?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Sort of.&nbsp;&nbsp; First you need to understand the implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Like IE Favorites Bar, the Favorites node in the Windows File Explorer Navigation pane&nbsp;is a label for something which is implemented by a directory called Links.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, let's open&nbsp; %USERPROFILE%\Links&nbsp;
 (which happens to be my default path in my Taskbar button).&nbsp;&nbsp; Somehow I already have a New folder in there.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure when I did that.&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, checking Favorites in the Navigation pane (which I usually never bother with), I don't see it; however, if
 I then click on the Favorites label, that puts Favorites into my WE Address bar as a breadcrumb node.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then clicking on the trailing link I can see New folder.&nbsp;&nbsp; And now that I have done that and done nothing with it the trailing link has disappeared!&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh.&nbsp;
 Because now AutoComplete has taken over and wants me to believe that Favorites isn't really what I found (Agreed.&nbsp; It isn't)&nbsp; so what I have there now is really IE's Favorites.&nbsp;&nbsp; YMMV.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quirks abound in this OS when you start exploiting its implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; }</p>

            as of now you can have or make the shortcut for the internet by downloading firefox. firefox is great 10 x faster than explorer 10 x more efficient, thier getting rid of explorer anyway. when u download firefox, you can add ur favorite spots to the bookmarks.

    <title>Visual Effects On Windows Crashing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aock  say:</h3>
<h2>            Visual Effects On Windows Crashing</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I originally got my computer I have about five years ago, the visual effects of it keep crashing ( the performance options shown in the picture attachment below ). I have tried requesting help on this over the years, and Googling it, but no one
 seems to ever have an answer as to why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hardware and software have both changed: this happened in windows 7, 8, and now 10. The performance options seem to crash back to the default settings no matter what I can be doing on my computer. It is not possible for me to recreate how they crash,
 too, and it is not happening because of an overload of ram or CPU usage. I could turn on my computer, the performance options work just fine, but then a second later they crash back to default, for example.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>I know how to turn them back on. I want to prevent them from always crashing back to the default settings.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Formatting has not worked. Changing hardware ( adding more ram, changing CPU, changing hard drives/adding more, changing my graphics card ) has not worked. Changing software has not worked. Creating another user account would not work. Updating my graphics
 driver has not worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help me?</p>

<p>Despite it actually having crashed over night while I was asleep, the earliest crash report for Explorer was a few days ago. There's warnings from today - actually from about seven minutes ago - but those are only from Adobe Acrobat Reader for some reason.
 So... it's not listing all the crashes here. My computer does not shut off, mind you, it only has explorer crash sometimes and my desktop often refreshes itself, sometimes not crashing when it does so.</p>

<p>I watched my desktop 10 minutes &amp; saw no refresh on its own, which would be a blinking of the icons. I did see my background slideshow. Yesterday, I set my Performance Options to look like yours, &amp; it has not reverted on its own as yet. For anyone else who
 wants to try: "<strong>START, Settings, System, System info, Advanced system settings, Settings (under Performance)</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the only difference between your setting &amp; "Let windows choose..." is these two...</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Is that all that happens when you "crash" - those two get unchecked? Is there another symptom?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't mean to minimize your problem, but I don't see a big difference with them checked or not. A slight shadow does appear under the mouse pointer. It does cause my icons to quickly blink once when I change the setting. But nothing is different about
 their appearance that I can see...</p>
<p>
</p><p>With "Adjust for best appearance" (they are checked)...</p>

            I'm not honestly sure what you're asking. The crash happens to me no matter what I'm doing, even if I'm not doing anything; it's happened on Windows 7, 8, and now 10. It crashes all of my performance options, no matter which ones are or are not checked,
 turning them all off: they all get unchecked.

<p>I'm not sure I'd call that a crash - sounds more like a settings change to me. That setting is achieved by selecting "Adjust for best performance" in Performance Options. It doesn't make a marked difference to the Desktop that I can see, but certain icons
 in File Explorer became plain. And certain text became granular, such as within the Performance Options requestor itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That sounds like something some kind of optimizer would want to do. Do you have such a thing running in the background or do you run one periodically?</p>
<p>

<p>Yes, it is a crash since the settings all turn off without me even doing anything to changing them at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, I do not use an optimizer and never have. I don't know what one is exactly, either. As I said so before, even after formats and hardware and software changes this keeps happening.</p>

<p>OK. Optimizers was just a thought. I remain unconvinced it is a crash, though, as the machine didn't go down &amp; a critical event wasn't recorded for it. Have you looked at the informational events carefully to see whether something happens on the days of
 your "crash"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I had an Adobe Acrobat warning, myself, on 8/30 at 8:13 PM, but was please to see it self-corrected in duplicate 5 minutes later...</p>

<p>If it's not a crash then what is it exactly? My desktop refreshes, sometimes my screen goes black ( on both monitors ), my icons all disappear on my taskbar and desktop, and then the settings are turned off.</p>

<p>
</p><p>On 8/31/17 : there was a warning from Adobe Acrobat Reader DC.</p>
<p>9/1/17 : A Battle.net Helper.exe critical event.</p>
<p>9/2/17 : Nothing listed at all.</p>
<p>9/3/17 : So far, two windows critical event hardware errors. This is from Overwatch crashing, but my desktop remained fine. This is the only event listed so far, as it is 2:29AM, and the day is young.<br />

    <title>Possible to configure Skype and Invoke to behave like a home phone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nvdkgm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Possible to configure Skype and Invoke to behave like a home phone system&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Currently, if someone calls you on your Skype Number all devices ring, but once you pick up the call is locked to that device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to configure your Skype Number/Skype settings to use the H/K Invoke as the base speakerphone system and have your smartphone behave as the cordless handset? This way you can transfer the call between devices, have multiple participants/sources
 in conference, put the call on/off speaker between the Invoke and a device, use the Android app to dial but begin the call on the Invoke, etc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it isn't possible this would be my feature suggestion.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although Skype Number is intended to receive an incoming call, it isn't a replacement for your regular landline or mobile service. You can only have 1 active call on one device. It wouldn't be possible to set up your Skype Number to have an active call on
 multiple devices at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your feedback as this may improve the experience of using Skype service.</p>

    <title>WMP doesn&#39;t detect my device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jesus56gon  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMP doesn&#39;t detect my device</h2>
                    <p>My computer does <strong>detect</strong>&nbsp;my Smartphone, connected with USB cable, but
<strong>WMP doesn't</strong>.</p>
<p>When I plug it with USB cable,&nbsp;WMP says: "Connect a device" but it is already connected because the computer has installed the drivers needed and mounted 2 disks: F:\ and K:\.</p>
<p>Therefore, I can see these 2 drives and the files inside and I can copy music, videos, etc... but<strong> I cannot sync music with WMP.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked in other&nbsp;XP and W7 computers and it worked:&nbsp;My device was detected and syncing&nbsp;started. However this doesn't happen in my W7 computer where I have all my music Library and Playlists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;must admit that syncing worked in my W7 computer until aprox. 2 months ago. Changes since then are: Installation of new version of Norton Internet Security and probably updates on W7 with automatic Windows Update.</p>
<p>There has been a remarkable change on my phone: As I wanted to use an external SD card to increase MB used for music, I&nbsp;deleted all my music and playlists. Afterwards, when&nbsp;trying to sync everything again with my new external SD card WMP said: Device is
 not connected :-(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WMP used is version 12.0.7601.17514 on W7 Home Premium</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your help will be welcome.</p>

            Hi Sengupta,<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
I disabled Norton Internet Security with no sucess.<br />
<br />
However I saw in another Windows Community thread a solution that works for me too.<br />
Was the reply given by Murph570.<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-pictures/windows-media-player-doesnt-recognize-mp3-player/65fab396-4ba0-44f2-b3a5-7136b1ceb590.<br />
<br />
The solution was to delete c:\User\"my login"\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Media Player and let WMP to rebuild it again.<br />
<br />
Thanks anyway for your help<br />

<p>please download and run the <strong>System Update Readiness Tool for Windows 7 (KB947821) [April 2010]</strong> and check if you can install the update.</p>
<p>After you run the tool a file called checkSUR.log is created in the folder C:\Windows\Logs\CBS. Please open it and look if the tool was able to fix all errors.</p>

<h2>            Windows Slow 10, slow&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Well on the start it was, lets say OK, even Microsoft advertise Windows 10 so agressive, people will think it is so good and compatible with everything product, but it is not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Toshiba Satellite C850D-11F, original RAM 2 Gb, plus I added&nbsp;4 Gb extra, and with Windows 8.1 no problem, it was a fast and responsive, it was "almost" the same when I installed Windows 10, but now after few updates mostly from Microsoft, when I write
 forms in web site comments or&nbsp;something like that, it stuck and it start to block completely for a while, and than after few minutes&nbsp;it respond a litle bit and etc, but in general it so slow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is obvius something wrong. The problem is also that&nbsp;my old Windows folder is deleted, so least for now I am stuck with&nbsp;terrible Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So anybody have a solution to made Windows "Slow" 10 not so slow&nbsp;or I should get rid of Windows 10 by reinstaling completely laptop from start?</p>

    <title>Signing my daughter in on her own profile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kubie578935  say:</h3>
<h2>            Signing my daughter in on her own profile</h2>
                    
<p>I'm so angry right now I can't think straight. I'm sure the answer is here somewhere, but I'm too busy gnashing my teeth and banging my head against the back wall to find it. Perhaps someone with a cooler head can help me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an account with Xbox Live. On this account are also my wife and two daughters. Last night my daughter tried to use her profile to play some Halo Reach with me. Since she hadn't used the account in a while, I had to go online and receive an e-mail
 with a code to be entered into the Xbox as a security measure. If you ask me, this is already too much. I mean, is there really that much profile theft that I should have to deal with this as often as I do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, that's not nearly frustrating enough to get my point across. We entered the code last night and had a wild time shooting up Covies, searching for Fuel Rod Cannons, and occasionally punching one another. Today comes along and my other daughter figures
 she'll sign in with her profile to play with her sister. That's when the real stress began. If I had any hair I'd have pulled it all out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, as soon as she tries to sign in, she is taken to a screen where she is forced to sign in with an e-mail and password. She obviously doesn't have this information (she's 10) so I put it in for her. The system responded that either I had the
 wrong password, or the e-mail address associated with this account wasn't valid. My eye! Of course it's valid! My daughter and I were just playing on it last night! Then it told me to go to a website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to the website, saw my account information and figured I'd just have it send another code to my e-mail. No such option was offered. (Gnashing teeth begins.) So I VERY RELUCTANTLY agreed to change my password. Since Microsoft doesn't let users re-use
 old passwords (understandable) I was very reluctant to change it. Passwords in this house are considered family secrets. We've learned the hard way that changing passwords any more often than necessary leads to huge problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I finally agreed to go ahead and change the password. I went back to the Xbox, tried to sign my daughter in, and used the new password. It didn't work. I found myself doing my own personal impression of Sasquatch in a Jack Link's commercial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I doing something wrong? I tried to figure it out but I was already angry at the security measure itself. Problems with the security measure nearly made my head explode right off the top of my neck. I needed it dumbed down to the point where there was
 an option that said, "Child's account requires e-mail and password." Reading through a bunch of options which are not related would only have exacerbated my emotional state.</p>
<p>Why can't my daughter play Halo on her own profile? We paid for a year up front last winter. As far as I'm concerned, that means we should be good until next winter. Having to verify she is who she says she is involves more than enough frustration without
 the problems associated with that verification. Surely there must be an easier way. Meanwhile, I have to explain to my daughter that just because an account is paid in full doesn't mean you can use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please forgive me for the angry nature of this letter. We're an Xbox family, and we have been for years now. It's hard not to feel betrayed, and the accompanying stress of feeling powerless to do anything about it can drive a loving father mad. Why isn't
 the password working? I just changed it. Why couldn't I have simply entered a code like I did last night for my other daughter? Why are these security measures there in the first place? Is Microsoft worried people will steal profiles while we're not looking?
 Can't you tell if the same profile is being used in two places (or on two Xboxes) simultaneously? I shouldn't have to put my daughter through this every time she goes a few weeks without playing videogames.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you know the answer, please help me. Writing this has calmed me down quite a bit, so I'm willing to try again. Please respond&nbsp;in case I don't figure it out. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm sorry you are going through all these issues. I couldn't help but laugh at the Sasquatch comment but I do see where you are coming from. Microsoft does a security check every once in a while because hackers never sleep and they just want to make sure
 that you are who you say you are. </p>
<p>They have posted some troubleshooting which I'm posting below to see if these steps help. If not please post back so we can find out where the problem lies so we can try to fix it.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm going to assume here that you can login to the account having this issue on Xbox.com? If so, please read and try and follow the directions below, let's see if we can get this sorted out for you. You'll need to follow the directions below from the account
 that's having the issue signing in.<br />
<br />
Please visit this page&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://account.live.com/Proofs/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong><span>. When you're logged in on top, do you see "Your account is protected by two-<span>step</span>&nbsp;verification."?</span><br />
<br />
If you've recently set this up on your Microsoft Account then you'd need to generate an App Password. This can be done towards the bottom of that page linked above. Once you have the App Password, you'll want to use this password to login to the Xbox 360 and
 download your profile on the Xbox 360.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
<span>If you don't have&nbsp;<span>2</span>-<span>Step</span>&nbsp;Verification turned on, then try to do the following in the exact order they are written:</span><br />
<br />
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Delete your profile (profile only)</a></strong>,&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clear
 your system cache (3 times in a row)</a></strong>,&nbsp;<strong>restart your console</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>download your profile.<br />
</strong><br />
Let us know if that worked out for you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I keep folder settings the same when moving to a different removable device&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I use Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; I have nearly all of my cd collection on a hard drive.&nbsp; The cd's are in different folders, such as 1970, Country, etc.&nbsp; Within each of these folders are the copies of the cd.&nbsp; I have manually set each folder setting to display
 size and date modified.&nbsp; I use the date modified to put the songs in correct order.&nbsp; I started running out of space, so I move a couple categories to a new external hard drive, and have lost the date modified setting in each of the cd folders!&nbsp; It also did
 keep the song size either.&nbsp; Is there a way to keep the folder settings when moving them to different drives?&nbsp; I really dont like the thought of having to reformat each folder...there are over 1000 cds so far!</p>

                    I am trying to save a .pdf file to a folder in my local user folder, but it says that I do not have permission to do so.&nbsp; My user is set up as administrator, so I thought I would have full access to manage any/all folders and files on the computer.&nbsp; How
 can I manage my user profile so that I can have full control for all files/folders on my computer?&nbsp; Thank you.

<p><span>Go to C:\Users\ and check that your user account and the Administrators group have full access to your profile folder.</span></p>
<p><span>See the “Do I have to apply permissions to share my files with other users on my computer?“ section on the following link:<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-to-know-before-applying-permissions-to-a-file-or-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-to-know-before-applying-permissions-to-a-file-or-folder</a></span></p>
<p><span>Although you should be able to save files to the folder, it may be best to save them to your desktop or one of the libraries for easy access.</span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Method 1<span>:</span></strong> If you have enabled any proxy connection on the computer, I would suggest you to disable it and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span>You may follow the steps to do so:<br />
a) Open Internet Explorer on the desktop.<br />
b) Click on Tools icon option on the top right corner.<br />
c) Select Internet Option from the list.<br />
d) Click on Connection tab.<br />
e) Click on LAN Settings.<br />
f) Uncheck the box which says “Use a Proxy Server for your LAN".<br />
g) Click on OK.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: The store app uses https instead of http which is used by other apps, so in order for the SSL handshake to proceed, the clock on the client and server needs to be correct.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps below to check if the date and time are set correctly.</span></p>
<p><span>a) In the Start screen type “Date and Time”, and click on date and time settings.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Check if the date and time is set correctly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 3</strong>: If issue persists, I would suggest you to re-register the store app and check if it helps. Refer the suggestion provided by “<strong>Luis Cantero</strong>”
 from this MSDN blog:</span></span></p>
