<h2>            Minecraft Update Villager Bugs - Caution Players&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On April 23 Minecraft updated and I noticed that in my village that I started about 2 months ago, the librarian and butcher seemingly vanished, leaving two bugged villagers that I cannot interact with and are still in the original clothing. The villagers
 also do not seem to head inside as once scripted at night or during a storm. Aside from being annoying, these things were mostly manageable and I was able to wrangle all of the villagers into safety. The only other issue I see is that they were all reset to
 level 0-1. This was also frustrating, but I still had all of the emeralds I had acquired so, again, mostly manageable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On April 24, I went into the chapel where I had fenced in the cleric to interact with him, and he had been replaced with a fisherman? I searched my town several times over and could not find the cleric anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also had problems with my iron golems glitching out of the town, despite being fenced in along the entire perimeter with a 3 block gap between fenceline and all other objects inside and out of the village.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are: is anyone else experiencing these behavior quirks of the villagers with regard to sundown and storms? What recourse do I have to resolve my missing cleric issue? Is anyone else reporting runaway iron golems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your consideration and assistance!</p>

<p>They changed the villager AI drastically, its not a bug. Legacy worlds (pre-update) were hit pretty hard because of this update, as the update included new types of villagers and new roles for them they kind of broke down the old worlds. If you have the
 world set on infinite, pack up and go find a new village and I could guarantee you all the new feature will be there and not broken right as rain. They don't go inside at night unless a zombie is actually in the area...and rain doesn't bother them anymore
 on occasion. Its different from village to village in the test runs I did of it between the official update and the beta test.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its not broken, I swear...its just "new." New can be hard to cope with sometimes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new villagers need to have a bed, food and a work space for them to have your village thrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clerics needs a brewing stand as a workplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fisherman needs a barrel.</p>
<p>Farmer needs a composter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Butcher needs a grindstone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Librarians needs a lectern.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shepard needs a loom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The list goes on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of the players i play with on a realm is very happy with this update.&nbsp;</p>

            I haven't gotten on my world yet since the patch but I expect to have some curious things happening too. I know the villagers are a lot more complex than before so it could be as simple as giving them the things they need as the others have stated. I also
 remember that a lot of times in order to find the new patch material you often have to spawn in new chunks by going to places you haven't been before in order to see the new things. Im sure that adjusting what the villagers have would help though.

<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:<br />
<br />
</span>1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <span><strong>Scanner</strong></span> tab, make sure the the
<span><strong>Perform&nbsp;quick scan</strong></span> option is selected and then click on the
<span><strong>Scan</strong></span> button to start scanning your computer
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malware<span><strong>
</strong></span>removal process.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the
<span><strong>Show Results</strong></span> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <span><strong>Remove Selected</strong></span> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.<br />

1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>

<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:

            <p>Hello No Knitter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting in the Microsoft community. It is a pleasure for us to have the opportunity to assist you.&nbsp; From the description, I understand that you are not able to&nbsp;choose from the drop down menu of&nbsp; a certain website.&nbsp; The drop down menu shows up
 and quickly disappears before you can choose from the list. I want to apologize for the troubles. I can only imagine how this is annoying. I'm glad to help and guide you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin with, can you provide a little more details on that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this happening on a specific website? Can you share so we can test it?</li><li>Are you using the desk top or metro version of IE?</li><li>Have you tried on different websites?</li><li>Does using the compatibility mode help?</li><li>Do you have all updates installed? </li></ol>
<p>Thank you for coming back with these info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>

 wrong with my computer, any time I turn it on I get a similar message. I have noticed however, that the last few digits of the error message change. The error message looked something like this:</p>

<p>I would try Safe Mode before msconfig.exe, much quicker and you just have to reboot when done.</p>

 you can do to try and isoalte the problem.&nbsp; First, try to get into&nbsp;Safe Mode&nbsp;or&nbsp;"Safe Mode with Networking" &nbsp; Get into Safe mode by tapping the "F8" key when you see the Manufacture's stuff.&nbsp; Don't tap it to fast, you can cause a keyboard error.&nbsp; You can even
 tap it a few timee before the Manuf. screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; If it works it will give you a menu, pick Safe mode off of that.&nbsp; See how the computer works in Safe mode.&nbsp; You will not have very good graphics but it is usuable.</span></p>

<h2>            Strange Skype behavior</h2>
                    <p>I recently downloaded and installed&nbsp;and update &nbsp;on my MacBook Pro running on version 10.14.1) &nbsp;that came to my email, and left it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mystery 1: Today, I tried calling an overseas number (as usual), clicked on Contacts...and nothing. No matter what I did, Contacts would not open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mystery 2: Next, I went to check on my iPhone and my iPad; Contacts opened as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mystery 3: for years, I have had the plan that allows Skype to automatically re-charge my account with a specific amount: today, I tries to make a call using my iPhone and a message came up telling me that I do not have enough funds and that I needed to
 purchase</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mystery 4: I tried the same exact operation calling the same phone number, using my iPad..it worked as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas, please?</p>

<p>Hi Emile,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked your Skype account, the auto top up option for Skype credits is active and seems to be working fine. Your credits are also enough to make calls to phone numbers. I am thinking if some of your device is signed in to a different Skype account.
 In this case, I need you to make sure if you are seeing your Skype credits balance for each devices, you must be able to view the current balance once you sign in regardless of any device. In the event that you won't be able to see the credits on your iPhone,
 kindly check if you are signed in to the same account with your iPad. Let me know if you have updates.</p>

<h3> cyber chaos crew  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 x64 compatibility&#47;support for Yamaha 01X audio interface</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this <a href="http://usa.yamaha.com/products/music-production/interfaces/01x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Yamaha 01X audio interface</a> with a <a href="http://download.yamaha.com/search/detail/?site=usa.yamaha.com&amp;language=en&amp;category_id1=16244&amp;category_id2=16268&amp;product_id=100004&amp;asset_file_language=EN&amp;asset_id=52028" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows XP x64 driver</a> that won't work on Windows 10 x64.<br />
</p>
<p>I've tried&nbsp;Windows XP SP2 compatibility, using the 1394 OHCI Legacy Driver, a FireWire adapter with Texas Instruments chipset instead of VIA, even turned off Driver Signature Enforcement and signed the drivers manually, but Windows won't establish the mLAN
 connection with the device. It works in Windows 7 x64 and its usable but very unstable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an official <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/yamaha01x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Yamaha 01X group on Facebook</a> currently with 772 members, someone reported having connected the interface successfully with a method similar to the one I described above, but the primary goal of the Yamaha 01X owners community is to either get Windows 10
 x64 support for the existing Windows XP x64 driver, or get a new driver written that will let this mLAN audio interface seamlessly operate in Windows 10 x64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a poll pinned to the top of the Facebook group page&nbsp;gauging the interest in trying to get new drivers written and inquiring people about how much they would pledge to have someone write and deliver a new driver. So far 141 members promised to pledge
 a total of $9630 for both Windows 10 x64 and Mac OSX drivers, and we are already contacting programmers that could be interested in writing them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would Microsoft be interested in collecting half of the pledged fee to work on compatibility/support for the existing Yamaha 01X Windows XP x64 driver, in a way that it would provide seamless operation in Windows 10 x64?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time, looking forward to hear from you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Miguel Costa</p>

</p><p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(EDIT May 20, 2017)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've managed to mLAN the interface by manually signing mLanBus.sys, mLanMIDI.sys &amp; mLanStrm.sys driver files after disabling Driver Signature Enforcement on admin Command Prompt and Windows Advanced Startup Options. It is operating flawlessly on Windows
 10 x64 with the Windows XP x64 driver. </p>

<p>
</p><p>At first I thought Microsoft was deliberately making it harder for their OS customers to use legacy hardware, but before jumping into the Anti-Windows/Anti-Microsoft bandwagon I've read more about Windows Driver Signature Enforcement and learned that it's
 a preventive measure against malware, and that only drivers that have been sent to Microsoft for signing will load into the Windows kernel.<br />
<br />
This official Yamaha 01X Windows XP x64 driver obviously wasn't signed by Microsoft to be used with Windows 10 x64, but since it can operate flawlessly in the operative system here's my question: Can Microsoft sign and allow it to be loaded into the Windows
 10 x64 kernel? It would make the 800 Facebook group members and all the other Windows 10 x64 &amp; Yamaha 01X owner's life easier, and spare us the trouble of having to disable Driver Signature Enforcement to manually sign the driver. It's a task that some users
 have trouble performing, and having DSE disabled might not only make their OS vulnerable but also prevent them from running applications that require DSE to be enabled:</p>

            I am proud owner of O1X, but disappointed by the way Yamaha treated us in this matter. With Windows 10, we all see new possibility for using the O1X. What is the current status?

<p>Anything that will go beyond the current maximum of 4 windows on one screen as used with the combination of the 'win' + 'arrow' keys. E.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to define layouts, e.g. 3x3 or 4x4 windows etc.</li><li>Vertical smart resizing of windows (currently available horizontally: changing the width of 1 of 2 windows with 50% width each, the size is adjusted for both windows. The feature is shown as a thick gray bar when resizing)</li><li>Moving windows as a group</li><li>...</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to a more plastic idea of what I am talking about: There is a software called
<a href="https://www.nurgo-software.com/products/aquasnap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
AquaSnap </a>which comes close to what I am looking for.</p>
<p>I just cannot fathom why such features would not be included in an OS bearing the very name 'Windows'... is it a patent problem?</p>
<p>Since large 4k Displays are on the rise, such a feature would - in my humble opinion - hugely increase productivity.<br />
</p>
<p>An answer by a Microsoft representative would be greatly appreciated. :-)</p>

<p>Hi Fernando,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your answer and recommendations.</p>
<p>I sincerely doubt that first level support via the phone will have a clear answer to this question, though.
</p>
<p>This to me is more of a development topic rather than a support issue. Am I looking at this the wrong way?<br />

            No you are not looking at it the wrong way.  You have good points and is definitely a development topic.  However, like I mentioned, we are not Microsoft employees nor have access to any of their systems or contacts.
<br />
<br />The number is not tier 1 support, but rather customer support.  They might point you in the right direction.  If I could do so, I would definitely do so.

<p><span>Hi Kevin:</span></p>
<p><span>Depending on the forum your working in (we can’t support others) the “Cut”, “Copy”, “Paste” commands are used mostly the same. As for as how to do it with
 in the forum you’re talking about, you would want to contact there forums support group.</span></p>
<p><span>Basic Instruction:</span></p>
<p><span>“Cut” = Move, if you right click on something in a computer and click “Cut” this is going to lift it from where it is, then when you chose the new location
 and right click and click “Paste” this is going to put it down there.</span></p>
<p><span>“Copy” = to reproduce, to copy, to make a copy of. Following the same instructions above except clicking “copy” instead of “Cut”.</span></p>
<p><span>“Paste” is to put it down, to place here.</span></p>
<p><span>“Edit” is to edit a document or a setting.</span></p>
<p><span>If it helps, there are books on computer terms that will help you. It’s what a lot of us started out with.</span></p>
<p><span>I do hope this helps, thank you for your post.</span></p>

 to even enter that playlist.&nbsp;&nbsp;[/quote]Ehhhh I wouldn't say that. MLG is a VERY small niche in the community. Even Frankie has stated that while being interviewed. 343i realizes that the vast (and I mean VAST) majority of players are in no way related to or
 supporters of MLG standards. Most of the gameplay changes are coming from feedback of the community and playtesters (only a small group of which are MLG), so to say that most of the changes are coming from MLG standards is a big exaggeration.</p>
<div>~</div>
<div>The only example I really need here to back that up with evidence is the new CTF where you can no longer drop the flag. A lot of MLG players (and wannabes alike) are infuriated by that. Another example is being able to throw the oddball/bomb.</div>
<div>~</div>
<div>But yes, there will most likely be an MLG playlist if it's being debuted at MLG Dallas before the game even releases.</div>

<p>You mean flag juggling? 343i hasn't exactly told us their reasoning behind the change. The only explanation we've gotten so far was from BS Angel in either the last bulletin (or the one before, not sure which) was that Halo 4's CTF is not the same CTF as
 previous Halo's. It's a "brand new" game mode now. So that could be taken as this is 343's version of CTF, not Bungie's. They're starting a new era of Halo, and revamping and evolving game modes. It's a weird explanation, but that's how BS Angel explained
 it.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>However, I believe it was also stated by a 343i employee that a lot of features can be turned on and off basically with the flick of a switch. Similar to Reach, they can change the game rapidly with playlist updates rather than needing to roll out a gigantic
 update to fix things which aren't working. So if CTF turns out to be horrible and everybody hates it and starts flooding 343's forums with CTF complaint threads, they'll probably be able to change it quickly.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>I'm just waiting to see if we'll be able to customize this in custom games. I'm sure the new CTF is great and I'm willing to give it a chance, but I like the current ("classic"?) version of it as well and would love the option to play it in customs if not
 matchmaking.</p>

<p>I don't like not being able to drop the flag but I can understand why they did it. I think there could have been a better way of keeping the players from juggling the flag.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>When you drop the flag while jumping it drops straight down instead of keeping the forward momentum.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>When you drop the flag it shows an animation of you planting (stabbing) it in the ground</p>

<p>MLG game modes are the most skillful game modes in Halo. Balanced out maps and combat system. Even Halo Reach MLG made it play like Halo 3 which I loved when I discovered it myself.[/quote]</p>
<p>I'll state the obvious here and say that this is only your opinion.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>I disagree about it being the most skillful mode. In my opinion, MLG game modes are the most
<strong><em>tactical</em></strong> modes in Halo. If you get a team of 4 randoms with god like accuracy (skill) and they match up against a team of 3 or 4 people with average accuracy but a far better strategy for map control (tactic), the team with the better
 map control will win. It doesn't take "skill" to spawn trap a team, it takes map control.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>I'm not sure if you've ever heard of Cosssta, but he played Arena on Reach quite a bit and was consistently in single digit Onyx with his team. I watched one of his games on YouTube (even though I really dislike him because he's an arrogant pr*ck) and I'll
 be honest, he really was not performing that well. He was losing 1-on-1 battles left and right, but getting lucky by ducking behind cover or being saved by his team mates often. However, his team got great map control. He made it to the back of their base
 (this was a symmetrical map) while his 3 team mates were set up elsewhere. So when the enemy team would spawn, he'd immediately have an angle on them where he could put pressure on them and either spawn kill them or make them easy targets for his team mates.
 That's not skill, that's team work and tactical play.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>And if you play a game in Reach MLG and then switch over to Halo 3, Reach still feels absolutely nothing like it. It only incorporates a few Halo 3-esque aspects like bleed through and no bloom. But Reach still plays far differently.</p>

<h2>            computer will not go in to sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>My computer will act as if it is going to sleep - the monitor will fade to black and the computer will make a "click-off" sound - but the fan/lights are still on and it generally does not appear to be any different than the on state.</p>
<p>I can directly tie this issue to the installation of a new video card (Nvidia 8400 gs) as it was working before the installation. All drivers are up to date and the rest of my computer is responding normally.</p>
<p>Googling the issue recommended I set several devices in the Hardware Manager to not allow it to wake from sleep. This has been done with no effect.<br />
Also, several forums recommended alter the Power Options to make sure that media sharing cannot prevent sleep. This has also been done with no effect.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Since the issue started after the installation of the graphic card, I would suggest you to uninstall the video card and check if the issue persists. If the issue does not persist then
 you may have to get the card replaced. Also check if the issue persists after you install the graphic card in another computer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>You might not be able to put your computer to sleep for one or more of the following reasons:</span></strong><span>
<br />
<br />
The video card on your mobile PC doesn't support sleep. <b>Update the driver</b> for your video card, or check the information that came with your Computer about your video card and supported drivers.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>To update a video card driver.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</span></strong><span>
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Device Manager by clicking the <b>Start</b> button clicking <b>
Control</b> Panel, clicking <b>System and Maintenance</b>, and then clicking
<b>Device Manager</b>.‌ If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Device Manager, locate the <b>device</b> and then <b>double-click the device name</b>.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the <b>Driver tab</b>, and then <b>click update Driver</b> and follow the instructions.<br />
<br />
Check the link to manually re-install the drivers<br />
<br />
<b>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</b></span></p>

<h2>            How do I set Windows Mail as default email client&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I want to set <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Windows Mail </strong>
</span>as my default email client that opens when I want to send a file. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do <strong>NOT </strong>want Outlook to be the default program. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone into the "Default Programs" area and selected Windows Mail as my default, but windows continues to try to open Outlook if I try to send a file as an attachment from any program/app on my PC.&nbsp; &nbsp;(Outlook is not even configured with an email client
 on this PC).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to I tell windows to stop trying to use Outlook. It seems this should be simple.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is another way for you to set your preferred email client. You may follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Apps</strong> &gt; <strong>Default apps</strong> &gt; Scroll down; then, select
<strong>Set defaults by app</strong>.</li><li>Choose your preferred <strong>default program/app</strong>; then, click <strong>
Manage</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We would appreciate it if you could get back to us and provide us your feedback.</p>

<p>I see no setting called simply "apps"&nbsp; See screenshot.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f56538b-cdab-4253-be5c-2483877dd5aa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f56538b-cdab-4253-be5c-2483877dd5aa" /></a></p>
<p>But I went ahead and selected "set defaults by app" from here. Which brought me to the next screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b01fe17f-6b06-4461-9aa0-90d59cbbd880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b01fe17f-6b06-4461-9aa0-90d59cbbd880" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not see "manage" here.&nbsp; I did go ahead and try to set all defaults to "Windows Mail" but it doesnt help. Windows still tries to open outlook and then gives an&nbsp; error message because I havent set up outlook to any email account. But Windows Mail DOES
 have an associated email account. Windoiws just will not look for it when I try to send a file from a program or app.</p>

            Predictably that did nothing.&nbsp; Not to mention that there really is no way to "update" Windows Mail at least as far as I can see.&nbsp; That is done when you run windows update.&nbsp; Please get a tech on this that knows how to fix the problem. It shouldn't take
 days to fix a simple problem like this.

<p>For us to isolate your concern with Windows Mail, we suggest that you try to uninstall your Outlook application. Once your done, try using your Windows Mail and check if the issue still persists. If there is no issue, you may reinstall your Outlook again.</p>

<h2>            Ender dragon bug&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This might be how it supposed to be I don't know because I don't play minecraft on pc but anyway.&nbsp; I was making a castle in the end and even when I'm invisible the dragon will fly over to attack.&nbsp; I want him to do that but sometimes he will fly through my
 castle destroying it.&nbsp; I was wondering is it supposed to fly through blocks destroying them or will it be patched to fly around the blocks?</p>

<p>Hey sorry if there is a similar post but I've read similar posts about missing memory but none are quite like mine.</p>
<p>I have windows 7 Professional x64 and I bought another 4 gigs of memory.&nbsp; Before I upgraded I had all 4 gigs usable on my system.&nbsp; I called my mobo vendor about the memory remap option and he said it was a built in automatic option and that it was a windows
 problem to why i don't have all 8 gigs usable.&nbsp; I've went through alot of repair options and I just reinstalled Windows 7 and it still says 3.99GB usable of 8GB. Any ideas on how to solve this problem?</p>

                    <p>I have been trying to install Windows 10, on my Windows 7 laptop, continuously since it arrived. I've lost count of the number of times that I've restarted my laptop &amp; started again. Every time it stops saying I need to uninstall HotSpot Shield. I've looked
 &amp; all I could find was a shortcut to something called HSS Shield, which I uninstalled.
</p>
<p>There is nothing even remotely like HotSpot Shield in All Programs or in the 'Uninstall or change a program list.</p>
<p>The box has a button at the bottom which says 'Uninstall &amp; continue' &amp; when I click it, it changes to a button that says 'refresh' which when clicked, does nothing.</p>
<p>i'm at a loss. I've wasted a weekend achieving nothing! Please help!</p>

            I am having the same problem as Ruth and I have tried the fixes you suggested as did she and they don't work. I have also downloaded and run Microsoft Fixit. HotSpot Shield from Anchorfree is not listed, when I click on the "not listed" option I am asked
 to enter a product code, I don't have one as I don't know where the program is hiding. It is not in programs and features and I can't find it in my registry. If the windows 10 upgrade program can detect HotSpot Shield there must be a way to determine its location.&nbsp;

<p>I spent the whole weekend of 15th &amp; 16th of August trying to do all this. On Monday, I decided I needed Help! &nbsp;I tried contacting by chat &amp; got disconnected 3 times. Then I tried the Microsoft phone back option &amp;, eventually, got put through to a UK, Microsoft
 Technician, in India. He was very nice &amp; spent over 3 hours trying to get rid of HSS by remote assistance.We both decided that it was part of ExPat shield which he kept deleting &amp; it kept coming back everytime he restarted the PC. Eventually he said that he
 could not do it &amp; he made me an appointment for a specialist Microsoft technician, on Thursday 20/08/2015.</p>
<p>on Thursday, a lady technician phoned, from India, at about 2.30pm. She straight away went on remote assistance &amp; started working on my laptop. I watched her delete umpteen bits of Expat shield, from the registry. She used several pieces of software that
 she downloaded &amp; installed while I watched. About &nbsp;6.30pm a man technician phoned &amp; told me that the lady had finished her shift &amp; he was taking over. Eventually he phoned to ask me to click ok on a box that would put my password in everytime he restarted
 my laptop, so that he didn't have to keep phoning &amp; asking me to do it, as I wasn't watching all of the time.</p>
<p>At 9.30 pm approx, he phoned to tell me that He had deleted every trace of ExPat shield, &amp; therefore HotSpotShield, deleted my Antivirus Software, Avast, &amp; set up Windows defender to do the same job. He then said he had made my laptop work really well on
 Windows 7 (which, by the way I can't see any difference). He said he'd checked out my hardware &amp; noticed that I was using a pentium dual core processor. This information had been available since the beginning &amp; I actually told them the processor &amp; that my
 laptop had 4 gigabytes of RAM. He said that, as the processor was too old, I would not only be unable to download &amp; install Windows 10, but not to bother trying to do the same with Windows 8.1. so therefore, could he declare this problem resolved? I was really
 tired &amp; upset &amp; not thinking straight so I said "I suppose so". I regret this &amp; I'm getting more angry every day.</p>
<p>i have so many questions. I was under the impression that Microsoft wanted all the people still on Windows XP to start using Windows 10. Some of them will have single core, ancient processors! I was under the impression that, if you were running Windows
 7 or 8 you were entitled to the free upgrade!</p>
<p>i many more questions &amp; now, if I try to download &amp; install Windows 10, from the icon in the task bar, it just keeps saying "Working on it" forever. It's now 3days &amp; counting. I'd really like to know where I can complain about this? Above all, why did it
 take 10 hours to tell me this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry about the bit below. It was an accident which it won't let me delete!</p>
<p>
</p><p>at 9.30pm approx, he phoned to tell me that</p>

            <p>After posting above message I decided to try delving a little further and gained success in installing windows 10.</p>
<p>I looked in the win7os on the computer and found the HotSpot Shield folder in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Program files(x86 </span>) , I tried to delete this file but to no avail as the file was open elsewhere. I then did a quick search online and found a site that told me to go into Task manager which I did and found HotSpot shield.
</p>
<p>I ended the process then went back into Program files(x 86)and deleted the file, I then retried the windows 10 download with success. This worked for me so I hope this works for others.</p>

            <p>Thanks to another user, I found that the best and easiest fix is to download the sound driver from the computer manufacturer's website; example: I have an HP Elitebook, so I went to HP.com and loaded the sound driver for the model that I have and
 did a restart. The sound was instantly restored. Also, HP and other manufacturers must be used to this type of thing because they have an HP Support Assistant app, a free download, that can troubleshoot all your computer issues and specify action required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend this method to any user experience sound issues after Windows 10 upgrade. It works and it's a quick fix.</p>

<p>Windows 7 SP1 is provided in two ways, either as a full .ISO file download weighing in at 2.4 GBs or as an update available through Windows Update. The .ISO file contains SP1 code for different processor architectures such as x86, x86-x64 and Itanium systems.
 Because I have a mixture of 32 and 64 bit systems, I went with the .ISO file. Whichever method you choose, here are some tips for ensuring a smooth installation.</p>
</span>
<p><span>* Getting Windows Update errors with Windows 7 SP1? MS notes "inconsistencies," provides fix:
</span><a href="http://is.gd/22brle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://is.gd/22brle</span></a></p>
<span>
<p>* 1. Click on Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories, and right-click on Command Prompt.</p>
<p>2. Choose Run As and select an Administrator account.</p>
<p>3. At the command prompt, type net stop cryptsvc and wait for the service to stop.</p>
<p>4. Type CD\ and press Enter.</p>
<p>5. Type CD windows\system32 and press Enter.</p>
<p>6. Type ren catroot2 catroot3 and press Enter.</p>
<p>Other solutions:</p>
<p>1. Make sure you install the latest updates for Windows 7, your applications and device drivers. This can ensure a smooth experience I noticed, although Windows 7 SP1 is minor, you don’t want to take any chances. If you are updating through Windows Update,
 it also guarantees a smaller update since only missing patches will be applied.</p>
<p>2. Backup – you can never go wrong with backing up; this is something you should do often even when you are not making major changes to your computer. Windows 7 has made it very easy tobackup your computer . The built in system imaging and backup and restore
 center makes it convenient to back up the operating system and all your critical data. In fact, I used this to test the beta and RC releases of SP1 on my production system. This method carried its risks, but at least I knew my RTM installation was safely backed
 up and tucked away from pre-release code.</p>

<span>
<p>3. Don’t do it during a major project, if you have something you are working on at the moment on your computer or in the middle of an assignment or work related project which you might need your PC for, don’t install the Service Pack right away. Do it in
 your off time, such as on the weekend or when you know you can leave your PC while it installs itself automatically. My installation took over 2 hours.</p>
<p>4. This brings me to another point, which is, don’t install SP1 on a laptop on battery power, it’s a CPU intensive task and will use up most of your battery power. So make sure your laptop is connected to power. For desktop users, I strongly recommend you
 have a UPS connected, you just don’t know when the unexpected can occur. You might just be in the last lap of completing the 2 hour installation and lose power.</p>
<p>5. Disable your Antivirus, I remember installing the SP1 beta with Microsoft Security Essentials version 1 installed and received an error that my Antivirus is not compatible. Although this was resolved, your experience might vary. I haven’t experienced
 the issue in the RTM code although I am running Microsoft Security Essentials version 2. Someone reported receiving an error message about Forefront Client Security not allowing the Service Pack to install. The recommendation is to disable Forefront which
 is based on the same core scanning engine as MSE or make sure you at least have the latest version of Forefront client security installed.</p>
<p>6. Another thing you should do is a clean boot before installing the Service Pack, you can do this by:</p>
<p>* Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>* Accept User Account Control permission</p>
<p>* If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</p>
<p>* On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</p>
<p>* Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</p>
<p>* Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</p>
<p>* Click OK.</p>
<p>* When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>* After the computer starts, proceed with the installation.</p>
<p>7. Another task you should try is to check your hard disk for errors:</p>
<p>* Click Start</p>
<p>* Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD</p>
<p>* Click ‘Run as Administrator’</p>
<p>* At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f</p>
<p>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</p>

    <title>Trenched - Xbox Reading error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trenched - Xbox Reading error</h2>
                    
<p>Xbox 360 Slim 4GB Model - Brought under a month ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently acquired the game 'Trenched' via the Xbox Marketplace - Every time I try to play the game I keep getting the
</p>
<p>"Disc is unreadable" error, So had a good read in the FAQ and done a search and completed the 'Clear Cache' trick. I then tried to</p>
<p>play the game with a little luck I sometimes manage to accomplish 1 full level with other players where as 80% of the time the game
</p>
<p>has a Insta-Error related to unreadable disc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Now i must be thick or I am obviously missing something here but because the game and content was and is downloaded + Installed onto my</p>
<p>Xbox hard drive (4gb Xbox Slim) with only not even half of that memory used, How is it that the game can be scratched - Shouldn't I be getting</p>
<p>some other error rather than a 'Game disc' type error? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried using a USB memory drive and formatted it (16gb) and then moved the game and its content from the Xbox Hard Drive to the USB Memory</p>
<p>and still get the same problem - Except only this time I get a error half way through every game I play then it quits and bring me back to the dashboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Redownloading the game isn't a option on a 10gb/month download plan - Until next month. So that is an invalid idea at the moment.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, mate, the solution you can't try right now is the one most likely to resolve the issue. Could you possibly take your console to a friend's house, to re-download on their network?

            <em><strong>Windows Update not working</strong></em>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>This is a very common problem lately.&nbsp;</strong></em> The most important tool you need right now is a lot of
<em><strong>patience</strong></em>.&nbsp; Windows Update resources at Microsoft are prioritizing Windows 7 updates at a very low service level and have been since early Summer 2015.&nbsp; It is not uncommon for Windows Update to take as long as an over-night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In many cases, the following rather simple and quick process works.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-update/windows-update-problem-error-code-80080008/de8114b5-1487-4b31-9b28-f11974718df1?auth=1"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-update/windows-update-problem-error-code-80080008/de8114b5-1487-4b31-9b28-f11974718df1?auth=1</span></a>&nbsp;
 This thread essentially lists a series of commands that I have found usually fixes WU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start, All Programs, Accessories, Right-click on Command prompt, Choose Run as administrator, OK.&nbsp; Type the following in the black box:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ol>
<li><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></li><li><strong><strong>net stop cryptSvc</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>net stop bits</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>net stop msiserver</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>net start wuauserv</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>net start cryptSvc</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>net start bits</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>net start msiserver</strong></strong></li><li><strong><strong>pause</strong></strong></li><li><strong>Exit</strong></li></ol>
<p>Type services in the text box above the start globe.&nbsp; Find each of the following and ensure they are set to automatic: Background Intelligent Transfer services, Cryptographic, Windows Installer, Windows Update.&nbsp; Double click on each item and choose automatic.</p>
<p><strong>If you still have a problem</strong>, try this.&nbsp; It will take a long time, but in almost all cases gets Windows Update back on track.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Download and run the correct version for your system of the System Update Readiness tool KB947821.&nbsp;
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows7/what-is-the-system-update-readiness-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 a net book last night.</li><li>Download KB3102810 directly from the Microsoft web site and install it.&nbsp; <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3102810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3102810</a>. This took 4 hours on a net book last night.</li></ol>
<p>Now re-start Windows Update.&nbsp; Do&nbsp;NOT restart Windows.&nbsp; &nbsp;Be very, very patient, it will likely take a long time.</p>

<div>&nbsp;can you set the lease time on your router to never expire and reserve an IP for</div>
<div>the media server computer? or a static IP?</div>

<div>Intermittent problems are the hardest to diagnose. Your description "..could be</div>

<div>time it happens, try power cycling the router. This is a diagnostic. What router</div>

            <p>I waited a few days to respond, because I wanted to test a few things based upon your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My router is a Linksys E3200.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that I lost the connection after 24 hours, which is the lease time set on my router. &nbsp;Since I changed my IP address to be a static IP, ipconfig /all does not show me the lease time anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just went into task manager and ended the DLNA process. The process never closed but did reset. &nbsp;I can now see the media server again. &nbsp;Interestingly, the windows media servers that are part of Windows Media player disappeared after I reset the DLNA process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will test again for more specific time frames. &nbsp;That said, when I was running original Windows Home Server OS lease time was never an issue for the Twonky media server I had running. &nbsp;I continue to wonder if Windows 8 or perhaps the firewall (Bitdefender)
 on my Windows 8 machine might have an impact versus the router. &nbsp;I did not run 3rd party antivirus or&nbsp;firewall software on my WHS machine.</p>

<div>&nbsp;the way to test if Bitdefender is a factor is to remove it from the scenario as</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;I've found that with routers that allow you to reserve IPs for</div>
<div>devices/computers and setting lease times to the longest possible/never expire</div>
<div>works best with Windows 8.1 DLNA scenarios for me. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;It will be interesting to see what your results are after running with static</div>
<div>IPs for a while.</div>

            <p>I tried the router option, and as best I could tried to set the lease time to forever, but still wound up with the media stream dropping after 24 hours. &nbsp;After some research, I decided to try Serviio which is a dedicated DLNA media server (Plex and Media
 Monkey are primarily other software that offers a DLNA option).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After almost 48 hours, the Serviio server is going strong and has not stopped. &nbsp;I did leave the router settings and the static IP on the Windows 8 machine, but I believe ultimately it was the software change that did the trick.</p>

            Hi Jillian.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br /> 3) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Admin, copy and paste in the following command and press Enter:  printui /s /t2     (Note that there is one space before each forward slash). 
<br />
<br />4 Open the Print Server properties, Remove the printer’s drivers for this printer and for any other printers you don't use presently.  
<br />
<br />5) If you get a message about access denied or the printer being in use and you cannot find the driver or any installed program that would account for this, you may restart the computer in a diagnostic startup and then use the printui  command to remove the driver package(s): <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-diagnostic-startup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-dia...</a>
<br />You must restart back to normal mode before you will be able to install the printer again.  
<br />
<br />6) Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />7) Go to the HP Support Downloads webpage here:  <a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers</a> to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />8) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>What is your default printer? To check, go to</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Printers &amp; scanners</p>
<p>
</p><p>and in the 'Printers &amp; scanners' section you can see which printer is the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that isn't the printer you want to use, click once on the printer you&nbsp;<em>do</em> want to use, then click on the gray box that says Manage. That will open a new page where you can select that printer to be your default printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explanation: When a physical printer hasn't been chosen, Windows will default to its built-in fax driver, or a PDF driver, or 'Send to OneNote.' Since neither of these are physical printers, you are asked if you want to "save printer output as."</p>

<p>I had to go talk to enchantress to get the achievement to pop.</p>
<p>Something odd Ive seen today though is an achievement pop on the xbox(ghom), but not show on smartglass or xbox.com. Seems they are really working the bugs out still, not on the xbox, but rather, on the online integration.</p>

<p>Ya, I had the same thing on the collect $500k gold and collect 5 bounty achievements. Not too worried though since on the achievement list it shows I have done 100%. With a game like this, you can except a few bugs like this at launch.

<p>Yeah, Seem to be quite a few bugs in this one, but nothing game breaking. For example, seems to me they inverted the health and defense values on the inventory screen. (Though I could be wrong, but it seems odd that I have 100k defense.)
