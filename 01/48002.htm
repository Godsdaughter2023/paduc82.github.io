<h2>            Display Driver Crashes</h2>
                    <p>Over the past 2 weeks, my computer has been repetitively crashing. I recently got Fallout 4. This was the beginning of the crashes. Once installed the game crashed regularly. These crashes, however, have progressed from the game. The graphics drivers now
 stop working on a regular basis and I can achieve little. I have even tried resetting the computer, but nothing has worked. The reliability monitor reports 2 hardware errors as follows:</p>

    <title>Games freezing on start up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elitewarrior261  say:</h3>
<h2>            Games freezing on start up</h2>
                    <p>I had another thread for this problem but they thought my problem was fixed. So i am starting another thread to actually get some help.</p>
<p>Original thread:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/forum/all/game-freezing-on-start-up/f0aae393-e11a-40cc-a61f-e39d9bd6492a</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Trying to play MW2 and Black ops 2 on my X and for some reason when i attempt to start them it freezes on the 360 start up screen. Only experienced it with these 2 games so far and they still work on my old xbox one.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I completely reset my conosole and then redownloaded them after the reset because they didnt work still and my black ops 2 initially worked and then my mw2 installed and i tried that and it still didnt work. So i tried
 my blacks ops 2 again and i am still having the same issue. What is really frustrating is that i spent $20 or so when it was announced for backwards compatibility because i lost my disc, and now that money is wasted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I tried everything at this point and would either like compensation because this is ridiculous or someone that might actually be able to help me instead of pointing me to other things that i have already tried at this
 point.</span></p>

            Yes by reset it i mean factory wiped it. But what i dont understand is that my other backwards compatibile games work and the two games work on my old xbox one, but for whatever reason they dont work on my almost brand new xbox one X, which is suppose
 to be better.

<p>Hello Warrior,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was only a misunderstanding on your previous thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do intend to fully assist here, and have another suggestion for you to attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, to investigate this further, we do need to ensure that we extend troubleshooting to&nbsp;the best we can. This can consist of leveling the issue onto three different root causes, hardware, software, or account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To finish investigating into hardware, we recommend that you attempt the following:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>From the <strong>Home</strong> screen, select <strong>My games &amp; apps</strong>.
</li><li>Highlight the game title, and then press the <strong>Menu </strong>button <span>
</span>&nbsp;on your controller. </li><li>Select <strong>Manage game</strong>. </li><li>Scroll to the right, highlight the saved data for your gamertag under <strong>
Saved Data</strong>, and then press <strong>A</strong> <span>
</span>&nbsp;on your controller. </li><li>Select <strong>Delete everywhere </strong>to delete all saves (local and cloud) for this game.
</li><li>After you have deleted all saves for this game, try playing the game and creating a new save to see if the issue reoccurs.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Try this for us and let us know if this works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

            i have tried to do that multiple times for both games and it never worked. Ad stated in the other thread i know its not my account because it works on my old xbox one, i am currently using a new xbox one x. I have even gone into another 360 game that works
 on my current xbox and deleted the saved data on there. I even went as far as to redownload my profile for 360.

<p>Hello Elite,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your new Xbox one X, when you launch the backward compatible game want you to try this. Hit the start and back button together. This brings up the 360 emulator on screen. Go to profile, and download profile. Even though it is already there. This kind
 of updates the profile and may help with the game. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Had this issue myself where kept saying download game again. I did what I mentioned and had no more issues. Also noticed when I did had my old gamer tag still showing, after my new one was there.</p>
<p>

<h2>            How can I stop mrt.exe &#40;MSFT malicious software removal&#41; running several times a day&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The performance of my PC is often really slow. I tracked this down to mrt.exe in the System32 folder, which hogs all resources and runs several times a day .</p>
<p>It writes a log entry showing that no virus is found so I don't need it repeatedly running.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried deleting it or renaming it (mrt.exe_ignore) but somehow it regenerates a new version :( and runs again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I change the scheduling so that it only runs once a month or remove it completely?</p>

<p>My question to you, Karthicka_R is: Because, I'm a bit confused....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Removal Tool, also called "MRT" comes as an important update, or is there other Microsoft removal tools?</p>

            <p><span>Hi Micael,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are right, as you mentioned that “The Microsoft Removal Tool, also called "MRT" comes as an important update”. This tool checks your computer for infection by specific, prevalent malicious software (including Blaster, Sasser, and Mydoom) and helps to
 remove the infection if it is found, refer to the below link.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/malicious-software-removal-tool-details.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/malicious-software-removal-tool-details.aspx</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also we have Windows Defender that comes inbuilt long with Windows 8.1, which protects the computer from the virus malware and spyware. You may refer to the following link.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/using-defender#1TC=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/using-defender#1TC=windows-8</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And we have Microsoft Safety Scanner it <span>is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Machael,</p>
<p>I didn't install MRT explicitly. Microsoft injects all PCs with MRT whenever Windows is updated. So it's part of the important update. Worse still, if you delete it then it get's replaced automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd prefer be without it (there are other tools out there to protect the pc) but at the very least I don't want it running several times a day unnecessarily and preventing me working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know how to change the scheduling so it's only once a month or once a week at the most.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes Karthick - I did follow the steps you sugggested. *edit* but MRT is not listed in the programs to uninstall.
</p>

            This is a stupid answer.&nbsp; We want to stop MRT from running not run it or another antivirus software as we already have another antivirus software running on our computers.

            <p>Grasping at straws.... I've tried blocking it from executing using the Windows Management Console - but it still executes several times a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I deleted mrt.exe from the system32 folder and replaced it with a copy of MRINFO.exe renamed to mrt.exe. It's a measure of desperation, but so far no logs have been written and the pc hasn't stalled.</p>

    <title>Upgrading from Windows Vista - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> katherine southern  say:</h3>
<h2>            Upgrading from Windows Vista</h2>
                    I currently have Windows Vista and need to upgrade to Windows 7, 8, or 8.1 for school. From what I've found Microsoft doesn't sell ANY of these programs anymore and you must go retail to purchase them. Is there anyway to download one of these online and
 upgrade to it from Vista? Also, from looking on Amazon and online Best Buy, many of the options say OEM. Is this a good version of the operating system? I've visited&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/help/upgrading-from-windows-vista-to-windows-7#T1=tab01
 but the tutorial links at the bottom do not work. Help, please!

<p>OEM means it's for Original Equipment Manufacturers.&nbsp; A company that builds computers would use an OEM version so they can pre-load Windows to their computers before they box them up and ship them to stores like BestBuy or customers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't get Windows 7 from most stores anymore, and many places that sell it online are scams that try to sell copies that someone else already used.&nbsp; I highly recommend using extreme caution when you buy from them and make sure it's a good reputable retailer
 that isn't trying to scam you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you receive <span>Windows</span> Update error 80070103 while installing updates, you might be trying to install a driver that is already installed on your computer or a driver that might be less compatible than one you already
 have installed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check the link mentioned below and see if the Audio issue stops. </p>

<h2>            Merge clean new Windows 7 Installation with my old one..&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The battery of my Thinkpad T410 is dead and last time I opened it I must have accidentally unplugged it and it went dead while coming back from sleep mode. When I tried to start the computer after that I couldn't, a blue scream came with:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Bad_System_Config_Info</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>...</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Technical Information:</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>*** Stop </em><span><em>0x00000074 ...</em></span></p>
<p><span>I first tried to </span>fix my computer with the Repair Mode of the Windows 7 Disc after that didn't work I tried to copy the folder c:/Boot from my backup which didn't work either and reinstall Windows 7 from the Disk over the existing Windows didn't
 go either. So now I make a backup of the whole hard disc, then I will format it and reinstall a clean Windows from scratch on. Then I would like to move the whole old files from the backup back to my disc, but which Files I cannot delete besides the Folder
 c:/Boot</p>
<p>
</p><p>Info: I use Acronis for my backups, so do just backup or restore certain folders and files is no problem at all.</p>

<h2>            Assistance on fixing error code 0x80072f8f, preventing updates on Windows and Store</h2>
                    <p>My computer is not able to update or receive any updates at all. As well as not being able to update the Windows store. I have looked through many different solutions and have not been able to fix this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are the solutions I have tried and did not work:</p>
<p>-Changing the date and time to match the correct numbers</p>
<p>-Synchronizing my computer clock to the windows server clock</p>
<p>-Stopping certain services such as the bits service</p>
<p>-Using the troubleshoot options in settings (Admin and non-admin)</p>
<p>-Using the troubleshooter provided by a download link sent by the virtual assistant&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Checked my network adapters (they are up to date)</p>
<p>-Stopped certain services from the msconfig options(checking to see if certain programs prevented this)</p>
<p>-I have even reset my pc to fix<br />
</p>
<p>It is really frustrating trying to fix this.</p>
<p>I would like to also add (if this has any relevance) that I got Windows 10 for free by upgrading from Windows 8.1 which was pre-installed on my pre-built computer.</p>

            I have tried that, I forgot to mention using the system file checker because I have tried numerous ways to fix this issue and I can't remember some. When I did the system file checker tool is said "<span>Windows

    <title>Xbox console not working after repair - falsely claimed as a tampered - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jbelt88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox console not working after repair - falsely claimed as a tampered device</h2>
                    
<p>I had my Xbox 360 sent in for repair a few weeks ago to get my disk drive fixed because it wasn't reading any of my games. I sent it in and had status emails sent to me regarding the repair and when it was supposedly done, the last email said it was getting
 shipped back to me. I received my Xbox 360 today and when I opened it, there was a letter that says the "inspection of my Xbox console revealed evidence of internal tampering or modification" and so forth. First of all, I have never opened or tried opening
 my Xbox 360 nor have done any modifications stated on this document. To clarify, I bought this brand new from Best Buy (a legitimate retail center) so any thoughts of the previous owner tampering the console is out of the picture. Can anything be done to clarify
 with the repair service that I have never tampered the device? I have never ever opened or tried opening it. It was brand new.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second issue I have is that the document states my console is being returned to you as-is (not repaired). However, when I received the device, I cannot turn it on. When I turn it on, the green power light turns on, which turns into three blinking red
 lights, turns green, then turns to solid red. On the screen it tells me to contact customer support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I contacted customer support initially for the first issue (the false claims of tampering) and also discussed the issue regarding not being able to turn my console on. After talking to customer support, I realized they will not do anything with regards to
 the false claims of tampering so I at least tried talking to them to help me fix this red light issue. So, they went through the typical remedies for the red light issue but nothing worked. They finally came to the conclusion that because the service people
 flagged my console as tampered, they have made this red light appear on my device and I cannot use it unless I go to a local technician to fix it (but I wouldn't be able to go online and get upgrades because it was flagged). However, this document clearly
 states that my console is being returned as is. It was not. Before I shipped it for repair, my console was up and running and the only thing that did not work was the disk drive. I am being told that my console was purposely made to not turn ON because of
 the flag, however this document says otherwise that I was suppose to have my console in the same state as before I shipped it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this normal? If something is claimed as tampered (which this is NOT true in my case especially since my xbox is brand new so no previous owners couldn't have done so), does Xbox service seriously make your device not work anymore? These are both major
 issues for me: I never tampered or opened my xbox console and now my console is even more broken than before I sent it for repair (but I was informed that was purposely set this way). I cannot find anywhere that Xbox purposely breaks your console because it
 is tampered. I have seen the site that explains console suspensions for Xbox live if you open the console and modify it (which I didn't even do this) but my assumption is its just a suspension within Xbox live, not the red light issue where you cannot physically
 turn the Xbox on.</p>
<p>Please can someone clarify some things and/or help me speak to the correct people to resolve this?</p>

<p>Hey there Jbelt! I understand you are having some issues after a console repair order. I tried looking up these interaction, but I don't see any calls or service requests on this GT. If you can PM me (envelope icon below) the GT you set these up under, or
 better yet the service numbers provided by phone support, I can better assist you with these issues. I look forward to your PM, thanks!

<h2>            How do i play games bought from store in true fullscreen mode in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased this game "Rise of the tomb raider" from the windows store.</p>
<p>However when I launch the game it always opens in windowed mode i.e. "borderless windowed mode" to be exact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The games I purchased from steam do have an option to play in "true full screen" using the "ALT+ENTER" key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is there is quite a difference in performance of the game when played in &nbsp;windowed mode when compared to full screen.</p>
<p>Also My SLI configuration does not seem to work in windowed mode.&nbsp;All other games work perfectly when in full screen&nbsp;for the games&nbsp;I bought from steam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please help me out on this?</p>

<h2>            HP Pavilion dv7-2110sa with clean Windows 10 freezes on startup if fast startup is enabled or if laptop is hibernated</h2>
                    <p>My HP Pavilion dv7-2110sa has been upgraded to Windows 10 Home Version 1709 (OS build 16299.19). I have upgraded the hard disk with an OCZ Vertex4 SSD. The laptop has an AMD Turion X2 Dual Core Mobile RM-74 CPU and ATI Radeon HD 4500 Series graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time the PC is shut down (with fast startup enabled) it freezes on boot up just after the rotating dots appear. The dots freeze and you have to press and hold the power button to force a hard shutdown. On restart it will boot up fine but next time
 I do a full shutdown it will freeze on startup again. If I hibernate the Laptop the same thing happens. However if I perform a restart instead of a shutdown, it will restart perfectly fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I disable fast startup in the power options the PC shuts down and starts up fine. So it is clearly a problem with the hibernate function (which is used by Windows fast startup).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could just live without the hibernate or fast startup function but I would prefer to have these options available to me. Many others have reported the same problem but I have found no solutions (other than to disable fast startup).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help with a solution please? Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hi Rey</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying to my post and sorry for my slow reply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue first occurred after I upgraded the OS from Windows 7 to Windows 10 (using the upgrade option rather than a clean install). The computer wouldn't wake from Hibernate, or from a "shut down" if fast shutdown was enabled. Wake from sleep and "Restart
 PC" were always fine though.&nbsp;<span>I decided to do a clean install of Windows 10 but the problem remains.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The only change I have made to the computer is the upgrade of the hard disk to the SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I disable fast start up the computer will start up just fine from a normal shut down (because then it isn't using the hibernation file for fast start up). If I hibernate it will fail to start. If I just put it to sleep it will start up fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled hibernation altogether now by deleting the hiberfil.sys file (using "powercfg /h off" from a command prompt with administrator privileges). The computer now works OK although I have no option to be able to hibernate anymore. So I have sort
 of resolved the problem myself, but I would still like to know why the hibernate always fails with an SSD installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>HP support will not help as the computer is out of warranty.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks again for any help or advice.</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Access Folder, Permission Denied as Admin</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a while now I lost access to a folder on my MyBook HD, saying I do not have permission to access it (even though I'm the admin). When it fails, it tells me to go change the permissions, which is what I try to do. I'm including a screenshot here of the
 steps I do and how it fails to work. It's just a folder where I put mp3s, so there are no system files in there of any sort. In the Properties window, it also shows 0 files and 0 bytes, even though there are files in there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I go into Properties of the folder, Security tab, Advanced;</p>
<p>- In Advanced Security Settings, Permissions tab, if I click "Continue" (with the admin shield), it says I don't have permission, even as administrative user, and to click "Change" above.</p>
<p>- I click "Change", get into a new window called Select User or Group, and per Microsoft's examples, I enter the word "Administrator" in the box (Enter the object name to select).</p>
<p>- The first time I clicked "Ok", then "Apply" on the previous window, it tried to take ownership and change it, but failed (see image). It says "Failed to enumerate objects in the container. Access is denied.", then "Unable to set new owner on _Temp. Access
 is denied."</p>
<p>- The second time I tried again, this time instead of clicking Ok after typing "Administrator", I clicked "Check Names", so it changes the name to "DESKTOP-RQV36KB\Administrator", but it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/540ded0d-401d-43b3-bd2c-a9b1084c1424?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/540ded0d-401d-43b3-bd2c-a9b1084c1424?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what I can do to salvage whatever's in there, I have backups so it's not the end of the world if I lose the content, but I can't even delete that folder at this point. I don't like the idea of leaving around something that seems corrupted on
 my drive. Anyone has any clues as to what I could do to either regain access, or delete it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>

            Does this happen on other computers where you connect the drive?
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro

<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection settings
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access
<br />Toggle it off
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />If the problem still persists...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Disk drives
<br />Right the external drive

<p><strong><span>Hi wjalexander91,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Are the other options like switch user, hibernate, etc working properly?<br />

<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If issue persists, you can force shut down and then boot in safe mode. Check if you can log off.</span><span>In
 Safe mode; you have access to only basic files and drivers.<br />
Refer to the link to start the computer in safe mode and then check - <br />

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Also I would suggest you to check if you face the same issue in different
 user account or new administrator account.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may create a new user account on your computer and then check.</span></span></p>

            Hi Gio, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10.

<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
