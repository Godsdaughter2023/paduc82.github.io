<h2>            Saving W10 upgrade download for future use</h2>
                    <p>Hi fellow Windows owners,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a Newbie so am trying to navigate my way around MS Community so if I make any errors please forgive me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the information I have read I should be able to download the W10 upgrade and save it until I want to install it but when I got notification that it was available for one of my desktops it was in the 'Windows Update' link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first Desktop (with W8.1)&nbsp;is set to 'Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the upgrade and now all I can see is a request to install W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can save the program to something like an external hard drive for use to reinstall W10 should the need arise (due to system failure, etc.) how can I do this and if I can save the upgrade how will it download and save, in a zipped file or some other
 way?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have another desktop with W7 Ultimate&nbsp;and a laptop also with W7 Premium</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help the Community can give me will be very much appreciated.</p>
                </div>

<p>
</p><p>As a matter of interest I have pasted the question and reply to the subject of reinstalling W10 which I found at Microsoft's Windows 10 Q&amp;As at link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-10-faq?&amp;SEMID=1&amp;WT.srch=1&amp;ocid=Win10Upgrade_SEM_GOO_MSBranded_ACTV_en-GB_sitelink&amp;wt.mc_id=Win10Upgrade_SEM_GOO_MSBranded_ACTV_en-GB_sitelink&amp;SEMID=1&amp;WT.srch=1&amp;ocid=Win10Upgrade_SEM_GOO_MSBranded_ACTV_en-GB_windows%2010&amp;wt.mc_id=Win10Upgrade_SEM_GOO_MSBranded_ACTV_en-GB_windows%2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-10-faq?&amp;SEMID=1&amp;WT.srch=1&amp;ocid=Win10Upgrade_SEM_GOO_MSBranded_ACTV_en-GB_sitelink&amp;wt.mc_id=Win10Upgrade_SEM_GOO_MSBranded_ACTV_en-GB_sitelink&amp;SEMID=1&amp;WT.srch=1&amp;ocid=Win10Upgrade_SEM_GOO_MSBranded_ACTV_en-GB_windows%2010&amp;wt.mc_id=Win10Upgrade_SEM_GOO_MSBranded_ACTV_en-GB_windows%2010</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer to the question regarding reinstalling is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Can I reinstall Windows 10 on my computer after upgrading?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Yes. Once you’ve upgraded to Windows 10 using the free upgrade offer, you will be able to reinstall, including a clean install, on the same device. You won’t need a product key for re-activations on the same hardware. If you make a meaningful change to your
 hardware, you may need to contact customer support to help with activation. You’ll also be able to create your own installation media like a USB drive or DVD, and use that to upgrade your device or reinstall after you’ve upgraded.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your reply.</p>

            <p>Hello again Sahil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your reply it appears you think that I have resolved the issue I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last reply simply pointed to the FAQs webpage which stated that I can save W10 and install it at my convenience and reinstall the OS in the event of a system failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the FAQs say I can save it for future use there do not appear to be any instructions as to how. This is what I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another anomaly I have found is that when the download was complete I was asked if I wanted to install W10 later but was only given an option of waiting 1, 2 or 3 days. I chose to wait the 3 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the 'Windows Update' option I was told that I needed to Restart my PC but when I did this the installation of W10 started as the PC was restarting despite my telling it not to install immediately and apparently totally ignored this request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically what I need is the instruction about how and where I can save the W10 download without having to install it immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further help you can give me regarding this will again be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

<h2>            Realtek RTL8187L Wireless LAN issues on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 on a notebook Clevo M660SRU (it's from 2008). The OS is very unstable and it freezes a lot, showing
<strong>DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made several testings and I've found that the WLAN caused most of the issues. By disabling it, and using only LAN it freezes less.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has a Realtek RTL8187L Wireless LAN. The latest driver (<a href="http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PFid=1&amp;Level=6&amp;Conn=5&amp;ProdID=36&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false&amp;Downloads=true#361" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>)
 is from 2011 for Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a common issue? My only option is to disable WLAN and buy a new external one or in the future this could be addressed and fixed?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the below steps and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1: SFC scan</span></strong></p>

<h2>            A driver for my CD-ROM drive has been disabled. How do I identify the driver and fix the problem&#63;</h2>
                    Lately I have not been able to use my CD-ROM drive. When I put a disk in it, the drive starts spinning but Windows doesn't acknowledge the disk. When I navigate to the CD-ROM drive in Explorer, a message pops up telling me "Please insert a disk into drive
 D:." When I look at the device properties, I get the following device status:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A driver (service) for this device has been disabled.&nbsp; An alternate driver may be providing this functionality. (Code 32)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Troubleshoot to start the troubleshooter for this device.<br />
<br />
The troubleshooting steps guide me to uninstall and then reinstall the device, but doing this has no effect--the drive still doesn't work.<br />
<br />
I'm running Windows XP Professional. My CD-ROM drive is an LG CD-ROM CRD-8482B. The driver files are as follows:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cdrom.sys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; GEARAspiWDM.sys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; imapi.sys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PxHelp20.sys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; redbook.sys<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; storprop.dll<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a solution?<br />

<p>Yeah unfortunately you have to beat him in a rather boring way. Especially because he has some sort of armour mode(when he turns yellow after hitting him) which just ignores your attacks and pummels you. If you back up away from him as far as you can, it
 should trigger either his taunt or his spear/hammer throw. Now it all depends on what character you're using, but use their projectile to do it. When he throws his hammer, you HAVE to jump, ducking or blocking doesn't work. If the character you're using has
 a teleport, wait until after he throws his hammer, or begins taunting then teleport and uppercut, and back out. Uppercuts do quite abit of damage, same for if you get an x-ray, wait until he taunts, get in there and x-ray. Hope this helps</p>

<p>I did the projectile trick and backed off of him the first few times, then I got daring and went in close on him. I found that trying to jump over him and get a jump punch then starting a combo works pretty well as long as he isn't reading your move and
 hitting you with the shoulder up charge. There's really no set way to beat him other than picking a good time to hit him with a projectile or close in on him and attack with a combo.</p>

<p>If you are using a character with a teleport move use that on him. But I usually like to stick close and jump over him and throw a quick combo. That method usually works out great for me.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>I wouldn't bother trying chain combo's together, you can get about two hits in, then he'll armour and attack. As for the shoulder charges and upper shoulder charges, I haven't figured how to really deal with those except avoid them at all costs, sometimes
 he will just do it twice all the way over to you and pummel you, if he does this just try jump over him and dash back. Seriously if he laughs at you for doing that it's a good thing, the more he laughs the more chances you get to throw more projectiles at
 him. What character are you using?</p>

<p>Man I HATE Shao Khan, I was trying to get the achievement of beating the game on max difficulty, went through the ladder easily and then I get to this buttmunch and got worked lol. I usually try to jump over his air charge and get in for uppercuts and jump
 back out. I guess I will try staying back with the projectile game and his teleport punch but I main Ermac and I think his fireball is kind of weak compared to other fighters.</p>

<p>Stay away from him and dodge projectiles, then nail him when he stops and taunts. &nbsp;Bicycle kick will do most damage if u can do the command consistently or just do the long range jumpkick. &nbsp;Thats if ur on beginner though.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 freeze on intial cold startup. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacksmith_642  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 freeze on intial cold startup.</h2>
                    Every time I start up my PC from cold it always freezes and is completely unresponsive to mouse and keyboard. The only fix is to reset my PC from power button on the case. It works completely fine for the duration of the time that it is on after that (until
 I start it up the next morning). I need some help fixing this issue as I've &nbsp;tried all the basic methods. In case its necessary I had Windows 7 64bit and upgraded to Win 10, this is when the problem began.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you have experienced due to system freeze. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To diagnose the issue, I suggest you to follow below troubleshooting steps and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Run the System and Maintenance Troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with system performance and maintenance. Follow below steps:<br />
1. Right click on <strong>Start </strong>button, select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
2. Change the view by option on the top right to <strong>Large</strong> icons.<br />
3. Click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and click on the <strong>view all </strong>
option on the left panel.<br />
4. Run the <strong>System and Maintenance </strong>troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Method 2 :</p>
<p>Refer below article for troubleshooting steps and check if it works.</p>
<p><span><strong>Windows hangs or freezes</strong><br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2681286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2681286</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The troubleshooting steps also applies to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Safety Scanner Disclaimer:</strong> There could be a loss of data while performing a scan using Microsoft safety scanner to eliminate viruses if any.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Safe Mode with Networking</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to check if the issue occurs in <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>.</span></p>
<span>
<p>Safe mode with Networking starts Windows in safe mode and includes the network drivers, services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Refer below link to Enable Safe Mode with Networking.</p>
</span>
<p><span><strong>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</strong><br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<span><strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 4: Perform Clean Boot</p>
</strong></span>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode, then perform a <strong>Clean Boot
</strong>to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do this, refer below article on how to perform a Clean Boot in Windows.<br />
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<span>
<p>(Applies to Windows 10 as well).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong>&nbsp;After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup
 mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The troubleshooting steps in the above links are meant for windows 8, however, you can use the same for windows 10 as well.
</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the status of the issue and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Same Problem here but the most current drivers are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a period of use the print drivers stop working.&nbsp; Access the printers results in the application not responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case restarting the print spooler has no effect.&nbsp; Compounding the problem all printers are network based.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS and all hardware drivers are at the most current.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WIndows 10 performed flawlessly until about three weeks ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Printers work immediately after a restart then after a while stop again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft any ideas?</p>

<p>This happens due to the website; the client is trying to browse to over SSL has an RSA security certificate that uses cryptographic keys that are less than 1024 bits in length. Also another

            Turns out to be opendns, I had decided to go back to win 8.1 because have it running on another computer using opendns without the problem. But decided to remove opendns one more time before reverting and gmail started working in windows 10, have question
 entered on&nbsp;opendns's website but no reply yet. It appears to be a problem with windows 10 or maybe Edge. This is being submitted using windows 10 without opendns and email working fine

<h2>            System Restore  &#34;initializing&#34; for 2 hours. Working or  hung up&#63; Hung up, do what&#63;</h2>
                    After visiting a web site, nothing worked even after restart. I chose to restore to a week ago. It has been "initializing" for 2 hours. Is it restoring, or simply hung up? I do not want to stop the restoration if it is working but do not know what to do
 next.

I interrupted the system restore and started it in safe mode before getting this suggestion. Everything is okay. That is what I wanted to do, but I was fearful of interrupting system restore. I am one of those people who feels safe only when following directions!

<h2>            Kinect &#61; &#36;98 at Walmart , Bestbuy , and Futureshop</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;Kinect is currently $98 at Walmart...Bestbuy and Futureshop dropped their price to $99 and change... Acording to the Futureshop website its only until August 1st, so if you snooze you lose..Of course this is the normal Kinect box, that comes with Kinect
 Adventure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I just picked up one... My local Walmart had 3 in Stock, my local Futureshop had 4 in stock (they are in the same parking lot)... I was one of those anti-kinect people , and I still am...When it launched at its original price, there was no way Id buy it...At
 $100, I'll bite....even if all I ever play is Kinect Adventures... After grabbing it, I went over to the game section to see if I could grab a game to go with it, and nothing grabbed my attention.... I may pick up Kinect Sports, or a fitness game if I see
 them go on sale....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Anywho, if you were on the fence, waiting for a price drop, nows your chance</p>

<p>As onyx said, Kinect should work fine with about 6 feet of space. So if you have a small office space you may need to send one of your fellow workers down to the basement. But do not, i repeat, DO NOT take his stappler...unless you want your work place to
 go disco inferno :P</p>

    <title>Lost Live Mail Password - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost Live Mail Password</h2>
                    <p>I have lots of probs recently with Live Mail, Hotmail &amp; Microsft Account. As a consequence I've cancelled my Hotmail&nbsp; &amp; tried to make Live Mail email work. &nbsp;I've&nbsp;made many attempts to change password - which seems to change the password to the MS Account
 ok BUT the new password will not be accepted by Live Mail. That all means I cannot access my Live Mail email.</p>
<p>My Live email is (removed PII)</p>
<p>My alternative email is (removed PII)</p>

            <p>I have managed to access my Live Mail.</p>
<p>I've tried many times to carry out the various suggestions made in this forum including what I did yesterday. That is I&nbsp;deleted the Live Mail email account. Then attempted to close my Windows Account. The Windows Account&nbsp;seemingly&nbsp;closed down ok. Then I
 attempted to create another Windows Account - that meant using my Live Mail email address &amp; password. This immediately reestablished my Windows Account with all my previous details. At this point I thought I'd failed so in desperation tried changing my password.
 Then closed down everything &amp; turned off the PC &amp; then back on. I was surprised to find that when I opened Live Mail that it now accepted my email address &amp; new password &amp; every thing was working ok.&nbsp;I must have changed my password previously about 8 times
 without success so I do not not know what was the actual problem that was rectified. However it all works now &amp; that's all that is important!</p>
<p>Thanks to all in this forum that offered help - much obliged.</p>

    <title>Ethernet is Limiting download to 10Mbps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> susanholley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ethernet is Limiting download to 10Mbps</h2>
                    <p>I have changed the default setting to 100Mbps in the under Speed &amp; Duplex, Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller Properties to allow 100 Mbps Full Duplex but it does not override and when I close out, it still shows 10Mbps. I spoke to Cox and they ran diagnostics
 which show I am receiving 150 Mbps to my router. They said it is an issue with my Dell Desktop computer Ethernet Setting is not allowing more bandwidth. Can anyone help me?&nbsp;</p>

            It may be caused by the Ethernet cable you are using to connect to the router. It may not be capable of 100 Mbps, especially if it is a long run of over 50 ft. Try a new Cat 5e or Cat 6 cable of the right length to make sure before looking at more complicated
 solutions.

<p>You may have to force both the router or switch port and the computer's Ethernet adapter to 100Mbps full duplex. But in my experience, some switch / Ethernet connections prefer and will run faster, with less errors, if both are set to Auto, rather than forced.
 It is years ago since I looked at this though, as I always just let them use defaults at home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suspect the cable also, as was already suggested. Even wireless is much faster than 10Mbps these days. My Realtek PCIe Family Controller is connected to Ethernet at 1Gbps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have some old switch between that might only be capable of 10Mbps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also possible that connectivity has been limited per device by some router setting.</p>

            &nbsp;I have a Dell Inspiron 660 desktop that doesn't have this problem, but you didn't say anything about how old your PC is or what processor it has.&nbsp; And you haven't said anything about your router and cable either.&nbsp; So I have to tell you that without that

<h2>            Refresh &#40;Re-fetch&#63;&#41; DNS servers in widows 10</h2>
                    <p>For a while I had custom DNS servers set in my IPv4 settings for my ethernet connection. I was using the google DNS servers 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4. I have set up a DNS server on my local network running Ubuntu that I want to use to serve up local site with
 custom domain names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the settings in my router to use the local DNS server (192.168....) and my providers domain as the #2 (208...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i went into my windows machine and selected the option to "assign DNS automatically" again the DNS servers will not change from the google addresses. ipconfig /all displays 8.8... I made the change 4 days ago thinking that it would just take time to
 refetch addresses but no luck. I have tried the various ipconfig commands to flushdns, renew and release IP but still no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is there a way to force windows 10 to refetch the DNS servers when keeping the automatic DNS settings?</strong> I have several machines on the network and i dont want to go into each one and manually assign DNS servers (and can't for some clients),
 hence the change at the router level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I am correct in assuming it will get the DNS addresses from the router, right? Regardless of where they come from the PC shouldn't be using the google addresses anymore)</p>

            Hi,  KaseyE
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to repair your internet connection.
<br />
<br />Go to those steps, from the Start menu or by pressing the key combination Win + I open the Configuration and click on the option Networks and Internet. Once there, we select the option Status of the left side menu and within the settings and options that are loaded in the right panel we have to look for network restoration.
<br />
<br />Clicking on this option will show us a new window from where we will be able to perform the network reset in Windows 10. In this way, all the network adapters will be removed and reinstalled and the original configuration of other components of the network will be re-established. net. This implies that if we were using some software such as a VPN client or virtual switches, we will have to reinstall them.
<br />
<br />A process that is carried out automatically by the system by clicking on the Reset button now shown in Network Reset in the Windows 10 configuration. It is normal that the process does not take too long, although we must wait until the end completely and restart the computer again to proceed with the network configuration in Windows 10 as we had until now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

            Windows XP Home doesn't include the Tasklist.exe utility, I can't figure out why Microsoft excluded this utility from the Home Edition but you can download a copy of it here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.computerhope.com/download/winxp.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.computerhope.com/download/winxp.htm</a>&nbsp; Put the utility in your Windows\System32 folder.

<p>Hey Foster. The reason you got that random GT is because you signed in with a different Microsoft account than is associated with your main GT. You are in luck though. Since you are signed in with the correct GT on your console, you can find the exact email
 address by following the steps in our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/forgot-microsoft-account#e8323ae0bdae4adc97356a2093935917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>No. &nbsp;I know what email it's attached to, but I don't use that email anymore. &nbsp;That's why I was trying to change it to this account in the first place. &nbsp;I see now that the process requires me to set up a new Microsoft account, transfer Foster to that new
 account, then transfer Juicebox to this account, which is all ridiculously tedious and not very user friendly. &nbsp;So now the issue I'm having is that I set up the new account, but for some reason it won't let me transfer Foster to that account. &nbsp;I get an error
 saying "Sorry, we can't change your Microsoft account right now. &nbsp;For more info, go to Xbox.com/AccountSwap." &nbsp;I go there, and it leads me to the same useless information I had already. &nbsp;I realize verbal communication is considered barbaric in this digital
 age, but isn't there someone I can actually speak to on the phone to fix this for me? &nbsp;I pay you guys a lot of money, and this loop of misinformation is really starting to *** me off.</p>

 because you have tried transferring the account, and you can only transfer accounts once every 30 days. If you have anymore questions, let us know.</p>

    <title>Rank Reset&#47;How to backup Gears files before it happens&#47; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Rank Reset&#47;How to backup Gears files before it happens&#47; Recover your Rank...</h2>
                    
<p><br />
I was a level 89 when my rank got reset. But I had a backup file and recovered everything including my skins and dlc characters, everything. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>You have to have a Usb drive (doen't matter what size).<br />
Plug it into your xbox 360.<br />
Go to "System Settings" and select "A" button,<br />
Move down to memory and select "A" button,<br />
Select the xbox's Hdd and select "A" button,<br />
Click on "Games",<br />
Move down to Gears of War 3 file and click "A' button,<br />
There's all your skins, characters and player data...<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; *Note - You can't copy or move your "player data file", I'll tell you how in a minute..<br />
On to copying your files, Select the Item you want to backup and click the "A" button..<br />
It will give your 3 choices, 1) Copy 2) Move 3) Delete, "CHOOSE MOVE"!!!<br />
It will now ask you Where you want to save the item, choose the usb drive you just plugged in.<br />
DONE!!! It's that simple!! It is now saved and safe.<br />
Do this for each item you want to backup.<br />
"Do not choose MOVE or it will move your file to the usb and you'll have to select that as your hdd everytime you play gears.<br />
Always choose "Move".</p>
<p>How to copy the "player data file". Really simple.</p>
<p>Boot up Gears, select your Usb drive that you just saved everything to and "play" 1 game of anything. When you're done playing, Go to the Dashboard and your "player data file" is now copied onto your Usb drive and you are now done completely backing up all
 your gears files.</p>
<p>Rank got Reset/How to recove</p>
<p>If you get your rank reset or loose an item, just plug in your Usb drive and boot up Gears and when it ask you to select the Hdd to save to, select your "Usb drive" and everything will be back to what you saved on the usb. All your skins, characters and
 rank!!! Play 1 game of anything again and when you're done, go back to Gears main screen and change your storage device back to the Xbox 360's Hdd (storage device) and when it downlads the content, you will have all your items and rank back on your xbox's
 hdd again and you have successfully recovered all you stuff.</p>
<p>Highly Reccomended:</p>
<p>After you finish playing gears for the day, I highly reccomend you save everything you've done to the usb drive (only takes a few minutes). If you get to level 90 and get reset and the last time you saved the game was at level 85, then that's what your rank
 will be, level 85. Better safe than sorry. Always save your files to the usb after you're done playing for the day.</p>
<p>This saved my butt from going back to level 1 and hope everyone heeds this warning..<br />
Any questions, just leave them here...</p>

<p>Sorry bout that, Its "CHOOSE COPY"...Sorry for the oversight...</p>
<p>As for my level 89, It's now 100, whooo hoooo Wings baby....</p>
<p>Sad to say but I'm disabled and can't do much of anything. If my brother didn't support me, I'd be homeless. Thank God for family..</p>
<p>As for the rank, I played the crap out of Gears. Several hours &nbsp;a day. Sad but, I don't have much of a life...now I'm depressed..</p>

    <title>COMM Ports Change After Setting in Device Manager and Reboot - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            COMM Ports Change After Setting in Device Manager and Reboot</h2>
                    <p>I am having an issue with Windows 10 resetting my comports after the system reboots. I keep finding information labeled similar to my issue but they only talk about going into device management and setting the COMM Port that I have. I run 4 Arduino's set
 on COMM 6, 7, 8, and 9 but after I restart the computer the ports change COMM Position. I then have to unplug and plug the USB ports back in and the COMM assignments correct themselves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I keep the COMM Ports from having this issue?</p>

<p><span>Hello AaronHamilton511,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forum. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you restart the computer, communications port (COM port) settings revert to the default. This occurs even though you have changed the settings in Device Manager. For example: if you run a command prompt, you may notice that the default settings
 for com 1 are:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Baud rate=1200; Parity=None; Data Bits=7; Stop Bits=1</span></p>
<p><span>You may have a program that requires different settings, such as: </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Baud rate=9600; Parity=None; Data Bits=8; Stop Bits=1</span></p>
<p><span>You can manually set com 1 to function at the settings you want by using this command:
</span></p>
<p><span>Mode Com1: 9600,n,8,1</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, when you restart the system, you find that the setting reverts back to the default:</span></p>
<p><span>Baud rate=1200; Parity=None; Data Bits=7; Stop Bits=1</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>COM port settings for command functions are maintained only for the active Windows session. Custom settings are discarded at shutdown.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To resolve this issue, create a startup task that sets the COM port to the settings that you want. The task can be set to run minimized with the close window on exit setting selected.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A sample shortcut has this command line: <strong>C:\winnt\system32\mode.com com1: 9600,n,8,1</strong>.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps. </span></p>

<h2>            Uninstalling Hotspot Shield</h2>
                    <p>About a year ago I installed an old version (7.6.4) of Hotspot Shield onto my laptop from filepuma. Then I uninstalled it and reinstalled it again. Now my computer thinks that I have two versions installed and won't let me uninstall either version. Whenever
 I try this it says "Another version of this product is already installed." I have tried a dozen ways to get rid of both versions and still cannot do so.</p>
