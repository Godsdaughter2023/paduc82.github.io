<h2>            Xbox one controller causes FPS drop, decrease gaming performance on Windows 10</h2>
                    
<p>I'm using a MSI GE60 2PE laptop (GTX 860m, Intel core i7-4710HQ) running Windows 10 Pro (detail:&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-wNYGsOJuYFZkkzR1haeGVwTTA&amp;usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B-wNYGsOJuYFZkkzR1haeGVwTTA&amp;usp=sharing</a>)</p>
<p>Before using Xbox one controller, I used a xbox 360 wired controller, and my laptop performed flawlessly.</p>
<p>But since I got the new Xbone controller connected using wireless adapter (already tried to connect with micro-USB cable also), gaming seem normal at first, then it started to drop FPS, stuttering, gaming performance seem to decreased a lot. the same with
 audio. Then when I tried to disconnect the controller by unplug the adapter / micro-USB cable, and then restarted the game again, the performance was flawlessly again.</p>
<p>This happened with all of the games I used the controller to play: GTA V, Fallout 4, COD Black Ops 3, FIFA 16,... I even tried Saint Row 4 and its just the same with other.</p>
<p>Note:Without Xbone controller, I usually get about 40~50fps in most of these games with almost all of settings were High and in Full HD 1920x1080 (except Black ops 3 in 1600x900). Xbox 360 controller didnt cause anything at all.</p>
<p>Nvidia graph card driver updated, xbox one controller driver updated via Xbox Accessories app, Windows update checked.</p>
<p>Hours of googling and I cant find any solution. Please somebody help me pls :(</p>
<p>Microsoft fix this please.</p>

<p>Interesting, because I'm using the Xbox One controller with the wireless adapter and it works flawlessly with no FPS drops. Some software in your PC just isn't agreeing with the controller. Maybe try wiping your PC and reinstalling from scratch.</p>

<p>It seems you have the same issue as me. So far, there seems to be no solution available which is really disappointing.</p>

<h2>            USB ports not recognising USB devices</h2>
                    Original Title:USB ports<br />
I made no changes to my comp.,&nbsp;but when I tried to use a USB port to upload some music to my MP3 player&nbsp;it did not recognize that it was a hooked up. I did some checking and found through the device manager that my USB ports were having a problem, (Standard
 Enhanced PC to USB host Controller has a driver problem.) and (Standard open HCD USB host controller has a driver problem.). When I have tried to update the driver thinking that was the problem, it says that the driver is up to date and nothing is needed.
 I have gone through every steps I can find to resolve this problem. I have uninstalled the drivers, ran scans of all kinds, restarted the comp for the drivers to be recognized and they are but they can not installed correctly, (windows cannot start this hardware
 because the configure information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged; code 19. It has a driver version 6.1.7601.18251 and I believe it was through Microsoft. But nowhere high or low can I find a way or a version that is correct to correct this error.
 Any help? I have a windows 7, 64 bit

<h2>            Spy vs spy</h2>
                    
<p>ok so basicly i have no idea where to post this so i am just going to post here, i dont know if anyone out there shares my mentality on this subject but lets find out. i have been with out any next gen consoles for along time, the last thing i owned was
 my original xbox which&nbsp;i eventualy had to junk it because it crashed and i bought another one for 50 bones i had this until about 2008 when it crashed so life went on and i got preocupied with other things when ever i wanted to play a game i still had my snes
 (which has lasted since launch) but now my brother has bought a 360 and i find it very entertaining although i am having a hard time transitioning into the next gen world of gaming, i find that there arent enough games out there that i like i would much rather
 play my original xbox games but heres the problem i have alot of games but they seem to be many of the few that microsoft left out like Spy vs Spy, Cel Damage, Cold Fear, Serious Sam 2, in summary i am saying is there anyone else who would like to see a patch
 or downloadble versions of more of the old games, i could always go buy another original console but at the moment i am not really able to do so.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Problem with Touchpad on HP Stream - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> william capps  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Problem with Touchpad on HP Stream</h2>
                    <p>After spending several hours with HP support, they have been unable to solve a problem using the &nbsp;Synaptics touchpad on the HP Stream I recently upgraded to Windows 10. It is a problem with Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP asked me to send the machine back to them for "repair" but, candidly, it seems the "repair" just consists of deleting Windows 10 and taking the machine back to Windows 7. Of course, their support people tried installing new drivers, etc. etc. &nbsp;I can't
 imagine how HP can make any money spending hours of support time on a machine that only cost $169 when I bought it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After having read a number of questions and answers about problems involving Windows 10 and various touchpads, I have concluded that it is simply too hard to try to fix this. Although I have always been a Windows person rather than an Apple person, this
 experience has made me reconsider this choice. If I actually take into account the value of my time spent trying to fix this problem, it seems that buying a more expensive Apple machine may have been a better choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also find it surprising that Microsoft, fully aware of this touchpad problem in Windows 10 which affects many machines, has not been more proactive in solving the problem for the users of its new system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would happy to hear from anyone who has found a fix for the Synaptics touchpad problem on an HP Stream machine "upgraded" to Windows 10.

            <p>I had also a problem with my HP Laptop touchpad after upgrading to Windows 10. And I also updated the windows hoping that the problem will be solved, but unfortunately it doesn't!<br />
</p>
<p>However I've solved the problem recently by doing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>From the "Device Manager" &gt; Expand "Mice and other pointing devices" &gt; Right click &gt; Properties &gt; go to "Driver" tab &gt; click "Roll Back Driver" and then restart your computer..</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">This has solved my problem..</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">hope it helps!</span></p>

<p>Apparently this is a common problem. &nbsp;I believe that it started shortly after I upgraded Adobe Flash player as noted below. &nbsp;Unfortunately, flash player is needed for other apps so an uninstall will cause other problems. &nbsp;It would be great if someone would

<h2>            Realtek RTL8723BE keeps dropping my WiFi connection on my laptop &#47;&#47; Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have HP 15-ac170ne with Realtek RTL8723BE network card and since I have bought it, I'm experiencing network dropping once in a while almost every day. First I though that this issue will disappear with some network updates but it got worse. The interesting
 thing is, that sometimes it comes back by itself after couple of minutes, sometimes I need to restart WiFi and sometimes I have to restart the system. It became very annoying. Also, most of the time when it happens, it sees all available connections but won't
 connect and couple of times, it completely deleted WiFi button. It's just like WiFi "refreshes" itself for some reason. Just a notice, refreshing definitely happens on my taskbar and desktop by itself, maybe that is somehow connected, I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I had a sound issue that I wrote about and the sound got worse with every new browser tab that I was opening that has sound actually. I wrote about it here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/anniversary-update-sound-problem/19321464-a023-4674-a7ba-fc579fdfed4c</p>
<p>
</p><p>I said this only because maybe some app is causing this network issue that we are unaware of. The interesting thing here is that this sound issue happens on Realtek product also.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me provide you with some TS steps I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- In Device Manager / Network Adapters / Properties / Power Management I have unchecked the box which allows network adapter to turn off to save power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- In System Power Settings I have set maximum performance for when laptop is plugged in as well as when it's on battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have the latest drivers. Tried to download from HP website, Realtek site, Microsoft update, other sites... I have tried newest drivers and the older ones. Just to say, I think that for some period of time, I stopped happening with one of the older drivers,
 but the issue reocurred after some time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>- I also contacted Microsoft support team, who remotely couldn't find the issue as "my device is working properly". Guy&nbsp;just checked do I have the latest drivers and told me they are working properly. He told me that I should contact them&nbsp;once it happens
 (?!). That is the same sentence as you would say "Keyboard not found, press any key to continue". That was pretty funny in this misery.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that after more than a year and a half, Microsoft, HP&nbsp;or Realtek&nbsp;cannot provide drivers with full compatibility with hardware for all devices?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyone from Microsoft who can tell me what is happening and how to fix this? Also, how to disable this auto-refreshing of the system? And please, don't suggest me to reboot my router as this is happening on every single connection I'm on and I also
 have other devices on the same networks that are not experiencing this kind of troubles. Also, I don't want to buy external USB adapter (I know that solves it) because I paid for this laptop a lot and at least I can expect is to work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just want to add that I have two HP laptops in my house, the same issue happens on both of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Windows 10 Home Single Language 64 bit. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Every help is welcome. Thank you.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Ros,</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for delay in answering you, I updated my Windows with Creators update and wanted to see how will it behave.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me answer your questions please:</p>
<p><span>1st - Windows is downloading it's own updates, I haven't turned it off and that's the only updates I'm doing since I got HP. I made only one change since I bought it (and only because I thought it causes the issue). I bought this laptop with
 Windows 10 installed already and McAfee on it which should've been activated for a year. I unistalled it and installed Avast Antivirus which I use on all PCs I had since Windows XP. The issue stayed the same with connectivity.</span></p>
<p><span>2nd - I started experiencing this issue ever since I bought this laptop. Then I started browsing and found out that many HP users are having the same issue with their connectivity once they upgraded system to Windows 10. I started finding
 "solutions"&nbsp; that I described as troubleshoots for it and none of them worked. There was only small period of time when connectivity was normal when I installed some older driver for my network card (which, in description, was not compatible with Windows 10
 btw). and it worked good. Then, some updates came, that driver disappeared and problem reocurred. Now, I really don't know what to do, seems like there is no solution for this. Is the only solution for me to sell this laptop and switch to Apple? I don't want
 something like this to happen, in the time where we are "depending" on network. I actually need wirelles for work also.</span></p>
<p><span>Just to give you quick view, this thing actually happend again while I was typing this post. Check picture please.&nbsp; First connection is mine. First it only sees it as one of the many it catches and after that it starts to connect automatically,
 with no success. Almost every time I have to restart WiFi. </span></p>
<p>As I wrote in my first post, I now you see the picture, sometimes it happens that only Flight mode button stays and WiFi button disappears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, one of the misteries for me on this windows is auto-refreshing. I believe that this Windows is optimized to work on desktops as well as on tablets and phones. One to rule them all, some would say. In that case, I know that this Windows is based on
 apps. As I mentioned in my first post, my taskbar auto-refreshes itself. You may see how may icons I have there and from time to time, they disappears and starts appearing one by one. Like when you do good refreshing on your desktop. I'm writing this as my
 question is: Does the same thing happens to a WiFi?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on what you've mentioned, the main issue here is the compatibility with the network driver for Windows 10. We suggest that you contact your device Manufacturer (HP) for them to have this isolate and resolve on their end. They have the right tool and
 resources that can check what needs to be done on this concern. </p>
<p>

<h2>            Malfunction of Surface Mouse left click</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 5 months ago I bought a Surface Mouse in Microsoft Store in Manhattan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, since a few weeks ago the left click button doesn't work well. 2~3 of 10 times miss the click order and It seems hardware malfunction as it happens regardless of any program or application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that now I'm living in Madrid, Spain. I'm wondering if there is any option that the mouse can be repaired or exchange in Madrid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            No sound w&#47;MagicJack since upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10, but for some reason I can't hear my phone messages on my MagicJack service connected to my computer. I play them back, but there's no sound. My MJ service prior had no issues. It's a problem not being able to hear my messages.
 I can download them to my computer, but that's an extra couple of steps that I didn't have to do before. I like the immediacy of being able to hear them from my desktop. I'm not experiencing any other sound issues. Cortana is fine, videos are fine, Pandora
 is fine. FYI -- I have a Samsung laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Elda</p>

            <p>Firstly try logging on to the Admin account that you set up for emergency access and elevation purposes and use that to change the password.</p>
<p>You didn't set up such an account? Then when this is fixed I seriously suggest that you do so.</p>
<p>You need to forget anything to do with XP. Keep this account for emergency access and for elevation purposes. Then change your User account to a Standard User account.(There is absolutely no need to run as an administrator on a daily basis in Windows 7 -
 Windows 7 has the "right-click-run as administrator" function for when you need admin privileges). You will be much safer and better protected doing this.</p>
<p>Now to your problem. This will be painful.</p>
<p>Courtesy of Pegasus (MVP):</p>
<p>You can reset any password by going through the steps outlined below. The process is involved and requires some careful typing. Ask a computer-savvy friend to assist you if you lack experience in this area.<br />
&nbsp; 1. Set your BIOS to use the DVD drive as the primary boot device.<br />
&nbsp; 2. Boot with a Windows Repair CD. <br />
&nbsp;3. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …" appears.<br />
&nbsp; 4. Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and then click Next. You are now in Repair Mode.<br />
&nbsp; 5. Select an Operating System, then click Next.<br />
&nbsp; 6. Select the Command Prompt.<br />
&nbsp; 7. Identify the correct drive letter for your Windows installation. It could be a drive other than C: but it won't be X:. You do it by typing the commands<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir C:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir D:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dir E:\Win* {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; etc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; until you find the Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will call that drive "Q:".<br />
&nbsp; 8. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; move&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; \&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy&nbsp; cmd.exe&nbsp; sethc.exe&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp; 9. Reboot normally<br />
&nbsp;10. When challenged for a password, tap the Shift key five times. You will see a small black screen.<br />
&nbsp;11. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see a list of all accounts that exist on your machine)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To see if the Administrator account is active)<br />
&nbsp;12. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user "xxx" ppp&nbsp; {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Replace xxx with the account for which you wish to set a new password, and ppp with the new password)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net user Administrator /active:yes {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (To activate the Administrator account if desired)<br />
&nbsp;13. Log on under this account, using the new password.<br />
&nbsp;14. Reboot the machine into Repair Mode as per Steps 1..6 above.<br />
&nbsp;15. Type these commands:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cd /d Q:\windows\System32 {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy \sethc.exe {Enter}<br />
&nbsp;16. Reboot into Windows.<br />
&nbsp;Instead using a Windows Repair CD in Step 2, you can use your Windows 7 Installation DVD. The steps are similar to the ones above.<br />

<p>Turned computer on &amp; it reads: 'System32\Drivers\isapnp.sys file is missing or corrupt. You can attempt to repair this file by starting Windows setup using original CD-ROM.'</p>
<p>I put Windows XP Home Edition CD-ROM (the original CD). Boots up, Welcome, I press 'R', them ADM. Pswrd(i press enter..no password.) I enter: ren c:\windows\system32\drivers\isapnp.sys isapnp.old &amp; hit enter. At the c:\wWindows prompt I type: EXPAND D:\i386\isapnp.sy_c:\Windows\System32\Drivers.
 It won't expand the file. It says cannot expand.</p>
<p>HELP!! This computer is my Dad's. He's 86 today. He is a writer, so all of his work is on that computer. I suspect he has been on some questionable Websites &amp; he may have let a random "Anti-Virus Program that told him that the computer was infected. I installed
 Windows One-Care last week and I'm not sure if it was running or not. Also, he has no "Recovery" disk &amp; diskette's. There is no Floppy drive either. Is there any way to repair this file?</p>

<p>Stop what you are doing right away. The very best thing you could do - and I'm basing this on what you've written and not saying this to hurt your feelings in any way - is to take the computer to a reputable local professional. This will not be a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad
 type of place. The professional will retrieve your father's data and probably do a clean install of Windows. The professional can also set up a backup strategy that will be seamless for your father.</p>
<p>If you want to try and fix this yourself, retrieve his data by one of the methods below and then do a clean install/factory restore. You will need to get recovery media from either the computer mftr. or see if there is a recovery partition on the hard drive.
 What is the make/model of the computer?</p>
<p>1. Pull the drive and put it in a USB drive enclosure or use a USB drive adapter. Attach this to a computer running a working install of XP/Vista/Windows7. Use the working Windows Explorer to copy the data to the rescue system's hard drive and then burn
 the data to cd or dvd or copy it to an external hard drive. I prefer not to do this if I know the drive is infected because there is a chance of infecting the host system. In these cases, I use #2 below.<br />
<br />
2. You can boot the target computer with a Bart's PE (XP only) or a Linux Live CD such as Knoppix or Ubuntu and retrieve the data that way. This has the additional advantage of telling you whether the problems you're having are hardware or software-related
 because if the computer behaves perfectly under Linux you know that Windows (software) is the culprit. Conversely, if the computer misbehaves under Linux you will know that there is a hardware problem. Here is general information on using Knoppix for data
 retrieval when you can't get into Windows:<br />
<br />
You will need a computer with two cd drives, one of which is a CD/DVD burner <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> a USB thumb drive with enough capacity to hold your data <span style="font-weight: bold">
OR</span> an external USB hard drive. Download the Knoppix .iso and create your bootable CD*. If you are doing this in an older operating system (XP or Vista), you'll need third-party burning software like Nero, Roxio, or the free<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ImgBurn</a>
 (Windows 7 can burn .isos natively). Burn as an image, not as data. Then boot with the CD you created and the Windows files will be visible in Linux. If you want to burn CD/DVDs, there will be a Linux burning program to use.<br />
<br />
*If your computer only has one optical drive and you want to use that drive to burn data or need to test the drive, you can create a bootable USB thumb drive running Linux instead of a bootable CD. This website will show you how to do that -<a href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pendrivelinux.com</a>

<p>Turned computer on &amp; it reads: 'System32\Drivers\isapnp.sys file is missing or corrupt. You can attempt to repair this file by starting Windows setup using original CD-ROM.'</p>
<p>I put Windows XP Home Edition CD-ROM (the original CD). Boots up, Welcome, I press 'R', them ADM. Pswrd(i press enter..no password.) I enter: ren c:\windows\system32\drivers\isapnp.sys isapnp.old &amp; hit enter. At the c:\wWindows prompt I type: EXPAND D:\i386\isapnp.sy_c:\Windows\System32\Drivers.
 It won't expand the file. It says cannot expand.</p>
<p>HELP!! This computer is my Dad's. He's 86 today. He is a writer, so all of his work is on that computer. I suspect he has been on some questionable Websites &amp; he may have let a random "Anti-Virus Program that told him that the computer was infected. I installed
 Windows One-Care last week and I'm not sure if it was running or not. Also, he has no "Recovery" disk &amp; diskette's. There is no Floppy drive either. Is there any way to repair this file?</p>
<p>&nbsp;thank you in advance, Mary</p>

<p><br />
Try following the directions on the link below. I noticed in your post you state "I type: EXPAND D:\i386\isapnp.sy_c:\Windows\System32\Driver". Note there should be a space between the underscore and the letter c.&nbsp; If expand doesn't work then try "copy" instead.
 You are on the right track. Otherwise you would have received an error when you renamed the original file. Also, if you don't have any success copying or expanding the file try doing a repair install following the instructions on the second link below.</p>

            Actually, the person to whom you replied - "davekingzbbb" isn't the original poster. So aside from him complaining about needing SP3, we have no idea what problems his computer is experiencing.

 software , and now have 5 antivirus 3 internet security and 2 firewalls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>then i told her i cannot disable the firewall , and she told me it was ok and won't force me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i do not want to give access to anyone. i am still worried will it be monitored.??</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Nothing to worry, they won't be able to monitor your activities on your device unless you will give them the permission to access it. Aside from that, your computer is safe and protected with the antivirus installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you called a technical support and they initiate a remote access on your computer, it will be fine. But if someone called you, asking you to give information regarding your computer, account, internet connections, etc. to have a remote access, that is
 the time that you have to be careful in providing those information.</p>
<p>

<h2>            RAM at 92&#37; with no high usage applications...&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,<br />
<br />
Sorry to bother you guys but I have a weird problem that I've Googled for the past 30 minutes. So my RAM usage is at a constant 92% but when I open Task Manager, the highest RAM usage application is Malwarebytes and it's only 10% (normal). Everything else is
 less. I have attached the screenshot; is there anything I can do to solve this problem?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance!!</p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>The manufacturer&nbsp; who I contacted told me the product was no longer supported and that it has no solution to my problem.</p>
<p>Nevertheless&nbsp; after some exchanges with&nbsp;a user from another community gave me the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When having&nbsp;cleaned my computer from any&nbsp;trace of the product 'including the USB camera driver) &nbsp;and reinstalled&nbsp; the product software&nbsp;from the CD or from the manufacturer site&nbsp; then connect the hardware and wait long enough ( it took as long as about&nbsp; one
 minute before W10 decided to install a generic driver for the camera and since that everything is operating perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will help other users </p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hi Divya,</span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>There are many Windows 8 users who are complaining about various restart and shutdown issues. Many times their Windows 8 computers restart themselves as soon as the login screen appears. Sometimes their computer
 systems hang while rebooting or shutting down the system.</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Most of the times these kind of issues are related with the new "Hybrid Shutdown" feature introduced in Windows 8. Hybrid shutdown feature of Windows 8 decreases the total startup time by hibernating the kernel
 session instead of closing it which reduces the overall Windows loading time because resuming from hibernated system session is very less work compared to a full system initialization.</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>But this new feature is causing problems to some computer systems and if you are also facing reboot or shutdown problems in Windows 8, you can fix it by disabling this new hybrid shutdown feature and doing a
 complete shutdown.</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Just follow these simple steps:</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>1. If you are on new Start Screen, type power and Windows will automatically search for the term and will show you the results.</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>If you are on Desktop, move your cursor to top-right corner of screen to access new Charms Bar. Now click on Search option and type power in search box.</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>2. Now click on Settings link given in right-sidebar of search results page and then click on "Change what the power buttons do"
 link given in the search results.</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><font>&nbsp;</font></span></span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>3. It'll open Power Options window. You can alternatively open the same window by typing powercfg.cpl in RUN dialog box and press
 Enter and then click on the "Choose what the power buttons do" link given in left sidebar.</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Now scroll down to bottom and you'll see "Turn on fast startup (recommended)" option given in Shutdown settings section.</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>4. Disable the option by unchecking the checkbox and then click on "Save Changes" button.</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Note: If the option is not shown or greyed out, scroll up and click on "Change settings that are currently unavailable" link.</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><span>&nbsp;</span></font></span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>5. That's it. Restart your system and your reboot or shutdown problems should get fixed in Windows 8.</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><span>&nbsp;</span>NOTE: If the above solution doesn't fix your problem, you can try to execute following command in Command Prompt. Open Command Prompt as Administrator by right-click on the bottom-left corner and
 select the same option from the Win+X menu:</font></span></span></p>
<p><span><b><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><span>&nbsp;</span>bcdedit /set disabledynamictick yes</font></span></b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>Please let us know if the issue persists. We will be happy to assist you further.</font></span></span></p>

<h2>            Realtek PCIe GBE Ethernet Family Controller stopped working completely.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has been working fine on my PC for several months but a few days ago my Ethernet connection failed with the appearance of a yellow triangle on the icon in the tray.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the troubleshooter in network diagnostics and received a result of problem found: “Local area connection 3 doesn’t have a valid IP configuration.&nbsp; Not fixed”. See attached screen-shot.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7049d04-1140-41cf-9b5a-23bcf50f5043" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7049d04-1140-41cf-9b5a-23bcf50f5043" height="348" width="451" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I checked both ends of the cable and both had green LEDs illuminated on the router&nbsp; computer and is noted as working correctly in the Device Manager properties box ‘general’ tab. I updated the driver and it appears correctly in the ‘driver’ tab of the properties
 box. However, in the ‘advanced’ tab the Network Address is shown as not present. Screen-shots attached</p>
<p>

<p>I also cut and pasted the following screen but am now not sure from where:</p>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><p>I have read through many of the other questions posed by members concerning considerable problems with this Ethernet controller but not exactly similar to mine. I, therefore, open a separate question. Any advice and suggestions would be gratefully received.<br />

            <p><strong>Windows by default does not want/like you storing files/folders int the root of your system drive.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to take ownership of there folders, this can be a cumbersome task,
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ek5gmtjmjf6d49r/InstallTakeOwnership.reg?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click HERE</a> to download a reg file from by DropBox account, which will add Take Ownership to the right click menu in Windows File Explorer . .&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this change made, Select the first .tmp Folder and shift click the last .tmp folder,
<strong>make sure you have nothing else selected</strong>, right click and choose ' Take Ownership'. A lot of command windows will open, it might take some time depending on what is in these folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>When all the command windows have closed, you can then delete these folders</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Hope this Helps!</p>
