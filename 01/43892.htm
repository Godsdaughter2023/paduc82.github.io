<h2>            What is going on Microsoft&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p><br />
I've been a gold member for nearly 10 years but i'm getting really tired recently...</p>
<p>Every time I log on something isn't working, either games or friends list etc...</p>
<p>Everytime I try to change ANY of my account setting I have to send TWO different access codes to TWO different emails addresses...</p>
<p>And now my console has stopped signing me in and requires a password every time I turn it on...</p>
<p>My account is very old and thus has had many changes over the years, all I am trying to do it change the email address associated with my Xbox Live account. Everytime I do this something different seems to break, it keeps signing me in on a totally random
 account on here that I have never used...</p>
<p>I want to wipe EVERYTHING in terms of email and Microsoft accounts and just start again with one email address and all my saved data, how can this be so hard to do? Even when I delete my old hotmail account it doesnt go anywhere and the Xbox is still using
 it!</p>
<p>Im paying for this service!</p>
<p>Who do I contact to sort this out once and for all?</p>
<p>GSuS</p>

<p>Hi, I'll try and help.</p>
<p>First, the service alerts you see posted doesn't always indicate the service in unavailable for everyone. &nbsp;Often times the issue is isolated but the system alerts are trying to be shown in as much of a transparent manner as possible. &nbsp;Many times there are
 alerts but the items shown has issues function perfectly fine for me.</p>
<p>Next, lets try and address your email/account problems. &nbsp;Are you receiving any specific error messages throughout the process? If so make sure you post them here so they can be researched.</p>
<p>Next thing we should do is check your Microsoft account settings and see whats on record. To do that follow these instructions:</p>
<p>1) go to <a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.microsoft.com</a> and login</p>
<p>2) Once logged in go to 'Your Info' at the top of the page</p>
<p>3) Click the link in the middle of the page that says 'Manage your sign-in email or phone number'</p>
<p>4) Take note of how many 'Account alias' are listed.</p>
<p>Its important to note that a user can have multiple email accounts associated with their account at any time; however, only one primary. &nbsp;Based on what you have written above I'm suspecting you have multiple aliases setup which is causing some duplicate
 notifications.</p>
<p>Once you record the information above come back and we'll try and walk you through getting your account setup in a way that works for you.</p>

<p>I have two current account aliases, the one I set up with my brand new Xbox One on release and the one I have been using for years prior to this.</p>

<p>Of the two accounts you have listed; is your objective to only have the primary account listed? IE- the one you setup with your new Xbox One?</p>
<p>If you don't need the second alias you can simply delete it from your profile. &nbsp;It should be noted that when you have more than 1 email alias associated with your account that you can use any of those aliases to actually sign into Microsoft services.</p>

<p>Oh, I understand your issue now. &nbsp;Sorry for the confusion. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I've never encountered that issue myself in regards to an email not associated with a Microsoft account. I'll continue to research and see if I can find anything related to the condition
 you describe. &nbsp;In the meantime perhaps someone else can shed some light on the situation.</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification.</p>

            <p>If you have compatible hardware and your computer still stops responding, disable any unnecessary hardware. Remove universal serial bus (USB) devices; remove or disable network adapters, sound cards, and serial cards; and then restart the installation.</p>

    <title>Unable to contact your DCHP server - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> justinjubenville  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to contact your DCHP server</h2>
                    After resetting my modem 100 times (from tech support) re-installing windows xp, buying a new NIC, i still get the same error message when i do a ipconfig /flushdns, ipconfig /release and then a ipconfig /renew : "An error occured while renewing interface
 Local Area Connection : unable to contact your DHCP server. Request has timed out." I'm currently plugged into my laptop (which works fine, win7) but as soon as i plugin to my desktop (before doing a full factory reset on the modem) i get no internet activity.
 There is no router involved, just a modem(RCA, Model: DCM 425).&nbsp; I've went through 20 different blogs and i cannot figure out what the problem is.
<br />
<br />
ipconfig /all result:<br />
<br />
Host name : ...... juby-qvfgt3vlfm<br />
Primary Dns Suffix ........ :<br />
Node Type : unknown;<br />
IP Routing Enabled : no<br />
WINS Proxy Enabled : No<br />
<br />
<br />
Connection-specific DNS Suffix :<br />
Description : Sis 900 Based PCI Fast Ethernet Adapter<br />
Physical Address : 00-01-80-6A-E2-F3<br />
Dhcp Enabled : Yes<br />
Autoconfiguration Enabled : yes<br />
Auto configuation IP Adress : 169.254.247.88<br />
Subnet Mask : 255.255.0.0<br />
Default Gateway :<br />
<br />
I was running XP SP3 before i reformatted. I am currently running SP1. I've disabled my motherboards NIC and plugged in the new one. Still get the same results as i was before i reformatted. Like i said, laptop works fine. When i first got the modem it was
 plugged into my desktop with a limited or no connectivity. As soon as i plugged it into my laptop, it was up in seconds. Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Justin<br />

            Make sure your DHCP Client service is running...<br />
Startup the Services window (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "services.msc"), then look for a line labeled "DHCP Client".&nbsp; Make sure that the Status column shows "Started" and the Startup Type column is "Automatic".&nbsp; If not, double-click on that line and make it that way.<br />

<p>Yes I did try adding the input method while logged in as the administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I add Microsoft Pinyin input method as the administrator, all the other accounts, including those with or without administrator privilege can use Microsoft Pinyin as their input method without any problem as well.</p>
<p>

    <title>Skype auto answer feature on Skype for iOS&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype auto answer feature on Skype for iOS&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I had an android device and I was able to use Skype as an auto answer feature for when I was not near my phone, but wanted to except incoming calls from my friend on Skype. Now that I moved to Apple iOS, I do not see this feature, and I was wondering, is
 there any possible way to get Skype for iOS to answer incoming calls for free? &nbsp;This would be a really useful feature, and I need it to answer incoming calls from some people that are on my account whenever I'm not near my phone. This will be great if you
 guys could please add this as a feature. It would be really appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Kind regards,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cam</p>

<p>Its almost a year later and still no auto answer for ipad? Come on Microsoft i spend alot of money with yall on yalls products my grandmother has Alzheimer's and can not answer by swiping technology confuses her this is a really simple feature that im able
 to use on my android devices right now why cant yall fix this for the ipad and ios, this may not be a big market compared to others but yall gotta think the majority of americans are aging anf a big part of our population is gonna be suffering from alzehimers
 and dementia and other cognitive disfuctions do yall really wanna miss out on this growing market bc yall wont add back a simple feature that yall took away in the first place yall can corner the market for this need with aging parents with health problems
 and their kids that are technologically advanced keep in contact and ease alot of stress for them being able to check in on there loved ones show that yall have a heart and fix this before i post on change.org and have to start an uproar.</p>

<p>You should be talking to Apple. IOS does not allow auto answer from apps. You don't own an Apple device... you rent it. You can only do what Apple allows if not jailbroken.</p>

    <title>Copying file from one Sata internal hard disk to another internal Sata - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> naveed-anwar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copying file from one Sata internal hard disk to another internal Sata Hard disk on two different Windows 10 installations</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so my situation is as per below :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I got 3 new desktops. Each with same hardware with an installation of windows 10 upgraded from windows 7.</p>
<p>2. I removed the hard disk from my old PCs and put them as secondary hard disk in the new PCs</p>
<p>3. I booted from my old HDD Os (also windows 10), I backed up the files and placed them on the partition of the new HDD in the new system.</p>
<p>4. Once I booted back to the New system Windows 10, I simply cannot see the files where I placed them. Although the space in the HDD is being shown as used, There is no way I can see those files here.</p>
<p>5. I booted from the Old HDD again and from there I am able to see the files are still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I noticed is that the Drive letters changes depending on which windows installation I boot from. Could this be the problem ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from above, I backed up the data on the old HDD partition, when I booted in to the new HDD I could still see the backup data in old HDD from new HDD OS, however when I copied it to the new HDD it disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exactly the same thing happened on all three PCs that I have upgraded/replaced. However for the other two, I managed to copy the data on an External Network Drive, this Data is easily readable in my new Setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this morning, the old HDD windows got corrupted and I am unable to boot to that OS and hence i am not able to copy that data to an external drive and from new HDD, I cannot see the data, although the space has been taken up (around 100 GB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone advise if anyone has faced similar problem/situation and if so How were you able to resolve it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried the show all files etc options but non of them work to show these files from the new HDD OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I tried something, and now from New &nbsp;HDD OS, I am unable to access the old HDD C: Drive anymore. It gives me the error "Access is Denied"</p>

<p><br />
Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.<br />
</p>
<p><br />

            <p>Hi Christian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your link has nothing to do with my situation. I am not trying to format any hard disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have figured it out on my own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The steps I took that showede the files that were not showing before:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Disconnect the old hdd</p>
<p>2. Reinstall windows 10 using a usb</p>
<p>3. Once the system asks you to select the partition to install the OS on, delete all partitions except the one where you can copied your data that isn't showing. Then make a new partition from the ashes of the previous deleted ones and install the new OS
 on that.</p>
<p>4. Boot into new windows and your data can now be seen in the Hard Disk.</p>

<p>I get this same problem all the time it drives me mad! (excuse the pun). Its only a Sata thing. &nbsp;If using the network or USB it will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When having to install a new drive from a faulty one if the faulty drive is readable I install on the back-up server to recover the data, I then install the new drive to the machine that I'm replacing the drive to, I install Windows (or use the cloned recovery
 partition) then remove the drive and install on the back-up server to transfer back the recovered files, after the copying is complete I place the drive in the machine, boot up and the drive says its got the data but none of the files are there! I do this
 hundreds of times day in day out repairing computers I never had a problem until GPT, but now it does it even with MBR. I figured it must be permissions I've tried all sorts of ways to overcome permissions creating a folder adding the user ect... but still
 doesn't work, on occasions I've got it to see the copied folders by using checkdisk but this doesn't always cure the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I could use the network but this is impractical when having to transfer 2/300 gigabyte of data on 3 or 4 machines at a time, just wastes time</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me the reason you solved your problem was because the data was on the partition prior to installing Windows, I guess I could partition the drive, transfer the data, then install Windows (or the cloned recovery partition) but this is not the solution
 to the problem and would cause unnecessary tasks for certain setups, also a higher risk of partitioning problems, why cant it just work like it used too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any one know what the problem is and how to resolve this...?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much appreciated</p>

<p>Thanks for the update Arthur. I do agree that it's unusual. I suggest that you also check if the version for your
<strong>BIOS </strong>is also updated to ensure compatibility with your operating system. You can check with your motherboard's manufacturer for that update. If you already have the latest one installed or if updating it still does not resolve the issue, I
 suggest that you post in our <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>TechNet forums</strong></a> and have our advanced users share their opinion on the matter.<br />
</p>
<p>If you have any other concerns, don't hesitate to post at our forums.</p>

<p>This is tied with Acer Arcade Deluxe: <a href="http://www.backgroundtask.eu/Systeemtaken/Taakinfo.php?ID=22052" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.backgroundtask.eu/Systeemtaken/Taakinfo.php?ID=22052</a>.&nbsp; I could find no good information on Acer&nbsp;Arcade Deluxe - I think it may be a game or a series of games but I'm not certain. If you're not using that program (and I imagine you're&nbsp;not), I
 believe it is safe to disable the service (or perhaps you may even want to uninstall the entire program if it isn't being used - that will probably remove the service).&nbsp; You can search your system to see if it's installed (it may have a shortcut in All Programs
 or show up in Start / Control Panel / Programs and Features).&nbsp; Asl your grandson if he knows about it and if he ever uses it anymore.&nbsp; Even if he does, you can still safely disable the service and tell him he needs to enable the service if he ever wants to
 use the program.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

I have contacted 2k, i have been doing everything they said but they could not solve the problem and as usual in the end they blamed my Xbox account and security settings.

    <title>Keyboard doesn&#39;t work on resume from sleep or hibernation since - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zerospace195  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard doesn&#39;t work on resume from sleep or hibernation since 8&#47;30&#47;16 Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>I've had this issue intermittently since the anniversary update, but the most recent updates (August 30 firmware update and the most recent anniversary update cumulative patch) seemed to have made the issue very regular (as in, just about every single time
 I resume from sleep or hibernation).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My keyboard will be 100% unresponsive when resuming from sleep or hibernation. As in when I try to type, nothing happens. I almost always must detach and re-attach the clipboard to get it back. One time, it was extremely slow to respond and was behaving
 as though the caps lock was on, when it wasn't (and when I turned caps lock on, the light on the physical key lit, and then it began typing in lower case). I tried closing Firefox and launching it again, but Firefox then wanted to start only in its own safe
 mode. After that, I decided to reboot, which led immediately to the blue troubleshoot windows menu, and I do mean IMMEDIATE. There was absolutely NO restart sequence at all when this happened. I simply chose to boot windows normally, and the Surface Book proceeded
 with a cold boot sequence, after which, the keyboard functioned fine until the next time I resumed it from sleep or hibernation, and the keyboard was yet again unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is to say the sequence that occurred was the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Resume from hibernation. Once logged in, launched firefox and tried to type a URL. Keyboard not responding properly (laggy &amp; caps lock off, but keyboard was producing all caps; with caps lock on as denoted by the light on the key, keyboard outputting
 lower case). Firefox kept wanting to start in safe mode after this happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Start menu --&gt; restart</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Immediately presented with the blue background windows troubleshooting screen/menu (like what you'd see if you booted from a windows disc for repair purposes)</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Chose to boot windows normally</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Once fully booted (cold boot sequence is what I saw), everything was back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a very, very sad development since the Surface Book had been more and more stable until the anniversary update arrived. I will likely try doing a system file check &amp; DISM with a current windows image just to see if it helps.</p>

            <p>I have been having a similar issue. My keyboard will be working when it comes out of sleep but short there after it and the touch pad will not work.&nbsp; No mouse cursor, no keys on the keyboard will respond.&nbsp; Sometimes attached and detach will fix the issue,
 sometimes not. The touch screen is working and I can use that to close my apps and restart.&nbsp; Once I restart the keyboard beings working again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the scan and got the following: </p>
<p>
</p><div>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;sfc /scannow</div>
<div>Beginning system scan.&nbsp; This process will take some time.</div>
<div>Beginning verification phase of system scan.<br />
Verification 100% complete.</div>
<div>
<p>Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>This is very frustrating as it will happened in a meeting went I have pause note taking for a while and resume to take about note and the keyboard stops working.&nbsp; I again did not experience this till after the anniversary update and latest firmware updates.&nbsp;
 Not sure which one caused it. </p>

            <p>Yes. System File Checker found no integrity violations. I'm at a loss. Last night I had the same issue again:&nbsp; resume from hibernation, keyboard somewhat works, then gets laggy, then while in the middle of trying to type, it switches to all caps without
 me touching the caps lock. Keyboard input continues to lag, finally, I try turning the caps lock on -- get lowercase, but still laggy. And then, keyboard stops and I get a "the last USB device you plugged into this computer malfunctioned" or something like
 that notification in the action center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I detach. I re-attach. Keyboard still doesn't work right. So I go to reboot. This time, I get the "please wait" over the solid color background and then boom -- the troubleshooting screen, as though I'd booted windows from a disc or something. I select "continue
 to windows" and again, everything works as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This never happened prior to the anniversary update and/or the most recent firmware update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft wants to investigate, I'll provide whatever files or data you need, but I really want this fixed. Rebooting all the time just to get my keyboard working is rather annoying.</p>

            <p>I'm still having the keyboard totally unresponsive on resume from sleep or hibernation issue ... any response, Microsoft? As previously reported, the system file checker says all is fine. Everything else (that I'm aware of) is working fine. This issue did
 not exist prior to the anniversary and/or most recent firmware updates. They came so close together I'm not sure which one is the cause.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I've found in my windows logs is the reference to the USB malfunction that occurred the 2nd time I had the keyboard lag and weird restart sequence, and the error is pretty generic. I ran the dump file through the diagnostic utility though.
 Here's the result:</p>

            <p>Are you guys for real? I post error log data and no one from MS bothers to come back and respond to this? My keyboard still CONSISTENTLY FAILS TO WORK AFTER RESUME FROM HIBERNATION. Sometimes, literally, the OS is up and running and its a full minute before
 it works. And then it lags and works incorrectly until I detach and re-attach the clipboard. WTH, Microsoft?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ugh. Why do I continue to buy Surface devices? </p>

            <p>This isn't a Surface Pro, this is a Surface Book. Removing the type cover driver does not apply here. I have tried the two button shutdown. It does not work. I will repeat what I've said before -- this did NOT happen before the anniversary update(s) and
 the Aug 30 firmware. I don't know which one caused it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tonight, I cannot seem to get my keyboard to work consistently for very long before it starts lagging and changing to all caps, etc. It has done it once just while typing this post. My trackpad also cuts out in the same way. I've rebooted, two-button shutdown,
 etc. Same result. If this keeps up, I may just get my Surface Book replaced, sell it and then buy something else. This is unreal. My Surface Pro 3 was a far better device than this piece of junk (and it cost less, too).</p>

            <p>One more thing -- the issue has slightly changed to basically mean that immediately on resuming from hibernation (and sometimes sleep, but usually just hibernation), the keyboard just flat out doesn't work. As in it just doesn't work. You try to type, you
 get nothing. No trackpad either. The only thing that works is the touchscreen. If I'm too impatient and reboot, it just keeps not working -- I have to wait MINUTES for a fully working, not laggy keyboard. That's totally ridiculous, MS. This is a laptop! The
 keyboard should just work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also this morning, when I woke my Surface Book, it had rebooted from installing Tuesday's cumulative patch -- keyboard didn't work, it also didn't even try to activate Windows Hello, and I was looking at a generic lockscreen rather than MY lockscreen (this
 happens a lot since the anniversary update whenever the SB reboots after installing windows updates). I had to log in via my PIN with the ON SCREEN KEYBOARD just to log in ...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This whole mess is just ... it's beyond ridiculous. I'm beside myself with anger that something so basic is so broken on a machine that I paid $2,000 USD for the privilege of wanting to pull my hair out over. If I reset this machine, I'm getting rid of it.
 I shouldn't have to erase all my software and settings (and before you tell me that it all syncs,
<em>it does not sync your start menu</em>) to fix something that Microsoft broke and now doesn't even want to seriously try to help me fix. This crap flat out never happened prior to the most recent firmware and/or anniversary update to Windows 10. ****.</p>

            <p>Ahh, several days later and no further response from anyone at MS. I'm so shocked
<em>*eye roll*</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, my keyboard still works and then goes unresponsive nearly immediately upon resume from hibernation. Occasionally, it comes back on its own. Other times, I have to detach/re-attach and sometimes I have to reboot to fix it. Sometimes absolutely NONE of
 the above works and I just have to wait, which usually means putting it back to sleep for a few hours to overnight. I have noticed that I will see the little 'safely remove hardware and eject media' icon appear quickly in my system tray and then disappear
 immediately upon resume. This always seems to happen around the same time the keyboard goes unresponsive. I'm trying to dig further into that, as I'm not sure if its related or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a completely unacceptable situation at this point. I can't resume from hibernation and then do some web surfing, because... well, you know, I can't TYPE ANYTHING.
<em>*sigh* </em></p>

            <p>I still have same thing unresponsive keyboard after&nbsp; hibernation and sleeping. I also have black screen after hibernation or sleep mode. I also feel that the device does not sleep ! because I can hear the van working in sleep mode while surface book charging.
 Battery drains is also back with&nbsp; hot keyboarded while in sleep mode. I did all updates and I am so tired&nbsp;of it :( I own surface book since&nbsp;11month now, but the laptop still has problem. As the result, I will sell it&nbsp;soon. I too&nbsp;busy for those problems and&nbsp;I
 will back to apple </p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office Picture Manager - how do I zoom in on a photo and capture the zoomed in part only&#63;</h2>
                    Hi there<br />
<br />
Reference Microsoft Office Picture Manager.&nbsp; I have taken several shots of people far away.&nbsp; When I zoom in on the MS Office Picture Manager to get a close up of the people,&nbsp;how can I "save" the picture as a close up, ie what I see the zoomed in close up I
 see on the sxreen?<br />
<br />
It's not cropping as that only cuts bits off the original image, it doesn't help for close ups or zooming in.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
thanks <br />
<br />
regards<br />
<br />
PS I have MS Vista

    <title>Sudden garbled and distorted audio - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sudden garbled and distorted audio</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I turned on my computer to find that the audio is all garbled and distorted. I've tried both the front and rear audio outputs, and for some reason the rear is slightly better sounding than the front, but they're both having the same issue. I've
 also checked with several pairs of headphones and speakers and it's present across all devices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hadn't downloaded anything the previous time the computer was on. I've since updated my Realtek audio drivers but the issue is persisting. I have disabled sound enhancements, as was suggested for people with a similar issue to mine, but it made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running out of ideas, can anyone suggest an alternative solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC:</p>
<p>
</p><p>i7-5820K</p>
<p>GTX 980ti</p>
<p>16GB RAM</p>
<p>Windows 10 Education</p>
<p>

            <p>If you have installed the Nvidia HD Audio drivers and don't use HDMI for audio. try uninstalling them.</p>
<p>I have not heard of conflicts with Realtek recently, but the two drivers have conflicted in the&nbsp; past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The audio chip does fail now and then. Mine failed on a machine about eight years ago (crackling and popping, etc.),</p>
<p>and while the motherboard was still under warranty a cheap sound card was&nbsp; much easier quick fix than RMA.</p>

            Thanks for your suggestion. Unfortunately I did try that earlier and it made no difference. Could it be the motherboard? I only built the PC a few months ago, so all the components are fairly new. The motherboard is an ASUS X99-A.

            <p><em>"Could it be the motherboard... a few months ago "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I really have no way of knowing, but your troubleshooting seems to indicate a bad chip.</p>
<p>The one time I had an audio chip fail (purely coincidental - also ASUS, but I am back with ASUS after</p>
<p>years with Gigabyte and AsRock) was on a six month old motherboard, and it also presented the issue</p>
<p>on booting the machine with no prior indication there was a problem</p>
<p>( I've also had two gpu failures over the years. Both worked fine one day, but would not boot to Windows the next).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Contact ASUS support, and see what they think. They may have a fix, or suggest an RMA, but</p>
<p>do make very sure the audio chip is the culprit, because even though they may suggest an RMA ,</p>
<p>they still may find there is nothing wrong when the board gets tested.</p>
<p>(I've seen plenty reports at the Nvidia/AMD forums of gpu's being returned this way).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your motherboard does have a better than average on board audio, which may perform better than</p>
<p>a cheap sound card, so you may find an RMA is preferable to an add on sound card.</p>
<p>- If lucky you may also be able to return the motherboard to point of sale for a swap ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- One other thing. Make sure you are using the correct front panel motherboard connection.</p>
<p>Some cases still have a legacy <em>ACL 97</em> (if I remember the term correctly) connector option.
</p>
<p>I don't think this would suddenly cause a problem like yours, but it could affect front panel</p>
<p>audio performance .</p>
<p>- Or, if the connector is not fully seated, this could cause performance issues ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>.</p>

 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above

<h2>            video project in Photos</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I'm making a video project with a combination of video clips and photos - I'd like background music on the photos and then not on the clips - so you can hear the clip audio - is it possible? you could do it in movie maker but can't figure out how in Photos.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Helens0,
<br />
<br />I'm afraid there is no way to trim the audio in a Photos video project, and I'm rather surprised they didn't add a feature like that. Any music you add will be uniform to the whole project.
<br />
<br />Here are a couple of things I'd like to tackle.
<br />
<br />You should send this feedback to Photos, it would help them greatly. In your video project in Photos, click on the three dot button on the top right, and click Send feedback. From there, you will be redirected to the Feedback Hub to send your feedback.
<br />
<br />The second thing is that you can perhaps delegate your video editing responsibilities to other free alternatives, here are a few:
<br />
<br />Openshot: <a href="https://www.openshot.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.openshot.org/</a>
<br />VideoPad: <a href="http://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nchsoftware.com/videopad/</a>
<br />VSDC Free Video Editor: <a href="http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videosoftdev.com/free-video-editor</a>
<br />
<br />If you want the old Windows Movie Maker back, you can download this offline installer for Windows Live Essentials 2012 here: <a href="http://download.digiex.net/Apps/WindowsLive/2012/wlsetup-all-2012-16.4.3528.331.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.digiex.net/Apps/WindowsLive/201...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps, Helens. Good luck on your video project.

    <title>Microsoft&#47;Xbox Username Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tertialskink694  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft&#47;Xbox Username Issue</h2>
                    
<p>Since my xbox has just broke, I tried moving my account onto a different xbox to play, but I forgot my account information, such as email, password, and I'm unsure if I'm answering my security questions right. Even if Xbox gives me the email address, it
 would do nothing because the email account is not active anymore. &nbsp;So I can't just recover my gamertag on the other xbox. &nbsp;I've been dealing with this problem for about 8 years now (since I made my gamertag back in 2005), and until now, I have found a way
 to deal with it. I used to move my gamertag onto a flash drive and then plug it into the other xbox and then either play with it on the flash drive or completely move it to the other xbox. Now that used to work all the time, problem solved. Yet when I tried
 to do it with my new xbox today, I was confronted with a pop up message asking for me to enter the email and password for the gamertag. And since I don't remember my information I am stuck, so I tried moving it back to my hard drive it was initially on (my
 little fighter 12gb very first hard drive ever produced) and I was again confronted with the message asking for the email and password. So now my gamertag is basically dead, but it allows me to still sign into it and use it offline only. It makes no sense
 to allow me to sign into it offline and not online as well. &nbsp;I have tried to call the Xbox support line multiple times and beg on my knees for them to give me my information, but they couldn't since it was against their rules.&nbsp;Long story short, is there a
 way to recover forgotten account information without have the email/password, such as the credit card info? Please respond, in dire need!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, wackshot55</p>

<p>Hello wackshot,</p>
<p>Lets see if we can't get this squared away for you. Here are few steps to try and find your Microsoft account.</p>
Find your Microsoft account
<div>
<p>You can find the Microsoft account associated with your Xbox LIVE account on your Xbox console. Here’s how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in using your Xbox LIVE gamertag. </li><li>Go to <b>Settings</b> and select <b>Account</b>. </li></ol>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fcompass.xboxlive.com%2fassets%2f3e%2f82%2f3e82b739-c22a-46a6-9313-78ee2f46c18d.png%3fn%3dsettings-highlight-account-l-m.png" /></div>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Scroll right to <b>Your Information</b> and select <b>Account Security</b>. The Microsoft account (Windows Live ID) that is associated with your Xbox LIVE account is shown.
</li></ol>
<p>If you can’t sign in to an Xbox LIVE profile on your console, here are some other ways to find your Microsoft account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <a href="http://accounts.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">accounts.live.com</a> and try signing in with what you think is your Microsoft account (email address and password). If you can sign in to Windows Live, the email address and password you entered
 are valid. Next, go to <a href="https://live.xbox.com/Account/Signin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox.com</a> and try signing in with this same information. If you’re prompted to create a new gamertag, the Microsoft account you entered is not currently associated with an Xbox LIVE account.
</li><li>Check your email accounts for messages about your Xbox LIVE Membership (search for messages about “Xbox LIVE” or “Microsoft billing”). This may help you determine which email address is associated with your Xbox LIVE membership (an email address is part
 of your Microsoft account information). </li><li>If you know your Microsoft account but can’t remember your password, see <a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/forgot-microsoft-account-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Recover your Microsoft account password </a>. </li></ul>
<p>Let us know how you make out after following these steps...</p>

<p>I do know the email that's on the account but the thing is its not an active email anymore and even if it was active I wouldn't be able to log in because I don't know the password to it. So any help options that involve resetting a password or requires an
 email are of no use. As far as I know, the only reasonable option is if &nbsp;I call and ask a rep to grant me the information if I give them all the credit card info on my account. &nbsp;Which I asked if this is possible to grant me access if I give them some form
 of information on the account. Lol I just want to play battlefield :(</p>

<p>Oh I just remembered why I've always had this issue, it's because when I made my gamer tag back in 2005, it wasn't required to create a Microsoft account. So I never even made one. This feels like trying to play games on a Commodore 64

<p>I want to play online with my friends and purchasing another Xbox live subscription is absurd. This is ridiculous I can't even fill out a recover form and try and complete as much information as I remember because when I made my gamer tag I used false information
 because I wasn't 18 and didn't think Xbox would protect my real information so that's also useless. Ugh it's like pulling teeth to recover forgotten and non-active information, I don't see why Xbox just doesn't believe me that I'm the owner of the account.
 An if I was trying to steal somebody's account, they would obviously recover it asap. This is just unnecessary stress that could solved if they take the credit card info that's on the account and if it matches what I tell them because obviously I have the
 card in my hand...</p>

<p>Really man. Look it's your responsibility to keep track of your information your FALSE information. Providing false information is a violation of the terms of use and will probably end in a account ban on that gamertag anyway so you may as well start from
 scratch...</p>

<p>w2502 eu comprei o halo e comecei no lendário e é possível sim zerar no modo solo! Mas não pode ser afobado e querer zerar o jogo em 3 horas, algumas partes fiquei dias pra passar e não jogo o dia inteiro, as vezes tem que matar 1 por 1... eu to tentando
 fazer mais conquistas, quem estiver afim pode me add. vlw abração</p>

<p>Are you trying to connect using Bluetooth or by plugging a wire from the headphones into the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are trying to use Bluetooth, make sure that Bluetooth is both present and enabled in your computer.&nbsp; Although most laptops have a Bluetooth adapter, many desktop/tower computers do not.&nbsp; Even if your computer has a Bluetooth adapter, make sure that
 it is enabled (check your computer's User Guide for "airplane mode").</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a Bluetooth adapter built into your computer and you are sure that it is enabled, it still may not connect to a newer Bluetooth device.&nbsp; This is because the Bluetooth support built into Windows 7 does not support Bluetooth 4, also known as Bluetooth
 Low Energy (Bluetooth LE).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Open Device Manager on your computer (click Start, type Device Manager in the Search box, and press Enter)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Double-click the Bluetooth category to expand it</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Right-click your Bluetooth adapter (receiver, transceiver, etc.) and select Properties</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Select the "Advanced" tab</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Check the LMP version</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>LMP 0.x - Bluetooth 1.0b</span></li><li><span>LMP 1.x - Bluetooth 1.1</span></li><li><span>LMP 2.x - Bluetooth 1.2</span></li><li><span>LMP 3.x - Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR</span></li><li><span>LMP 4.x - Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR</span></li><li><span>LMP 5.x - Bluetooth 3.0 + HS</span></li><li><span>LMP 6.x - Bluetooth 4.0</span></li><li><span>LMP 7.x - Bluetooth 4.1</span></li><li><span>LMP ​8.x - ​Bluetooth 4.2</span></li><li><span>LMP 9.x - Bluetooth 5.0</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you don't have LMP 6.x or better and the headset uses Bluetooth 4, that's your problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can you pair the headset with your smartphone and hear sound through the earphones?&nbsp; This will confirm that your headphones are working.&nbsp; Most smartphones do support Bluetooth 4.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the problem is that your computer doesn't support Bluetooth 4, either look for an updated Bluetooth driver at the website of your computer's manufacturer or buy an inexpensive Bluetooth "dongle"
 that connects to a USB port on your computer.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<span>For example: <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=100158097%20600315449&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;Description=bluetooth&amp;bop=And&amp;PageSize=96&amp;order=RATING" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=ENE&amp;N=100158097%20600315449&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;Description=bluetooth&amp;bop=And&amp;PageSize=96&amp;order=RATING</span></a></span></span></span>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>If you do get a Bluetooth transceiver, disable the onboard Bluetooth in your computer.</span></p>
