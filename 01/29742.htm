<h2>            How do you confirm what your old microsoft password was if you don&#39;t remember it&#63;</h2>
                    I recently change my Windows Password because I forgot the old one("I wrote the old one down but can't locate the paper"). I am trying to activate my personal assistant Cortana but I now get a screen that tells me to enter my old pass word one more time!
 Can you tell me how to get around this? Or is there a code in which I can enter? Thanks in advance Dan

    <title>Xbox Design Lab Controller Breaks Shortly After Warranty - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox Design Lab Controller Breaks Shortly After Warranty</h2>
                    <p>I finally decide to shell out the $80 for an Xbox Design Labs controller and about one month after the warranty expires, the left thumbstick breaks. I've had several other (and much cheaper!) controllers, all of which have seen more use than this one, none of which have had the same issue. Seems like what you gain in customization, you lose in quality. So so so frustrating. I cant believe that one month ago, they would've sent me a new controller no problem and now I'm completely out of luck (and $80). Thats just so stupid! Seems like these shoddy controllers are designed to only hold up for about 100 days - then the jokes on us. Thanks Microsoft!</p>

            <p>Signed in to say that I just experienced the exact same issue. Got the controller as a Christmas gift and have been using it for about five months, and not the left thumbstick is not working properly. While in a game, my character will walk in a straight line and not be able to turn, even if I'm not touching the controller. This obviously makes the controller practically useless. I spent 1h20m on the phone with support, on hold for most of it, including speaking to a supervisor, just for them to tell me that because I'm about a month out of warranty, I'm out of luck and need to shell out another $80. This whole thing has been extremely frustrating and disappointing, as I've spent literally thousands of dollars over the last decade+ on consoles, accessories, games and XBL, and then be told that I have no options other than to give them more money. This is clearly a quality issue that many others have been experiencing, and their Support doesn't care at all. If you're thinking about purchasing a

            Hey mate i feel. Have had 2 design lab controllers both treated with the utmost respect doing nothing to break them. One for 13 months the other for 14 months and yet both have broken the same way. They’ll be fine when i log off and then i will go to log
 in put my headset and find that there is not sound. Even after trying every troubleshooting to fix if. In the aux port and the chat mixer port there is nothing. And of course no warranty on them or the console since I’m using my original Xbox One I got when
 they first released.&nbsp;

    <title>Elite Controller Faceplate Squeaking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> puttyngton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Elite Controller Faceplate Squeaking</h2>
                    
<div>
<div>
<p>As the title suggests my Xbox One elite controller has randomly started to squeak. I last used it over 24 hours ago and since then has randomly started to squeak, it never made any noise or feel used before. I can press down on the face of the controller
 by the right thumbstick and it'll make a loud audible squeak and I can feel the plastic move as if there's a space that shouldn't be there. When in my hands it feels like a rumble as the slightest twist movement makes it squeak. Using the triggers makes this
 rumble squeak sensation and it's so distracting to the point where I can't concentrate on the game because of this.</p>
<p>Is there anyway I can fix this? Any way I can just force the plate back into place or tighten the screws as I know Microsoft's Warranty has long gone with me as I've had the controller since their release in October last year with no faults up until today.
 Thanks for any help!</p>
<p>TL;DR Controller squeaks, anyway to stop it's squeaking?</p>

 left over bits from updates but back then they always ended up on what ever the biggest drive was on the PC. Any ways I am just wondering if this is the same thing so I can delete them as&nbsp;they are starting to take up a decent amount of space (about 5GB worth),
 and if so is there&nbsp;a way can I stop this from happening?</p>

            <p>Hello Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you make any hardware or software changes to your computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing detailed information about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur either if any corrupt data is present in the computer or the computer is infected by a virus or a malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following&nbsp;methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Perform disk cleanup and check the issue.</p>
<p>Refer this article:</p>
<p><strong>Delete files using Disk Cleanup</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/delete-files-using-disk-cleanup#delete-files-using-disk-cleanup=windows-8</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use "<strong>Disk Cleanup</strong>" to reduce the number of unnecessary files on your drives, which can help your PC run faster. It can delete temporary files and system files, empty the "<strong>Recycle Bin</strong>", and remove a variety of other
 items that you might no longer need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: While performing disk cleanup on the hard drive if any corrupt data is found, it gets deleted and any data available on the drive might get lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not help, use method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
<strong>Run Microsoft safety scanner to find and remove any virus or malware which may be causing the issue.</strong><br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Microsoft safety scanner</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>

            <p>Thank you for getting back to me and sorry for the delay in posting a response. I followed the 2 methods that was posted here. To sadly still have the random looking files and folders in my PC's Music folder. First I ran Disk Cleanup, and while it did free
 up some space the random looking files still remained. So I downloaded and ran the MS safety scanner, I ran it first as a full scan. It found no issues, so I ran it as custom scan for just the PC's C: drive and the music folder, and it came up with no issues
 as well which I figured it would. So then I ran windows defender which I figured would be a bit redundant but I did so any ways and it found no issues as well with a full scan. I then got a license for Norton 2015, installed that patched/updated it and ran
 that as a full scan and it too found no issues. Any ways the random looking files are still there and the scans I did came up with no issues malware, virus or other. So I took a screen shot that kind of shows what the files look like, who knows if this is

            <p>Hello Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response and screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that a specific application which may be installed on your computer, has caused this change in files and file location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow these steps and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows + X keys </strong>and click <strong>file explorer.</strong><br />
b. Double click "<strong>C:</strong>" drive, type any the name of any song or an album in the search box.<br />
c. When file appears in file explorer, right click the file and click "<strong>open file location</strong>".<br />
d. This will show the exact location of your music files.<br />
e. Afterwards, you may save your music files in another location and delete those random numbered files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please keep us updated on the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p><span>I know it has been quite some time since I posted on this and I have an update on the issue. I followed the suggested steps out lined for me here in the comments to delete the files and while it would work only for the short term. After every update
 to windows (8.1) the random files would pop back up although less than what was there before. And I would then again delete them so on if I didn’t by the next update there would be more. Any ways I did a restore well really a clean windows OS install on the
 PC and then updated it up to current, seems to just be something I do every so often as habit. It has been a few weeks since then and the issue seems to have gone away with the fresh OS install. Had an update since that and no random files popping up that
 I have found just sitting there eating space. So I guess the solution to this problem would be to do a clean OS install. I know it maybe a pain for most but I am at the point It doesn’t really bug me that much anymore. Also restoring from a manufactures restore
 partition I would imagine would work as well unless the issue is there as well. I am sure there is another solution that doesn’t require doing what I did but this is what worked for me.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I cant mark this as the answer for what ever reason but for now I am considering the issue solved</p>

            No problem, I took way longer to post a response or update myself, and I appreciate the help. Also the PC this happened on updated last night and this morning it finished with no random files so it seems to be working out just fine. I tend to keep a&nbsp;decent
 back up system if&nbsp;I can, external HDD or NAS then right now I am starting to&nbsp;use&nbsp;OneDrive more as well just incase so nothing was lost. Any ways thank you&nbsp;again.

<h2>            I can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t change my gamer picture</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. I recently got a new laptop with Windows 8, preinstalled with some games, such as Microsoft Solitaire Collection. When I tried to play it, it opened Xbox Games and asked me to créate a new Xbox LIVE account, so I did. After that, I received a default
 gamertag (BeltedSoup) and a default gamer picture (green circles). However, I decided to change them, so I went to
<a href="http://live.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://live.xbox.com</a>.&nbsp;I could easily change my gamertag, but when trying to change my gamer picture, the page says that I need to change it in the Xbox 360 console.</p>
<p>I don't own a console, and I have no future plans to buy one. If I decide to buy more games, they will all be in my laptop.</p>
<p>Why can't I change my gamer picture from the website or from the Xbox Games App in Windows 8?</p>

<p>I was looking for an option to change the picture, but I found where to change my avatar. Now I'm wearing a green shirt and blue jeans in the avatar. However, there still is no option for the gamer picture.</p>

<h2>            I want to edit in a great deal of text using TITLE OVERLAY in Windows Movie Maker</h2>
                    
<p>I am attempting to edit in a great deal of text using TITLE OVERLAY.&nbsp; But even though the "box" in which you type text to be edited in as a title is fairly big, Movie Maker allows me to&nbsp;type in&nbsp;only 7 - 10 words.&nbsp;that I have 2 pages of text that I'd like
 to copy from a MS Word document and paste in the text box.&nbsp; In other words I can only enter 7 - 10 words of text for a title.&nbsp; Then I have to copy another portion of the word document I'm using and enter those words by pasting again.&nbsp; I would have to repeat
 this process a great many times to complete the entering of all the text I want edited in (using Scroll, Banner - Banner Scrolls Right to Left (overlay).&nbsp; Entering all the text would therefor be incredibly time consuming.</p>
<p>Isn't there a way to enter all the text with one copy paste?&nbsp; In other words, can't I:<br />
1) select all the text of the MS Word document<br />
2) copy it<br />
3) click on "make titles or credits" under Edit Movie<br />
4) click "Add title on the selected clip in the timeline"<br />
5) and enter the text by pasting all the text I copied into the box<br />
6) and finally click on "Done" so all that text adds into the movie <br />
7) and appears on&nbsp;the "Title Overlay" line<br />

    <title>Modern Warfare 3. Disc unreadable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jolobo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Modern Warfare 3. Disc unreadable</h2>
                    
<p>Disc: Call of Duty - Modern Warfare 3 (mint condition. &nbsp;new from box.). &nbsp;Bought through Amazon UK.</p>
<p>Xbox: &nbsp;Recent issue gloss black "angular" 250GB version. &nbsp;Bought in Switzerland, so is a PAL Xbox. &nbsp; Xbox OS is up to date as of yesterday (05-11-2013).</p>
<p>Things: I've tried:</p>
<p>- Everything in disc read troubleshooter post in this forum, &nbsp;(checked disc condition, cleared cache etc)</p>
<p>- Deleting any existing MW3 files. &nbsp;I checked for any previous MW3 demo files/save games and there were none present. &nbsp;There are however files from other CoD games there, that of course I want to keep so let these be.</p>
<p>- Tried same disc in another Xbox. &nbsp;Surprise, it works. &nbsp;This is an older early issue Xbox. &nbsp;The off-white, more "curvy" version. &nbsp;Xbox OS perhaps 12 months old. &nbsp;No internet at home at the moment so can't update to bring in line with newer Xbox. &nbsp;(Anyway
 would like to keep on current version since at least the game works on this one.)</p>
<p>- Moderate scouring of gaming forums relating to this issue, and aside from the above, found nothing of use.</p>
<p>Would seem to point to a hardware issue in my newer Xbox, perhaps? &nbsp;Although I've never had read issues with any other disc to date. Either that or I thought perhaps an issue introduced by later Xbox OS iterations.</p>
<p>Grateful of any help.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Jolion</p>

<p>G'day Jo! Thanks for all of the info and for trying those steps. That's all extremely helpful!<br />
<br />
<strong>Let's try a few more things:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Try another copy of MW3, if you're able. </li><li>Delete your profile (NOT items, just profile), clear the cache, restart the console &amp; re-download your profile.
</li><li>Delete the latest system update - highlight the HDD in your Storage settings and press LB, RB, X, LB, RB, X, then follow on-screen prompts - and then re-download the update by connecting to Xbox Live.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
Let us know the results! If those don't work, we can find another solution.</p>

    <title>Storage Spaces Memory Leak - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peck1234  say:</h3>
<h2>            Storage Spaces Memory Leak</h2>
                    <p><span>Ive been using Storage Spaces with REFS for the last year in a RAID1 array on two 3TB drives.&nbsp; REFS is appealing to me because it can determine "bit rot" and you really never need to worry about corruption. &nbsp; HOWEVER high disk usage on this array causes
 HUGE memory increases over time.&nbsp; The best way I've been able to replicate this (quickly)&nbsp; is by running an analyze scan with any 3rd party defragmenter (like defraggler) The memory size gets larger and larger with the disk usage. Any open world games like
 fallout 4/or grand theft auto; After hours of&nbsp; playing will suffer the issue. Microsoft has acknowledged this BUG with a patch weeks ago.&nbsp; (A patch mind you that doesn't fix anything without user input of registry settings (of WHICH are not there). &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Anyone else using storage spaces having similar issues?!&nbsp; What gives Microsoft.</span></p>

            Ok apprently the guys at veeam state that changing the cluster size to 64K with REFS fixes the memory issue. &nbsp;

</p><p><em>Earlier this year, Microsoft tested different scenarios of thread auto-lock feature in the Internet Explorer and other forums. After experimenting with 30-day and 90-day thresholds, engineering set out to build the functionality into the new platform
 with a 90-day threshold. Now, plans are being made to re-launch thread auto-lock as a permanent community feature beginning in early to mid-November. Auto-lock will run in
<strong>all public forums and languages</strong>, locking threads with no replies in the past 90 days.</em></p>

<p>I think that threads should contain a designation for the version of Windows (or other programs) that apply to that thread. As long as that version remains supported by Microsoft, then the thread should remain unlocked. I often find useful information in
 threads that are more than 90 days old, and I would like the opportunity to post my solutions to the described problems. Please consider adjusting the auto-lock thread without the need to request a thread be unlocked.</p>

<p>Same boat here. I have spent hours trying to figure out the issue. Rebooted over and over again. Reconfigured everything and I still get the same message - "There is a problem with your connection" but yet every Mac in my house is connected, my ipad is connected
 as is my BlackBerry Bold with not issues. Oh, and so it the Wii. Xbox - NOPE. Nothing. This will most likely be my last MS product ever. It was a gift for my son...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its quite common to mistype the WEP key so check it carefully, have you every connected before or is this the first time? Temporarily disabling WEP on the router will tell you if this is a security issue or not. Which of the wireless adapters are you using?
 black/white/internal (360S)?</p>

    <title>Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop - Sticky Key Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dlcj21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Desktop - Sticky Key Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have one of these keyboards at home and at the office, in the office I have the whole desktop including the mouse, but at home I only have the keyboard. &nbsp;I upgraded from the Microsoft Ergo 4000 keyboard that I've used for many years. So far I'm enjoying
 the keyboard but I have an issue that I was wondering if there was a way to fix?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The one at work doesn't seem to have this problem although I use the keyboards differently, at work it's mainly for typing and coding, at home I use it for typing and gaming. &nbsp;</div>
<p>
</p><p>The issue:<br />
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Shift, Alt, and Control buttons when pressed numerous times seem to stick even when they aren't being pressed. &nbsp;For example if I have 3 out of 5 files I want move from one folder to another, if I push and hold control, select the files in the 1st,
 3rd, and 5th position with my mouse, after I drag them to the other folder and release the control button, if I click on the 2 remaining files in the original folder, both files are selected even though I'm not holding control down so you'd expect only 1 to
 be selected.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Same issue happens in games where I've bound hotkeys to use modifiers such as shift, control, or alt. &nbsp;If I'm alternating between 1 and shift-1, eventually just pressing 1 will result in shift-1 being registered. &nbsp;I initially thought that maybe stickey
 keys was being turned on but I've confirmed that is not the case.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Both cases are resolved by simply pressing the button that's sticking and that fixes it, but when using multiple modifiers, it's hard to determine which one is sticking so it usually results in pressing each of the buttons, alt, control, and shift once
 until it's back to normal.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Additional Information:</div>
<div>None of these problems seem apparent on my work desktop. &nbsp;I'm using windows 8.1 Pro at home and windows 7 pro at work. &nbsp;At work, my receiver is plugged into a usb switch as I use it for 2 pcs, the switch is 2 ft away from my keyboard position in line of
 sight.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At home, the usb receiver is plugged into the back of my desktop under my desk, out of line of site? (could this be a problem?)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas you have to solve either of these issues would be most appreciated.</div>
<p />
                </div>

            <p>I've found a solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open Device Manager</p>
<p>Under Human Interface Devices, locate the Microsoft Hardware USB Keyboard</p>
<p>Right click, Properties</p>
<p>Power Management Tab, <strong>Uncheck</strong> allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</p>
<p>
</p><p>That fixed it for me, no need to uninstall/change drivers.</p>

<p><span>Hi sheryl1954, &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community Site. The issue you posted is related to Microsoft Office and would be better suited in the Office Discussion Groups.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However I would suggest you to use
<strong>Associate a file type or protocol with a program</strong> option from
<strong>Default Programs</strong>. Use this option to fine-tune default programs based on the file type or protocol. For example, you can have all .jpg, .bmp and all other image files open using Windows Photo Viewer and check if the issue can be resolved.

                    <p><strong>Connecting your Logitech C922 Pro Stream Webcam using Windows 10</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Plug in your webcam to a USB port on your computer. <em>Using a USB extension cable or a hub device may hamper your connection.</em></li><li>Open “Settings” on your computer</li><li>Select “Gaming”</li><li>Select “Broadcasting”</li><li>Choose your desired settings for “Broadcast audio”</li><li>Go down to “Camera”</li><li>Turn on “Use camera when I broadcast”</li><li>The name of your camera should show.

<p>My camera turned on right away.</p>

                    <p>About every 60 to 70 seconds, the screen will flash which will cause an interruption in any entry or typing.</p>
<p>I have run all of the DISM commands, SFC scan, I have also uninstalled most all of the applications that were installed on my system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh yes, let me mention that I upgraded from windows 7 to windows 10.</p>
<p>I have also booted from power off after each uninstall to clear out active memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been in contact with WINDOWS answer desk twice and have 2 sets of scripts which I have executed many times with&nbsp;</p>
<p>NO problems found.&nbsp;</p>

            I had the same problem, but in every 5-10 seconds and in Windows 7, so i just restored my system from the backup and the problem never appeared again. Of course now i'm on Windows 10, so far(2weeks) no problems at all.
