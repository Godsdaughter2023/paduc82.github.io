    <title>The TCP port is already used by another application &#38; System Tray - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> william_stephens  say:</h3>
<h2>            The TCP port is already used by another application &#38; System Tray New Notifications have &#34;headline&#34;, but are blank when opened, after an update.</h2>
                    <p class="contentHeader1">After a regular Windows 10 update from Microsoft, one of my applications started showing the error, "The TCP port is already used by another application".&nbsp; Changing the port number won't clear the malfunctions.&nbsp; At the same time,
 the system tray "New Notifications" show a "title", but when opened are blank.&nbsp; Has anyone else had this problem?&nbsp; Using a "Restore Point" clears the problem, but that means I can't accept Microsoft updates!&nbsp; Please help!!!&nbsp; Most of all, is there a way to
 clear this problem?</p>

<h3> ggager  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade&#39;s hidden issues with Office 2016</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my Windows 7 Ultimate desktop to Windows 10 on the first day. I love Windows 10. Then I used my Office 365 account to upgrade from Office 2013 to Office 2016 on the first day possible (9/22). Everything worked except for Outlook. My Outlook 2016
 did not populate with my accounts or data. After several hours with the Office support team, and a great technician by the name of Maxwell Leal, the problem was identified. There was a defect in the Windows 10 install that caused the Outlook 2016 upgrade to
 fail. The Mail App icon is missing in the Control Panel and that caused some form of disconnect during the Office 2016 upgrade. I was told that Windows 10 had to be repaired or re-installed. Back to Microsoft Windows support for another 3 hours and 4 different
 support techs. Each of the 4 techs I spoke with acknowledged that they knew about the problem, but had to transfer me to someone else who would help. During the last conversation with tech number 5 I was disconnected and despite taking my cell phone number
 he did not call back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know the best way to address this issue? Because I upgraded to Windows 10 more than 30 days ago I cannot just return to Windows 7 and re-install Windows 10. This is apparently a known problem. How do I fix it?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to download the Windows 10 ISO and create a Media Creation tool and then perform Automatic Repair. Refer to the following link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a>

<p>
</p><p><span>Once you have the installation media, follow the steps:</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Start your computer from the installation media. Insert&nbsp;the disk or USB stick and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to “Press any key to boot from DVD,” do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change
 the boot order in your computer's&nbsp;BIOS settings so that it first starts from the disk or USB. When you see the 'Install Windows' page, tap or click 'Repair your computer' link to&nbsp;start the Windows Recovery Environment.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the Choose an option screen, click 'Troubleshoot'.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click, Advanced Options and then click on 'Automatic Repair'.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After this complete the repair and see if you are able to boot in to your computer.&nbsp;</p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Also I suggest you to follow the steps below to re-install the Mail App and check if it helps:
</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press the Windows key and type in PowerShell.</span></li><li><span>Right click and run it as an Administrator.</span></li><li><span>Type the following in the Powershell prompt:&nbsp; </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 51, 204, 1)"><span>get-appxpackage *microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps* | remove-appxpackage</span></span></li><li><span>Close the Powershell window.</span></li><li><span>Reboot.</span></li></ol>
<span>
<p>Once the system reboots you can install the App from the Windows store or from the link given below and check if it helps:</p>

    <title>New monitor not recognized on reboot or awakening from hibernation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> teelabrown  say:</h3>
<h2>            New monitor not recognized on reboot or awakening from hibernation</h2>
                    I use a KVM switch (Intellinet) to share a mouse, keyboard and monitor between two machines both running 64 bit Win 7.&nbsp; My old monitor, which I used in portrait orientation, failed, and I replaced it with an Acer K272HL with landscape orientation.&nbsp; Both
 computers detected the new monitor, but on reboot or awakening from hiberation, one of them always reverts to Generic PnP monitor with portrait orientation.&nbsp; I have to go through the detect monitor process in the control panel each time to get it back to landscape.&nbsp;
 I've tried a cold boot after disconnecting the power, all cabling, and the kvm switch, and I tried updating drivers (I have an Nvidia GeForce 9600 GT graphics card), but no success.&nbsp; Any ideas?

<p>Hi Teela,<br />
<br />
<br />
Most often than not this issue can be attributed to the drivers not working well with the new device you have connected to the computer.&nbsp; For us to better understand our next course of action about this, we would like to know if you have already updated the
 drivers.<br />

&nbsp;In the meantime, we recommend this posted by one of our MVP, <strong>SpiritX MS MVP</strong> in this post. He outlined how you can properly install and update drivers

    <title>My Windows 10 desktop File Explorer must be broken or OneDrive is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Windows 10 desktop File Explorer must be broken or OneDrive is messing it up&#63;</h2>
                    For instance, yesterday I found tons of Duplicate docs with similar names in File Explorer that must have been created by some auto-Save process when I just went thru a long process of renaming them all to shorten their names of any&nbsp;files that I wanted
 to keep and then to carefully delete every DUP that had the oldest Date Created or Date Modified date. I did this&nbsp;to make sure that I only had one copy of each one so that when I modify it, I've always got only the latest version and also to make them easier
 to scroll thru &amp; find on my Windows 10 phone in OneDrive.
<p>But, after all of that work, today when I look at that&nbsp;whole list again in File Explorer,<strong> the old ones have all come back on their own!! I'd watched it Delete them all as I carefully scrolled down the long list and hilited any DUPs so I could hit
 Delete.</strong>&nbsp;Where the heck did they come from? OneDrive or something? I hate that stupid cloud thing. It's a pain, especially for those of us who are just old farts who know how to backup stuff on our own and trust ourselves to do it on a regular basis
 on a nice fast thumbdrive.</p>
<p>Sorry about my griping but I've got steam to let off.</p>
<p>I save my data on an internal&nbsp;D: HDD as opposed to on the&nbsp;C:, which is a nice, fast SSD that I only have Windows and my programs on. I never put any data on the HDD and I check it frequently to make sure that I haven't accidentally saved a DOC or an image
 on it. I don't save Videos or Music since they take up too much storage space.<br />
So on a slightly related subject, as I just went to work on things, I opened WORD 2016 and there's my new DOC in the upper left corner's Recent&nbsp;list&nbsp;and it says that it was Saved on my D: &gt; Documents and in the proper folder.&nbsp;But the DOC after it says that
 it is on OneDrive. Why does it say that? Isn't it in My Docs on my computer and that's the one I worked on?&nbsp;I don't use OneDrive. I purposefully only store my data on my computer and if it somehow finds its way onto OneDrive, so be it. I've had to stop OneDrive

<p>Thanks Allan. So, I'd always thought that I understood that if your computer was connected to your OneDrive and both are logged into using the same outlook.com email address, if you Deleted a file or folder on your computer, it was also Deleted automatically
 from OneDrive. Have I been wrong on that "auto-sync" idea?</p>
<p>As far as what you've said to do, I hate to say but I'm a little lost. I sure don't know what you mean by "removed your account from OneDrive". Huh?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I could ask you, could you please just give me a few steps I should do to fix this? I'd been tempted to go thru and try it all again by doing something to my OneDrive account based on what you said &amp; then Delete them all again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't. I decided to ask for help. :-)</p>

<p>Allan, let's just get me out of OneDrive completely. I'm tired of messing with it &amp; I have no real need for it nor do I trust that what I have on it will always be the most current version or that it will be accessible or be editable if I'm out somewhere
 due to internet connection issues, permissions or Settings. So, can you just give me the steps to turn off OneDrive completely so it won't ever mess with me again?</p>
<p>I'll just take it off my list forever.</p>

<p>I'm sorry to be bothering you with another Reply but I'm nervous that something I said caused you to Unsubscribe to this Question. I hope that my not hearing back is because it's a weekend. I'm willing to do whatever work needs to be done to fix all of my
 files &amp; folders and how OneDrive treats them. My goal had been to see if I could trim them all down so I could keep under the limit for free OneDrive here in the United States. So I'll ask again for help. I know basically nothing about OneDrive. It's a huge
 mystery to me. All I&nbsp; know is that I see it on my Windows phone &amp; on my home computer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you sync or link your folders to<strong> OneDrive</strong>, it will automatically backup your files. Thus, creating duplicate application. You can simply unsync your
<strong>PC</strong> to<strong> OneDrive</strong> by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the lower-left side of your <strong>taskbar</strong>, right-click <strong>
OneDrive icon.</strong><br />

<p>I'm sure glad to hear back. I'm a dumbo on OneDrive so please don't assume that I know anything. I don't. I'm too old school.<br />
</p>
<p>Are you telling me to unlink this PC&nbsp;from OneDrive, go thru my process of deleting all of the duplicate files that I find and then do the reverse somehow to Link this computer?</p>
<p>It confuses me that I find a batch of folders in File Explorer that are all the same as mine. Are those actually stored on my computer or on a server cloud somewhere? Not that it matters but that might help me understand OneDrive a little better.</p>
<p>I think that I've probably messed things up by working on files that I navigated to &amp; opened in WORD or EXCEL that were in the OneDrive and not the same file that is just located in My Docs on this PC?</p>

<p>I'm ready to give this a go today, Allan. I found that in those 3 steps you gave me to do, it needs a new one added. I don't know if you know anyone that should be told this&nbsp;if you have just Copied it from somewhere. If you just made the list and forgot
 to say my #2, that's OK. I'm just trying to help anyone who finds this thread when dealing with the same stuff.</p>

<p>So, my plan is to now UNLINK THIS PC, find all of my huge files and either Delete them or Modify them to make them way smaller (#2 SpaceSniffer is interesting freeware that might work good to find my giant files &amp; there's a Download link here:
<a href="http://www.raymond.cc/blog/find-out-what-files-and-folders-are-taking-up-hard-drive-spaces" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.raymond.cc/blog/find-out-what-files-and-folders-are-taking-up-hard-drive-spaces</a>&nbsp;)</p>
<p>This page also tells how to use Windows to find your drive hogging files: <span>
<a href="http://www.tenforums.com/general-support/16407-how-can-i-find-large-files-windows10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">www.tenforums.com/general-support/16407-how-can-i-find-large-files-windows10.html</span></a>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm a little scared to just plunge ahead. Should I just UNLINK THIS PC and then go Delete or Modify any files that I find in File Explorer (probably all photos or images) and then go to that same place and maybe it will have a UNLINK THIS PC link to
 click? This is my only computer that I use anymore. </p>
<p>I guess, if you tell me that I should, I could do that UNLINK THIS PC thing to my other home PC, a Windows 10 ACER All-in-one desktop, just to make sure that&nbsp;it doesn't somehow mess things up. I'm gonna wipe that thing clean soon and sell it anyhow.</p>
<p>Here's a few examples of the cleanup I can do so that I can get under the free 5 GB OneDrive limit:</p>
<p><strong>4.73 GB&nbsp;PST that I sure don't need since I use my Outlook 2016 in Exchange mode which keeps my stuff on Microsoft's server cloud. Even if I want a backup for safety, I can keep that huge thing on a thumbdrive:</strong></p>

<p><strong>6.38 GB folder of DOCS?</strong><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3ac6c17-1ab7-4a35-ad11-350a3fbe9691?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c3ac6c17-1ab7-4a35-ad11-350a3fbe9691?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>Sorry for the late response. Upon unlinking your <strong>PC</strong>, all files that are duplicated by<strong> OneDrive
</strong>will be automatically removed from your <strong>PC</strong>. In case that you'll need those files again, simply add your account back to<strong> OneDrive</strong> and those files will be back on your<strong> PC
</strong>again under the <strong>OneDrive f</strong>older. Try giving it a shot, then update us with the result.</p>

<p>Thanks. There's no need to apologize for any little delay. I'm sure not in any hurry. I actually don't know anything about OneDrive since I really don't need it but I just figure it would be nice if I ever need it since I see it on both my Windows phone
 and on my PC.</p>
<p>When you said "Upon unlinking your PC, all files that are duplicated by OneDrive will be automatically removed from your PC.", it confused me. When you say "removed from your PC", do you mean literally deleted from data folders like Documents, Music, Pictures,
 Videos or do you just mean that they'll no longer be displayed in the OneDrive section in File Explorer? I hope the later is what you really mean.</p>
<p>On that same subject, do some people use files when working on a desktop PC, and not just a smartphone, that are only in the&nbsp;OneDrive section in File Explorer?</p>
<p>That's too confusing to me to even think about. I can't imagine why someone would do that unless maybe it's only done if they're working on someone else's PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So, how about this major fix it idea?:</strong></p>
<p>1. Unlink my desktop PC from OneDrive.</p>
<p>2. Login to OneDrive and delete EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>3. On my PC, clean up all of my data files including Deleting any duplicates that OneDrive mysteriously made when I changed a file's name (lots of those) &amp; resizing oversized Photo &amp; PrintScreen images which were my goof ups.</p>
<p>4. Link&nbsp;my desktop PC to OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that this will be all I'll need to do. I bet this will put me within the 5 GB free limit on OneDrive. If not, I'll deal with it then.</p>
<p>I'll wait for your input on my 4 step plan.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Built-In Word Processor&#47;Spreadsheet&#47;Presentation Software&#63;</h2>
                    Out of curiosity, does Windows 7 Home Premium have built-in Word Processing (not including WordPad and NotePad but similar to Mcrosoft Word), Spreadsheet (similar to Excel), and Presentation (similar to Powerpoint) Software or do those programs have have
 to be installed through a 3rd Party?&nbsp;

            No, Windows 7 does not have those type programs built in. You must install separate programs, &nbsp;Microsoft Office being one. &nbsp;There are free options as well, e.g. Libre Office.

<h2>            Drop down boxes closing automatically</h2>
                    When trying to open a file in any program, the drop down menu for "look in" will close automatically when I try to select a location to browse. My computer is brand new and this is not a problem that just started to happen. It's happened since day one
 (only about a week)

            Well, this isn't exactly what I was talking about. When I would try to open a file, in any program at all (Word, Excel, Photoshop, even notepad) and I would access the "open file" dialog box, I could not choose a location to browse for a possible file
 to open. By this, I mean that when I'd click on the little drop down arrow to access, say, "Desktop", &nbsp;"My Documents" or "Local Disc (C:)", this drop down menu would collapse as soon as I would try to mouse down to select a location to browse. This would then
 not allow me to change locations to look for any file in any directory to open. <br />
<br />
I actually solved the problem on&nbsp;my own with a great deal of trial and error. I had a hunch that the problem might have been caused by one of the pre-loaded drivers. I then took it upon myself to go through one driver at a time,&nbsp;uninstalling&nbsp;it, re-installing
 the latest version, then checking to see if it solved the problem.....lather, rinse, repeat. After going through a few, I found that it was apparently a problem with the Realtek High Definition Audio driver. Once this was deleted and re-installed, problem
 solved and everything is functioning properly. At least for now, and hopefully this problem is resolved. Thank you for your quick reply. It's nice to know someone out there is "listening" and willing to give advice.

    <title>AHCI driver and dual channel ide driver both in device manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fly3r  say:</h3>
<h2>            AHCI driver and dual channel ide driver both in device manager</h2>
                    <p>I was running system in AHCI mode. I updated the BIOS and forgot to change the default mode for SATA from IDE to AHCI. When Win 7 booted up, I saw it was adding drivers for my ATA devices. I rebooted, entered the BIOS and changed&nbsp;SATA to AHCI mode.&nbsp;It did
 reboot&nbsp;successfully. I then entered the Device Manager and under IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers, there were 2 entries for ATA channel&nbsp;0 and&nbsp; 2 entries for ATA channel 1. The second entry for each didn't show a device associated with it. It also showed Intel(R)
 6 series/C 200 Series Chipset Family 6 Port SATA AHCI Controller- 1C02 and the next line showed Standard Dual Channel PCI IDE Controller.</p>
<p>Everything seems to be running normally so my question is this: Should I disable or uninstall the second entry for each blank&nbsp;ATA channel and also&nbsp;for the IDE Controller? If I do, what might that affect if anything? I'm assuming on the initial boot after
 the BIOS update, since the default was IDE mode, it just loaded the IDE Controller for the drives and then when I went back to AHCI mode, both Controllers showed as they had both been loaded. I'm usually in the mode of "don't &lt;removed&gt; with it if it's working",
 so I didn't want to uninstall anything or disable it without knowing what the consequences might be.</p>
<p>Thanks for any help with this.</p>

<div><span>Depending on what exactly is listed in Device Manager, it should be normal that you shouldn’t have to disable any.

            You are (or were, in 2012) seeing the two standard (parallel) IDE channels and the 6 newer AHCI channels listed together. &nbsp;If you switch device manager to view devices by connection, and expand the PCI bus tree, you will see the two controllers with their
 channels attached. &nbsp;This initially puzzled me too. &nbsp;The key is to use the More Actions &gt; View &gt; devices by connection pane on the RHS of the Computer Management dialog. &nbsp;I also have made my dual-boot XP/Win7 rig use AHCI for both. &nbsp;But the old IDE controller
 doesn't do that. &nbsp;No need to worry -- you might find a use for the old IDE interface -- I use it for DVD writers.

<h2>            Skype 8.11.0.4 for Mac - echo with Ligitech wireless headphones</h2>
                    <p>HI,</p>
<p>I'm getting a very bad echo with the latest version of Skype when I use my Ligitech wireless headphones. The headphones are several years old but worked great until the Skype upgrade. Any suggestions? I'm using Skype on a Mac. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Julie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no separate driver for the Logitech H800 headset. You insert a small device into the USB port and the headset works over Bluetooth. Here's a link to the headset on Amazon:&nbsp;https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Bluetooth-Wireless-Headset-Smartphones/dp/B005GTNZUM/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1512146094&amp;sr=8-8&amp;keywords=logitech+headsets</p>

<p>Hi Julie. The problem is solved. Recording software I use with Skype caused the echo. I replaced application and the problem disappeared. The vendor with the non-compatible software is Audio HiJack.

<h2>            Xbox keeps disconnecting fme from parties and then from LIVE....</h2>
                    
<p>Hey,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right so for the past two days now my Xbox keeps disconnecting me from parties and then from LIVE as a whole which results in me having to turn my console off and then on again only to have the process repeat. This only seems to happen when I'm talkign to
 mates in a party or private chat. From my friends perspective I seem to just&nbsp; leave the party and then go offline. It's really annoying me now and I wanna know why this is happening. My network is fine. Low ping and an open NAT. Everything else works perfectly
 fine (computers). I heard LIVE was having soem issues is that the cause? If so when is this likely to get fixed?</p>
<p>Thankyou.</p>

<p>support.microsoft.com/.../908880</p>
<p>support.xbox.com/.../nat-type-strict.aspx</p>
<p>Could also be a DNS issue. Use a program called "Name Bench" to find the faster DNS servers to try.</p>

<p>Ok those links won't work for me. This is really weird. EVERYTHING else works fine. I can browse the net on all computers in my houehold fine. Can play PC games fine. Can use Skype fine. Can use my PS3 fine. Xbox can connect but then like I've said disconnects
 whenever I'm in a party or private chat and while playing Dead Rising 2 with my mate, just disconnects. Apparently there were probems with the LIVE service the other day? I think I may still be affected by whatever the issue was...

<p>Tremlett, is this issue ONLY occurring in the FIFA title you mentioned, or is it happening in multiple games? If you're not sure, can you try a different game with your friends to see if the issue persists there, too?

<h2>            Amazon webpage will not load after Windows 10 update week of 8-8-2016</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded my nice stable Windows 7 computer with the free Windows 10 upgrade and that even seemed to go smoothly until updates were foisted upon my computer during week of 8/8/2016.&nbsp; Tonight 8/10/2016 I could no longer open Amazon.com in any browser and Windows
 had no automatic solutions.&nbsp; Inconveniently, Windows 10 has not created any automatic system restore points so I have no options but to revert to Windows 7 or reset my computer (but I will lose some programs - now called apps).&nbsp; Are there any reasonable solutions
 to this problem?</p>

    <title>No Windows 7 Screen Saver - Can&#39;t find KB911895 in updates - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No Windows 7 Screen Saver - Can&#39;t find KB911895 in updates available.</h2>
                    Screen saver for Windows 7 64 bit not working. Did extensive searching and had seen much information on a
<p>"<b>Microsoft HID non-user input data filter</b> " causing the same problems. Looked for it in Windows Update and the way they have the optional updates listed is terrible. Spent a lot of time searching through 20 updates and clicking on the "More information"
 for each trying to find it. Never did. Then I found a site that mentioned the actual "KB911895". Looked through all 20 updates and none were listed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Appears to be a common problem with wireless devices. Not using a wireless mouse or keyboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope someone can help.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Just to add to John's reply.<br />
<br />
Copying mpegs to a dvd will result in mpegs on a dvd as a data disc.&nbsp; They will play on a computer but not in a dvd player and tv.<br />
<br />
You need to author a video-dvd disc for it to be playable on a dvd player.<br />
<br />
This will be one of the options you get from the dvd burning software you choose to use.<br />

                    I have an ASUS F202E Notebook PC (without a CD/DVD drive) with Windows 8 pre-installed. &nbsp;I have tried every possible technique imaginable to turn this machine into a dual-boot Ubuntu/Linux machine but it simply refuses to allow me to install Ubuntu.
<div><br />
Anyone know how this can be accomplished?</div>

<div>Many thanks.</div>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000">Windows 8 computers have UEFI secure boot feature enabled by default. The UEFI BIOS is created for
 Windows 8 and if you need to use other Operating System like Windows 7, Linux etc, you have to disable the UEFI BIOS and Secure Boot options. When your computer is powered on, check the boot-screen for setup key to enter BIOS Setup Utility. In the BIOS Setup
 Utility, change the boot mode from UEFI mode to legacy BIOS mode (or CSM boot mode), and disable the Secure Boot option. If you don’t do both the steps, then you won’t be able to boot into Windows 7. The computer booted up as you had not disabled the secure
 boot options.<span>&nbsp; </span>Try to disable that and then check. </font>
</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><font><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Once you are finished and you
 want to return back to normal operation you need to revert the BIOS settings. The installed Windows 8 OS will not boot up, if you do not revert the BIOS settings.</span></font></font></p>

<span>I am unable to get a Windows 7 installation to complete, using a “Reinstallation DVD" from Dell. I have a two-year-old Dell Studio XPS 8100 computer, with Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit, 8 GB DDR3, quad-core Intel
 i-5. Because it often says “Not Responding” (in Word 2007, Windows LiveMail, Firefox and others after clicking on something), requiring a hard reboot (20-25 times yesterday and today) since Ctrl+Alt+Del does not do anything, two months ago I reinstalled Win7
 from a “Reinstallation DVD” from Dell (and possibly reformatted my boot drive), but that did not change anything. I therefore bought a new Western Digital hard drive a week ago, but I have been unable to get Win7 to install from the Dell disk. I hope that
 this is not a matter of proprietary Dell software on an OEM partition on the original hard drive not allowing installation of the Dell Win7 version on any drive other than the original one.

 (While Microsoft Support Article 2466753 suggests that this may result from the Intel storage controller being configured to RAID mode, my BIOS says it is eSATA.) When I clicked the OK button, I got the Dell splash screen, then “Starting Windows,” then “Startup
 is starting services,” then “Windows could not complete the installation. To install Windows on this computer, restart the installation.” I clicked OK, and got “Setup will continue after restarting your computer,”, then the Dell splash screen, then “Starting

 and chose “custom-advanced.” It asked where I wanted to install Windows. I chose “Disk 0 Partition 1: New Volume, Primary Partition.” I clicked “Next.” It said “Installing Windows,” but eventually arrived at “Windows Setup could not configure Windows to run

<span>I thought of buying a retail upgrade version of Win7. I was certainly not going to pay $200 for a full version, but when I asked someone at the Best Buy Geek Squad desk I was told that, unlike previous versions
 where an upgrade disk just required that you momentarily pop an installation disk for a previous version into the optical drive to prove that you were entitled to upgrade, an upgrade version of Win7 requires that you actually have an existing full install
 of the previous version already on your computer. Before buying an upgrade version of Win7 I went home to try to install a previous version of Windows on the new hard drive. I first reformatted (using the hot-swap external drive bay with a laptop) to an NTFS
 simple volume, which said it was “healthy.” I tried to install Windows XP Pro (from a disk I had gotten from Microsoft, since I bought a computer in 2001 with Windows Me installed but with a coupon for Windows XP when it would come out in two months). It loaded
 drivers, but then said a problem had been detected (in pci.sys). I then tried installing Windows Me from the original “Dell Reinstallation WMe” disk, but got “Windows ME Setup files were not found,” with an “A:\&gt;” prompt. I also at some point had a message
 about “No CD ROM device drivers selected.”<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<span>I have tried to make sure that the new drive is good. The person at Geek Squad took it in back of the counter the day after I bought it there, and ran some tests, but did not find any problems. I also ran SpinRite
 on it for 22 hours at Level 2 (using the external dock and the laptop). While it did not display SMART data for the drive (which is not unusual, since a fair proportion of drives do not publish that data), so I don’t know whether or not it has more than its
 share of the normal ECC-corrected errors, SpinRite did not find anything that it had to correct.

<span>Just in case there was a problem with memory (particularly since Dell replaced the motherboard and hard drive [and maybe memory modules, although I don’t recall] six months after I got the XPS 8100, because of
 what seems to have been memory controller problems, so I don’t trust Dell on memory issues), I ran Memtest86+ v4.20, but it did not find any problems.

<p><span>I tried again more times today. After I had again reformatted with the external dock and the laptop (although it said it was a primary partition,
 both before and after I deleted the partition and formatted it), I put the drive in the XPS 8100 and booted from the Dell Reinstallation DVD. I got “loading files,” then “Starting Windows,” then a choice of language (English), then choices of language to install
 (English), time and currency format (English [U.S.]), and keyboard or input method (U.S.). I clicked “Install Now,” and got “Setup is starting.” I accepted the license terms. I chose Custom (not Upgrade), and Disk 1, Partition 0. On the “Install Windows” page
 it did “Expanding Windows files,” then “Installing features,” then “Installing updates,” then “Completing installation.” All but the last of these had green checkmarks. Instead, after a few minutes working on the “Completing installation” the installer said
 “Windows Setup could not configure Windows to run on this computer hardware.” I clicked OK, and it rebooted, with the Dell disk in the optical drive. It gave the Dell splash screen, then “Starting Windows,” then “Setup is starting services,” then “Windows
 could not complete the installation. To install Windows on this computer, restart the installation.” I clicked OK. It said “Setup will continue after restarting your computer.” Then “Windows is starting services,” then “Windows could not complete,” etc. I
 clicked OK, and rebooted without the Dell Reinstallation DVD. It went through the same process I have just described. I then did everything mentioned in this paragraph again, except that on the Custom install screen for Disk 1, Partition 0 I clicked on “Drive
 options (advanced),” and formatted the drive from within the installation program. However, things proceeded after that the same as before.</span><span>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I&nbsp;suggest you to load the drivers for the hard drive controller during setup or change the BIOS setting to AHCI or IDE mode as mentioned in the link.</span>
