<h2>            Windows 10 has become buggy</h2>
                    <p>I performed a fresh install of <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 10 Home</span> about a month ago. A need to install .NET runtime led to confusion and installing several other programs one of which was designed for servers, some .NET framework
 stuff I probably didn't need and more. I removed everything I didn't need that happened to be in the normal "uninstall or change" file. But it's not all available in that file. Some files are placed somewhere else and I found them once but concluded I had
 no idea how to remove anything. Anyway, this computer has had two total crashes today of a type I've never seen. I got a white page if memory serves with a note "sorry, a fatel error has occurred and windows needs to shut down"....or something to that effect.
 There was nothing I could do; nothing to click, escape was unresponsive - so I hard-stopped it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spell check has been flaky and the mouse sometimes is slow to work - clicks becoming non-functional - and sometimes does not work. Several times the mouse stopped working on ebay and I had to close the browser and restart it and then go back to the page.
 I find often that the curser is sluggish, for example, when backing up to correct a typo, it lags behind. But this computer is fast; it has 1 TB at 7200 rpm, 8GB RAM and AMD Phenom II Quad Core CPU. All this buggy stuff was not present until a few weeks ago.
 When I first installed <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 10 </span>
I enjoyed the smoothest, fastest computing experience ever. Not anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Task Manager I see SuperFetch is maxing everything for quite a long time upon startup. I understand it is a
<em>prediction and preload </em>program, designed to make the user experience faster application opening. But there has to be something it's not doing right. I don't use that many apps. It must be prepping apps that I don't need. So I'm wondering if there is
 a way to see what applications it's predicting and thereby engaging and prepping. If I could see this and "opt out" on a lot of it I think it would help.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I use Kaspersky Total Security and I think it is causing problems. They haven't caught up and made their program compatible with Edge Explorer. I'm not even sure it's providing any protection while I use
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Edge</span>. Anything you can tell me about this would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I'm considering starting over - <strong>fresh install</strong>. This time I know a lot more about what I need to install and what I do not need. My question; is there an updated version of
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows 10 Home</span> that I should download and install, or is it still the same as it was a month ago? Any input anyone can offer about anything I've stated here will be appreciated. I've been a bit lost with all this,
 but I'm slowly learning.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since the right-click does not function properly in <strong>Edge Browser</strong> or anything opened in
<strong>Edge Browser</strong>, we recommend that you reset Microsoft Edge through PowerShell, it will be imperative that you perform a full backup and/or create a
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
system restore point</a> first. The steps in resetting Microsoft Edge through PowerShell are as follows.<br />
</p>
<strong>Step 1</strong><br />
Navigate on the following folder (Replace %username with your own username.) and clear everything inside it:<br />
<br />
<strong>C:\Users\%username\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2</strong><br />
Right-click on the Start menu and choose “Windows PowerShell (Admin)”. Copy and paste the following code inside PowerShell and press Enter:<br />
<br />
<strong>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose}</strong><br />
<br />
When you open Microsoft Edge next time, you will see that it has been reset to default. If you encounter any error, type the following command to get the first few logged events:<br />
<br />
<strong>Get-Appxlog | Out-GridView</strong><br />
<br />
Note the error code in the log and proceed <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh973484%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.<br />
<br />
Check if the issue persists.&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<p>I guess I should have learned my lesson from last time when they openly treaded spoiler territroy during E3, but I didn't. Why do they seem fixed on revealing seemingly major plot points? Reapers working with Cerberus? Seems pretty major to me, and it just
 doesn't make sense to reveal plot points about a game such heavy on story. Why?</p>

<p>Nothing really major to be honest. &nbsp;We've known that about Cerberus and the Reapers before this ME 3 demo, and of course you weren't forced to watch it other than your brain telling you that you must because it's Mass Effect 3.&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-4.gif" /><br />
<br />
I agree that I wish spoilerific content would not be shown, but by now you should know that's not going to happen when BioWare shows or demo's a game, especially Mass Effect. &nbsp;Just look at Mass Effect 2's information bonanza before it released. Half of the
 game was literally shown, and when I played it I already knew most of what was going on.

<p>Yes, like I said, I should have learned from last time. But I mean, its E3 and they're showing the first solid gameplay to be seen...of course they know tons of their fans must be watching? I guess I don't understand the logic behind it.</p>

<p>We're in the age of the Internet and social media, and to be honest I was surprised that the leaked E3 Mass Effect 3 trailer wasn't on the Internet sooner than it was.<br />
<br />
So seeing "spoiler" content in a trailer/demo for E3 is not really surprising, as BioWare would know nowadays that not much can be kept under wraps anyhow.<br />
<br />
You could gain a sneaking suspicion in Mass Effect 2 anyhow that the Illusive Man and Cerberus had a "connection" with the Reapers on some relatively small points. TIM always seemed to know about upcoming Collector attacks, which of course the Collectors were
 working for Harbinger and the Reapers, so again this revelation isn't a surprise and I kind of figured that's how it would turn out in ME 3.</p>

<p>Also, Arkham. &nbsp;Congrats lol, I think most were aware however of what I just said regarding TIM and his sneakiness with the Collectors in Mass Effect 2. &nbsp;You could just tell something was going on in his actions and dialogue.</p>

<p>It is what it is. &nbsp;Won't be the last bit of supposed major information revealed, no doubt about that. &nbsp;I would just go on a media blackout regarding all things Mass Effect 3 if you're concerned about more spoilers being thrown out there. &nbsp;I know it'd be
 hard considering we have 8 more months, but it can be done lol.</p>

<p>Yeah, the media blackout is your only sure way. &nbsp;I, for one, don't mind the so called spoilers. &nbsp;Consider this, you've mentioned that we've suspected this, and now we have confirmation, but what hasn't been revealed is, how this has happened. &nbsp;That will
 create more questions than answers so I think that the suspenseful element is still in play. &nbsp;Now when are they gonna reveal the new redesigned Jack!!!</p>

<p>Yeah I still think the suspense is still there like Arkham said, because we won't know everything until we actually play ME 3. &nbsp;Unless they just show absolutely everything about the game and story beforehand... But I trust BioWare not to do that even though
 they almost literally did pre-release for ME 2.</p>

    <title>Windows Update unable to find updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thespiralring  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update unable to find updates</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded my laptop from Windows Vista (32-bit) to Windows 7 (64-bit).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After installing, it performed a critical update and successfully installed 4 of them. It then recognized that there were ~100 more updates to install - with a combination of recommended and important updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hit update, and it wasn't able to download and update for over an hour. I cancelled the update and restarted my computer, but now Windows Update says has never recently checked for them, nor has recently installed any when it had just this morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run the Microsoft Update Diagnostic, and it comes up with an error: 0x80070057, although when I searched it up, other people's error description did not match mine.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Both Microsoft FixIt and running scannow on the command prompt came up empty - no other problem was detected.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I feel that my antivirus may potentially be the cause, since I read that if it checks a particular file, then it might cause this error, but I don't know how to make it not check that file.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any other solutions would be helpful, thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>There is nothing wrong with your computers!&nbsp; The problem is a hopelessly inadequate Windows Update service.&nbsp; Likely it is overwhelmed sending millions of 5 gigabyte Win10 files to unwilling
 Win7 computers, using the same equipment and network that normally services you and I.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From Microsoft’s perspective, the updates you want are an extremely low priority.&nbsp; They do not want you updating Windows 7.&nbsp; They want you replacing it with Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have seen cases where the green bar continued overnight and finally found the updates, then spent many more hours downloading those updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>My advice:&nbsp; don't even bother until the September updates, or be very, very patient.&nbsp; Stop trying to fix your computer.&nbsp; You are likely to make a mess of it for no benefit.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Trying to fix your computer is pointless, when the problem is your supplier.&nbsp; Sort of like taking a part your car's engine because it does not start, when the problem is the gas tank is empty.</span></p>

            <p>Uninstall your antivirus.&nbsp; Good thing to try.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are also WU trouble shooters and preparation routines that can be run.&nbsp; I would not think that re-install is necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A suggestion:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, create a
 system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or 4 DVD +Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive, you will have a precise duplicate of
 your system as it was at that point.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">

            <p>I restored it to the point before I installed my antivirus software. &nbsp;But that didn't help. The windows update trouble shooter didn't give any solution that I hadn't already tried nor did it have a tab which highlighted the problem I am facing at the moment.</p>
<p>Is there any other resource that you know?</p>

            An icon that you add to your desktop will only appear on your desktop.&nbsp; When you install a program, look for an option to install it for the current user or for all users.

            The Desktop is comprised of files/icons from two different locations:<br />
<br />
<strong>Public Desktop:</strong> Icons present in this folder will be displayed for every user profile. The Public Desktop folder is located here:
<strong>%PUBLIC%\Desktop</strong> (Type the path in the Explorer Address bar or Run command.)<br />
<br />
<strong>User Desktop:</strong> Icons present in this folder will be shown for that particular user account. The desktop folder for the currently logged on user is located at
<strong>%USERPROFILE%\Desktop</strong>, which is usually <strong>C:\Users\{Username}\Desktop</strong><br />
<br />
You may simply move the specific desktop icons from Location #1 to Location #2, if you don't want the icon to be shown for all users.

            "C:\windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts" is a file used by the windows box as similar to a linux box to define which is a localhost...you would not need a /etc/hosts file if you are on a domain as the dhcp will take care of it...but however windows is not
 efficient in handling in security of /etc/hosts file as linux does and thus results in browser hijacking....<br />
<br />
to get the /etc/hosts file you got 2 options...<br />
<br />
option 1:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
* Download HostsXpert from funkytoad.com and unzip (extract) it to your<br />
desktop:<br />
http://www.funkytoad.com/download/HostsXpert.zip<br />
* Open HostsXpert from your desktop.<br />
* When you receive the following message, click the "OK" button.<br />
o Confirm<br />
<br />
HOSTS file does not exist, press OK to create HOSTS file, Cancel<br />
to Quit.<br />
<br />
[OK] [Cancel]<br />
* Close HostsXpert.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
option 2:-if you like to get your hands dirty...<br />
<br />
all you need is a regular text file with this inside of it:<br />
127.0.0.1 localhost<br />
<br />
save it as host (no file extension please :))<br />
and if you really want to be a 100% sure nobody is going to mess with it, change the permissions to everyone:read/execute.<br />
<br />
That's it, a brand new host file :)<br />
<br />
<br />
to edit the entries in the hosts file you can use the command like i.e. elevated command prompt<br />
<br />
in linux its "sudo vi /etc/hosts"<br />
<br />
for windows you can use the "copycon" command or use the followinf script<br />
<br />
type hosts |find "127.0.0.1"<br />
if errorlevel 1 (echo 172.29.1.43&gt;&gt;hosts) else exit<br />
<br />
<br />
save this as *.bat file and change the ip's for whatever entry you need to....this should help well...<br />

<h2>            Question about Croft Manor in Rise of the Tomb Raider game, only 98&#37; Complete and Relics 53&#47;54 error</h2>
                    <p>I seem to be missing either an item or its a bug, I got 98% Complete<br /><br />Relics 53/54<br />Documents 40/40<br />Murals 2/2<br /><br />it seems like either I am missing an Relics in the Rise of the Tomb Raider game add-on game where your in Croft Manor, or its a bug since I don't seem to be missing anything, I don't new if starting an new game for the Croft Manor would fix this bug or game error, it just bugs me that I was not able to get it 100% Complete. the add-on had an updated download today, so maybe playing an new game would fix it, but then I would have to go and find all the Relics again, and other stuff which may of be either 53 items or 54, any idea if this was fixed in the update this released for it, anyway I am looking forward to the new Tomb Raider game coming out in this September.</p>

            <p>I did a little looking into this, sadly as per SE, it looks like there is no "fix" for this problem, you'll have to replay the effected part of the game in order to get the progress to register.&nbsp; I would suggest feedback to SE directly on this one as its extremely unfair.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Black Screen with Cursor, Safe Mode doesn&#39;t boot, Recovery disk also doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am having some trouble with a Toshiba Satellite P745-S4160. After I go through the boot process, the login screen is replaced with a black screen with a cursor. I have browsed the internet looking for a solution, and most solutions involve running the
 task manager through control + alt + delete. I am not able to run the ctrl + alt + del menu. I have also tried booting to the last well-known configuration (advanced), but that brings be to the same screen. I try to boot into safe mode and the drivers loading
 freezes after C:\Windows\system32\drivers\CLASSPNP.sys. I have created a system restore disk, and when I boot from the optical disk drive, it says "Windows is loading files..." and then shows the black screen with cursor. I am not able to run anything and
 I can not tell if the hard drive has been corrupted. I have removed the RAM and reinstalled it to see if that is the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I desperately need help with this. Please, if you know the solution, do not hesitate to respond.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
There is a possibility that the Windows operating system on your computer is already corrupted, or the recovery disk that you're using is corrupted as well.
<br />
<br />
You can try to <strong>create a new recovery USB flash drive or a DVD</strong> by checking the article below:<br />

    <title>Moderate emails after migrating to O365 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moderate emails after migrating to O365</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I have a hybrid deployment and I have migrated a few users to the cloud.</p>
<p>A couple of this users have access to another mailbox called Helpdesk, which moderates emails with zip files. After the users where migrated, when they click Accept for Moderation, they get this email error:</p>
<div><span>The following recipient(s) cannot be reached:</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Microsoft Exchange Approval Assistant' on 1/26/2016 10:18 AM</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This message could not be sent. Try sending the message again later, or contact your network administrator. You do not have the permission to send the message on behalf of the specified user.
 Error is [0x80070005-0x0004dc-0x000524]</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>I have then migrated the helpdesk mailbox to O365, and now when they clicked accept, they got:</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><b>Delivery has failed to these recipients or groups:</b></span></div>


<div>'Microsoft Exchange Approval Assistant' (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)</div>
<div>Your message can't be delivered because delivery to this address is restricted.</div>

<div>Then I changed the options for that SystemMailbox user to not be restricted, and they get:</div>

<div>
<p><b>Delivery has failed to these recipients or groups:</b></p>
<p>'Microsoft Exchange Approval Assistant' (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)<br />
Your message wasn't delivered due to a permission or security issue. It may have been rejected by a moderator, the address may only accept e-mail from certain senders, or another restriction may be preventing delivery.</p>

<p>I have add them in security and everything, but I cannot find how to solve it.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
</div>

<p>Hi JordiLores9339,</p>
<p>when you try to approve/reject emails which need to be checked first, the sender should be shown as “Microsoft Exchange on behalf of XXX”. However, in your case it shows “Microsoft Exchange Approval Assistant”.</p>
<p>To understand the situation, could you provide the detailed information regarding how to moderate emails? For example, do you set transport rule in Office 365 to let specific emails go to moderator for checking first?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Johnny Zhang</p>

<p>Hi JordiLores9339,</p>
<p>The permissions assigned in the on-premises will not be migrated to Office 365. So I’d like to confirm if you have re-assigned the permissions to the users so that they can have access to the Helpdesk mailbox?</p>
<p>Also, can you please provide the step by step guide about how you set the moderation up so that we can check if the issue can reproduced?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I migrated the Helpdesk mailbox to O365, everyone had access, but I have reassign the permissions just in case.</p>
<p>In my Exchange On-premises/Organitzation Configuration/Hub Transport/ Transport rules I created a new rule:</p>

<p>Actions: forward the message to '*** Email address is removed for privacy ***' for moderation</p>
<p>That's it</p>

<p>Hi JordiLores9339,</p>
<p>I’d like to share that I have performed a test in our Exchange hybrid lab, and I couldn’t get it work either. After clicking
<strong>Approve</strong>, I also received an undeliverable report saying that the message couldn’t be delivered. I suppose it is possible that the Exchange hybrid deployment cannot support this scenario at all. And I will do more consulting in order to make
 sure of it. Once there’s any update, I will keep you posted.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>Hi JordiLores9339,</p>
<p>As far as I know, there is no method to migrate system mailbox. Before further investigate the issue, I have some concerns about the case. When the migrated users click “Accept” in helpdesk mailbox, I would like to know who (on premise/cloud/external) sends
 email to recipient (on premise/cloud).</p>
<p>Moreover, could you provide the entire NDR via private message for checking?<br />

<p>Hi JordiLores9339,</p>
<p>Before moving on, I would like summarize the case now. You have a helpdesk mailbox, and users who have full access permission are located in the on premise. You set a moderator/approver in the cloud, and want specific email go to moderator mailbox first
 to approve/reject using local transport rule. However, the NDR you receive after clicking “accept”. Please correct me if I misunderstand.</p>

<h2>            Sudden black screen in laptop with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7&nbsp;for a bit over a month now, but suddenly my laptop won't boot up properly anymore. I have a Lenovo z570 and I see the Windows logo when I boot up, but get a black screen afterwards before the login screen and it stays
 there forever. Can anyone please provide the correct steps to fix this problem. All of my work is in this PC. I was told it might have to do with the fact that I did not shut it down for the night before it happened. I can access the blue screen with options,
 but I can't seem to get to safe mode. I did it once, but I wasn't sure what to do on it and it was the middle of the night so I shut it down thinking I can access it later, but I'm not able to. Please help in any way; I need to get back to work!</p>

            Did you just install Windows of something? There are only 5 or 6 updates for WMP depending on which version.<br />
.<br />
KB952069-v2 WMP9 only<br />
KB954155 WMP 9 and 11<br />
KB973540 WMP 9 and 11<br />
KB975558 WMP 9 and 11<br />
KB978695 WMP 9 and 11<br />
KB2378111 WMP 9 and 11<br />
<br />
You can check your Windows directory for the installation logs. For example KB952069.log. You can also check add or remove programs with show updates ticked.<br />

<h2>            In Windows Media Player 9.0 I have just found that the radio tuner and album information will not open. Message&#58; HTTP 500 Internal Server Error.</h2>
                    <p>Hello All.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night I found when using Windows media player (v.9.0) that when attempting to get album information all I got was a black page and in the case of the radio tuner a blank white page. This is still the case.&nbsp; When attempting to open the radio tuner I
 did on three occasions, however, receive a message stating that the cause was an HTTP 500 server error, indicating that the error was not at my end. Since my internet connection has through this period been working fine for everything else this further suggests
 that the error is not mine. Nevertheless, I did last night perform a disk check, but as indicated this has not helped. I have also attempted to find in google other instances of this particular problem: the closest I came was a Microsoft support engineer who
 stated on this website in 2011:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>500 Internal Server Error:</strong> This error can only be resolved by fixes to the Web server software. It is not a client-side problem. It is up to the operators of the Web server site to locate and analyse the logs which
 should give further information about the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case the engineer was responding, however, to a windows media player script error, which I have not received: nevertheless, the reference to the internal error is relevant, but the engineer offered nothing that would assist my issue. I assumed that
 in this case the server would be Microsoft's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using WMP 9.0 since 2006 - which incidentally I prefer to the later versions - with no problems, so this one is quite out of the blue and I could not help but wonder if Microsoft may have curtailed some the the program's services to encourage
 an update, especially since the end of WIndows XP support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, if anyone can shed some light on this issue I would appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ian.</p>

            <p>Andrew, hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You did not say what you wanted me to look at in Tools/Options or what you meant by editing tabs and why this would help, so other than opening the dialogue box I have not done anything about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did, however, in response to your suggestion to try a WMP diagnostic tool go to http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_media_player_diagnostic. The purpose of this 'Fix It' is to:
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Automatically repair Windows Media Player problems when the player doesn’t start, streaming doesn’t work or when you cannot browse or search for media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this tool could not find any problems and thus nothing was fixed. The WMDiag that you mentioned I looked at later, but according to Microsoft this simply collects diagnostic data that can be sent to an IT professional; it gave no indication
 that it fixed anything, unlike the aforementioned tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I posted my question something has, however, changed in WMP, a change that quite clearly indicates - besides the HTTP Internal Server Error message - that the problems are not caused by something at my end: it seems that Microsoft has made some changes,
 very much for the worst.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday evening I tried the radio tuner again and to my surprise something happened, but what I saw bore no resemblance to what used to appear. Instead of seeing various radio channel options that I would click on to stream radio live to WMP I was presented
 with something like a web page with a Bing search field in the centre and a menu at the top. In short, I had to use a search engine to find radio 4 FM on BBC iPlayer and to rub salt in the wound I could not play the program unless I was using Internet Explorer
 - I was asked to install the latest flash player for that browser - which I never use. If I wanted to use iPlayer I would simply go straight to it in Firefox, I would not open WMP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to the other problem, the inability to acquire album information, the behaviour of WMP is unchanged - just a black page, but no error messages, but then if the diagnostic tool is to be trusted there would appear to be no errors in the program and the
 fact that this problem is occurring just at the time when Microsoft have evidently sabotaged my digital radio seems too much of a coincidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using WMP (9.0) since 2006 and it has always worked well for me and it has been nice to have the live radio feature: why Microsoft would eliminate it I cannot imagine and whether or not I am going to get the 'Find Album Info' function back...well,
 I am not at this point optimistic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again Andrew.</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail - combine emails from all accounts into one &#34;global account&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Windows Live Mail Experts,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have multiple email accounts on different servers, and am VERY unhappy&nbsp;maintaining the different accounts. Windows Live Mail offers a "Quick Views", however, I must go to each separate&nbsp;acccount to delete Junk/Smap emails or permanently delete all unwanted
 emails.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I combine all email accounts into a a single "view" with ALL the necessary folders to maintain ALL emails, whether Inbox, Sent, Junk (Spam) or Deleted (Trash), with NO need to go to different account folders checking each folder under each account?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The option or feature to have all e-mail messages combined from different e-mail accounts under a single view setting is currently unavailable in Windows Live Mail.<br />
<br />
I will forward the suggestion over to our product team as consideration for a future release.<br />
<br />
Thanks!

            I was hoping that there was a way to combine folders for each email account into a similar folder instead of having to go to all the folders.<br />
<br />
Must say whoever designed Windows Mail did a poor job. If you don't come up with a solution, I am going to another email program and removing Windows Mail.<br />
<br />
It is poor quality.<br />
<br />
Also, is automatically show messages as read when I haven't even read them yet. and moving them to the folders of each account, so I am wasting time having to check each account and each of their sub-folders.<br />
<br />
VERY DISAPPOINTED !!!<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I do apologize for the inconvenience this has caused you, and we hope that you understand that Windows Live Mail is just a mail client that offers services to manage your email without needing to login via website.
</span></p>
<p><span>It can only accommodate deferent email account form deferent mail provider at the same time but it also has its limitations. It cannot integrate all the email account from different email provider into 1.
</span></p>
<p><span>Please understand that each and every mail provider is using different rules different settings and features that is why as of this moment combining all email address into one by using Windows Live Mail is still a concept.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We would like to thank you for sharing the idea. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>

            &nbsp; You could do it with the Windows VISTA version of Live Mail. All accounts came into one central Inbox, then you could filter past that. I have 17 email accounts for different ventures/businesses, I don't care WHAT address an email is sent to...if someone
 sends me money through Paypal, I want it to goto my 'Money Received' folder... It's really NOT that difficult a concept yet neither LiveMail 2012 or Outlook 2013 will provide me this feature.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>1. I connected new pc to the internet, downloaded the windows live mail from essential site, and started the application. typed in my mail address and password and the download process started</p>
<p>but didnt download the whole data / folders and groups (as ther are on the old pc). meanwhile new mails are coming in. unfortunately it looks that this is not the right way to transfer the mail.</p>
<p>now I would like to transfer the mail in the right way but not to loss the new mails that came in&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please advice how can I do it?</p>
<p>If i log on to my mail account over the web (not using the windows live mail icon) I dont get the same miles and folder as they shows when i start from the windows live mail icon, I dont understand why or it is to do with the wrong way I transferred the

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do not recommend that you use any Registry Cleaners, Optimizers, Driver Updaters, Tune -Up utilities, etc.</p>
<p>They may do more harm to your operating system than any good that they claim to be able to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I suggest that you read this about the program ASAP.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>PC Accelerate Pro</strong>&nbsp;(from <em>Installer Technology</em>)&nbsp;is a potentially unwanted program,&nbsp;which is advertised as a system optimizer, and once installed it claims that several issues were been detected on your computer. However, if you try

<h2>            Xbox 360 wired controller on Windows 10 not working</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I followed all the instructions on the Microsoft site:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/connect-wired-controller-computer#0aa042f2ae4745b8ade4988bd9c8300e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/accessories/connect-wired-controller-computer#0aa042f2ae4745b8ade4988bd9c8300e</a></p>
<p>Windows 10 recognizes the controller, installs the current drivers for it, charges it up, yet it wont actually control anything. &nbsp;I've tried several games known to support 360 controllers in Windows. &nbsp;I've done standard troubleshooting - remove driver, reinstall
 driver, roll back to older drivers, reboots between everything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I chatted with Xbox support a few weeks ago and after troubleshooting a bit I was told the controller does not work with games on Windows 10 (????). &nbsp;I'm of course puzzled because there's a support page for it and Windows 10 definitely recognizes it as a
 360 controller. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts??</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            can&#39;t connect to public networks with web authentication</h2>
                    My Win 8 laptop connects easily (and every time) to any network that has a network password (that I know)... However, if I am trying to connect to a network with web authentication (I.E. hospitals, McDonald's, coffee shops) I get a limited connection and
 can not get to the Authentication page.&nbsp; I am sure there is some setting somewhere but I can't for the life of me find it.&nbsp; What do I need to do to fix this problem?

Additional Information : 



Why can't I connect to the Internet? Refer (My connection is listed as "Limited") 


http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/cant-connect-to-internet 



Windows reports that my connection is "Limited."   	



This means the PC has successfully connected to the router, but the PC wasn't assigned a valid IP address, so you can't actually get to the Internet. If you're connected to a home network, try restarting the router. If you're connected to a domain network or a public network, contact your network admin or the technical support rep for that network. 



 Note  

You can only join a domain if your PC is running  Windows 8.1 Pro or Windows 8.1 Enterprise.          



@Zaki 



I will assume you mean changes other than the automated windows updates that are also network hardware/software related.... Just to assume that you are not treating me like I am having trouble finding the "any" key.

<h2>            Halo 4 Game of the Year Edition</h2>
                    
<p><span>I heard there would be a game of the year edition of halo in October, but only place i can find the game is here:</span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/productID.287980800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/productID.287980800</span></a><span><br />
<br />
The US MS store, now, i live in Sweden using a European Xbox 360, is it possible for me to buy the GOTY Halo 4 of that homepage, have it sent over here and i would be able to play it? or would it not work on my console?</span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span>If it won't work or i can't buy of the american homepage etc, or the codes for dlc, if any, included wont work on EU xbox live, then when is it released over here? will it be released over here?</span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span>would love some answers as i can't find anything anywhere tbh.</span></p>

<p>I have seen it in a few US based stores online, but there is no info about EU at all, and that is what i need to know tbh. also, if i buy it from US, will the codes work on EU live? for the DLC stuff that is. anyone know?</p>

<p>so i could buy the GOTY edition from say gamestop, or some other store that ship US to EU, then it would work with DLC codes etc over here? thats kind of neat, always thought they where locked to regions like the PS3 codes.</p>

<p>Sorry, I should clarify - I've looked into it a bit further, as you got me thinking on my aforementioned presumption... and it's actually a bit more complicated. Whilst a lot of DLC codes are not region locked, there is also a good amount that are. You cannot
 be guaranteed that the codes will work, as there are numerous factors that come in to play when it comes to deciding whether or not to lock DLC codes. To be on the safe side, you should assume that they won't work, contrary to what I stated earlier. My apologies.</p>
<p>You could always contact 343 and query this, but whether or not you get a response I couldn't say.</p>

                    <p>My son got MineCraft &nbsp;for X BOX one.&nbsp;</p><p>He likes to build, but the only thing that works is the story mode. He doesn't like that. And he does nog understand good enough English to understand.&nbsp;</p><p>I cannot find a manual on the internet.</p><p>Is there &nbsp;some who knows how you can put the building mode on and not the story mode. Or is there any one who has a manual, with steps, so I can tell him how to use it.</p><p>Greetings, Marinka</p>

            <p>It sounds as though you purchased Minecraft Story Mode instead of regular Minecraft. Story Mode is just a Minecraft story, there is no building. You would need Minecraft in order to build.</p>

<h2>            Network Speed Test</h2>
                    Since loading Windows 10 I have been unable to print off the results of my speed tests. Is this a new failure on the part of windows, the same as the failure to allow me to download Microsoft Media Player.
