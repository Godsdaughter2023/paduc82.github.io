<h2>            Cannot Connect to Wireless Router</h2>
                    My parents recently moved out to an acreage, and set up a new internet connection,&nbsp;via a satellite internet service. They brought the same TRENDnet wireless router we used at our old house (where I connected fine) here.&nbsp;I brought my laptop (Toshiba A350D,
 running Windows Vista Home Premium SP1), and when I attepmpted to connect to the internet, via both ethernet cable through the router and wirelessly, I only got a local connection. I brought up the Windows connection troubleshooter, and tried every step and
 solution they had to offer. Every other wireless device in the house, including another older laptop and my iPod Touch are able to connect and get internet fine. Can anybody offer some solution as to why my computer won't connect?

            <br />
<span>Hi CrimsonJester, <br />
<br />
We would like to have some more information.<br />
Does it show “connected to the network” in the notification area on the right bottom corner of the taskbar?<br />
Please let us also know the report that you got from the “Windows connection troubleshooter”.<br />
<br />
<br />
We have got two scenarios here: <br />
I) You are </span><span>not connected</span> <span>
to the network and thus not getting the Internet access.<br />
II) You are </span><span>connected</span> <span>
to the network but not getting the Internet access.<br />
<br />
<br />
I) In the notification area, if it shows that you are </span><span>not connected</span>
<span>to the network, we would first need to try to connect to the network and it should consequently resolve the Internet issue.<br />
<br />
1) Check out the steps mentioned in the below article to troubleshoot network connection issues:
<br />
Troubleshoot network connection problems</span>
<p><span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/33307acf-0698-41ba-b014-ea0a2eb8d0a81033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/33307acf-0698-41ba-b014-ea0a2eb8d0a81033.mspx</a>
<br />
<br />
2) Assign IP address manually and check if it works.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong><span><br />
Follow the steps as below on the computer on which the internet is working fine:</span>
</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span><br />
1. Click on Start, in start search type in <strong>cmd</strong> and then right click on
<strong>cmd</strong> in search result and “Run as Administrator”.<br />
2. Type <strong>ipconfig /all</strong> and press enter.<br />
3. Take down the <strong>IP address</strong> , <strong>Subnet Mask</strong> , <strong>
Default Gateway</strong> , and <strong>DNS Servers</strong> . Make sure to note which is which. We are going to use this information a little bit later. We are only concerned with IPv4 entries; you can ignore the IPv6 entries (if any).<br />
4. Type <strong>Exit </strong>and press enter.</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong><span><br />
Now follow the steps as below on the computer on which you don’t have the internet connectivity:</span>
</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><span><br />
1. Click on Start, in start search type in <strong>ncpa.cpl</strong> and press enter to open
<strong>Network connections</strong> window.</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the
<strong>Network Connection</strong> window right click on “<strong>Local Area Connection</strong> ” and then select
<strong>properties</strong> .</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click
<strong>Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)</strong> and then the <strong>Properties</strong> button in
<strong>Local Area Connection </strong>Properties.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Enter the IP address, Subnet mask and the Default gateway and click on Ok.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span>
</strong><span>Before you make any changes, write down the settings that you see on this page. If something goes wrong you can always change the settings back to what they were!
 Just close all these windows and you are done. </span></p>
<p><span>Pick an IP address and enter it into the IP Address box. The IP address you choose should be very similar to the router's IP address. Only the last
 number of the IP address should be different. If the router's IP address is 192.168.1.1, I might choose 192.168.1.10. The IP address you choose should end with a number between 1 and 254, and should not be the same as the router's IP address. Every device
 that connects to your network needs to have its own IP address. </span></p>
<p><span>Put the subnet mask we previously found in the subnet mask section. The default gateway should go into the Default gateway box. Enter the DNS servers
 we previously found into the two DNS Server boxes. Click ok all the way out of this menu.
</span></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<span><br />
</span><span><br />
<br />
II) </span><span>In the notification area, if it shows that you are
</span><span>connected</span> <span>
to the network,</span> <span>then we will move ahead with troubleshooting the Internet access.</span>
<span><br />
<br />
<br />
</span><span>Check out the article:</span>
<span><br />
Troubleshoot Internet connection problems</span> <span>

    <title>WINDOWS 10 SRTTRIAL ERROR. THE COMPUTER DOESN&#39;T START - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adriancontreras24  say:</h3>
<h2>            WINDOWS 10 SRTTRIAL ERROR. THE COMPUTER DOESN&#39;T START</h2>
                    <p>I need help with Windows 10. I've installed Windows 10 two days ago and since then I've had this problem two times.</p>
<p>The problem is that the computer doesn't start. After the first images with the brand of the device, the screen is black and the Windows logo never appears. I've tried different possibilities in the advanced option sección with no solution.<br />
The problem seems to be the following windows/system32/logfiles/srt/srttrail.txt. In both cases I had to restore the system and re installed Windows. In both cases every applications installed was deleted and I had to do it all over again.<br />
Please, if there is no solution I'll just try to go back to Windows 8.1</p>

            <p>The scenarios stated did not work....!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed a suggestion from CCVincent&nbsp;</p>
<p>to hide the update so that it does not install. This left the update in a "waiting to install" state?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever was in this update caused a system freeze with 100% disk active, but no activity. This has been a persistent problem since windows 10 installation. &nbsp;It is the first time I have been able to isolate (in a general sense) something that causes the
 problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But as I am typing this the machine I am having a problem with hung again and after a reboot performed an update ? and now it no longer has the KB309761 showing as waiting to install. ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any additional insight would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>And now the hidden update is no longer hidden, and again as I type this message the system hangs again with 100% disk activity..........uuuuggghhhhh</p>

            <p>Hi Colin:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply....however I had tried this a couple of weeks ago.... &nbsp;I was surprised how small the pagefile actually was and I made it a lot larger about 2 times actual memory, but it made no difference. The key thing of interest is that in my case
 it shows 100% disk active but am only doing &nbsp; 0.1Mb/sec &nbsp;and with 2 % cpu use. &nbsp;I keep getting the "feeling" that excessive activity that occurs about 10 minutes after startup &nbsp;reaches a threshold, settting a bit, that is interpreted as no more I/O is allowed.
 &nbsp;This activity is always from microsoft by Service host local system, and application host services and tapers off just before it reaches 100% disk active and a system hang.</p>

            <p>Hi John</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you looking at Resource Monitor?</p>
<p>I hadn't discovered it before. In Task Manager I notice my actual Memory running at about 75% while I'm doing basically nothing. Wish I had bought this machine with 8Gig RAM, instead of 4. :\</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what else to suggest, except:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming 0.1Mb/sec meaning network activity; Is it so low <em>because </em>of loss of disc space?</p>
<p>Hiding the update I don't think stops updates from automatically downloading. Could be wrong..</p>
<p>Stops them installing tho.</p>
<p>So, is this what the "microsoft" activity is about?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, I reiterate;</p>
<p>Recommended pagefile size is <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">at least</span></em>
<strong>3</strong> times that of physical memory.</p>
<p>Mine is set to a minimum of <strong>4</strong> times and a maximum of <strong>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry, I meant&nbsp;<em>pagefile</em> space. &nbsp;No matter, as what seems to be at issue is exactly what is behind the heavy disc activity.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>YOU MUST BE RUNNING AN APP THAT USES A LOT OF MEMORY OR YOU HAVE A MEMORY LEAK OF SOME SORT</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>59% today, so I probably had some other apps open yesterday - or something.. I can immediately see three processes pushing 200MB each, including System - closer to 300 actually. Anyway, it all adds up. Mostly, but not only, it was the GIMP freezing over
 and I know that does use a lot of memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to what exactly is writing to disc, it was suggested to me to use Procmon.</p>
<p>Some basic instructions here&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sophos.com/en-us/support/knowledgebase/119038.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sophos.com/en-us/support/knowledgebase/119038.aspx</a>&nbsp;which I needed to begin with.</p>
<p>Then, set Procmon Filter &gt; Filter (default Architecture) to Operation | is | WriteFile.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2dab57bd-b356-48b6-897f-fc97e02a005f" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Tools &gt; Count Occurrences to Path.</p>
<p>The second setting proved unsuccessful for me (no idea why, yet what I got was a clear record of what was writing what to where.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&nbsp;THIS ACTIVITY ALWAYS IS ABOUT 10 MINUTES AFTER BOOT</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Plenty of time then to set up Procmon, ready to start to capture.</p>
<p>Every record is timestamped exactly, so...</p>
<p>Saving results in native PML format means you can always examine them again in procmon.</p>
<p>I, however, prefer CSV (spreadsheet) format as the text is much easier to see. Except, if Count Occurrences worked it would be more useful in Procmon.</p>

            <p>Not really. The "conflict between digital and analogue outputs" is essentially waffle because it does not offer a solution and what you are trying to do is entirely within the specification. It should work and under the terms of the warranty HP should resolve
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the Q&amp;A for the Intel HD graphics</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.intel.com/support/graphics/sb/CS-031040.htm</p>
<p>
</p><p>Outside of warranty then I would look at fitting a separate graphics card. The power capabilities of the system limits the spec you can go for but so does the low profile chassis anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the technical manual<a href="http://h20565.www2.hp.com/portal/site/hpsc/template.PAGE/public/psi/manualsResults/?sp4ts.oid=5389531&amp;spf_p.tpst=psiContentResults&amp;spf_p.prp_psiContentResults=wsrp-navigationalState%3Daction%253Dmanualslist%257Ccontentid%253DService-and-maintenance%257Clang%253Den&amp;javax.portlet.begCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken&amp;javax.portlet.endCacheTok=com.vignette.cachetoken" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 here </a>and can find no constraints on the use of the DV port, in fact the specs still describe the port as DVI-D but list a DVI-I to VGA adapter which is contradictory.</p>

<h2>            How to free more space on Local Disk &#40;E&#58;&#41; when Disk Cleanup app didn&#39;t work&#63;</h2>
                    <p>EDIT: Added photos.</p>
<p>I've been trying to free more space on my Local Disk (E:), but even after using the Disk Cleanup App, nothing seems to free the space on it. I've looked at the storage usage on Disk (E:), and the only thing that seems to be taking up space is "Other", while
 nothing up seems to be taking up space besides a small amount in system and reserved. When I click "other", it shows me no files or folders. What could this "other" be?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>When I click on other, it just shows this. I don't know what could be taking up this space.</p>

            Microsoft is aware that previously-hidden partitions are improperly being assigned drive letters after installing the April 2018 Update.  As a result, they now appear in Disk Management and File Explorer.  These partitions are typically recovery partitions used by the Windows Recovery Environment or by the Original Equipment Manufacturer.  It is not recommended that you attempt to delete or reformat these partitions as this may have adverse effects on your ability to recover Windows.  Microsoft is currently working to address the issue in a future Windows Update, and we’ll update this thread when a solution becomes available. 
<br />
<br />(Update 5/14/18:  The solution that will soon be released via Windows Update will only prevent this issue from occurring for devices that install the April 2018 Update after the solution is released.  If you've already installed the April 2018 Update and are experiencing this issue, you'll need to follow the steps below if you want to hide these partitions.)
<br />
<br />Although you can safely ignore these partitions, if you prefer do away with the low disk space warnings and hide the partitions so they no longer appear in File Explorer, you can do so by manually removing the partition’s assigned drive letter.  To do this:
<br />
<br />1. Select the Start button, type cmd and then right-click Command Prompt in the search results and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />2. In the Administrator:  Command Prompt window, type diskpart and press Enter.
<br />
<br />3. Type list volume and press Enter.
<br />
<br />4. Make note of the volume number for the drive letter you want to remove.  For example, if the drive letter you want to remove is Drive “E”, note the volume number for Drive E.
<br />
<br />5. Type the following command, and press Enter. 
<br />
<br /> select volume &lt;volume number&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;volume number&gt;, substitute the volume number you made note of in Step 4.   In the example above, if the volume number for drive E is 5, you would type: select volume 5
<br />
<br />6. Type the following command and press Enter.
<br />
<br />remove letter=&lt;drive letter&gt;
<br />
<br />When typing this command, in place of &lt;drive letter&gt;, substitute the drive letter you want to remove.  In this example, you would type: remove letter=E
<br />
<br />7. Close the Command Prompt window.

<p><span>I had itunes set up and working since i have had my computer. One day it asked to be updated, so i did. After it updated it stopped working because
 whenever i tried to open it it would say "this shortcut has either been deleted or moved would you like to delete this shortcut". This kept on happening so I uninstalled it and tried to reinstall it, but then comes my second problem. While itunes is downloading
 an error pops up saying "There is a problem with this windows installer package A program required for this install to complete could not be run contact your personnel or package vendor". This is my main problem and i don't know how to stop it i have tried
 a disc clean up, De frag and trying to completely take everything to do with itunes off my computer, but it still doesn’t work. HELP ME!!! I NEED ITUNES</span></p>

            <p>I had the same issue.&nbsp; The fix was simple.&nbsp; Try to uninstall all iTunes related items from your PC.&nbsp; In my case when I tried to uninstall Apple Software Update, I was presented with the "There is a problem with this windows installer package A program required
 for this install to complete could not be run contact your personnel or package vendor" error.&nbsp; I ran the Fix&nbsp;it solution at &nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_and_Uninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_and_Uninstall</a>.&nbsp;
 I had the Fix it app uninstall Apple Software Update.&nbsp; After the Fix it app successfully completed, I was able to install iTunes.</p>

<p><br />
I had the same problem and spent hours trying to resolve. In the end it seems that you need to delete ALL the old itunes programs- quicktime, bonjour and anything that says apple. When i tried to do this using control panel- uninstall I got the same problm
 saying it couldnt be deleted. if you go to </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and click the run icon, you can delete these programs one at&nbsp;a time- just follow the uninstall guide. Once ALL of these programs are completely gone, itunes installs as normal. Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Unspecified error when opening explorer</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I attempt to open the file explorer either by hitting windows+e or clicking directly on the file explorer icon on the taskbar, a dialog window is displayed indicating an Unspecified error occurred (see screenshot below). This error however doesn't

<h2>            Having a slight problem with a Thieves &#38;&#35;39&#59;Radiant Quest&#38;&#35;39&#59;</h2>
                    
<p>I'ive managed to finish three of the four radiant quests offered by Delvin Mallory (Imitation Amnesty, Silver Lining and Summerset Shadows), yet I can't get the last quest, The Dainty Sload which needs to be done before I can do the Under New Management
 quest, be named Guild Master of the Thieves Guild and get the Guild Master Armor. I've read that I have to get&nbsp;five special jobs completed (I've done The Numbers Job of Delvin's and The Burglary Job for Vex all together Seventeen Times!!) and then speak to
 Delvin and he'll let me know about doing the mission. I already spoke to Tonata? the woman in the Ragged Flagon who's the Fence and I've completed her quest to take some Moon Sugar to a Kha'jit caravan, which according to the Skyim wiki, before you can do
 the last of the Radiant Quests of Delvin's, you need to do Tonata's (SP?) before the fourth one is optioned to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has this happened to anyone else and if not, is it known as a glitch? If it is... I can't finish the Thieves Guild story arc, get my Guild Master armor or get the One with the Shadows achievement. Any help?</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">you need to do 5 missions in each city to unlock the relevant quest. 5 in Windhelm, 5 in Solitude etc. It's one of the most time consuming missions to get, especially
 as they are random locations when Delvin and Vex give them to you, keep it up or try to work out what city you haven't done and only accept missions from that area.</span></strong></p>

<p>According to my ingame journal, I've done The Numbers Job and The Burglary Job seventeen times in Solitude... and Delvin still hasn't offered me The Dainty Sload mission. &nbsp;Like I said in my original post, I know that you need to do five special jobs of Delvin
 or Vex's in a city, before you can do the Radiant Quest for that city as I've done the Radiant Quest missions for Windhelm, Whiterun and in Windhelm, as well as Tonilla's (Got her name right!) quest which appears in the Miscellaneous section, Deliver Moon
 Sugar to Ri'saad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to the Skyrim wiki, I've one what I'm 'supposed' to, to get this mission offered to me... Done the special jobs more than five times, done Tonilla's mission... only thing I can think of which COULD be causing this problem... was when I was offered
 a job in a city I had either already completed or not the one I was after, I quit it, then tried again to get the city I wanted. Thing is... I don't think that'd be causing a problem as I did that for the first three Radiant Quests and it worked..</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest resetting your desktop window manager and see if that will resolve it. You can do that by going to
<strong>Start</strong> -&gt; <strong>Run</strong> -&gt; type <em><strong>tskill dwm</strong></em>. This command will reset your desktop windows manager.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, we'd like to verify the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Were there any recent changes made to your computer prior to the issue? (Updates, software or hardware installations, etc.)<br />
</li><li>Is your video card driver up-to-date?</li><li>What other troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know.</p>

            Hi! I once noticed this when I was creating a clip and I switched to my web browser (meaning that the game window was minimized and not running). Do you play in fullscreen mode? Maybe that will help. If that doesn't work you can also change the save location
 of the clips which might fix the issue. Besides that you should also check for any updates for Windows 10.

<h2>            XBox 360 reports 2.9 GB HDD free but says no room to install game</h2>
                    
<p>My niece never had her Xbox 360 connected to the internet. She got Guitar Hero live today. Game needed a update. It froze/hung on wireless connection. Shut it all down connected cat 5. She had 1.1 GB free, went to install game, Xbox reports not enough storage
 space.</p>
<p>1. Cleared Cache, no change</p>
<p>2. Formatted HD and now has 2.9 GB free, still get report that there is not enough room on the device.</p>
<p>The ONLY thing I can think of is that maybe there was a glitch when it froze on system update? Right now a empty HD and still get report the unit does not have enough storage space.</p>

<h2>            Digital Gift Cards</h2>
                    
<p>i know this is probably better suited for General Discussion and isn't game specific BUT most of the hardcore gamers and regulars hang out here so it'll get more visibility. &nbsp;Anyhooser, I've noticed that there hasn't been much talk about digital gift cards
 and figured I'd let everyone know.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Digital giftcards are available on the MS commerce site and you can schedule when they get emailed to the person who is having their day made by you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh I definitely agree, I'm just saying there were a lot more people that seemed to want it than are talking about it.</p>
<p>It is kind of cool though that you can schedule delivery. &nbsp;I suppose what people really wanted is the ability to gift directly from the game store on the console. &nbsp;I think the Wii does or did that.</p>

<h2>            Cannot install Windows 7 SP1 update.</h2>
                    <p><em>CANNOT INSTALL WIN 7 SP1 UPDATE</em></p>
<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I have tried now for many days to install the Win 7 SP1 update.<br />
<br />
- Tried regular windows update<br />
- Tried turning off the AV<br />
- Tried installing first "System Update Readiness Tool for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems (KB947821) [May 2011]"<br />
- Tried booting in Safe Mode and installing<br />
- tried update my Graphic Card driver (ATI Radeon)<br />
<br />
Nothing works. The only change I can think of was the installation of a printer about a month ago (EPSON SX420W).<br />
<br />
Thank you for any help!<br />
<br />
David</p>

            <p>Which method are you using to install the Service Pack, Windows Update or .exe download from Microsoft Downloads?</p>
<p>If possible, boot into Safe Mode, and do a System Restore before you installed the Service Pack and reference the information I have provided below with instructions about how to install Windows 7 SP1.</p>
<p>Microsoft released the first beta back in June 2010 followed by a Release Candidate late October 2010 and the final RTM availability (February 16 2011 MSDN/TechNet subscribers) and public Availability (February 22 2011). Unlike previous Service Packs, Windows
 7 SP1 does not contain any major improvements; it’s basically a rollup of updates that have been released for the operating system since it went to manufacturing July 22 2009. If you have been diligently updating your computer through Windows Update since
 then, you basically have all that SP1 has to offer.</p>
<p>Windows 7 SP1 is provided in two ways, either as a full .ISO file download weighing in at 2.4 GBs or as an update available through Windows Update. The .ISO file contains SP1 code for different processor architectures such as x86, x86-x64 and Itanium systems.
 Because I have a mixture of 32 and 64 bit systems, I went with the .ISO file. Whichever method you choose, here are some tips for ensuring a smooth installation.</p>
<p>* Getting Windows Update errors with Windows 7 SP1? MS notes "inconsistencies," provides fix: http://is.gd/22brle</p>
<p>* 1. Click on Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories, and right-click on Command Prompt.</p>
<p>2. Choose Run As and select an Administrator account.</p>
<p>3. At the command prompt, type net stop cryptsvc and wait for the service to stop.</p>
<p>4. Type CD\ and press Enter.</p>
<p>5. Type CD windows\system32 and press Enter.</p>
<p>6. Type ren catroot2 catroot3 and press Enter.</p>
<p>Other solutions:</p>
<p>1. Make sure you install the latest updates for Windows 7, your applications and device drivers. This can ensure a smooth experience I noticed, although Windows 7 SP1 is minor, you don’t want to take any chances. If you are updating through Windows Update,
 it also guarantees a smaller update since only missing patches will be applied.</p>
<p>2. Backup – you can never go wrong with backing up; this is something you should do often even when you are not making major changes to your computer. Windows 7 has made it very easy tobackup your computer . The built in system imaging and backup and restore
 center makes it convenient to back up the operating system and all your critical data. In fact, I used this to test the beta and RC releases of SP1 on my production system. This method carried its risks, but at least I knew my RTM installation was safely backed
 up and tucked away from pre-release code.</p>
<p>http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/</p>
<p>3. Don’t do it during a major project, if you have something you are working on at the moment on your computer or in the middle of an assignment or work related project which you might need your PC for, don’t install the Service Pack right away. Do it in
 your off time, such as on the weekend or when you know you can leave your PC while it installs itself automatically. My installation took over 2 hours.</p>
<p>4. This brings me to another point, which is, don’t install SP1 on a laptop on battery power, it’s a CPU intensive task and will use up most of your battery power. So make sure your laptop is connected to power. For desktop users, I strongly recommend you
 have a UPS connected, you just don’t know when the unexpected can occur. You might just be in the last lap of completing the 2 hour installation and lose power.</p>
<p>5. Disable your Antivirus, I remember installing the SP1 beta with Microsoft Security Essentials version 1 installed and received an error that my Antivirus is not compatible. Although this was resolved, your experience might vary. I haven’t experienced
 the issue in the RTM code although I am running Microsoft Security Essentials version 2. Someone reported receiving an error message about Forefront Client Security not allowing the Service Pack to install. The recommendation is to disable Forefront which
 is based on the same core scanning engine as MSE or make sure you at least have the latest version of Forefront client security installed.</p>
<p>6. Another thing you should do is a clean boot before installing the Service Pack, you can do this by:</p>
<p>* Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>* Accept User Account Control permission</p>
<p>* If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</p>
<p>* On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</p>
<p>* Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</p>
<p>* Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</p>
<p>* Click OK.</p>
<p>* When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>* After the computer starts, proceed with the installation.</p>
<p>7. Another task you should try is to check your hard disk for errors:</p>
<p>* Click Start</p>
<p>* Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD</p>
<p>* Click ‘Run as Administrator’</p>
<p>* At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f</p>
<p>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</p>

<p>Check your hard disk for errors, Another obscure thing you could try is disabling User Account Control temporarily.</p>
<p>Install the drivers for your LAN adapter (Wireless, Ethernet or Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Its possible you might need to do a BIOS update if one is available for your computer. Also, check for any updated chipset drivers.</p>
<p>Also, disconnect any non-essential devices you might have attached to the system.</p>
<p>Its possible the SP1 download might be corrupt, I would download another copy and try again.</p>
