    <title>Windows 10 Audio on Other Virtual Desktops&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> itzhalo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Audio on Other Virtual Desktops&#63;</h2>
                    Hello windows community! I was simply just wondering if there was a feature on Windows 10 that included the ability to mute other desktops. So say if I want music on 1 virtual desktop and work on the other, how can I mute the one virtual desktop if I wanted
 to that was playing the music all together? I don't want to have to go into the volume mixer and mute everything that way, I would just like to simply hit mute on one desktop. Also it would be an awesome feature to only hear the sounds of whats playing on
 one desktop at a time (The only desktop I am on it the only one I can hear). Thanks guys!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What exactly happens when you try to connect the Renesas USB 3.0 to the computer?</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message?</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Does the Renesas USB 3.0 get detected if you connect it directly to the computer running Windows 7?</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>This issue occurs because the USB 3.0 device is not fully inserted into the port.</p>
<p>The USB 3.0 port supports USB 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 devices. The first layer of pins inside of the USB connector are for USB 1.0 and 2.0 ports. The second layer of pins inside of the USB connector are for USB 3.0 ports. Therefore, to resolve
 this issue, make sure the USB 3.0 device is fully inserted into the port.</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Uninstall and reinstall USB drivers and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;To remove and reinstall all USB controllers, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, click Run, type <b>sysdm.cpl in</b> the Open box, and then click OK.
</p>
<p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Hardware tab. </p>
<p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the <b>Device Manager button. </b>
</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers. </p>
<p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click every device under the <b>Universal Serial Bus controllers node</b>, and then click
<b>Uninstall</b> to remove them one at a time. </p>
<p>f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart the computer, and then reinstall the USB controllers.
</p>
<p>g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plug in the removable USB storage device, and then test to make sure that the issue is resolved.</p>

    <title>Replacing pre-installed with regular - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> e4356  say:</h3>
<h2>            Replacing pre-installed with regular</h2>
                    Is there any way to replace a pre-installed version of Windows 7 (64-bit) by a regular version (without the junk the company that made the computer put on it) of Windows 7 (without buying it again of course)?<br />
<br />
I suppose I must have some sort of licence but does that mean I can get the regular version with that same license (using the product key on the computer case)?<br />

            <p>The short answer is <em>Yes, you can</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If none of the PC maker's utilities are any use to you [including any system recovery utilities such as a recovery partition] then you can make a Windows 7 Installation Disk [DVD or USB - I use the latter].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Requirements</span></b></p>
<p><span>-1&nbsp;A Windows 7 / Vista / XP-SP2* PC on which you can use an admin-level account</span></p>
<p><span>[* XP requires additional components- see para 1.1 below]</span></p>
<p><span>AND EITHER</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>- 2<span>&nbsp; </span>Blank rewriteable DVD [see 1.4 below - you need to manually edit the disk that's created to use it for Home Basic &amp; Starter versions]</span></p>
<p><span>OR</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>- 3<span>&nbsp; </span>4GB USB [my personal preference]</span></p>
<p><b><span>Hazards</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>- 1 This recovery method will result in the loss of all user files &amp; all installed applications and it may also remove all disk partitions.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>Links to essential external procedures that must be followed during this recovery method</span></b></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>- 1<span>&nbsp; </span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0072c6">Installing and reinstalling Windows 7</font></span></a></p>
<p><b><i>Links to advisory documents worth reviewing before starting this recovery method</i></b></p>
<p><i><span>&nbsp;</span>- 1<span>&nbsp; </span>Windows Help</i></p>
<p><i><span>&nbsp;</span>- 2<span>&nbsp; </span>PC manual</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><u><span>Procedure</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>1<span>&nbsp; </span>To make an installation DVD or USB [I&nbsp;prefer using a 4GB USB stick]</span></p>
<p><span>1.1<span>&nbsp; </span>Download the <span>correct</span> ISO file for 32 bit or 64 bit Windows 7 Home Premium or whatever version you have&nbsp;[see paras 1.2 &amp; 1.4 below] from<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><a href="http://www.w7forums.com/official-windows-7-sp1-iso-image-downloads-t12325.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0072c6">Official
 Windows 7 SP1 ISO from Digital River</font></span></a><span> </span></span></span><span>and the
</span><a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/html/pbPage.Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0072c6">Windows 7 USB-DVD download tool</font></span></a><span>&nbsp;
</span>The download tool can run on Windows 7, Vista &amp; XP SP2 but XP users need additional components that are listed, &amp; linked to, on the download page.</p>
<p><span>1.2<span>&nbsp; </span>You can only run a successful installation of the version of Windows [Home Premium &amp; so on] that is identified on your Certificate of Authenticity [CoA] but&nbsp;if you have the Home basic or Starter version&nbsp;you will need to create the
 Installation disk for Home Premium then do a manual edit of the disk to make it able to install Home Basic or Starter&nbsp;[see para 1.4 below for that edit task].<span>&nbsp;
</span>The PC manual also needs to be checked as, if the PC is only specified as being capable of running 32 bit Windows 7 [“x86” but often referred to as x32], then only a 32 bit [x86] installation will succeed.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If the PC is specified as being capable of running 64 bit Windows 7 [“x64”] then a x64 installation would normally be chosen.<span>&nbsp;
</span><i>If you have any access to the system, then you can check the current version at Control panel, [set it to View by - large or small icons rather than Categories], System - see the entry at the top for the version &amp; the entry lower down at System type
 for 64 bit or 32 bit.<span>&nbsp; </span>Your Windows 7 CoA Product Key is valid for 32 bit &amp; 64 bit versions so you can choose which one to install.</i><span>&nbsp;
</span>Your Windows 7 CoA Product Key is valid for SP1 even if you have not yet installed that update.</span></p>
<p><span>1.3 <span>&nbsp;</span>On this or another PC, using an admin-level account, install the USB-DVD Download Tool then run it with the ISO file stored anywhere on the system [except the target DVD / USB drive, I discovered, although others say that it can be
 on the target drive].<span>&nbsp; </span>The result is a Windows 7 SP1 installation DVD / USB.
<span>&nbsp;</span>The USB-DVD Download Tool can then be ignored or it can be uninstalled.</span></p>
<p><span>1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a Product Key for the Home Basic or Starter versions, you need to do a manual modification of the Installation Disk to make it into a multi-version installer [for Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate].&nbsp;
 This is not an illicit procedure; you will use&nbsp;your existing&nbsp;Product Key and you will choose Windows 7 Home Basic or Starter during the installation procedure [your Product Key will only work for the version supplied with the PC].&nbsp; I have done that procedure
 on my Installation USB and it seems reliable.&nbsp; On the </span><span>Installation USB [or rewriteable DVD], go to the "sources" folder and delete the file ei.cfg - that is all you need to do and you now have a Multi-version Windows 7 Installation USB.</span></p>
<p><span>2<span>&nbsp; </span>To install Windows 7:</span></p>
<p><span>2.1<span>&nbsp; </span>Insert the Windows installation disk, (re)start the system.<span>&nbsp;
</span>As soon as the PC maker’s logo appears, set the system to boot from the DVD / USB drive as appropriate by pressing repeatedly on the
<i>Boot options</i> key or the <i>BIOS</i> key identified onscreen at this point [or identified in the PC manual].<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>2.2<span>&nbsp; </span>After several minutes [that can include periods with a blank screen &amp; no apparent activity], wait during the “Starting Windows” screen then, at the first
<i>Install Windows</i> dialog, select the language the time-currency format &amp; the keyboard.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Then click <i>Next</i>.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fptsvaa.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pqqYNZb7iyKzMgzE52mV8fkReGmgbp7JyC0Rs65DYZcDrCFF_l-nmP6Qpi4zu3to9iWJJqIt9Eui7Z0bJDXwHGZ0vbVdH6iIQ%2f042.JPG%3fpsid%3d1" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2.3<span>&nbsp; </span>At the next <i>Install Windows</i> dialog, select <i>Install now</i>.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fptsvaa.bay.livefilestore.com%2fy1pqqYNZb7iyKz0MXTJ9-q20B9kJ4D-Jge9zDnBfpL1tZxqhQ544DkYeS0sJJPottwhBJiOed3qrqiQWbnOmYJRu-0Fwach3Kuc%2f043.JPG%3fpsid%3d1" /></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>2.4<span>&nbsp; </span>Onscreen instructions will then guide you through the installation procedure.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There is more detailed guidance at </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0072c6">Installing and reinstalling Windows 7</font></span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>2.5<span>&nbsp; </span>At the end of the reinstallation, you may or may not have to activate Windows 7.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are reinstalling the version preinstalled by the PC maker then they might have provided for a self-activation process that you will not even notice.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you have any doubts then you can go to </span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/validate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0072c6">Genuine Microsoft Software Validation</font></span></a><span> afterwards to validate the activation / self-activation
 if you wish.</span></p>

            This thread shows up as a recent article, but it absolutely does not apply to the problem that many are having with MSN Weather having died after the 1909 Creators Update (Win10, 64 bit Pro for me).&nbsp; Won't run, wouldn't reinstall, the delete method recommended
 below did appear to delete the app, as the Store asked for an Install, instead of a Reinstall.&nbsp; However, same result.&nbsp; Reinstall was recommended by the Store.&nbsp; Back to square 0.&nbsp; I guess the best solution for your 600 million Win10 users is to use some other
 app, this one is DEAD!

            Hi CYNDABELLAMY,<br /><br />I’ve seen quite a few devices have a hard time connecting to windows 10, but we can try to work through it. When you plug it in, go into “This PC” is anything displaying at all? <br /><br />If you go into “control panel” and then search for device manager, does it display in this list? Possibly with a yellow ! On it. <br /><br />Lastly, do you have the make/model of your laptop, and the exact model of the MP3 player. <br /><br />I look forward to troubleshooting! <br /><br />- C

            Which version of Windows is this MP3 player originally designed to work on?
<br />
<br />Amazon indicates it only works with Windows 8 and lower.
<br />
<br />PC OS Requirements: Windows 8 / 7 / Vista / XP (SP3 or higher);
<br />
<br />Did you try launching Windows Media Player and see if its detected there?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade activation product key requirement no skip - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade activation product key requirement no skip</h2>
                    <p>I had windows 8.1 on my laptop, upgraded it to 10, activated, everything was fine.</p>
<p>Recently I broke my windows 10 doing something so proceeded to install windows 8.1 again from an existing iso and started upgrade to windows 10 using media creation tool.</p>
<p>I thought the digital license would work but apparently my windows 8.1 currently is not activated and the upgrade is asking me for a product key. The laptop is fairly old so I don't have the product key.</p>
<p>I have no clue where to go from here.</p>
<p>

<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft

    <title>Is there a way to disable the double-tap &#61; enlarge feature - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to disable the double-tap &#61; enlarge feature</h2>
                    Double tapping the top part of a window enlarges the screen to maximum size. &nbsp;This ability has been present in Windows for a very long time. &nbsp;However, I am using a laptop and have set it so that tapping the touch-pad is equivalent to clicking. &nbsp;THE PROBLEM
 is that whenever I try to move a window, it enlarges it and it is very troublesome. &nbsp;Is there a way out of this hassle? &nbsp;Thank you so much.&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft community forums. I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Do you face similar issue if you use external USB mouse?</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>The feature which you are referring is Snap feature on Windows, for more information you may refer this Windows 7 link which is also applicable for Windows 8.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Maximize windows on the desktop using Snap</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Maximize-windows-on-the-desktop-using-Snap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Maximize-windows-on-the-desktop-using-Snap</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To fix this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they are listed. After each method, check if problem is fixed. If the problem is not fixed, try the next method.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> You may face this issue if Touchpad sensitivity is high. Try reducing Touchpad sensitivity on your laptop and check. Most touchpads have adjustable settings and these settings can make the touchpad function improperly
 if set incorrectly. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the sensitivity is set to high on the touchpad, any slight touch can cause the cursor to randomly jump to another location of the screen. To resolve this issue, lower the sensitivity setting of the touchpad using the touchpad settings.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To correct these issues, enable or disable the touchpad or adjust its settings. To do this, follow the steps for your version of Windows:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>&nbsp;</span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, click <strong>Control Panel</strong>, click
<strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>, and then click <strong>Mouse</strong>. <span>
</span></li><li>Click the <strong>Touchpad</strong> tab, and then adjust the settings. On some PCs, the touchpad settings might be on the
<strong>Buttons</strong> tab.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> If you don't see a <strong>Touchpad</strong> tab, and the touchpad settings aren't on the
<strong>Buttons</strong> tab, refer to the documentation that came with the PC or visit the manufacturer’s website to learn how to access the settings for the touchpad.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> You cannot disable the double tapping windows to maximize the Windows explorer. However you can
<span>prevent windows from being automatically arranged when moved to the edge of the screen. Follow these steps to do so:
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To turn Snap on or off</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <strong>Make the keyboard easier to use</strong> page by pressing <strong>
Windows key + X</strong>, clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>
Ease of Access</strong>, clicking <strong>Ease of Access Center</strong>, and then clicking
<strong>Make the keyboard easier to use</strong>. </li><li>Under <strong>Explore all settings</strong>, click <strong>Make the mouse easier to use</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Make it easier to manage windows</strong>, do one of the following:
<ul>
<li>To turn Snap off, select the <strong>Prevent windows from being automatically arranged when moved to the edge of the screen</strong> check box.</li><li>To turn Snap on, clear the <strong>Prevent windows from being automatically arranged when moved to the edge of the screen</strong> check box.</li></ul>
</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>. </li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

<h2>            Desktop icons, shortcuts don&#39;t work</h2>
                    Desktop icons and shortcuts work for a while after booting up but freeze up after a short time and don't work.. Restarting usually fixes the problem for a short while, but then they freeze up again.

<p><span>Hi Muniman2,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you recall making any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The Issue could be caused by some third party softwares or security software present on the computer, I would suggest you to try the following steps to narrow down
 the issue: </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Disable the security software; follow the steps mentioned in the link below</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Disable-antivirus-software</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> Enable
 the security software back once everything is done.</span></p>
<p><span>You may temporarily disconnect the computer from the internet during this test.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:<span>&nbsp;</span>Put the computer in clean boot and test</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Follow&nbsp;<strong>Step 1
</strong>in the link below,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.</span></p>
<p><span>After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software
 you can consider uninstalling it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> - Remember to put the computer
 back to normal startup <strong>follow step 7</strong> in the link.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

                    Hi!<br />
I would like to report this, perhaps, "wrong" behaviour.<br />
I have an NVIDIA GeForce 8600 GT.<br />
Running on Windows 7 Home Premium 32bit.<br />
I had installed latest NVIDIA drivers though the NVIDIA website. Currently was at Version 332.21.<br />
Windows Update, had found some NVIDIA related drivers, when going this way in a previous Windows installation, I found out that actually, they integrate then fully with NVIDIAs websites drivers and update systems. So this time, I went straight and downloaded
 latest driver from NVIDIA and installed it.<br />
After that, Windows nicely noticed those drivers, and further Windows Updates were not found or suggested, about NVIDIA graphics drivers.<br />
<br />
I had one day some serious issues with my PC, which has happened also another time some month ago.<br />
Mainly, as seen in Reliabilty Monitor, Video hardware errors, and Windows abnormal shutdowns, because I needed to push the reset button to shutdown, after the freezes of the monitor, together with slowdowns of mouse cursor and odd colours on the screen. This
 together with a failed Windows startup, which resulted in using the recommended Startup Repair, on Windows boot. This happened another time, exactly the same, some time ago. At that previous time, the Startup Repair said, that it found some error root cause,
 although, it was little cryptic, something like perhaps, changes to system configurations or stuff like that. Nevertheless, it said that it passed the tests and Integrity Repair went OK. This time, however, Startup Repair could not perform the final Integrity
 Repair, and reported some root cause of: "Unknown Bugcheck: Bugcheck 124, ..."., with a final:<br />
<br />
Repair action: System files integrity check and repair<br />
Result: Failed. Error code =&nbsp; 0x490<br />
<br />
Nevermind all that, (although it would be nice if you know something about this), my main reason for posting this is for the following:<br />
<br />
After I went to Reliability Monitor, I clicked on Check for solutions, on the Video hardware errors.<br />
After a little time, Windows came back with suggesting some actions, in the Action Center.<br />
One of those, which probably had to do with the Video hardware errors, suggested a procedure about the NVIDIA driver.<br />
The message was labeled:<br />
<br />
"Solve a problem with NVIDIA Graphics Driver"<br />
<br />
I opened the solution, and it said those stuff:<br />
<br />
Solve a problem with NVIDIA Graphics Driver<br />
<br />
<p>NVIDIA Graphics Driver has stopped working properly.</p>
<p>A driver update, if available, might prevent this problem from recurring.</p>
<p>There are several ways of locating and installing driver updates, but it is best to let Windows do this for you. Try the first step below, which describes the process. If it doesn't produce a driver update that solves the problem, then try the remaining
 steps in the order given.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>

<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwer.microsoft.com%2fResponses%2finclude%2fimages%2fright.gif" />What is a driver?</p>
</span><br />
So, I began by taking the steps one after another, from top to bottom as suggested.<br />
The number 1. options when expanded, said:<br />
<br />
<div>
<p>Even if all critical updates have been installed on your computer, optional updates might be available for NVIDIA Graphics Driver that have yet to be installed. Here's how to use Windows Update to check for and install optional driver updates:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>a. Tap or click to open Windows Update in Control Panel</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>b. In the left pane, tap or click <b>Check for updates</b> to see if there are any optional updates available for your computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>c. If optional updates are available, tap or click the link to view and select the updates to install. (If you don't see this link, you might have to tap or click
<b>Check online for updates from Microsoft Update</b>).</p>
<p>If no optional updates are available, go to step 2.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>d. Select the optional updates you want to install (especially if they appear to be graphics related), tap or click
<b>OK</b>, and then tap or click <b>Install updates</b>.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
</div>
This procedure, did not produce any results. I checked for Updates but there was none found.<br />
So the issue I am going to report here, has to do with option number 2.<br />
Option 2, when expanded, said:<br />
<br />
<div>
<p>If no optional NVIDIA Graphics Driver updates were available in Windows Update, you can try updating NVIDIA Graphics Driver manually.
</p>
<p><b>Note</b><br />
It's best to let Windows install drivers for your hardware automatically, as described in step 1 above.</p>
<p>If you decide to manually update , here's how to do it:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>a. Tap or click to open Device Manager&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>b. In <b>Device Manager</b>, double-tap or double-click <b>Display adapters</b>, and then double-tap or double-click the name of the device running NVIDIA Graphics Driver.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>c. Tap or click the <b>Driver</b> tab, and then tap or click <b>Update Driver</b>.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>d. When asked how you want to search for driver software, tap or click <b>Search automatically for updated driver software</b>.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>e. Windows will locate and install a new driver if one is available. </p>
</div>
<br />
When I followed the above procedure, this "wrong" thing happened.<br />
Windows said, that it Updated the Driver successfully.<br />
It installed, an older driver in place of my latest 332.21 NVIDIA driver that I had installed from NVIDIA.<br />
I can confirm that the driver was 332.21, as when I saw the Driver Tab it had:<br />
<br />
Driver Version: 9.18.13.3221<br />
<br />
The specific driver that Windows Device Manager installed was:<br />
<br />
NVIDIA GeForce 8600 GT (Microsoft Corporation - WDDM v1.1)<br />
<br />
General Tab<br />
<br />
Device type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Display adapters<br />
Manufacturer: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NVIDIA<br />
Location:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PCI bus 5, device 0, function 0<br />
<br />
Driver Tab<br />
<br />
Driver Provider:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NVIDIA<br />
Driver Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 14-May-09<br />
Driver Version:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.15.11.8593<br />
Digital Signer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft Windows<br />
<br />
After that, my NVIDIA 332.21 driver, were listed in Add/Remove Programs, but I did not check to see if it works, for example if it could be uninstalled.
<br />
But, at least, I could report, that in Control Panel, there was this NVIDIA Control Panel, which I clicked, but nothing happened.<br />
It did not open the NVIDIA Control Panel.<br />
So, I report all this, because I feel that it is wrong behaviour.<br />
A question that came to my mind for example is, why did Windows update the Graphics driver, through Device Manager, when the current NVIDIA driver, was newer than the one which Device Manager installed?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.<br />
Appreciate your thoughts and suggestions on this.<br />
Perhaps, something might be done, if this above behaviour is not as it should be.<br />
Cheers!<br />

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Suppose you have connected a device with your computer, Windows 7 / Vista will now automatically search for the driver and install it. If you want to select every driver manually(because you have a manual driver that is better), then you should disable automatic
 driver installation. To do this you don’t need to install any software at all, you can do this using
<strong>Windows Driver Settings.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>Here is what you need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Start–&gt;Search type in gpedit.msc</li><li>Click the file to open the Local Group Policy Editor and show Windows who is in control!!</li><li>You want to go here: Computer Configuration-&gt;Administrative Templates-&gt;System-&gt;Device Installation. Click on the subfolder Device Installation on the left and on the right side you will see the possible restrictions.</li><li>Right Click on Prevent Installation of Devices not described by other policy settings and edit this option, set it on ENABLED.<br />
Reboot Windows and enjoy its inability to pollute your system with its standard driver, open gpedit.msc again and revert the change so you will be able to install your driver.</li></ul>

            HI JohnsonJames2011,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info, but I unfortunately have Home Premium, so Group Policy Editor is not available for me. Nevertheless, I have found something similar to what you say:<br />
<br />
Control Panel-&gt;Deviced and Printers-&gt;Right Click on Computer-&gt;Device installation settings.<br />
<br />
I thought hard to what I should put here.<br />
Please if you could give a suggestion and I might think about it.<br />
Before, when playing with the NVIDIA Drivers as said in my post, I had it to never install drivers software from Window Update.<br />
Now I changed it to the Recommended setting of Yes, do this automatically.<br />
I noticed this change, when I recently uninstalled my NVIDIA driver, and then upon reboot, Windows automatically installed the Driver that I mentioned in my post above.<br />
That was not bad behaviour although it could be avoided.<br />
Neverthess, after the next reboot, I installed the latest NVIDIA normally.<br />
Now, Windows understands that I have the NVIDIA latest driver, so this automatic driver software from Windows Update, has not in any way interfered or suggested some other driver.<br />
Also, I think that I want this automatic driver software from Windows Update, because I want my devices to have nice drivers and new ones.<br />
<br />
Still, I think, that the problem that I described in my post above, remains.<br />
And surely, it would be better for example, if Windows did not suggest the step 2 of manually updating the Driver through Device Manager. Because it went and installed an older driver, which of course contradicts the whole point of clicking on *Update* Driver.<br />
For me, it would be better, for example, if the step 2 was not there at all and we went straight for step 3 or 4.<br />
Also, as an important notice, I would like to mention, that I went to read a little bit the Release Notes and information PDF of the NVIDIA driver 332.21:<br />
<br />
http://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/332.21/332.21-win8-win7-winvista-desktop-release-notes.pdf<br />
<br />
Somewhere there, it was mentioned:<br />
<br />
<div>Uninstalling Drivers Using Device Manager is not Supported<br />
Issue<br />
<br />
<div>On all supported versions of Microsoft Windows, uninstalling the NVIDIA driver using
<div>the Windows Device Manager may not remove associated files or applications.<br />
<br />
<div>Explanation<br />
<br />
<div>Microsoft has confirmed that this behavior is by design. If you wish to uninstall the
<div>NVIDIA driver, it is recommended that you do so using Add and Remove programs.</div>
<br />
<div>See the Microsoft KB article 2278714:<br />
<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2278714/en-us<br />
<br />
Of course, here it is saying about UNINSTALLING drivers, whereas my problem in this post, has to do with UPDATING a driver. Neverthess, they both have to do with Device Manager.<br />
<br />
As you can see, clearly, the step 2 should not be suggested perhaps.<br />
What do you think?<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            <p>Hello Markos,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for&nbsp;updating&nbsp;this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, the Windows update picks up the latest driver edition that is compatible with your system&nbsp;configuration. So, I would recommend you to visit the system manufacturer's website and install the latest&nbsp;graphics driver that is available at their support
 page to ensure your system is updated with the latest version and that your system does not experience any random crash dumps or blue screens (BSODs).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please post back for any other queries. We'll be glad to assist you further.</p>

<br />
EEE Hmm.<br />
Nothing its just a Hewlett-Packard (HP) Desktop PC.<br />
Running: Windows 7 SP1 Home Premium.<br />
<br />
Actually, in the HPs website, there are not any drivers for Windows 7.<br />
But, I download my graphics drivers from NVIDIA:<br />
<br />
Thanks though. Now, my system has not experienced any serious issues till those freaky moments that I mentioned above some time ago. The scary thing is, that it happened exactly the same, after format and reinstallation of Windows. So, maybe there is something
 with some software?<br />
Dont know. hope that in future I dont see again same BSODs, and stuff.<br />
<br />
Still, this post is relevant, and perhaps, Microsoft could do something about this in the future Windows. Of course, its just a minor issue, and it involves changing the solution procedure offered for updating the NVIDIA graphics driver.<br />

            <p>Hi Markos,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your update on the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check the model no. of your system, you, may follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> button, type <strong>msinfo32</strong> in the Start search and hit ENTER.</li><li>Check for&nbsp;the&nbsp;<strong>System model</strong>, in the list of System summary.</li></ol>
<p>It's good to know that you got your issue resolved. However, to check&nbsp;for compatible drivers for your system, you must look for the latest drivers updated on the
<em>system</em> manufacturer's website. After obtaining the system model for your HP PC from the above mentioned steps, you may search for the drivers by entering&nbsp;the model number (product name or number) in the following link:</p>

I live in Serbia.<br />
The modem is from cisco... uhm, I couldn't find the model number because... China. Maybe 1500-03yp000. But probably not.<br />
I have the D-link DIR-600 router<br />
I haven't the slightest clue what UPnP is, but I've tried both ways I think.<br />
I've no NAT error<br />
The console simply says that it couldn't resolve DNS server names. (Don't even bother telling me to try turning it off and back on again. I tried it countless times by now.)</p>
<p>W: 0000 - 0021<br />
X: 0000 - F001<br />
Y: 0000 - 0000<br />
Z: 8015 - 1903<br />
ID: FFFF - FFFF<br />
L: 8015 - 1903<br />
Q: 8007 - 0435<br />
T: Wireless<br />
D: 192.168.0.1<br />
S:WPA2<br />
C: 1</p>
<p>Getting pretty tired of restarting and stuff. I've like a dozen other wireless devices that work perfectly fine with the router.<br />
I suppose it's also worth mentioning that the console can connect to my computer with no problem whatsoever. Just not the internet. Via wired and wireless methods. Even tried hooking it up to the modem directly. No luck. And don't try that "probably just not
 available in Serbia" thing, because my friends have it with the same ISP. Any help is much appreciated. If you know something usefull, please do tell here or at my E-mail address *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

                    <p>I've also been having trouble with this update as many many many others have. I downloaded the manual update for x64 I ran all the updates in it except 2919355 rebooted my system then tried running 2919355 it tells me it's already installed. I go to windows
 update in control panel and check for updates and it shows up again and is not in my install history except as fails... and is not in the installed list either... is it installed or not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS the search installed needs to recognize when a person tries to type in KB#### so it's easier to find out if you have something installed or not without having to go through them all individually.

                    <p>Creators Update installed itself last night on shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting up today, my Microsoft Bluetooth Mouse 3600 cannot be seen to pair anymore.&nbsp; It can see my other BT devices (Sony Bluetooth speaker and headphones) but not my mouse.&nbsp; It was working fine prior to the update, under both Windows 7 &amp; Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried also to pair with a Motorola BT mouse, but again the mouse is just not "seen" to pair with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been into Device Manager and removed the BT mouse driver, rebooted, then re-installed it, but neither mouse still cannot be seen.&nbsp; I'm stuck and really don't want to revert to a wired mouse as both my USB ports are in use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried Windows Update, driver updates etc. to no avail. &nbsp;</p>

            I'm not surprised you are having trouble with Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.

<p>Thanks, I may just do that.&nbsp; I don't consider myself an "early adopter" as the update was pushed out to me. I didn't even realise it was doing the Creators Update until I shutdown .&nbsp; I though the update was going to be just a small security patch!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to try with another BT mouse from work, and if that fails, I'm downgrading.&nbsp;</p>

            If you rollback, see how you can block the update from automatically installing again.

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. Usually this is either a need for updated drivers (though you did try in Device Manager) or something else interfering with the process.
<br />
<br />Try manually downloading and installing the latest drivers.
<br />
<br />Microsoft Mobile Mouse 3600 - drivers - set to your version of Windows.
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/mice/bluetooth-mobile-mouse-3600/pn7-00001#techspecs-connect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/pro...</a> 
<br />
<br />It would also be a good idea to update the BIOS, chipset drivers, and any Bluetooth drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site.
<br />
<br />========
<br />
<br />More troubleshooting which I would do anyway :
<br />
<br />If using an SSD or hybrid hard drive be sure it has the latest firmware.
<br />
<br />Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a process of elimination :
<br />
<br />Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin)   OR   Windows PowerShell (Admin) - at the prompt type in 
<br />
<br />MSCONFIG 
<br />
<br />and hit enter

<br />
<br />========
<br />
<br />Do all of these :
<br />
<br />If you had a 3rd party antivirus on the OS you upgraded OR if you have one now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype out there Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are true superstars.

<br />Tips to improve PC performance in Windows 10 &lt;-- read this link

<br />
<br />The below is additional help with some of the methods in the "Tips to improve...." link.
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)  OR  Windows PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />(Run these one line at a time.)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS and drivers.
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<p>Thanks for the help, but the first thing I checked was I had the latest BIOS &amp; drivers.&nbsp; The BT uses the same chipset &amp; drivers as WiFi (which is fine) and that's fine so it's not completely broken drivers per se - and they were fine prior to the Creators
 Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's obviously nothing fundamentally wrong with the BT stack, as it can connect to audio output devices just fine.&nbsp; It just doesn't "see" any BT mouse devices I have. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the Control Panel &gt; Troublshooter for Bluetooth and that didn't help, thinks BT is working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an FYI, the mouse pairs okay with my Surface Pro 3 which doesn't have the Creators Update yet, so it's not a broken mouse.</p>

            Well I definitely would manually install those drivers.
<br />
<br />It is the BIOS and chipset drivers for the motherboard to which I am referring.
<br />
<br />Since the mouse pairs with the Surface that does indicate that either it is a driver issue or something is interfering with mouse. I have seen this issue several times with other BT mice and devices and the methods I posted usually do help correct them.

<p>Thanks, as I stated, I already checked the motherboard BIOS &amp; chipset drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try some other BT mice and see how I get on.</p>

<p>I tired some more BT devices but still couldn't see anything to pair.&nbsp; I also found that on hibernation the PC wouldn't wake up the display, requiring me to pull the plug on a number of occasions.&nbsp;Hibernation&nbsp;used to work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rolled back to the pre-Creators Update Windows 10 and everything is working again - Bluetooth, hibernation etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your trying to help, the assistance is appreciated even if it wasn't successful.</p>
