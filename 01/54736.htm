            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            &nbsp;Hi Bill Metallinos,
<div><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community!!!</div>
<div><br />
Based on your post I understand that while installing display driver and kasperky you are unable to use your keyboard, it would be grateful if you can reply to this question in order to assist you further.</div>
<div><br />
1. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?<br />
2. Is it confined only while installing display driver and kasperky? </div>
<div><br />
The Code 10 error code is generated when Device Manager has insufficient information or the error that is bubbled up by the device drivers is not recognized by Device Manager. Additionally, this error may occur when one of the drivers that the device needs
 does not start. If many drivers are being used by a particular device, it can be difficult to determine the one that failed.</div>
<div><br />
I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it helps.</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>Run the following troubleshooter and check if it helps.</div>
<div><br />
a) Press Windows Key +R, type Control Panel.<br />
b) Type troubleshooting in the search bar, click on troubleshooting.<br />
c) Click on Hardware and Sound, click on Hardware and Devices.<br />
d) Follow the steps from the wizard to run the troubleshooter.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to perform a clean boot and then try to update the drivers and install kasperky and check if it helps.</div>
<div>Clean Boot will check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</div>
<div>Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</div>
<div><br />
Step 1: </div>
<div>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.<br />
d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.<br />
e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.<br />
f) On the ‘Startup’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.<br />
g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</div>
<div><br />
Step 2: Enable half of the services<br />
a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.<br />
b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.<br />
c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.<br />
d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</div>
<div><br />
Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</div>
<div><br />
Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</div>
<div><br />
Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns<br />
If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</div>
<div><br />
Step 6: Resolve the problem<br />
After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</div>
<div><br />
Step 7: <br />
Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</div>
<div><strong><br />
<br />
Update Driver:</strong></div>
<div><br />
a. Drag the mouse to bottom left corner and right-click on the ‘Start icon’.<br />
b. Select ‘device manager’<br />
c. In Device Manager, locate the device you want to update, and then double-click the device name.<br />
d. Click the ‘Driver’ tab, and then click ‘Update Driver’ and follow the screen instructions.</div>
<div><br />

<p>Hello, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0a6a6ddd-fc7c-416a-9297-8e4b586303fc" title="AsifKhan1">
AsifKhan1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>A few thoughts to consider here ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, if you use Skype and have a Skype account, <em><strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10384/why-has-my-credit-debit-card-been-charged-when-i-haven-t-made-a-skype-purchase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">fraud reports can be filed directly
 with Skype Customer Service</a></strong></em>. However, note that once you flag your Skype account or payment method as having been used fraudulently, Skype will likely suspend or block your account to prevent further fraud, leaving your account disabled for
 use, as a result of <em><strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA341/what-is-a-chargeback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the charge-back process</a></strong></em> to recover funds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, if you do not use Skype, and do not use the payment method for anything related to Microsoft, then there is no need to contact Skype directly. Simply contact your payment method (e.g. credit card company, banking institution) to report the unauthorized
 charges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype does not host a call center, so there is no phone number to share with you. Neither does Skype use a general or generic "contact us" email address.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Elaine</p>

            Hi Chumbosk, a lot of users are reporting problems with the Store app in version 1803! 
<br />
<br />Please try this: 
<br />
<br />Open the Windows Store 
<br />
<br />Click your User Icon and choose Sign out 
<br />
<br />Search for an App you want to download and click 'Get' 
<br />
<br />Sign back into your Account 
<br />
<br />Can you now download that App?

    <title>Please reconnect your controller - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Please reconnect your controller</h2>
                    Hey guys I have recently been having some problems with my new xbox 360. Basically my controller kept shutting off, so after a few frustrating experiences I sent it back for a replacement. Then to my dismay, the new controller I received did exactly the
 same. So I decided to test it out with a borrowed controller, which also did the same. I'm kind of guessing it's the 360 at this point but if it is something to do with the receiver in the 360 would it really cause the controller to shut off? Wouldn't it just
 disconnect but stay on? I'd at least like to understand what exactly the issue is and possibly save myself the cash and hassle of posting everything back to the (online) retailer for a replacement. Things that seem to make controller shut off more frequent:
 -Vibration enabled -Playing online Help appreciated Ace

<p>Hey there</p>
<p>Welcome to the forums</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Would you also be able to try a different battery pack to see if that fixes the issue. If not, then follow the instructions by chRuNcHy, or buy a new controller.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Hope this helps, </p>

<p>this has only happened since upgrading to windows 10 it has worked fine for 5+ years on windows 7 so surely the motherboard has the capacity</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run windows 10 pro build 15063.483 version 1703</p>
<p>asus tek board P8H67-M PRO</p>
<p>intel core i5 2500 processor</p>
<p>16gb ram 64 bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>as from the specs you will be able top tell if this is a desktop or a laptop but of course it is a desktop and is custom built with the above motherboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>no error messages encountered&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>trouble shooting came back with scan disk which was completed to no avail</p>
<p>
</p><p>no changes to bios,&nbsp;Basic Input/Output System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>western digital and Toshiba hdds</p>
<p>
</p><p>no ssd installed</p>
<p>
</p><p>and the power supply can more than accommodate my devices</p>
<p>
</p><p>as I said it has worked fine for 5+ years and fine on windows 7&nbsp; and fine on windows 10 for over a year</p>

    <title>Can we switch the Function Fn key to work in reverse so when it&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul kepp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can we switch the Function Fn key to work in reverse so when it&#39;s light is off it does f1-f12, instead of using the media playbacks I rarely use&#63;</h2>
                    Just like the question states, the regular function keys are much more useful and mainstream and I'd like those to be the defaults instead of having to have a bright light constantly from my keyboard?<br />
<br />
I know, I'm picky but this would be nice.<br />
<br />
Also, is there any software or areas for activating specific customizations besides Action Center? I've only had this tablet for a few days now and trying to setup the way I like to work.

<p><span><span>There are certain services which do not run in safe mode, for instance,&nbsp;<strong>windows installer service</strong>, which does not run

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Remote Access Connection Manager Service</span></strong></span><span><span>

<p><span><span>I’d suggest you to try and start the service in normal mode and see if that fixes the issue.</span></span></p>

            Hi Alfonso,<br />
<br />
There is likely some incompatibility between the CD and the CDROM drive on the computer in question. You had a great idea trying to copy the files with the other computer. We just need to expand on that.<br />
<br />
You mentioned 'Data 1' and 'Data 2'. Some programs require the folder to be named the exact same as the name on the CD. Here is how to do this.<br />
When you have the first CD in the computer that the game works on. Look in My Computer and see what the name of the CD is. It might be simply 'Data 1'. Create a folder with that name. Make sure it is exact! Do the same for the second disk. Copy both onto a
 USB drive...likely what you did. :-) Now try the install.<br />
<br />
A second option if you are on a network, is to share out the CDROM drive on the computer that works 'Computer 2'. Create a Mapped Network drive on the 'Computer 1'&nbsp;and then do your install.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you have questions and what happens<br />
Thanks!

<h2>            My account is really messed up.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have some bad problem.</p>

<p>I recently tried to purchase something(well not actually purchase, tried to get free game for gold member)</p>
<p>but i failed saying that I'm too young too buy this content. Not only free game for gold, other game like</p>
<p>Nike sport for Kinect(All aged). They didn't even asked me for parent account.</p>
<p>Also, when i try to change setting like "privacy and online setting", they ask for parent account.</p>

<p>But in xbox 360, I get full control. Everything i do, it's not restricted. They don't ask for parent account, no error message like you are young.</p>
<p>In xbox.com's privacy and online setting, i'm set as adult. Also in console, i don't see option like promote to adult.</p>
<p>I also registered my credit card to validate myself.</p>

<p>I'm trying to say something is really messed up with my account.</p>
<p>I believe synchronization between xbox 360 and xbox.com is wrong.</p>
<p>I get full permission in console unlike xbox.com.</p>

<p>It's not that big problem but it's really annoying since when i try to change certain setting, i have to put parent account.</p>
<p>When i try to add something to download list, i get rejected(they don't even ask for parent account unlike changing setting. Just rejected right away)</p>

<p>Long time ago, i created account. I think it was underaged. I didn't care about it because at that time, i got halo 2 from my friend and all i want was play game as fast as i can. They asked me for parental account, so i created parent account by myself
 and applied it. Both of these accounts were created with fake information. Now I transferred that account to my primary account (birthday set to 1990. September 10). Maybe, something wrong happened during this procedure.</p>

<p>I have tried Xbox Chat Support(not ambassador) 5 times but none of them were able to solve my problem.</p>


<p>Please don't say things like this. I already heard many times from support.</p>
<p>Like 'if you don't see it in your console, it means you are not eligible' &gt;&gt; then why do i get full control in console</p>
<p>'your parent account is younger than your primary account' &gt;&gt; I double checked it. It's not the answer.</p>
<p>'add paypal account instead of credit card' &gt;&gt; I'm currently living in South Korea. They don't offer paypal option.</p>
<p>'I-PIN verificatoin. Did you completed it' &gt;&gt; Yes i did.</p>

<p>The Xbox console in relation to Xbox.com is having a lot of troubles right now (moreso XBOX LIVE), what some people are experiencing (including me) is that we cannot change bios, names and mottos on the console but can through Xbox.com. In your case, this
 is happening the other way round (vice-versa). Considering you do not want to chat to Xbox Support on the phone, all I can really suggest is that you PM one of the main Forums Support agents with a link to this thread and they'll be at your assistance right
 away; in the mean time I would recommend trying to talk with an ambassador to see if they provide an alternate solution.</p>
<p>In the mean time, I do hope everything gets sorted!</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>You summarized everything correctly.</p>
<p>I created 2 accounts(1 parent, 1 child). I see myself that i'm already promoted to adult account but i'm treated as child</p>
<p>(it's my predictions. Base on what's happening to me)</p>
<p>I already tried the link that you provided and they are showing me that i'm adult.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm already promoted to the adult. That could be the reason why i'm not seeing promote to adult option. However, they are not recognizing it i believe.</p>
<p>And like user "Reincrease" said, &nbsp;can you link it to Forum Support agents?</p>

<p>Hm...I have negative feeling with xbox support(well not the forum. I meant live chat.) right now.</p>
<p>They are saying same things over and over again.</p>
<p>They are saying like everything should be fine as long as you follow us and don't do something wrong.</p>
<p>Well, they are wrong. I did everything as they ordered me. No hope.</p>

<p>Thank you for coming to help me.</p>
<p>I would like to use phone support but since i'm living in outside of U.S. I think i will use it as final solutions.</p>
<p>However, I'm not sure about using phone support.</p>
<p>Last time when I was using live chat support, assistant called since we were treating with(credit card) sensitive information.</p>
<p>But he called me anyway. Does it make him to have power(or permission) of phone support?</p>
<p>Or should i use phone support separately rather than going through live chat?</p>

<p>Ok, support team told me that this problem can't be easily solved. So, they told me that they will hand this problem to next level of support. They said that this will take long time. During that time, what should i do?</p>
<p>P.S.- &nbsp;about 6 days has passed.</p>

                    <p>^Resolved. Scroll to bottom to see what I did.^</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Today I while I was browsing the web, my screen blanked out for a minute and then greeted me with this welcoming message:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b69445e-ee62-48f5-a890-67a8da47f0ca" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7b69445e-ee62-48f5-a890-67a8da47f0ca" /></a></p>
<p>I am using an HP Stream 11 (I got it last Christmas).</p>
<p>I checked Windows Update and there are no updates available.</p>
<p>Screen still totally working except for this&nbsp;square has suddenly appeared and brightness cannot be adjusted.</p>
<p>There is this square on my screen now (not there before) and I cannot adjust brightness.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/08ccdc13-8dd9-4ef6-a87e-bf03c07230e7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/08ccdc13-8dd9-4ef6-a87e-bf03c07230e7" /></a>Don't
 know if you can see it that well, it's those pink, green and multi-coloured dots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting now to see if that helps :\</p>
<p>If it does, hope this post helps other people!</p>
<p>Felix Yates ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Edit- 07:59 AM- 20/03/16*</p>
<p>I restarted and it worked!</p>
<p>Screen brightness fully functional and square gone.</p>
<p>I don't know why I didn't restart in the first place before asking this.</p>
<p>Anyway, bye!</p>
<p>*End*</p>

<p>Most commonly caused by bad RAM so start by testing your memory. I like Memtest86+ from<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.memtest.org</a> . Obviously, you have to get the program from a working machine. You will download the .iso to make a bootable cd.
 You want the pre-compiled bootable ISO (.zip). Unzip the file you download by double-clicking on it and drag the contents out. You will now have a file called memtest86+-4/00.iso (the version number may be different). You can delete the .zip file now. Put
 in a CD-R disc and start a third-party burning program such as Roxio, Nero, or the free<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ImgBurn</a> (unless you have Windows 7 which can burn .isos natively). You will need to burn the file as an image, not as data. Refer to
 your burning program's Help if you don't know how to do this.<br />
<br />
Leave the CD-R in your optical drive and restart your computer. When you restart the computer you will see messages:<br />
<br />
1. Possibly a message that says something like "Press F12 for temporary boot menu". If you have this message, press that function key. Use your arrow key to select the CD/DVD drive and the computer will boot from the Memtest86+ CD you made.<br />
<br />
2. If you don't see a message about a boot menu you will need to go into the BIOS to change the boot order. This message will say something like "Press F2 to enter Setup". Press that function key and you will enter the BIOS. Find the section about boot and
 change the boot order to CD/DVD drive first, hard drive second. Save your changes and exit Setup. The computer will boot from the Memtest86+ CD you made.<br />
<br />
The test will run immediately. You can remove the CD while the test is running.You will need third-party burning software to do this&nbsp; Burn as an image, not as data. Then boot with the media you made (you may need to change the boot priority in your BIOS so
 that the optical drive is the first boot device). The test will run immediately. Let the test run for an hour or two - unless errors are seen immediately. If you get any errors, replace the RAM.</p>

            Hi DavZarek, 
<br />
<br />Click start, and type “Control Panel” - open it, and look for Default Programs. 
<br />
<br />When you launch that, all of those listed, you’re not able to change? 
<br />
<br />What about: 
<br />
<br />Choose default apps by file type
<br />Choose default apps by protocol 
<br />Set defaults by app
<br />
<br />Are you able to go into any of those and make changes? 
<br />
<br />let me know, we’ll figure this out!
<br />- C

<p>none of the choices works. It seems Microsoft wants us to use their "photo viewer" and nothing else. This is extremely frustrating.</p>

</p><blockquote>Hi DavZarek, <br />
<br />
Click start, and type “Control Panel” - open it, and look for Default Programs. <br />
<br />
When you launch that, all of those listed, you’re not able to change? <br />
<br />
What about: <br />
<br />
Choose default apps by file type <br />
Choose default apps by protocol <br />
Set defaults by app <br />
<br />
Are you able to go into any of those and make changes? <br />
<br />
let me know, we’ll figure this out! <br />
- C </blockquote>
<p>I even went as far as adding two extensions [file types-.gpx and .rmp.] to the list, and that did not work. Seems that many of the "software" from the past is leading up to an app, and most of those are getting found at the "Microsoft store". Well, that
 would clean up the waste of plastic disc shipped with hardware, but gee wiz.</p>

<p><em><strong>UPDATE: solved some issues, at least</strong></em><br />
</p>
<p>I managed to change some of the problematic extensions using the fix described here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://superuser.com/questions/841497/windows-open-with-application-not-appearing-as-an-option/1020255</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a couple of them, the assoc command returned the correct application, but Windows still refused to use it to open files of that type.&nbsp; For those, I updated the assoc to point to the application anyway.&nbsp; For the really stubborn ones, I had to go edit
 registry keys as well HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\.{ext type} (edit default keys, OpenWithProgids, etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>Original post:</strong></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to hit that "me too" link a hundred times! (<strong>update</strong>: disable cookies and you can!)</p>
<div><br />
<p>So far, I have:</p>
<ul>
<li>set Apps and features to "Allow apps from anywhere"</li><li>used right-click -&gt; open with -&gt; "always use this app to open..."</li><li>used Properties -&gt; change (several times per attempt, because apparently it never works on the first attempt)</li><li>used Control Panel -&gt; Set your default programs</li><li>used Settings -&gt; Default apps</li></ul>
<p>Tried using default apps by file type, by app and even by protocol</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTHING STICKS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time, it doesn't even bother registering the change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried resetting to default and then reselecting the desired apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried changing registry settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried using the apps themselves to register the desired extensions - some of them even work, unless there's a "preferred" MS app, in which case those particular settings are ignored (jpeg, png, xml, log, txt)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The apps I want to use for the different extensions all show up on the context menus, but are glaringly absent from the list of available apps in the "Default apps/Choose default apps" and "Set defaults by app" interfaces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are sometimes available in the "Choose default apps by file type" interface, but selecting them does nothing - Windows REFUSES to change the app that *it* selected as the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't have this problem before the last update; however, that update did seem to kill pretty much all known extension settings (including MS ones like Office!).&nbsp; Most of them, I was allowed to reset (to MS apps, natch), but the ones where I want to use
 something else - not gonna happen.&nbsp; I mean seriously: who wants a choice between Paint and Paint 3d for jpeg files?!??!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like Ryan, I have to manually select the desired app every.single.freaking.time&nbsp; and it's gotten past a joke.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS.&nbsp; This is a brand new machine, brand new install - all of a week old at time of writing.&nbsp; I did switch to a local account rather than a Windows Live account (or whatever it's called) because I frequently don't have internet access.&nbsp; I found a recommendation
 somewhere to remove the Windows Live account as it is sometimes known to interfere with file associations (ie forces a per-account association), and have done that, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PPS. Store access is disabled by policy, because the prompt was irritating me - I have all the apps I need (or wish to use) locally installed.<br />

<p>
</p><p>How did you install your windows?&nbsp; I think somehow the issue is specific to new windows installs.&nbsp; I installed from a slipstream USB drive I made in 2015 I believe.&nbsp; I let it do all the windows updates.&nbsp; Then I activated with a legal license key.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe
 there is just an issue in the latest version of windows for new installs or maybe it had something to do with jumping such a big number of windows updates?&nbsp; I'm not sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to try the stuff you suggest.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I didn't: it came preinstalled on a new machine (which of course spent the next three days installing updates).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further research indicates this is a known bug in the 1803 update.&nbsp; A fix was promised for November, but clearly hasn't materialised.&nbsp; My previous machine (also Win 10) didn't have this issue.&nbsp; Anecdotal evidence seems to indicate that the issue occurs more
 frequently where a user has changed from logging in with a Windows live ID (which is pretty much forced at setup) to a local account.&nbsp; One of the suggested fixes was to change back to a Windows live account.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Ain't gonna happen...</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad the link I posted worked for you; just <em>one caveat</em>: I've noticed when I reboot the machine, MS randomly changes a file association - yesterday it decided Edge was the answer to pdf documents...&nbsp; -,-</p>

I used "Windows Update Error 8024402C" found at; winbdows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-update-error-8024402C.&nbsp; No Help<br />
<br />
I also tried:&nbsp; support.microsoft.com/kb/971058<br />
&nbsp; "How Do I Reset Windows Update Components"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Select "Let Me Do It Myself", click to view detailed information.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As previously stated I was unable to accomplish "Delete the qmgr*.dat files, in step #3.<br />

The hardware change was the cloning to a new larger Hardrive and then adjusting the partion as I had mentioned.<br />
&nbsp;Thanks for your reply. I will&nbsp; try the link you sent and give a follow up of the result.<br />

            Hi Jessen,<br />
I downloaded the System Readiness Tool, Ran it and installed the "HOT FIX". This took awhile as the installation bar ran up to approx. the 80% area then ground to a halt after about 20 minutes it said it was complete. I shutdown then rebooted the computer,
 went online and selected Windows Update from the program menu. After 7 minutes of "Searching for Updates" the error 8024402C appeared once again. I then tried the Microsoft "Fixit" program which once again was no help.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 Ultimate x64 with Raid 1 fails to boot after final mirror - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wr213  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate x64 with Raid 1 fails to boot after final mirror complete</h2>
                    
<p><span>This is more of a warning, and a question combined. Essentially, I am playing experimenting with windows 7 and decided to try raid 1 mirrors. So I have 2 WDC sata3 1tb drives plugged
 into an asus p5p2-vm, Intel Pentium 4 chip (64-bit support). For the most part this motherboard is supported under windows 7. The windows 7 advisor says graphics and sounds don’t work. I acquired another graphics card and installed windows XP sound drivers.
 The system has been stable and working well for 1-2 weeks - without Raid1.</span></p>
<p><span>The entire 1TB drive is formatted to be the boot/system drive (1 big C: drive). This drive is plugged into sata1 port on the MOBO. After 2 weeks, I acquired an identical drive,
 plugged it into the sata2 port on the MOBO, and configured software raid 1 using windows 7's disk management utility. Basically, you convert the primary to a dynamic disk, activate the new secondary, convert it to a dynamic disk; and then follow the GUI wizard
 for the Raid 1 setup.</span></p>
<p><span>I could reboot fine for the first 2 days, but the raid array was not finished rebuilding. In fact, it seemed like if I shut the pc down before 100% build complete, the computer
 restarted building the array from scratch - need to verify that one because I wasn't paying close attention.</span></p>
<p><span>Fast forward to raid array build complete, restart the PC - and.... no boot. I get past the bios screen, and reach the screen with two windows boot options "Windows 7", and "Windows
 7 Secondary Plex" - or something like that. After choosing (defaulting to) the primary "Windows 7" boot option, the computer screen went black, displayed the "Starting Windows" text, and essentially hung. The drive light quit displaying. The nice little hallucinogenic
 windows icon, above the Starting windows" text never showed up.</span></p>
<p><span>After a few rounds of this, I decided to run a repair option by F8&nbsp;choose repair. This repair kernel booted fine but failed to find any problems. The result was that a recently
 loaded driver may have caused my system to fail to boot. I then did a safe mode boot (F8 also). This started nicely, but proceeded to hang on starting kdcom.dll. I tried to unplug the secondary drive and boot the primary (default) - same problem. After a few
 more dead ends, I finally decided to boot to the secondary plex, while the primary drive was unplugged. This essentially simulates a failed primary hard drive.</span></p>
<p><span>This boot worked; and I thought I had success. So I plugged the secondary drive into the primary MOBO sata port, thinking the primary boot option "Windows 7" would start the computer.
 Well the system failed to boot, after telling me it thought primary drive was missing from the system. Now I think technically, this is how I could recover the failed primary Raid 1 drive:</span></p>
<p><span>1) Swap MOBO connections, making secondary the first device</span></p>
<p><span>2) Boot to the primary Windows choice</span></p>
<p><span>3) While in OS, break mirror, and delete the failed primary drive</span></p>
<p><span>4) Reboot with the old primary drive (or its replacement) now plugged into sata2 port. Activate this drive in windows disk management utility and re-raid it.</span></p>
<p><span>Well I am stuck at step 2. These were both new drives, so most likely not bad. I am little confused now what the issue is. But at least you got the data - if anyone sees this problem,
 we are now connected. :) I doubt this problem has to do with my older motherboard, but you never know.</span></p>

<p><span>After a few rounds of this, I decided to run a repair option by F8&nbsp;choose repair. This repair kernel booted fine but failed to find and problems. The result was that a recently
 loaded driver may have caused my system to fail to boot. I then did a safe mode boot (F8 also). This started nicely, but proceeded to hang on starting kdcom.dll. I tried to unplug the secondary drive and boot the primary (default0 - same problem. After a few
 more dead ends, I finally decided to boot to the secondary plex, while the primary drive was unplugged. This essentially simulates a failed primary hard drive.</span></p>
<p><span>This boot worked; and I thought I had success. So I plugged the secondary drive into the primary MOBO sata port, thinking the primary boot option "Windows 7" would start the computer.
 Well the system hung in exactly the same way. Now I think technically, this is how I could recover the failed primary Raid 1 drive:</span></p>
<p><span>1) Swap MOBO connections, making secondary the first device</span></p>
<p><span>2) Boot to the primary Windows choice</span></p>
<p><span>3) While in OS, break mirror, and delete the failed primary drive</span></p>
<p><span>4) Reboot with the old primary drive (or its replacement) now plugged into sata2 port. Activate this drive in windows disk management utility and re-raid it.</span></p>
<p><span>Well I am stuck at step 2. These were both new drives, so most likely not bad. I am little confused now what the issue is. But at least you got the data - if anyone sees this problem,
 we are now connected. :) I doubt this problem has to do with my older motherboard, but you never know.</span></p>

This is not a solution but a question: What do you hope to gain by having a RAID array?<br />

            i was hoping to have protection in case of drive failure - without having to restore files from backup. any better ideas on this?

            Have a look at these forums. The vast majority, perhaps 99%, deals with issues such as<br />
<ul>
<li>Windows fails to boot </li><li>Some Windows functions no longer work properly </li><li>File corruption </li><li>Account problems </li><li>Virus infections </li><li>Hacker attacks </li><li>File system corruption </li><li>File loss </li><li>Backup/restore problems </li></ul>
A RAID array gives you no protection at all against any of those. RAID arrays are great for banks whose computers must survive a disk crash without interruption. Do you run a bank? You would be far better served with a scheme like the following:<br />
<ul>
<li>Install a disk in an external USB case. </li><li>Back up your data files every week to this disk. </li><li>Use a flash disk for your data backups on alternate weeks. </li><li>Create an image of your Windows installation. Store it on the external disk. </li><li>Update the image twice a year and also before major changes. </li><li>Keep two or three versions of the image. </li><li>Burn a Windows Repair CD. </li><li>Boot the machine with this Repair CD to check whether it will detect the image you created.</li><li>Keep your backup media well away from your PC for most of the time. </li><li>Have two fully tested admin accounts and record their details on paper. </li></ul>
If you observe the above points then you are very unlikely to have any serious problems with your machine.

<h2>            Asus F555L notebook will not start Windows.</h2>
                    My son's Asus F555L notebook operates on Win10 but will not start Windows. &nbsp; &nbsp; It was upgraded from Win8 during the free upgrade period and we don't have an installation disk or a recovery disk. &nbsp; &nbsp;As we can't start Windows, I can't get to the licenseeither.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Can I download an installation package to make an installation disk or repair disk to boot from?

            <p>Resetting your notebook will perform the same as a clean installation and will also give you options to save your data . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start your Notebook, then just after the Manufacturers logo disappears and Windows 10 tries to boot, press and hold the power button down for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down<br />
<br />
<strong>Do this Twice</strong><br />
<br />
On the third boot attempt, Windows will boot into the Windows 10 Repair Environment, from there you can access Startup Recovery, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>First try a System restore</strong></p>
<p>Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - System Restore, see if you have a recent restore point you can revert your system to . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If System Restore does not work, try resetting your Notebook</strong></p>
<p>Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC, choose to keep files and applications</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all this fails, the follow Lawrence's link to download the Windows 10 installation media and perform a clean install of Windows 10</p>
