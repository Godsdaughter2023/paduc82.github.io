<h2>            Faulty Hardware corrupted page issue in Windows 10 Asus</h2>
                    <p>Sup All</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop has been crashing at least once every two days after I upgraded to Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>The blue screen tells me that its a faulty hardware corrupted page issue and I've test the RAM and there was no issues&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It stopped after a while when I reset my PC but it came back</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a feeling its something to do with the Asus touch pad driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any Asus users have this issue with their laptops and did you fix it???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attached my latest dump file below</p>

            <p>Hi Ju, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A blue screen error (also called a stop error) can occur if a problem causes your PC to shut down or restart unexpectedly. When you experience this type of error, you won’t be able to see things like the Start menu or the taskbar on the screen when your
 PC is turned on. Instead you might see a blue screen with a message that your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.</p>

<h2>            Sound Audio microphone record recording</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I was gifted with new Toshiba L850 from Australia. It was installed with windows8 when I got this.It worked perfectly but now I got a problem.When I was speaking with my friend via skype suddenly he said that he could not hear me,but I was able to hear
 him.So I checked my microphone(in my PC) with the software 'sound recorder', but when I played it back I heard "zzz..." sound only. I checked my device status and I found that microphone is working properly and my driver software was up to date.when I use
 an external mic it worked properly.I want to know a solution for my problem &nbsp;</div>

            Office 2013 or 2016 HUP?
<br />
<br />
<br />Re-install HUP
<br />Reinstall Home Use Program (HUP) Office 2016
<br />&lt;snip&gt;
<br />The link sent in the Order Status email doesn’t work.  what i had to do was go to the HUP website through the first email sent to my work email address to purchase the office product.  that brought me to the HUP website where you can buy the backup media, or another product.  from there, instead of clicking on the “Order History” link in the top right which starts the whole send you an email with a link b.s. that doesn’t work, click on the “Customer Service” link instead.
<br />
<br />This pulls up another window with the Contact Us page.  there should be a box in the middle that summarizes your last purchase with the date, order #, recipient and total.  in that box there is an “Order Details” link.  click that.  you will then be brought to the order details page with your product key for the office product.
<br />On a side note:  i compared the text string from this “Order Details” link, to the text string of the link provided in the order details email that gets sent to my work email, and they are in fact different.  the one in the email is missing some arguments which i assume is why it doesn’t work.
<br />hope this helps!
<br />Joe
<br />&lt;/snip&gt;
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If it is 2016, try logging in to the MyAccount site with your email address.  If you see your Office license there, use the following process to transfer it to the new computer.  Otherwise you will have to contact MS Support for help with this problem. They will need to know the Correlation ID number

<br />
<br />Change the country code as required. There should be a "Contact US" for HUP specific help.
<br />
<br />
<br />Note: you have to use the correct installation file for the activation to work.  Ether download it from the HUP site, or you can try the download from Technet. It worked for people in the past (I have not had recent confirmation that it still works).

<br />
<br />This page shows how to install Office AFTER the license has been activated.  It also shows a few other things you can do in the MyAccount site.
<br />
<br />Some of the answers can also be found in this FAQ, including how to “Share” your 365 Home subscription:

<br />
<br />The “Office Install” MS support site has detailed instructions for this process.  Essentially it is a 3 step process which can all be done from the new computer.
<br />
<br />The first step is to log in  to the MyAccount site on the new computer.
<br />
<br />The Second step is to remove permission to use full functionality on the old computer, you “deactivate” it. In Office 365 you do NOT have to uninstall Office. When you use the “deactivate” function, that copy of Office goes into “limited function mode”. When in that mode, you can open files and print them, but you cannot save any changes to the files. In other words, you cannot edit the files
<br />
<br />The third step is to install on the new computer. The instal will also assign a license “count to it to “activate” the programs.

<h2>            Xbox One - English speaker in Finland</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>I'm an English speaker, xbox one was launched yesterday and now I have purchased it, this is the absolute worst user experience ever, or I'm doing things wrong, please help me out</p>
<p>I have a perfectly good working xbox 360 and a windows phone also, my gamertag + points etc all is fine, now when I logged in to the xbox one I had this really bad compromise, apparently I cannot be an English speaker in Finland, only Finnish is supported
 in Finland, so xbox just excluded the 5% of the population who speaks Swedish! </p>
<p>Seems that I cannot be an English speaker and live in Finland, per xbox rules, so then I foolishly chose USA, now there is tons of content that I cannot have access to because guess what I am NOT IN THE USA !</p>
<p>Even worse, now my windows phone is logged out of xbox permanently and I have no idea how to get this working again, the whole change to Finnish has been a real hassle and top of all things, KINECT DOESNT SUPPORT language when you leave in Finland, so I
 have a nice paper weight sitting on top of my TV that cannot be used for ANYTHING not even turning on or off the xbox one because language is NOT supported !</p>
<p>Can anyone PLEASE help me out? </p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Windows Start Menu takes up the entire screen.</h2>
                    &nbsp;Hello, I just installed windows 10 and after installing everything and making sure it ran smoothly I restarted my computer and once I logged back in when I would hit the Start Menu button the Start Menu would take up the entire screen instead of just
 being in the right hand corner. Does anyone have a suggestion to fix this?

<p>Same thing is happening to me.&nbsp; I've tried toggling the "use start full screen" off and on, and nothing happens.&nbsp; And there seems to be no way to get back to the desktop.&nbsp; So I'm stuck in this mode with the start menu taking up the whole screen and it won't
 go away so that I can get to the desktop.</p>

<p>That might not work but what happened for Me was that my computer filtered to Tablet Mode and until I had turned it on FF,&nbsp; I was completely unaware until I accidently shoved my mouse over the extra settings on the right hand side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That might be a&nbsp; problem but it's easy to fix.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have done a clean install of Windows 10 on my pc twice now. When I am using my computer I have no issues with Windows 10, it works great and all my apps/ programs run properly. However when I go to bed and the monitors shut off (I have the power settings
 set to Never hibernate or go to sleep), there has been an annoying issue where around 6am each morning the pc just locks up and I have reset the pc to get back into Windows. The error message I am getting is:</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I did not have any scheduled tasks in the Task Scheduler prior to the upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Initially I did the upgrade through Windows 8.1. After the upgrade I did a secure erase on the SSD and then did a fresh install using the media created by Media Creation tool (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install).</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I seem to have resolved the issue. The error with GUID of {1B562E86-B7AA-4131-BADC-B6F3A001407E} was the actual DCOM process.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have disabled the DCOM service through the "dcomcnfg" application and this morning there were no errors and the pc worked flawlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I don't have any applications that would require enabling of software components to communicate directly over a network. I have tried out the games that I play this morning and all other frequently used applications and not one had an issue with DCOM disabled.</p>
<p>

 is strange as I have 32gb of memory and the page file is set to between 4gb and 49gb (system managed). The full error that I am seeing is:</p>

            I did resolve the issue, unfortunately it had nothing to do with dcom, it was related to video card cables (2 display port to hdmi adapter cables - video card only has 1 hdmi port). Driver was seeing 2 hdmi connections. When the monitors went to sleep
 the driver kept polling and apparently couldn't connect or find a second hdmi port and wreaked havoc with the system. Since I changed from the 2 display port to hdmi adapter cables to an hdmi and a dvi cable I haven't had a single shutdown (other than restarts
 for Windows Update).

            <p>I've been having the exact same issue with a brand new Surface Book, literally out of the box. Microsoft's solution so far is for me to send the device back leaving me without a computer until they send a new one and I find the time to install everything
 again. Unfortunately I can't do that as I rely on the computer for work and sold my previous one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A system file check shows that the OS has corrupt files that it can't fix, even after a reinstall of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone at Microsoft can look into the issue it would be fantastic. It's incredibly frustrating having an expensive new computer crash multiple times a day.</p>

            <p>I'm right there with you. &nbsp;The event viewer shows the exact same error as you every three minutes or so and my Surface Book goes through huge phases of recurring BSODs (every 5-10 minutes at its worst), primarily variants of IRQL_NOT_LESS_THAN_EQUAL. &nbsp;All
 told, I get literally about 1000 system errors a day and around a dozen BSODs. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I study outside of the US, and so I'm not able to send mine back for a replacement until the next time I'm in the country.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can we get an update on this Microsoft? &nbsp;Like Troy said, it's astounding how many bugs come with these very expensive machines.</p>

            <p>A lot of newer programs don't support SP1 or SP2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I where to update XP,&nbsp;I would choose to download the<br />
Service Pack 3 file.</p>
<p><br />
Where to download the SP3 installation file:<br />
(File is large but will only install components that your PC requires)<br />

Windows XP Service Pack 3 (SP3) includes all previously released updates for the operating system. This update also
</p>
<p>includes a small number of new functionalities, which do not significantly change customers’ experience with the operating
</p>
<p>system. </p>
<p><br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322389</a></p>
<p><br />
Your PC must be at least SP1 or SP2 level as SP3 will not<br />
install on XP Gold.</p>
<p><br />
I would also create an "Image Backup" of my drive prior<br />
to installing SP3 just in case you do have problems.<br />
Don't have any Image Backup software:<br />
Try "True Image" (has a 15 day trial version available)<br />

<p><br />
If you use Zone Alarm Firewall (Free or Paid) then update to<br />
version 7.0.483.<br />
Warning do not install ZA version 8.0.xxx as it currently has<br />
problems.</p>

<p>==============================================<br />
You might have a better result if you convert the <br />
files to the .wma format.</p>
<p>Maybe the following freeware converter would<br />
be worth a try:<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Free Mp3 Wma Converter<br />
<a href="http://www.koyotesoft.com/indexEn.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.koyotesoft.com/indexEn.html</a><br />
(Mp3, Wma, Ogg, Aac, M4a, Ac3, Ape, Flac, Wav)<br />
(FWIW if you install the converter you may want to<br />
uncheck the offers of Yahoo and Dealio) (also...you<br />
may want to uncheck the CD Ripper and the Easy<br />
MP3 Cutter)<br />
<br />
After installing the program...open it and drag/drop<br />
your MP3 files onto the main screen...<br />
<br />
Choose a save folder (output path). Or just leave...<br />
"Save in the file's directory" checked and the new<br />
files will be saved in the folder with the MP3 files.<br />
<br />
Choose a format....WMA.<br />
<br />
Left click the Convert button.</p>

<h2>            Keeps Signing me out at random times</h2>
                    
<p>I have been having this problem for a while now and have just been ignoring it since it didn't affect me while in multi-player game modes.&nbsp; But now I am trying to download games or watch movies it keeps logging off and signing me out of live.&nbsp; It also happens
 when I am playing a game in single player mode so I don't get any achievements or gamer points.&nbsp; I use to be able to just leave my x-box run and download a game or an add on while doing something else or at least have it run while the counsel is shut off but
 now that doesn't work.&nbsp; I have to literally hold my x-box's hand through a download and keep re-signing in.&nbsp; I have tried all the simple fixes i.e. restarting the router and modem, checking my xbox live connection and nothing has worked yet. I also know that
 it isn't my internet that is the issue cause I have had the same internet since before the problem started and my other internet accessible items aren't loosing the connection.&nbsp; I am getting really, really annoyed</p>

<p>Hello gamer,</p>
<p>the issue you are experiencing often is caused by impending updates. To get rid of these corrupt files you should save your profile in a USB stick and clear for three times (three times in a row) your console cache as shown here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a></p>
<p>After getting rid of the corrupt files just move back your profile again and keep on playing!

<p>Is your XBOX connected to your network via wifi? &nbsp;If so you may want to try running
<a href="http://www.metageek.net/products/inssider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.metageek.net/.../inssider</a>&nbsp;on one of your PC's. &nbsp;This is a pretty handy tool that will give you an idea of how saturated the spectrum is in your location, overlapping channels, and a
 general score of how things should be performing for your wifi setup. &nbsp;It may seem that everything is fine on other devices as they can be more forgiving of latency, dropped packets, etc than your XBOX 360.</p>
<p>I had similar problems sporadically for a couple months. &nbsp;It turned out my neighbors have been firing up more wireless devices and further saturating the spectrum. &nbsp;I found myself switching channels a few times and finally going to 5ghz after it was apparent
 this was a futile effort.</p>
<p>If this situation sounds like it may be similar just do the following.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download&nbsp;http://www.metageek.net/products/inssider/ and install on one of your PC's connected via wifi.
</li><li>Launch the app and click the networks tab on the top. </li><li>Look at your wireless networks signal bar, it should be green ideally, also look at the link score on the right. &nbsp;if it's not over 60 you're likely having problems.
</li><li>Look at the graph on the bottom, if it looks crowded (more than a couple of networks in your range or a ton across the channels) you may want to consider connecting your XBOX 360 via ethernet to your access point or upgrading to the 5ghz spectrum.
</li></ol>
<div>If you see that your are over saturated and think you need to change channels or upgrade to 5ghz after using this tool please let me know. &nbsp;We can talk about the specifics of your setup and exactly what steps need to be taken.</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>
<div>Thank you!</div>

<p>I had the same problems months ago.</p>
<p>Did something to the modem and things got better. I don't remember exactly what was but was something along this lines (found this online):</p>
<p>1-"Your NAT could be moderate or strict. Also, make sure you have uPnP (Universal Plug and Play) enabled in your router if you're going wireless. It's usually the default answer to that kind of problem, but it never hurts to check it out."</p>
<p>2-"However a buddy with the same problem actually found a problem in the NAT. Run xbox live test a few times. It should say open but if it ever says strict then you have a NAT problem. here is a solution:</p>
<p>1. access your router settings through a pc directly connected to the router. </p>
<p>2. turned UPnP on</p>
<p>3. entered my Xbox 360's IP address in the DMZ address under DMZ host settings</p>
<p>4. created active forwarding rules to open ports suggested by XBOX themselves</p>
<p>5. manually set the IP address along with the subnet mask, primary DNS, and secondary DNS of my Xbox 360 to coincide with the info that the netgear settings display</p>
<p>these actions were done in an attempt to loosen the NAT restrictions, even though many times when i ran the Xbox live connection test is said my NAT was open. however, with the research i have done, i know this problem deals with the NAT and the ability
 for our networks to connect to other networks on Xbox live."</p>

            <p>Hello Niki,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you&nbsp;for posting&nbsp; your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you make any specific change in the computer prior to the issue?</li></ol>
<p>The issue may have been caused due to View settings of the icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may&nbsp;try the following steps and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Hold down the <strong>Crtl</strong> key and use the mouse wheel to resize desktop icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Right click an empty space on the Desktop.</p>
<p>Select the <strong>View</strong> option.</p>
<p>You should see 3 options for changing to <strong>Small</strong>, <strong>Medium</strong>, or
<strong>Large Icons</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, there may be possibility of display driver being outdated or corrupted. I would suggest you to update the driver and check if the issue still persists.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that somehow your display settings got changed... from a driver update possibly, or some accidental button click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on your desktop and select Screen Resolution... if this isn't set properly, everything will be the wrong size... Most likely it should be set to something that ends in "768"...</p>
<p>1024x768, 1280x768, or something like that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that isn't the problem, on the same window, look near the bottom center and you will see</p>
<p>"Make Text And Other Items larger or Smaller"</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are settings that will make everything at 125% or 150% larger, and settings for individual types of windows, text, etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking your resolution got changed somehow though.</p>

    <title>Need help recovering Windows Live ID&#59; phone support is useless - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter_b.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need help recovering Windows Live ID&#59; phone support is useless</h2>
                    
<p>I just dusted off my Xbox 360 after a year or two of sitting in the basement.&nbsp; (What can I say?&nbsp; I couldn't resist Mass Effect 3!)&nbsp; As soon as I connected to Xbox Live with my gamertag ("peteweez"), I was forced to apply a dashboard update.&nbsp; This dashboard
 update deleted all of my saved login information for my gamertag.&nbsp; Upon completion of the updates, the console restarted and demanded the Windows Live ID and password associated with my account.&nbsp; I haven't had to use this information for at least a year, and
 possibly more (since my Xbox always remembered my login info even when I was playing regularly).&nbsp; I've forgotten everything.</p>
<p>Since I don't remember my WLID email address, I can't get a reset password link sent out.&nbsp; I checked all of my known email addresses, and I receive notifications related to my gamertag at "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***".&nbsp; But this email address is apparently not my
 WLID, and just a notification email address or alternate email address.&nbsp; I assume that if I ever were to find out my WLID, I could get a password reset link sent to "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***".</p>
<p>But whenever I call support, they refuse to even <em>tell</em> me my WLID.&nbsp; I give them my name, phone number, and address, all of which matches everything on the account.&nbsp; Then they ask for either the last four digits of the credit card on file for the
 account or the answer to my security question.&nbsp; Neither piece of information even exists.&nbsp; I never used a credit card with the account (I bought my Gold membership with a prepaid access code), and I lacked the foresight to set a security question.</p>
<p>I've offered to verify my identity six ways to Sunday.&nbsp; I can send in a copy of my driver's license, which matches every single piece of information on file for my account.&nbsp; But since there's no credit card and no security question on my account, the representatives
 just keep on saying, "Well, too bad.&nbsp; It's against policy.&nbsp; Can't do it.&nbsp; If there is no credit card and no security question on the account, then it's gone forever."&nbsp; I've asked to speak with someone on Tier 2 escalations, but they all refuse to transfer
 me or even fill out an escalation request, preferring instead to waste my time guessing various permutations of potential email addresses which could be my WLID, always to no avail.</p>
<p>Who must I speak with to get the issue escalated?&nbsp; Anyone with common sense should be able to understand my situation and provide an alternative means of proving my identity.&nbsp; A driver's license which matches the account exactly would be much more difficult
 to fake than a credit card number.&nbsp; (And I'm willing to go even further than that to prove my identity.)&nbsp; However, Tier 1 support agents do not have the authority to make a common-sense judgement call like that.&nbsp; That's all well and good, except that it seems
 that their raison d'être is to prevent me from accessing the higher tiers of support or having my issue escalated.</p>
<p>One suggestion I keep getting is "just make a new gamertag".&nbsp; I'd lose all my points and achievements, but OK, I can live with that.&nbsp; What I
<em>cannot</em> live with is losing access to all of my Mass Effect saves.&nbsp; For whatever reason, Mass Effect 3 won't transfer saves between profiles.&nbsp; If I could transfer my Mass Effect 3 saves from my old profile to a new one, I'd be OK with abandoning my
 old gamertag.&nbsp; In essence, the entire issue here is about being able to use Mass Effect 3's multiplayer functionality.</p>
<p>Would there be a way to retrieve the old login information from my Xbox hard drive by hooking it up to the SATA port on my computer?</p>
<p>Please note that the gamertag I am posting with, "ChewableOrchid9", is just a temporary gamertag.&nbsp; I need access to my original gamertag, "peteweez".</p>
<p>Please, somebody, give me an answer other than "just make a new gamertag" or "too bad, can't do it, it's against policy".&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>sorry, unless you can prove your identity with their requirements, your only option is to start over. &nbsp;I went through the same deal when I wanted to use my old Dave McFly tag (that is why I use davemcfly85 now). &nbsp;thankfully I was more of a casual player
 back then and had almost no game score so I did not feel bad starting over.</p>

<p>@davemcfly85: Sorry to hear that. &nbsp;Yeah, I couldn't care less about my achievements or gamerpoints. &nbsp;I just want to be able to play Mass Effect 3 online with the saved character I've worked on for years. &nbsp;All of your decisions throughout the entire trilogy—down
 to little tiny details in the original Mass Effect, affect the outcome of Mass Effect 3. &nbsp;Whether or not you play multiplayer online also affects the outcome. &nbsp;If I'm not able to regain access to my old gamertag, and I can't have the save files transferred
 to my new gamertag, it might mean I have to start again at the very beginning of the trilogy. &nbsp;That's probably 200 hours or more down the drain. &nbsp;(Though in all honesty, I probably wouldn't bother at that point.)</p>
<p>Did you have any luck getting through to the higher-ups in tech support, though? &nbsp;Someone with actual decision-making authority? &nbsp;I've been pretty much stonewalled—Tier 1's modus operandi seems to be to make useless suggestions to stall the customer as long
 as possible, then tell them there's nothing more they can do and refuse to escalate the issue even after repeated pleas. &nbsp;I would have been better served just reading the support pages on the website. &nbsp;I don't call tech support to have them read the website
 to me—I call them because I have a problem which I cannot fix myself despite exhausting all other options. &nbsp;Sometimes it just feels like they're deliberately trying to block access to the higher support tiers.</p>

<p>Huh , well I went thru the exact same thing &nbsp;some years ago and eventually wound up having to call and request an email account verification. &nbsp;It is the same as the phone except it is a email version and you can spend time researching &nbsp;answers. &nbsp;It took
 me some 6-8 months and just about that many forms and I eventually answered enough questions correctly to get me a password-reset link to another email...the key is to put in as much info as possible. &nbsp;The forms I filled out requested everything from the name
 to the IP address of the PC I was on! &nbsp;There was also a text box for more info and I just put in the GS, some names from the friends' lists and even listed some achivements. &nbsp;But as mentioned, if you can't answer enough questions to suit MS, your account is
 gone. &nbsp;What puzzles me about your post is the update: &nbsp;my console has been update numerous times and my account info is still on it. &nbsp;And even if MS would give you the WLID, they don't know the password...it would be stupid to allow thousands of people access
 to both!</p>

<p>@RED SHIFT1: Thanks very much! &nbsp;This is most helpful. &nbsp;I can definitely provide tons of information, including dates of Gold membership expiration, serial number of the console used most frequently to connect to Xbox Live, IP address used most frequently
 to connect to Xbox Live, notification emails addressed to my gamertag, my driver's license (which matches the account information) and more. &nbsp;I think I could satisfy them. &nbsp;But how did you get this option? &nbsp;It has never been presented to me. &nbsp;Is there a way
 the mods here could get an email account verification set in motion?</p>
<p>The password isn't a problem. &nbsp;If I get access to the WLID, I still have access to the notification email address for the gamertag. &nbsp;If I'm receiving gamertag-related notices to that email address, I would assume password reset links would also be sent there.
 &nbsp;And if not, I would imagine if I could provide all that information via email account verification, perhaps they could just associate my gamertag with a new WLID.</p>

<p><span>Hey Chewable,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting in the forums about this. Definitely sorry to hear about these frustrations. I completely understand the&nbsp;</span>disappointment&nbsp;<span>behind losing any achievements and gamerscore, however it
 does sound like creating a new account may be your best option. Phone support needs you to be able to verify all of the initial information before we ask you the other verification questions Red Shift was alluding to. Unless you're able to verify to phone
 support or recall that Live ID you used, creating a new account is truly your best bet.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I wish you the best, &nbsp;<br />
Mister Barakus&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Alright, so let me ask this: how does Microsoft verify account information for gamertags which purchased access through prepaid cards and don't bother to set security questions? &nbsp;Lay down and pray for rain? &nbsp;Surely Microsoft has a support group to deal with
 issues more complicated than those which can be solved by a phone support rep running off of a script. &nbsp;I can't be the first to have had an issue like this.&nbsp; Surely Microsoft must have a procedure to deal with more complicated cases.</p>
<p>The question is not really one of whether or not I can prove my identity.&nbsp; That I can do—I can prove my identity six ways to Sunday and am willing to send Microsoft all kinds of private personal details to prove it.&nbsp; (I probably shouldn't be doing this,
 but I guess I want my gamertag back that much.)&nbsp; They could send me snail mail at the address on file with the account, or call me at the phone number on record with the account.&nbsp; I'd pay for postage.&nbsp; (Incidentally, the former method, that of sending mail
 to the address on file, is considered sufficient proof of identity for creating an account or recovering the login data for the online features of my health insurance company—which is surely several orders of magnitude more private and personal than a gamertag.)&nbsp;
 The question, rather, is who at Microsoft has sufficient authority to make a judgement call, and how can they be contacted?&nbsp; Obviously, the Tier 1 support agents lack such authority, and seem determined to prevent me from escalating my issue to someone who
 does.</p>
<p>Also, your response does not address my other question: if I am forced to start a new gamertag, is there any way my Mass Effect 3 save file can be made to work with my new gamertag?&nbsp; If that can be done, then I don't really care about the old gamertag and
 I would forget about the entire issue.</p>

<p>Ok two things first it isnt required that you set password reset options or secret question and secret answer
</p>
<p>They do help in reseting passwords</p>
<p>Verification isn't required for prepaid purchases only for validation or changing account info</p>
<p>Noone can use drivers license info as verification except for age</p>
<p>You have to pass verification before you can get any info from an account </p>
<p>If you know the windows live Id you can goto the windowslivehelp.com and contact customer support
</p>
<p>Which is the updated form that redshift mentioned </p>
<p>You can fill out the form to reset an windows live Id even with an invalid reset email</p>
<p>And list the extra info but they would need the windows live Id</p>

<p>To answer your last question ChewableOrchid9 - Your save file is connected to your gamertag directly. If you go to a new gamertag that save file cannot be used with another gamertag as it is hard coded for use only with that gamertag.</p>

<h2>            External hard drive won&#39;t register on new laptop</h2>
                    My laptop which ran Windows Vista broke down so I bought a new laptop which runs Windows 7. A collegue suggested I plug my old hard drive in to a Usb External Hard Drive Sata caddy to re use the hard drive.However the driver loads up but the hard drive
 doesn't register on my computer. It does come up on devices and printers but the device doesn't recognise the manufacteur,model number or description. I was wondering if there is something I can do to get it to work or is my hard drive of no use to me now?

            I was told the old laptop failed due to a motherboard failure and that the hard drive should be ok. Someone told me it could be something to do with the hard drive being pre programmed and it is clashing with the primary laptop hard drive. They suggested
 that I need to turn it into a slave drive but I don't know how to do that

<h2>            Win8 usb3 problem &#47;UX31a&#47;iomega ego</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I have a Asus UX31a that came with Windows 7. After installing Windows 8 my external disk, iomega ego 1Tb usb3, only allows reading, I can not write anything to the disk. I wonder how to solve this problem.<br />
The disk worked perfectly on this laptop with Windows 7 and works fine in other laptops with Windows 8 or Windows 7. Other discs I tried, usb2 or usb3, work well on my asus ux31a with Windows 8.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

            I also had the same problem. I scratched my head and search online and tried different things for 4-5 hours but nothing was helpful.
<br />
Finally it worked after I updated the driver from iomega website (It was very difficult to get the link - even after creating account at iomega it was not easy to find driver links on their website!) They do not have driver for Windows 8 separately and you
 can't find this link without creating account but this is the direct link to&nbsp; update USB 3.0 driver<br />
<br />
<u>http://download.iomega.com/usb3encrypt/iomega-usb3-updater.zip</u><br />
<br />
I love the hard drive. It has been 2 years and it is working smoothly. I was disappointed by the poor update/support but the company was recently purchased by Lenovo and I hope it will be better in future.

            I have an easy solution that will have to do for now.
<div><br />
<div>I had Windows 8 PRO and Iomega eGo worked fine, as soon as I put it in my new laptop, it didn't.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Got an error saying disk was corrupt.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Solution was to use an extension UBS 2.0 cable to avoid my new laptop's USB 3.0 port and it worked!</div>

                    <p>Hey everyone,&nbsp;</p>
<p>a few hours ago a friend gifted me the Forsaken DLC for Destiny 2, and for some reason I can’t seem to redeem the gift code. Whenever i put it in on mobile or the xbox it just disappears and nothing happens. I own both the previous 2 DLCs (which i think
 are required) and i dont see whats going wrong here...</p>

<p>Helloooo ladies and gentleman :P</p>
<p>basically, i believe maybe 2 years ago I deleted my profile on Xbox live called innocentlemmnig (don't judge the name), and now Id like to get it back or re-download it to my xbox console however I do not remember the email address nor the password I have
 used in order to sign in with that account...</p>

<p>is my account and all the DLCs and points that I hadl.. Lost?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that anyone can ask for your account details, but I have my debit/credit cards that I used, my passport etc. Basically everything to confirm that it was indeed my account and I am associated with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Help please :)</p>

<h2>            windows 10 boot time always shows &#34;attempting to recover installation&#34;, and suddenly shows &#34;restoring your previous version of windows&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using Windows 7 64-bit on ASUS N43SL, RAM 8GB, Core i7, and approx 15 GB free on C drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 days ago I downloaded Windows 10 upgrade by using the default Get Windows 10 toolbar, and applied the entire Windows 7 update as a preparation, but I decided to do the Windows 10 upgrade today.</p>
<p>So, today I started up my laptop, updated my Norton Internet Security as usual, and started the upgrade process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the screen showed a few percent progress, I left my laptop turned on and plugged.</p>
<p>I leave it for 2 hours, and when I came back I the screen showed "restoring your previous version of windows"</p>
<p>And then, the laptop restarted..</p>
<p>And windows 10 started to boot, after the windows logo showed for approx 10 seconds, it went blank</p>
<p>A few seconds later, the screen showed "attempting to recover installation" for 1 or 2 seconds</p>
<p>And it showed&nbsp;"restoring your previous version of windows" again</p>
<p>And then, the laptop restarted again..</p>
<p>And it became an infinite boot loop over and over again..</p>

<p><strong>After a few times restart, I decided to PRESS F8 during the startup</strong></p>
<p><strong>I chose Safe Mode with Command Prompt, and press Enter</strong></p>
<p><strong>And then Windows 10 boot until I saw "Safe Mode" on every corner of the screen</strong></p>
<p><strong>And then it showed&nbsp;"attempting to recover installation", and went to the boot loop again</strong></p>
<p>I shut down my laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to my 2nd laptop, and I downloaded&nbsp;MediaCreationToolx64.exe to create a bootable Win 10 thumb drive, and it stucked, the screen showed "Something happened", just as plain as that and closed. &nbsp;My thumb drive is 8GB, I have formatted it with FAT, and
 with NTFS, but no success of creating the bootable Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anybody on this planet have the same problem? &nbsp;Any solution?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I apologies for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand your inconvenience. We will assist you to resolve this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur when the Operating System files gets corrupt or missing.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are not able to boot to your previous Operating System as well, I suggest you to install the previous Operating System first on your computer and then try to install Windows 10. If you try to install Windows 10 directly
 on your computer, you may face activation issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have an Installation Media for the <span>
previous Operating System</span>, then create one by referring to the following Microsoft help article.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> When upgrading to Windows 10 from media, you must run setup.exe from within your Genuine and Qualified version of Windows 7 or Windows 8. If you want to perform a clean install, you must have upgraded to Windows
 10 previously. Performing a clean install of Windows 10 with media without upgrading to Windows 10 is not supported and will have activation issues.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Inbox emails disappeared if more than 2 weeks old</h2>
                    <p>I have not changed my account settings.</p>
<p>It is VERY important that I find emails in my inbox from more than 2 weeks ago.</p>
<p>I charge has been made to my credit card and the goods have not arrived.</p>
<p>I need the emailed receipt.&nbsp; BUT THE EMAIL IS GONE.</p>
<p>I have not deleted the email in error.&nbsp; The program has put the email somewhere.</p>
<p>This is a SERIOUS financial situation.&nbsp; Microsoft must fix this immediately.</p>
<p>I have read every post and there is no solution given to more than 155 people who have this problem.</p>
<p>I am sure there are more people, who aren't pressing the "this is my issue too" button.</p>
<p>Your response with a REAL solution is urgently required.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Thank you for your kind response.</p>
<p>I appreciate the comment that I am not in the correct forum - hopefully your response helps the many users who are feeling frustrated.</p>
<p>Unfortunately your answer has&nbsp;not worked for me.&nbsp;Is there something that I am missing?&nbsp; I have restarted the application - but the search function still does not display the message I require.&nbsp; I repeat, this message has NOT been deleted.&nbsp; It is 3 weeks
 old.&nbsp; My previous setting stated "anytime" rather than defining the date&nbsp; .... so I felt sure that "anytime" meant "anytime".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have no idea what accessing my account using a browser could mean. &nbsp;I start up my laptop, click on the windows icon on the bottom left corner, the little picture of the envelope comes up and click on it to start my email.</p>
<p>Windows 10 is a completely new operating system - and I am really unhappy with the disappearing email trick. &nbsp;It is ESSENTIAL that I have access to my emails.</p>

<p>Completed. All folders are empty... as I would expect because I don't use email via a browser ... I use the application that comes with Windows 10 standard installation. &nbsp; However, it has uploaded my calendar.</p>
<p>I also want to point out - now that I have gone onto this site it has "pinpointed" the physical location of my desktop on the Google map. &nbsp;And you can also tell me EXACTLY when I last went shopping on line via this PC - I find this to be a gross invasion
 of my personal privacy! &nbsp;I certainly don't remember pressing the button to authorise this kind of knowledge about my personal life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I digress, the real problem I have is that the email I require has disappeared (and since reporting this issue - many other emails have disappeared, which I shall no doubt need in the future), and they have NOT been deleted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Where are the emails? &nbsp;I need to retrieve them.</p>
<p>I really don't want to have to start printing all my correspondence on paper ... I believed those days to be long gone.</p>
<p>Is there some kind of &nbsp;archive box ? &nbsp;Please tell me the path. &nbsp;I really need that email (and others that have disappeared)</p>

<h2>            How to schedule a task to start an app when another app starts&#63;</h2>
                    I want to start an app when another app starts, but I ca't figure out how to set Task Scheduler.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To trigger I set On an event, on Source &nbsp;I pick the app name from the drop-down menu and leave Event_ID field blank. On the Action tab I place the path and the triggered app name, as usually, and fill the&nbsp; remaining&nbsp;&nbsp;sections also as usually, but it doesn't
 &nbsp;work. When I start the main app the other one is not triggered.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have used Task Scheduler to star apps in a simple way, but this one does not work. Can someone tell me what I am missing and guide me, please?</div>

                    <p>Original Title: Failure configuring Windows features, Reverting changes - LOOP</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have an asus laptop thats about almost a year old now and I decided to reinstall windows due to some graphics card driver issues. I tried to update windows and now I am stuck on this screen. I cant even log in. I cant even stop the update. I cant log
 on or do anything at all. I have tried starting in safe mode but it never starts up in safe mode. I have tried powering off the computer the hard way and it still doesnt do anything. It just goes to this screen and stays there. I am running windows 8 (not
 8.1) and would really appreciate any form of help. </p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The make and Model is a Packard Bell oneTwo S3230 all in one computer. Windows 8 64 bit with 8Gb of ram.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">When I go to install the Windows 8 updates, there was about 89 important updates and another 21 which was not important. all together around 968Mb in size.&nbsp;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">The updates down load and seem to installed ok. It's when it needs to do the restarts and it says it's Configuring Windows Please do not switch off, that it seems to get upto 98% done. Then it reboots and then it says "Failure configuring
 Windows updates. Reverting changes. Do not turn off your computer"</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">So I am unable to tell at what it had failed at. &nbsp;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">At this point it gets struck in the loop and you can do nothing etc power off. If you power back on you still, struck in the same loop. The only way around it I found was booting from USB Drive. From there I am able to restore it
 back to a Fresh versions of Windows 8. which runs just fine, without the updates.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">If I try the updates again I get back struck in the loop.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">This should not be happening, as this is a fresh version of windows 8, with nothing else installed.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Microsoft does have a major problem with Windows 8 and updating it. That's a Fact as everyone can see that. The question is why has not Microsoft, not fixed the main cause of the problem? Instead of these get arounds.&nbsp;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I have now wasted 4 days trying to sort this out. please supply me with an solution&nbsp;</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Cheers!</p>

            <p>I have the same problem described in the original post.&nbsp; After attempting a Windows Update running Windows 8, every time I power on my Asus laptop it boots straight to "Preparing to configure Windows... Do not turn off your computer."&nbsp; After less than a
 minute the screen changes to "Failure configuring Windows features... Reverting changes... Do not turn off your computer" and freezes on this screen.&nbsp; If I manually restart using the power button, the cycle repeats itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from manually powering my laptop off and on and making sure to unplug removable media, it is not possible for me to do any of the steps suggested in the post of May 26, 2014.&nbsp; I cannot run, install, or perform anything because I cannot get to an interactive
 screen before it freezes.</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the steps listed here and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span><br />
I would suggest you to perform System Restore to an earlier point when the computer was working fine and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
Follow the steps mentioned below and perform a System Restore from Windows Recovery Environment. Check if it helps.<br />
<br />
a) Insert the <strong>Windows 8</strong> Installation Disc; click on <strong>Repair your System.<br />
</strong><br />
b) Click on <strong>Advanced Startup Options</strong>.<br />
<br />
c) Click on <strong>Windows Startup Settings</strong>.<br />
<br />
d) If prompted, <strong>press any key</strong> to start Windows from the installation disc.<br />
<br />
e) If you are using the Windows installation disc, click on System Restore.<br />
<br />
f) Click on the <strong>Restore point </strong>during which the System was working fine.<br />
<br />
g) Click on <strong>Apply</strong>, click on <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p>Check if you can boot the computer normally or not. If yes, follow the next method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Now I would suggest you to reset Windows Update Components, set the computer in a Clean Boot State and then install the update manually.</p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought an acer laptop and have had the same issue, here's my fix.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found F2 booted me into full system restore, which took hours, but was like a new laptop, which it was yesterday!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After it got back to the new laptop screen, i went through the set up, but customised settings to prevent Windows from automatically updating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once i was back in Windows i went via windows update and loaded the updates one at a time, (yes this is a major pain) every time I got a green tick I loaded another update, every time I got a restart i restarted (yes over 40 times...).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was one update that failed, but it prompted me to use the update troubleshooter and try installing again, I did and it didn't fail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once all the updates were done, i went for windows 8.1, took a while to download and update but I am now fully updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously this is my work around, and its probably the one update in the 90 or so that didn't work that causes the problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have the same exact problem as Nazik and am also in the same situation with the Asus being purchased as a refurbished model. I believe the issue that he and I are having is that we are stuck on the screen and cannot get to the desktop to run the Windows
 8 setup. Do you have any suggestions in fixing this?</p>
