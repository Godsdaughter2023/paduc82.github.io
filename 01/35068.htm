            Because the games these days use a lot of resourses in your pc it can help a lot if you find your saved games file and delete all but a six pack of your saves,it may or may not help you, but it will help your pc. Also if you DL Superantispyware free and
 run only quick scan then DL ccleaner free from piriform,both are free you will do your pc a big favor.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Blank Screen with Cursor Hang&#40;Nvidia Driver Issues&#41;</h2>
                    So, I have been trying to figure this out for 2 days now and can not find a definitive solution. I am running Windows 7 64 bit and my video card is an nvidia 9800 Gtx+. Everytime I try to update the display drivers(I have tried every version nvidia has
 on their site for 64 bit windows 7 drivers), upon restart I get the Windows Logo and then where it should go to the login screen, it just stays blank with a cursor that is movable and never changes. I am posting from the same comp but I just have the driver
 set to Standard VGA(Did it safemode). Any ideas?<br />
EDIT: I thought I might add, when I originally installed I had to use a friends video card to get it to finish, cause it would hang at completing installation. I swapped back to my card after the install.

            I have tried the drivers from EVGA as well, which is my card manufacturer. No good. And on Windows 7 the default driver did not even work hence why I had to set it to standard VGA. I solved the problem by switching to an ATI Radeon HD 4870 instead, works
 perfect. But it still bothers me that the drivers for the Nvidia card do not want to work with 64 bit vista or 7.

    <title>Issues with digital full game purchases - games download but freeze in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lewis_carroll  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with digital full game purchases - games download but freeze in various stages or kick back to desktop</h2>
                    
<p>Anyone else out there that has purchased the full version of digital games experiencing issues with the game getting hung during a load screen or kicking you unexpectedly back to the Xbox One desktop?&nbsp; Here is my current support experience that began (and,
 still continues) back on November 23:</p>
<p>Day 1: November 23, 2013</p>
<p>Forza at 20-22% loads initial video with the illustrious Hammond narrating.&nbsp; It then makes a loud obtrusive noise that sounds like the Geth trying to communicate to me through the device.&nbsp; I am then kicked back to the dashboard right after.&nbsp; That was not
 what I envisioned as 'Ready to play'.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the upside, Call of Duty Ghosts worked at the 60% mark.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I did not try at earlier percentages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Downloaded and started watching a series on Netflix,&nbsp; resulted in picking up where I had left off in the series when watching on the 360.&nbsp; But, the app crashed to dashboard during the countdown to auto play the next episode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Downloaded Killer Instince and Lego Marvel Super Heroes&nbsp;.&nbsp; These played without any issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Day 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I opened an online chat with MicroSoft support.&nbsp; Their suggestions during the chat session:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn off the Xbox One by pressing and holding the power button on the device (should clear anything cached in memory) three times in a row
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>That did not resolve the issue with the Geth trying to communicate to me via Forza MotorSport 5
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>The next suggestion was to re-download the game </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>I tried this three more times (trying at different stages of the download to execute the game), but the Geth were persistent
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>I must say that the opening narrative is bloody brilliant!!!!!!&nbsp; But, why can I not just skip over it?
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Day 4</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then initiated a call with MicroSoft support.&nbsp; Here were the suggestions provided</p>
<ul>
<li>Reset the system back to factory defaults </li><li>Try downloading and running Forza again </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>At this point I am fairly sure the Geth are letting me know that they are sabotaging my efforts from the future
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>I was given a service request number to reference, and they were going to call me
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While disappointment set in on not getting to play Forza, I kicked off the other digital downloads again to start fresh anew in the morning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Day 5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ERROR: Disc read error '&lt;FileName&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Called on 11/27/2013 7:27 PM&nbsp; to have lego marvel super heroes refunded from XBOX One Account</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Question: How do I transfer a content license from one Xbox One to a new Xbox One?&nbsp; So that I can play the games offline.</p>

<p>*need to find out why this is still available as a download for xbox one - should have been refunded</p>
<p>**BF4 - installed BF4 Second **** (by selecting map then selecting the download - was not available in regular store option), installed BF4 China Rising (by selecting map then selecting the download - was not available in regular store option)</p>
<p>*** Made it to 100% install but received message: Sorry, we won't be able to install this.&nbsp; Looks like it wasn't formatted quite right.&nbsp; Check the Xbox Store to see if another version is available. (0x87de2717)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE: if not signed in I am now prompted for 'Do you own this game or app? If you have a game disc, insert it now.&nbsp; If there's no disc, make sure you've signed in to Xbox Live.&nbsp; If you don't have rights for playing it, you'll need to buy it at the Xbox Store.&nbsp;
 See in Xbox store or Cancel.&nbsp; I called support on this - they said there is no way to transfer digital content licenses on the XBOX one at this time (something that could be performed on the xbox 360).&nbsp; While playing with each of the settings I found a 'My
 Home Xbox" - with the option to Make this my home Xbox.&nbsp; I selected it and this resolved the issue with the DLC rights management.&nbsp; You should include this step in your documentation when sending out new xbox one's as replacements - or place it in the knowledge
 base on the web site.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12/8/2013 4:09 PM&nbsp; - Online with Chat Support - frustration level rising</p>
<ul>
<li>Support asked if I had tried the following:&nbsp; <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/offline-system-update-diagnostic-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/offline-system-update-diagnostic-tool</a>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>They requested that I download and apply the OSUDT2 update. </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Downloading the update resulted in errors when trying to extract the files, it took me THREE separate downloads to piece together all of the files to be able to extract them
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Again, frustration level rising - if this is what I get when downloading a compressed file to my PC and trying to extract I can only imagine the issues I am experiencing on the XBOX One where I cannot SEE any errors occurring
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Sample error trying to extract files: Error 0x80004005: Unspecified error.&nbsp; An unexpected error is keeping you from copying the file.&nbsp; If you continue to receive this error, you can u se the error code to search for help with this problem.
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>While explaining the issue in Chat I was dropped </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Went back and initiated a new chat - reference number 1226468433, now online with Pierre
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Requested to create a new account to try to log in:&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - Password:&nbsp; Happy140
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>NOTE: Creating the account - a .50 charge was going to be levied… now it's just the notion that I am having to pay anything to try something that may or may not work
</li></ul>

<p>&nbsp;And, my most recent response back:</p>
<p>Can you provide me with details on how long each download took, and then the exact tests that you performed to test the games in question?&nbsp; I find it strange that I could not access my account for only a very short period of time.&nbsp; Which is why I am asking
 for details on the testing that was performed.&nbsp; I have performed the steps to get back into my account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Answers to Connectivity questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Use a wired connection: This will eliminate any potential issues with interference that can be caused by wireless devices.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am using a wired connection directly to my modem for the Xbox One </li></ul>
<p>2) Directly connect your Xbox to your modem: This step will only work if your modem does not also function as a router, as this step is to eliminate any issues that are caused by Network Address Translation (NAT) blocks. Additional resources regarding the
 ports used by Xbox live can be found here: Network ports used by Xbox LIVE</p>
<ul>
<li>I am connecting the Xbox One directly to the modem </li><li>For reference, the following configurations have been performed for the Xbox One connection at my site
</li></ul>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Xbox One IP Address reserved based on MAC address of the device</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Xbox One IP Address has been placed in the DMZ</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Port Forwarding has been enabled for the IP address assigned to the Xbox One device</p>
<p>§&nbsp;</p>

<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Firewall options on the modem have been completely disabled (against my better judgment – but, I wanted to ensure that that did not cause a possible issue)</p>
<p>3) Check your Internet Service Provider (ISP) - Xbox LIVE does not support Wireless or satellite based ISP. If you are unsure of what type of internet service you have, you should contact your ISP. You can also have them check to see if there are any issues
 affecting your network health, depending on the tools your ISP has at its disposal.</p>
<ul>
<li>My ISP is Time Warner Cable. </li><li>I have a 50 Mbps down and a 10 Mbps up connection to the internet </li><li>I monitor the health of my connection via tools such as wirshark and fiddler from my workstation and I perform random tests using tools sites such as speedtest.net along with connection tests back to the company that I work for to ensure the quality of
 my line. </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the following devices that DO NOT HAVE ANY issues with keeping a live connection or downloading content:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 x windows workstations (one running windows 7, the other running windows 8)
</li><li>1 Apple TV (Typical use streaming content for Netflix, Apple, UTube) – a wireless connection that when monitored shows an average of a 26 Mbps download
</li><li>1 Roku (Typical use streaming content for Netflix and Crackle) – creates a wireless connection that when monitored shows an average of 26 Mbps download
</li><li>2 x Apple iPhones (one iPhone 5, one iPhone 5s – used for streaming content and uploading content) – wireless connections that when monitored have an average of 26 Mbps download and 5 Mbps upload
</li><li>1 PlayStation 3 – Wireless connection (sometimes wired) – used for downloading digital content (Games, Netflix, etc) – wireless connection that when monitored has an average of 26 Mbps download
</li><li>1 Xbox 360 – Wireless connection (sometimes wired) – used for downloading DIGITAL content (GAMES, Netflix, etc) and uploading content such as saved game data – again wireless connection on average at 26 Mbps download
</li><li>1 Xbox One – WIRED connection (I have tried wireless too) – used for downloading DIGITaL content (GAMES, Netflix, etc) and uploading content such as saved game data – when performing test from the Xbox one:
</li></ul>
<p>Network Status</p>
<ul>
<li>Wired </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Nat type: Open </li></ul>
<p>Detailed network Statistics Page on Xbox One:</p>

<li>Call of Duty: Ghosts - started download and completed after system update - tried to play multiplayer - game will cycle between a Call of Duty Ghosts image screen and a black screen, will eventually just take me back to the menu screen.&nbsp; If I do not touch
 anything it goes back to the Call of Duty Ghosts image screen and to a black screen again.
</li><li>Tried playing the campaign - initial cinematic loads then I get a call of duty ghosts image screen (this one with the gentlemen in the mask).&nbsp; It&nbsp; goes to a black screen and flashes back to the image screen then gives me a 'Error - disc read error 'imagefile2''
 with the option to 'Exit' </li><li>Tried forza motorsport 5 again - game dies at same place during initial load - unable to get into game to play

<p>There is a Microsoft Campus close to where I live.&nbsp; Can they do anything extra from their site?&nbsp; Are there any other tools that we can use to troubleshoot the issue?&nbsp; If the answer is no, then I need to return the device and get a refund on ALL of the digital
 content that I have purchased for the XBOX ONE as it DOES NOT WORK in it’s current state.&nbsp; I purchased it to play games on, and it does not do that with any form of consistency.&nbsp; It is a hard pill to swallow for me that I can perform downloading, installing
 and playing the same games without any issues on my XBOX 360.</p>

<p>§ 12/14/2013 8:00 AM - Deleted Forza motorsport and re-downloaded again- I am kicked back to the main menu now during the loading screen after - never make it to the portion of the game where I can start a career, play multiplayer, etc.(the previous download
 did not even allow me to finish the initial video before it froze)</p>
<p>§ 12/14/2013 - purchased physical copy of game - I can now get into and start playing the shanghai mission</p>
<p>§ Additional notes: &nbsp;</p>
<p>□ Dogtags now displayed in the game (where they did not display when playing through the initial version of the Digital game play of the first mission)</p>
<p>□ The intermission video was not skipped (the scene on the battleship) upon completion of the first mission and before starting the second mission</p>
<p>□ In the Shanghai mission - both pieces of the gate that needed to be unlocked are now displayed instead of just the right portion of the gate. &nbsp;The ladder to go up the building is now available for use</p>
<p>§ 12/15/2013 Tested the following maps to ensue they load in multiplayer:</p>
<p>BF4 - </p>
<p>MultiPlayer Map Load Results</p>
<p>Flood Zone (BF4) </p>
<p>Operation metro 2014 (SA) </p>
<p>Dawnbreaker (BF4) </p>
<p>Hainan Resort (BF4) </p>
<p>Guilin Peaks (CR) </p>
<p>Gulf of Oman 2014 (SA) &nbsp;**</p>
<p>Dragon Pass (CR) </p>
<p>Operation Locker (BF4) </p>
<p>Caspian Border 2014 (SA) **</p>
<p>Golmud Railway (BF4) </p>
<p>Lancang Dam (BF4) </p>
<p>Operation Firestorm 2014 (SA)</p>
<p>ZAVOD 311 (BF4)</p>
<p>Silk Road (CR) </p>
<p>Altai Range (CR) ***</p>
<p>Siege of Shanghai (BF4) - OK</p>
<p>Paracel Storm (BF4) - OK</p>
<p>Rogue Transmission (BF4) - BAD *</p>
<p>** - would need to go to desktop on Xbox One, select the quit option for the game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>§ Upon restarting game, it automatically tries to log you back into the map. &nbsp;Needed to quit, and switch to a different game to get the menu to come back up again. &nbsp;Did not realized that I was in a one man party so it kept trying to auto join the session</p>
<p>*** - Selecting 'Altai Range (CR)' from the server browser would only return 'Gulf of Oman 2014' maps in the list, BUT when selecting the game it did take me to Altai Range (CR) map. &nbsp;I will contact
</p>
<p>Personal note: the standard BF4 maps work fine, the maps that do not work are the DLC maps for SA. &nbsp;I think I was just fortunate with the CR maps all working.
</p>
<p>EA support on this particular note</p>
<p>§ 12/15/2013 Playing call of duty ghosts the following multiplayer maps loaded</p>
<p>§ Chasm - ok</p>
<p>§ Octane - ok</p>
<p>□ While playing midgame on map received 'Disc read error 'imagefile60'</p>
<p>§ Stonehaven - ok</p>
<p>More to come - I have received a message from MicroSoft support that my service request is now being transferred to hardware support. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem with Kinect Sports Rivals Preseason and Zoo Tycoon. &nbsp;They tried resetting my account. &nbsp;Didn't work. &nbsp;I did all of the same troubleshooting steps. &nbsp;I cut them off when they started talking about my ISP and my internet connection.
 &nbsp;The last email I received was that my issue was being escalated to the next level, but that they didn't know how long it would take to get back with me. &nbsp;Its a shame that the software licenses are so one sided. &nbsp;Other situations this would clearly be considered
 breach of contract and subject to a lawsuit. &nbsp;Not that I would want to go that way. &nbsp;This is new technology and purchasing it this early comes with some risk. &nbsp;But for God sakes be a bit more customer conscious. &nbsp;When a customer tells you, in detail, that
 the fix did not work in the past, then move on. &nbsp;At this point, it is clearly a hardware issue for you and me. &nbsp;They need to replace the unit. &nbsp;I'll be glad to give my credit card information to reserve the replacement so long as the replacement is received
 first. &nbsp;Rather than having me test the unit, let me send it back to Microsoft so they can try to figure out the problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As previously stated, I have not been able to play Zoo Tycoon since downloading it. &nbsp;I have been able to select a new solo game, then tutorial 1, then the game gets stuck on the loading screen. &nbsp;Kinect Sports Rivals Preseason gets stuck on the loading screen.
 &nbsp;I was able to get to the start menu once with Kinect Sports Rivals Preseason after receiving a code from Microsoft. &nbsp;However, it reverted back to the original problem after resetting the console to its factory defaults. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I am as frustrated as you and, unfortunately, without a fix for you to try. &nbsp;I will follow this to see your progress. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, for the first time since purchasing the DLC and then<br />
purchasing a physical copy of the game, I am able to at least open ALL of the<br />
maps and I have successfully been able to make it through the first two<br />
chapters in the campaign (Baku and Shanghai).&nbsp;<br />
Now you may ask yourself what does all of this mean….</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, I have a 50 Mbps down and 10 Mbps up connection from Time<br />
Warner Cable.&nbsp; I am now wondering if they<br />
have a web acceleration device such as a Cisco WAAS, Riverbed Steelhead or the<br />
like in place to help them reach those speeds.&nbsp;<br />
My download times when immediately selecting the same download again are<br />
significantly shorter (the sample above on download one taking 35 minutes and<br />
download two taking 17 minutes) for the BattleField 4 SA DLC.&nbsp;&nbsp; If so it could be an issue with how they<br />
cache the download and how it handles large files.&nbsp; I cannot easily review how large each<br />
individual file is on the Xbox One (though, I plan on trying to get more<br />
information on the download process via a sniffing tool).&nbsp; While I am going to contact Time Warner, it<br />
could be on Microsoft's side, where the caching is taking place and the issue<br />
is occurring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I decided to try going to my workstation to replicate the<br />
issue.&nbsp; For those of you experiencing<br />
these issues, try the following from your home PC that is connected in the same<br />
fashion as your xbox one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Browse to&nbsp; <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/offline-system-update-diagnostic-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/offline-system-update-diagnostic-tool</a>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Select the and<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; download the file for OSUDT2 update - will be saved as OSUDT2.zip </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>As soon as it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; completes, select and download the file for OSUDT2 again - save this file<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; as OSUDT2 (2).zip </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Now, open the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; first OSUDT2.zip file and extract the content to another folder on your pc </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>The question - did the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extraction work? Or, did you get an error extracting some of the files ? </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Now, open the second OSUDT2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2).zip file and extract the content&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to another folder on your pc </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>The question - did the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; extraction work?&nbsp; Or, did you get<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an error extracting some of the files? Were they the same files? </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I repeated this process a few times, waiting about 30 minutes<br />
between downloads.</p>
<p>For me, I noticed that the first download took quite some time<br />
to download at a whopping 2.2 Mbps&nbsp; (yes,<br />
I have a 50 Mbps download - but, you are only as fast as the slowest<br />
connection) and, the second time I try to download it I hit right at 6.5<br />
Mbps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Opening the files to extract them</p>
<ul>
<li>The first file I almost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; always received the following message trying to extract the sostmpl.xvd,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; systemaux.xvd and system.xvd files: An unexpected error is keeping you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from copying the file.&nbsp; If you<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continue to receive this error, you can use the error code to search for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help with this problem.&nbsp; Error<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x80004005: Unspecified error. </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>The second file, I almost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; always was able to extract all of the files or I had one less error in the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; files that I could extract.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I kicked off the second download immediately, if I waited for a bit (I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; said 30 minutes, but about 10 minutes or so and I go back to the 2.2 Mbps<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; download times and have errors extracting the files again) </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, while I ponder the meaning of this I have a few options on<br />
my other DLC.&nbsp; Do I just automatically<br />
assume the first download of my DLC will be bad if it looks to be fairly<br />
large?&nbsp; If so, I will have to get into<br />
the habit of download and watch, delete right after download and then download<br />
again….&nbsp; And, here is a recap of the<br />
initial download sizes again:</p>

<p>So, I am also going to try to do this with Forza during a more<br />
reasonable hour (it is almost 1 am here now) to see if I might actually be able<br />
to play the game without errors (again for the first time since<br />
11/23/2013.&nbsp; I also plan on putting a<br />
sniffer on the traffic to get more information on what the Xbox One does when<br />
you hit the market place for a download and I am then going to do the same with<br />
my Xbox 360 (which I have not had any issues with, for that test I will be<br />
downloading COD Ghosts on the Xbox One and the Xbox 360 - it may be two days<br />
until I report back on my findings here).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12/17/2013 12:47 AM I am still waiting for support to reach out<br />
and contact me on the Service Request since it was 'transferred' to the<br />
hardware department.</p>

<p>It seems my problem is with my account. &nbsp;I received a new Xbox One through the advanced exchange. &nbsp;Using my current account, I was still unable to play digital downloads (I even tried to download Killer Instinct to see if it was simply the individual games,
 but that didn't work). &nbsp;I reset to factory defaults, removed the Xbox One as my current account's Home Xbox, and created a brand new account. &nbsp;I was able to successfully download and play the games I couldn't play with my current account (except Zoo Tycoon,
 which I just downloaded he demo). &nbsp;I then signed in with my current account and installed the full version of Zoo Tycoon. &nbsp;It did not work.</p>
<p>I think this is a Cloud issue. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It appears to be a problem with my account. &nbsp;I got a replacement Xbox One and the problems persisted. &nbsp;So I tried a different method and set up a new account on the Xbox One, completely removed Kinect Sports Rivals Preseason as well as my current account
 (also removed the Xbox as my Home Xbox) and redownloaded the game. &nbsp;It worked perfectly. &nbsp;I then signed into my current account and the game worked. &nbsp;I used the same method with Zoo Tycoon Demo, Killer Instinct Demo, and Zumba Demo. &nbsp;All worked with the new
 account but would not work if I downloaded the game using my current account. &nbsp;Once the uncorrupted game was downloaded (after removing my current account completely) it worked with my current account. &nbsp;I tried this method in reverse. &nbsp;When I downloaded FIFA
 using my current account, left the download on the Xbox but completely removed my current account (including removing it as my home Xbox), and associated the download with the new account, the download failed to work with the new account. &nbsp;I am going to try
 downloading FIFA with yet another account (clean without my current account being associated with my Xbox) to see if I can uncorrupt the file on my current account and the new account. &nbsp;</p>

<li>Requested that I wait to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hear back from Jamie on the issue after speaking to his supervisor </li></ul>

<li>Started a re-download of<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forza 5 </li></ul>

<li>12/20/2013 12:30 AM&nbsp; - Playing Forza 5 </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Yeah, I got past the entry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; screen </li><li>BOO, the game kickes me to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desktop during the first race, not even halfway through on the track </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>12/20/2013 12:53 AM - COD<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiplayer - Domination - Seige… </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Screen attempted to load -<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; received :Error Disc read error 'mp_hashima' only option is to exit </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>As of this time BF4 is the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; only game that does not give me any errors - this is also the only game<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that I have purchased the physical media for...note it took multiple<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; downloads of the maps and quite a bit of time testing each map to ensure<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that I could play the game without lockups or being kicked back to the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; desktop </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>12/25/2013 - Downloaded<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peggle - so far so good - I would say the best game for the console to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; date :) probably because I have not had an issue with the download -<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; probably because it was only a 1.7 GB download - but, who is counting the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; size now a days... </li></ul>
<ul>
<li>12/28/2013 7:29 PM spoke to<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisa to get a status update - an advanced exchange is coming.&nbsp; Will see if console number 3 works when<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it arrives in a week.... more to come </li></ul>

<p>Service Request: &nbsp;1229537788</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Brian,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My<br />
name is Brendan with the Xbox Customer Care Advocacy Team. I'm sorry to hear<br />
that you are having issues with your Xbox One games and I'd be happy to help<br />
you resolve this issue. Let me go over what I was able to find when looking<br />
into this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have reviewed your case, and I understand you are unable to<br />
start playing games on your Xbox One as they will always bring you back to the<br />
dashboard. Typically these symptoms indicate low memory on the console, please<br />
try the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn off the console completely by<br />
holding the power button for 10-15 seconds</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unplug the power brick while the<br />
console is in sleep/power saving mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the error continues, please reset your game profile<br />
by using the following steps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>First,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; re-launch the game.&nbsp; </li></ol>
<ol>
<li>When<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you see the Splash Screen. </li></ol>
<ol>
<li>Hold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all of the trigger buttons, bumper buttons, and Y together at the same time.
</li></ol>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: LB + RB + LT + RT + Y should bring up a confirmation<br />
page.</p>
<ol>
<li>Choose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes from the menu and then press<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the A<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; button to reset your profile. </li></ol>
<p>What this should do is create an offline game save for that<br />
game.&nbsp; You should be prompted to either<br />
over-write the old game save immediately or when you next re-start the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your patience and for being a part of the new Xbox<br />
One!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Brendan</p>

<p>Lewis did you fix your issues? &nbsp;I am having similar problems and have already had 2 replacement consoles. &nbsp;Nothing loads...everything installs without a problem from disc and digital downloads. &nbsp;I have Dead Rising 3 and NBA 2K14 on disc both install and
 update but won't load. &nbsp;It either freezes at a screen, black screen, loops or kicks me back out to the dashboard. &nbsp;I have done my research and I do know about all the fixes with the hard reset. &nbsp;This does not work for me. &nbsp;I have also purchased COD and Titanfall
 through a digital download but same issue. &nbsp;The only game that works is Killer Instinct.</p>

    <title>Netflix Video Screen keeps changing size after Windows 8.1 Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Netflix Video Screen keeps changing size after Windows 8.1 Update</h2>
                    I have had my Acer laptop now for about 9 months with Windows 8 on it and I play Netflix from the App. I have never had a problem until after updating my software to Windows 8.1.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The video starts and plays like normal for about 5-8 minutes, then the screen size in the video player changes size about every 6 seconds creating a flickering. It flickers from one screen size to another. First the video plays to the edge of the screen,
 then changes to an 1/8th in border, then 1/4 in border, then full size again.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I fix this?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I leave out of the player and come back in, the problem doesn't happen again for a few minutes, but then begins again.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using the default video player on my computer that loaded with the Netflix App.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            Same problem here, everything is updated. Hoping for an actual solution. Windows 8.1 is the central theme of this problem, so it's to blame.

            Nope, the issue persists in any browser when watching Netflix. It's something to do with windows 8.1 interaction with the video driver. Trying reinstalling the drivers and silver light. Didn't work.

            I also have the same problem others are having. It's incredibly annoying to try watching a movie and it keeps jumping back and forth between widescreen &amp; 3 inches cut off on both sides of the screen, back and forth every 5-30 seconds. It happens on every
 movie and television show.<br />
<br />
Uninstalled the app, drivers, silverlight and reinstalled all several times and it doesn't fix it. The Netflix app is broken with Windows 8.1 and needs to be fixed.<br />

            Same issue here - only since updating to 8.1 - Same issue is replicated on my brand new XPS - also running 8.1. &nbsp;Fresh install and the issue is still present. &nbsp;Going to post on the netflix site, though I'm sure they are aware of the bug. &nbsp;

            Were you able to find a place on the Netflix site to post? Only thing I can find on their site is a telephone # to contact them. No email, no nothing. Even their Facebook site has posts outside of comments disabled.<br />
<br />
Here's a video showing the issue: http://youtu.be/NyFM2sAu7zU<br />

            It's something to do with Windows 8.1.<br />
<br />
My netflix ran flawlessly on both my laptop and desktop until windows 8.1 upgrade, ran absolutely fine under windows 8.<br />
<br />
It is not a video graphics driver issue...<br />
<br />
WIndows 8.1 also broke Autodesk Inventor Pro 2014 and Autodesk 3ds Max 2014, <br />
Autodesk came out with a patch to fix what Microsoft broke.<br />
<br />
Guess we will have to wait for Netflix to come out with a patch/update to fix what Microsoft broke.<br />

<h2>            Halo Reach Last Update Disc Read Error</h2>
                    Since the last Halo Reach update i've been having disc read errors for the game. What's weird is I can multiplayer and campaign and all of a sudden when it comes time to earn game credits my game freezes during the glowing blue lights segments saying disc
 is unreadable. I've checked the disc and there aren't any scratches on it. My game didn't have this error before the last reach update. I'm also on a first gen 20 gb xbox 360. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

<p>Same thing is happening to me but with Fallout 3, I did all the trouble shooting as well over the phone with Xbox support, their final decision was that my Fallout 3 game was to old for the new Xbox slim system which I do not believe. The game disc is fine
 as I took it over to a friends house that does not connect their xbox to the internet and the game works fine. Xbox screwed something up with this update for sure!</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that, Yes I had a console one of the first ones that came out, that died out, then I bought a used on on Craigslist that one ended up banned or was banned from the get, so finally after the kids moved out we decided to re claim our Gaming
 room and get things the way we wanted to.</p>
<p>I did re download and did the license transfers someone on the phone walked me through that I did just by a 2nd brand new console as well so now we have two in the house, However I did NOT re download all the content because I want it all kept on the one
 that is used the most the other one is in the event my nieces and nephews come to visit system link type stuff.</p>
<p>anyhow I have no idea whats going on if your a MS Rep can you look up my account info and find out?</p>

<p>I don't work for MS so I can't. The license issue is the only thing I can think of, but it should still give you the full game if you're signed into Live. Hopefully someone else has another idea.</p>

            <p>Hey there,<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear this is happening but this does to be an issue with this specific game. I have done extensive testing on this one and it is the only XBLA game that I can not find a work around for out of the 300-400 XBLA games I own. The fact that the game was pulled from the marketplace might play a part here. My usual workaround for this issue is to choose the "Unlock Full Game" option on the main menu and redownload it from within the game itself and then use the B button to back out to the main menu when the download completes. But when you choose the "Unlock Full Game" option, it results in a error code now.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I ever find a solution, I will post it here. I have found some crafty ways around these issues in the past. But for now, I absolutely can not find a way to play this game on any other console than the one it was originally downloaded on many years back. Just wanted to let you know that you were not alone with this issue but it appears that there might not be a work around for this one. However, there is a new <a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Product/Double-Dragon-Neon/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d80258411252" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Double Dragon</a> game on the marketplace and it is pretty fun and not a bad replacement.</p>

<p>I have no idea why this cant be debugged, I mean why would they charge you for a game and yank it from the Marketplace and make it no longer available. The only way to try and re download it is here on the web site you get an Error code if you try using
 your console.</p>
<p>I paid 800 ms points for this and the game and it doesnt work the way it once did due to their decision to yank it from Market place I am wondering if XBL would be willing to allow me the new Double Dragon as a replacement I doubt it though....

            <p>That is unlikely. Games are occasionally pulled from the marketplace for various reasons. Sometimes it will be due to legal issues and other times it will happen when a company folds that happens to own the rights to the IP. It's never really done simply because Microsoft decides it is time to take it down though. Please don't think that is the case here. But I can assure you that I will take a closer look in to this game specifically later tonight and if I find a solution, I will let ya know. </p>

            <p>Update:<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to get it to work earlier today on a console other than the one I originally purchased it on and other than the one that the license is currently tied to.<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I did was redownload the game from my download history on a different console. Then launch the game with the profile that purchased the game. That still showed the game as a trial version. Then I signed out of my account once on the main menu screen. From there trying to select any option will prompt you to sign in to an account to play the game. So I went ahead and signed back in to my account that purchased the game and the main menu then transformed in to the full game main menu. Letting me then access the full version, online co-op, leaderboards etc. Let me know if you are able to get this to work as well. If not, then I will try to find another work around. Fingers crossed!</p>

            During installation, programs have the option to create special shortcuts that point to a protocol or GUID (Global Unique Identifier) rather than a true file location. &nbsp;Programs that do this include (as you mentioned), Safari and Microsoft Office applications.
 &nbsp;There is no way to change it.

<h2>            Optimize and Defragment my Windows 10 computer</h2>
                    Once a month, I manually optimize my drives. Last month and every other month before that, there were 4 drives shown. I would click on the first one to optimize and it would take quite awhile. Unfortunately, I do not remember which drive this was. However,
 today, there is only one drive for me to choose-C plus a note that says only drives connected to the computer are shown. Before when 4 were showing, only the first one actually took time to defragment. The rest always 'said' they were defragmented. It is set
 up to be done weekly automatically. Should I be concerned about what happened to the other 3 drives that used to show up?

            Hi Natalka, the other drivers were the recovery and UEFI partitions and in fact do not need to be defragged, it is only your C drive that needs to be defragged, so nothing to worry about . . .

 you do is try changing the Windows Live ID for your account, which can be done via the console, under Account Management.

    <title>My password will not work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nowherenow  say:</h3>
<h2>            My password will not work</h2>
                    I am using Vista home premiunm, 64 bit. I am a techno- not- if it happens behind the screen, I do not get it.<br />
<br />
My password will not work after restarting the computer. I restart it almost daily, and this has never happened before. &nbsp;I did not know about the reset disk utility, and did not create one. I am sure that I am using the correct password- the hint confirms it.
 I have tried some variations, and, no, my caps lock is not the problem. <br />
<br />
I did not recently reset the password. I have tried starting in safe mode, but again- it requires a password.<br />
<br />
All I get is "incorrect password". I am told that I will have to restore the OS, and will lose all data since the last backup. I read about third-party software that might overcome this problem- what are the risks? Does that usually work?<br />
<br />
Help- It's a lot of work to set up everything again!

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to clarify first if you are doing a screen share to your contact for them to hear your system sounds or are you referring to doing a video call and sharing your music?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I ask what have you tried so far in regards to this? </p>

    <title>Unknown Devices after windows 8 pro upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unknown Devices after windows 8 pro upgrade</h2>
                    <div>Hi guys, really hope someone can help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After I upgraded to windows 8 pro a few days a go I've had nothing but problems with my Alienware M17XR3.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To begin with my system keeps restarting to avoid loss of any data, which I've found may be cause due to drivers that are now 'unknown devices'.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My Intel(R) HD Grahics 3000 driver now and then (seems to be at no obvious point, just random) reverts back to an unknown device... I have been on to Intel's website and downloaded to most recent driver several times - every time it reverts back to an
 unknown device, I make it update again by browsing in the folder in which the driver I got from Intel is saved. The times it seems to revert back to an unknown device is when my system restarts to avoid loss of data.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have since reverted to factory settings and re-installed windows 8 pro, downloaded all updates apart from two which fail to install every time with the error code 800F0217. These downloads are;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Intel Corporation driver update for Intel(R) HD Grpahics family (microsoft corporation - WDDM 1.2) and</div>
<div>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. - Graphics Adapter WDDM1.2 - Intel(R) HD Graphics 3000</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>That's the first problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My next is the three now unknown devices after I factory reset. When I right click properties and on general tab the location is:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PCI bus 0, device 2, function 0</div>
<div>on PCI Express Root Complex</div>
<div>on Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have searched for drivers for these devices but I haven't had any luck.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be appreciated and if you need any more information please ask.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks, David.</div>

            <p>Exactly my problem ! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got away with "PCI bus 0, device 2, function 0" by getting below -</p>
<p><a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;DwnldID=22019&amp;lang=eng" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?agr=Y&amp;DwnldID=22019&amp;lang=eng</a></p>
<p>which essentially is the Intel&nbsp;HD 3000 driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am stuck with the remaining two. I think they mite have to do with&nbsp;USB 3 ports. Not sure though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated. </p>
<p>Thanks, Sandeep&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            You also need to download the win7 version of the ST Micro Accelerometer. That was the one that did not get installed for me.

<h2>            Skype&#39;s Frequent Interface Changes Are Getting Too Difficult To Tolerate</h2>
                    <p>I am a computer programming expert, and, I am finding it very difficult and extremely frustrating to deal with the
<strong>constant changes in the Skype interface.</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, is there anyone else out there who is as fed up as me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also find that other people don't have the updated interface. So they don't see what I see. I try to tell them a simple task, such as "Share Screen" and they don't find it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like that my contacts are in skype but am contemplating changing products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else feel the same?</p>
