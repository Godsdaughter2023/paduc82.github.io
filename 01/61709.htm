                    I have a home network with 1 windows computer and 2 macs, before upgrading to win7 on the PC all the computer can&nbsp; see each other,
<br />
<br />
now the macs still see each other but not the PC and the PC cant see the macs<br />
, mac # 1 has 10.5<br />

<div><br />
</div>
<div>My brand new Surface Pro 2 was stolen from my car last week. It was purchased through my IT department and unfortunately my IT guy threw away the box. Is there any way I can find out the serial number associated with the device. The police desperately
 need as well as my insurance company. Thanks&nbsp;</div>

<p>I'm at the part, I guess late in the game, when you're told to explore while Rhonda works on the plane. I go to do a side mission and I am not offered the option to talk to the woman in the jewelry store. I go back to the hangar when I'm told Rhonda is ready
 and I'm not given the option to talk to her. Has anybody else encountered this issue and what can be done about it?</p>
<p>Separately, I'm encountering the bug with SmartGlass, but it seems everybody's encountering that one.</p>

If you haven't done so, try exiting the game completely and then launch it again to pick up where you left off.</p>

<p>Oh, you should be aware that the timer for the game will likely start at a different amount of time left, then what you may have had. When you choose a chapter to play they each appear to have a set amount of time left for completing the game.</p>

<p>DR3 has been weird with me. &nbsp;There was a side mission with the girl (Christine?) that sacrifices herself and there was nothing I could do and the timer ran out and I didn't complete the side mission.</p>
<p>Also there was a weird glitch where Nick disappeared and then the world began to collapse. &nbsp;Cars began to float around and street lights and such fell over. &nbsp;I had a second player on the other side of a building from me and it said he was -2348934735 (or
 so) meters away.. &nbsp;It was bizarre. &nbsp;I recorded it with game DVR. &nbsp;Looked like something from Alan Wake.</p>

<h2>            Windows Wireless LAN 802.11 Extensibility Framework issue</h2>
                    <p>Upon turning on my laptop, sometimes my network adapter is not connected to my network (It should automatically connect like it always does). Upon clicking on my Network, it doesn't connect so all I do is troubleshoot and it takes care of the issue, resets
 the adapter, and boom I am connected. However, I do this more and more frequently and I do not want to continue working around it, I am just looking for a permanent fix. &nbsp;Anyone understand this? My Laptop is relatively new, I purchased it in August of 2014.
 Alienware m14x, i7, etc. I don't remember when this problem started. Please help! Yes, my drivers are up to date as well. Thanks</p>

            Here is how you do it:
<br />
<br />To begin, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation.
<br />
<br />There are some interesting changes users will see. The first one is the obvious change from Windows is activated with a digital entitlement to Windows is activated with a digital license. At the bottom is a new option called Add a Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />Click Add an account to start linking your account; you will be prompted to sign in using your Microsoft Account and password.
<br />
<br />After signing in, Windows 10 activation status will now display Windows is activated with a digital licensed linked to your Microsoft account. A mouthful I know, but this is how Microsoft will reduce the need always to know that 25 alphanumeric product key users are accustomed to losing or misplacing.

<p>When I see this, should I proceed? It's kind of misleading when it says that I will use my Windows password

            What happened after that: I was unable to login into Windows using my local account, the only available account at sign-in was the Microsoft account. Computer was linked to the MS web site, however. But after I switched back to the local account, I couldn't
 see my computer under "My devices" on the web site. Any suggestions?

<p>Hi NJ,<br />
<br />
<br />
Based on the information you have provided, it seems like the issue is due to a corrupted system file or due to broken/missing components of an application.<br />
<br />
I would like to know more about your concern. Kindly verify the changes made on your computer prior to the issue.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, we suggest that you run the System File Checker and DISM tool. The <strong>
System File Checker (SFC)</strong> is a utility in Windows that scans for corrupted Windows system files. If it finds a problem, it will try to replace the problematic system files from a cached version that’s on your PC. If SFC can’t replace the files, the
<strong>Deployment Image Service and Management Tool</strong><strong>(DISM)</strong> can check the corrupted files then download and replace the files with Windows Update.</p>
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>Start menu</strong>, type <strong>Command Prompt</strong>. Right-click the result and then click
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
</li><li>Copy or type each command followed by hitting <strong>Enter</strong>:<br />
&nbsp; <em><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>&nbsp; dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></em></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your query about Zune music, it has something to do with the Groove music app. You may consider resetting the Groove application. To do this, refer to the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; feature</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click the Grove app from the list and then choose <strong>Advanced options</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>Reset</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes and we'll assist you further if needed.<br />

    <title>Why can&#39;t I see what is refundable on Microsoft&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dangerpowers23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I see what is refundable on Microsoft&#63;</h2>
                    Iv'e been wanting to know the answer for a while now and nothing has helped. I just want to know why anyone can't see what's refundable if an unauthorized purchase is made? If that happened to you, I bet you would want a refund too. But, you don't know
 if you can refund it; which brings me to my second question: Why isn't the refunding of a complete game not refundable? I know games can be refunded, but some of the more popular games on Microsoft's store (and some of the more expensive ones too) aren't eligible
 for a refund. An answer would be greatly appreciated, and I think I speak for a lot of people who have the same problem. In-game purchases should not be refundable, obviously, but the game itself should be.

<p>Hello!<br />
<br />
Some games may be eligible for a refund as long as it meets certain criteria (such as being played under 2 hours, purchased less than 14 days ago, etc.).&nbsp; You can do this at&nbsp;https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is not listed there, you can submit a request for a refund at https://support.xbox.com/en-US/forms/request-refund</p>
<p>
</p><p>If an unauthorized purchase was made (meaning someone whom you don't know accessed your account) you typically would be able to get a refund for those purchases by contacting Xbox customer service.</p>

<p>The current Microsoft Store Terms of Sale are rather clear in stating that refunds are not granted on digital purchases. It is true that Microsoft is reviewing changing the terms to permit refunds on purchases made within the previous 14 days and that have
 been played for no more than two (2) hours, but that change has NOT yet gone into effect. Only a subset of Xbox Insider Program participants have been granted the privilege.<br />
<br />
I, along with others, do have that privilege, and presuming that the proposed rules do not change in the final release, here is a subset of what you can and cannot refund:<br />
<br />
CAN REFUND<br />
-Xbox One games (both AAA and indie games downloaded to your Microsoft account) that have been played for less than two hours and that have been purchased in the past 14 days<br />
<br />
MAY REFUND POTENTIALLY<br />
-Xbox One durable DLC (season passes, expansion packs)</p>
<p><br />
CANNOT REFUND<br />
-Xbox 360 games (both AAA and XBLA games) and other content<br />
-Consumable DLC (things like premium currency - VBucks in Fortnite, for instance)<br />
<br />
In practice, refundable content will have a link adjacent to it in your <a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft account</a> purchase history that says "request a refund". If the link is not present, the content is not (or no longer) refundable.<br />
<br />
Again, the key point here is that the rules have NOT changed - when you buy a game, you are agreeing there are no refunds. If one is granted, it is in extreme circumstances (such as how "Fortnite" was released before they made Battle Royale free).</p>

 that was reserved for the kinetic. During which time they took core gamers for granted and reached out to markets who don't give &nbsp;two farts about them. &nbsp;We'll I've waited long enough to see what they could do to repair the damage but it's not going to happen.
 PS4 is the future for core console gamers. RIP XBone.&nbsp;</p>

 simply to one-up each other. &nbsp;They are not giving you this stuff because they care about you. &nbsp;They just want your money. &nbsp;If Sony did not have to compete with Microsoft, then it would mean lower quality games, higher prices, more restrictions, more ways to&nbsp;implement&nbsp;in-game

<p>Why must any complaint about the Xbox One automatically mark the person as a Sony fanboy? It is just possible that the person doesn't like it and sees Sony as the one who have done more to attracting the gaming market than Microsoft?</p>
<p>Sony PR has been better, I don't think anyone could argue about that. Rightly or wrongly, they've told people what they want to hear and it has paid off for them.</p>
<p>Thankfully the new head of the Xbox Division is changing that but he hasn't been in charge for long enough to get over the negative feelings about the botched launch, the lack of communication about the DRM, "Deal With It", and that the console still lacks
 basic features that the Xbox 360 had at launch.</p>
<p>Microsoft "fanboys" have seen Microsoft make uturn after uturn, yet still seem to take them at their word for everything. Branding any negative comment about the blessed One as the whining of a Sony fanboy.</p>
<p>Perhaps instead of dismissing these comments out of hand, you should instead be asking &nbsp;what has turned someone against a company they've obviously given a great deal of money to.</p>
<p>Yes of course it is stupid to want a company to fail just because you don't like their product, but do try just for a moment to consider why people are thinking that way.</p>

<p>The flopping term was likely hyperbole, not to be taken seriously but as an exaggeration. However the fact is that in Microsoft's home market of the USA, the competition is outselling the Xbox One.</p>
<p>Now no matter how you look at it, that really can't be seen in a positive light. It's an example of how badly Microsoft have handled things.</p>
<p>I own an Xbox One, I don't own a PS4. I looked into which next generation console option would support my PC gaming and decided that Microsoft had the better product for me. It'd be nice if more people took that time but if they did PR companies would be
 out of business in a week.</p>
<p>Zen, you had no problems with the OP's comments but still chose to wrote them off as coming from a Sony fanboy. That shows you didn't really care for the comments because they were negative about Microsoft and the One.</p>
<p>As for the OP's comment to him wishing they fail, are you genuinely telling me you've NEVER exaggerated to that degree because you're angry or upset? If you can honestly say you haven't then you are the only person on the planet who can.</p>

<p>That was kind of my point. &nbsp;I think it was the exaggeration (fairly extreme one, at that) in the original post that made it seem a bit fanboyish. &nbsp;Favoring one side heavily enough to suggest the other is failing when it really isn't. &nbsp;Now, having said that,
 I know there are some negatives and I'm not suggesting they're anything but. &nbsp;This is all coming from someone who... isn't really the biggest supporter of Microsoft. &nbsp;I just don't see the need to go to extremes to make the situation look worse than it is either,
 and I can see how that leads to one appearing to be a fanboy for the other side.</p>

<p>I think They realized that the core gamer is where its at now. PlayStation isn't any better. They told everyone at a E3 one year that PSN would always be free online ALWAYS! Liars. PS4 online is not free. Halo is where its at for me and my Reach 360 is still
 going strong. So as long as MS and 343 keep the Halo games great Ill stay put with XB.

<p>Mattrick was a clown and it hurt the Xbox division big time. The guy decimated gamer audiences talking poo in his beige slacks and American Dad sweater. But to my mind all Sony have done as a company is go second to come first, meaning, they followed every
 Xbox presser and reacted accordingly to the public/consumer response and tailored their announcements to suit the mood.</p>
<p>I remember my brother (day one 360 owner, 8 year Gold subscriber) was put off by the One's 'always on' feature. I said at the time that he's always connected when gaming anyway, so it shouldn't matter to him. He was forceful about disliking the feature.
 He let his Gold run out, and he bought a PS4. (He'd been spending more time on PSN on his Vita than he had been on his 360 by then.)</p>
<p>Anyway, less than month ago he was lauding the PS4's ability to start a download while he was out, and when he got back he could boot up and start playing. lol Yeah. Always on. What a horrible feature. What I find funny is though, Sony INVENTED DRM and SecuRom.
 Now they're being praised for being some kind of anti-DRM champions. That's hilarious. IMO</p>
<p>For myself, I see the two platforms as all but identical, with only services and exclusives separating them. I prefer the Live service, and Xbox platform though. I bought a 360E not long ago, even though I already owned 360, and I have the money and could
 have bought a One. 360 was the best-selling console in the UK in 2013 and I suspect did equally well this year. It's a solid affordable console with a huge library and proven services and apps. The One seems to be competing with the 360 and the PS4.</p>
<p>I'll be getting a One. I have cash ready. I'm just waiting for a deal/bundle/game that'll push me to part with it. Shadow of Mordor, Unity, Arkham Knight, Space Hulk, or hell maybe Destiny. You'll notice they're all multi-platforms. lol

You get this error when you try to start an application with CreateProcess which requires admin rights. You have to use<span>ShellExecute with "runas" to start an application with admin rights.<br />

<br />
I know it is easy if you're using the ProcessStartInfo class in .NET, <br />
just set the UseShellExecute = true; it's a boolean value holder. <br />
Provide the verb = "runas"; and you are done. It is very easy<br />
to do this, I agree, I've been playing with it since Windows Vista. <br />
Anyway, the OP shall also be able to use app.manifest configuration XML<br />
to set the application to by default start in elevated mode. <br />
<br />
<strong>Only have to modify the one XML line so that it looks like below:<br />

<p>Hey mate, the best way to get the enforcement teams attention is to use the reporting features on the console itself to file a complaint:

<p>It is against the forum rules to name and shame. &nbsp;It is also pointless because the enforcement team do not read these forum posts. &nbsp;Use the complaint tools on your console and they will eventually get looked at. &nbsp;If they are found to be doing anything wrong,
 the appropriate punishment will be given.</p>

            I'm actually not able to do anything on it now, when I log in it goes to the start menu and automatically starts switching between start menu and desktop with nothing on it and as I said it won't really let me do anything. My anti virus software is Avast
 and the last time It was working correctly I had deleted 2 files but I don't see how it could have caused a problem.

    <title>Cannot install old programs onto Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jemsick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install old programs onto Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to move some software that I have on a computer that is&nbsp;no longer working.&nbsp; The previous machine was running Windows 7 and was upgraded to Windows 10. The hard drive is in perfect shape as well. Just the motherboard and internal UPS got shorted.
 I didn't want to fork over the money to have it fixed up so I got a new computer. &nbsp;Short story, I went to install Webroot Spy Sweeper and a few others that I had on my old computer and they won't install on the new computer that is running Windows 10. The
 programs ran&nbsp;fine on the old computer that was upgraded to Windows 10. That's why I was looking for a mirroring software that will copy those programs over. Does anybody have an answer or anything that can help me. Please and thank you in advance for your
 help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Method 1&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshooting&nbsp;</strong>computer problems, never before has find some solution in history of Windos (a exageration, but I think you get the idea), Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 I try this before, but not works.<br />
<br />
Do you know if there are other alternatives to Windows Hotspot?</p>

<p>Normally, these two methods mentioned on the link above resolves any issues with mobile hotspot. However, if it the issue still persists, we suggest you to update your drivers for Windows 10. Here is an article you can refer to on how to install/update drivers
 by Andre Da Costa: How to: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">

<h2>            Possibitlity of Wireless&#47;Network Status Window at Logon Screen &#40;Win 7&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I work for a school district with a large number of laptops. Some of our laptops have connection issues in certain areas of our schools. As well, our student laptops are deepfreezed which prevents windows 7 from caching the previous logged on student/user.
 In any case, I was wondering if there were any scripts, third-party tools, or any other methods to display a wiresless/network status at the logon screen for windows 7 computers? This would help students to wait until they could see that their laptop has a
 connection before attempting to logon.</p>

<h2>            How do I fix a blurry picture&#63;</h2>
                    Hi! I take hundreds of photos with my digital camera. I have an 8 GB SD card and when I put the pictures from the SD card onto the computer, some of them are a little blurry. I know it's due to the camera shaking a little, but is there a way I can fix
 the picture in windows 7?? <br />
Thanks so much!<br />

<h2>            Wordpad Bug&#58; Text seems to be stuck in Justify mode when wrapping a line</h2>
                    
<p>Well the title pretty much says it all. When I type past the end of the line, before it wraps it starts squashing letters together, then wraps, but doesn't unsquash the letters. Looks awful and I have no way of chaning it. It's set to Left justification,
 so I change it to Justify and my text doesn't change,&nbsp;so I&nbsp;change it back to Left and its still the same.</p>
<p>I can't find any way of stopping it squashing my text up so I'm guessing it's a bug.</p>

<p>Grrr it seems to have corrected itself today. I've put up with this problem for weeks on two different machines (one x32, one x64) and it did it all the way up till I posted here, now the problem has gone! I started playing with fonts and justifications
 heavily just before I posted this to see if I could cure it... maybe I did?</p>
<p>I'll post a screenshot if I can cause it to happen again.</p>

<p>The words "is reache" are squished up more and more while I'm typing. In this instance, when I finsihed the word "reached" by putting&nbsp;the "d" on the end it spills to the next line and heals itself, but this is quite often not the case. However I have no
 idea how soon I will see this problem again, so I thought it best to throw and image up now.</p>

<p>Hello BLiTZWiNG,</p>
<p>I was not able to reproduce what is happening with WordPad. <br />
I tried with 10 - 15 fonts and never was able to make it have words that were squished together. They always wrapped to the next line as they should.<br />
<br />
Please provide more information as to what font you are using and the exact steps to see if I can reproduce your issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Marilyn,</p>
<p>I am using Windows 7 Enterprise, both x86 and x64 (it's happening on all of my computers). I simply opened Wordpad, left the default settings untouched, which means the font is Calibri 11. I notice that it is actually dependent on what I type, as some words
 will wrap directly, but I found the sentence below will cause it to happen quite visibly. As you type the last 'a' in 'blahblah' the 'bla' will squish together, and when you type the final 'h' the whole word 'blahblah' will squish, as will the 2nd 'd' in 'odd'.</p>
<p>this is a test to see if the text i am typing will start to squash up and look really odd blahblah</p>
<p>Here are some screens that you should be able to run through Windows Photo Viewer to see it happening (Edit: Actually if you just open them one after another in another tab it's plain to see also).</p>

<p>Hi BLiTZWiNG,</p>
<p>I tested again using the Calibri 11 default and still was not able to reproduce the error you are seeing.<br />
I tested using the same sentence with left justification as the default. <br />
<br />
My computer is Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit, not Enterprise but that shouldn't make a difference.<br />
<br />
I suggest you run a SFC /scannow to see if you have any corrupt system files. <br />
<span>Click Start<br />
</span><span>Open an elevated command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator.&nbsp;<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.&nbsp;<br />
At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
<br />
<strong>SFC /scannow</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.<br />
<br />
Then reboot your system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer to&nbsp;Knowledge base (KB) article if you find corrupt files:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>KB article 929833</span></a> -</span><span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system

<p>Hi Marilyn,</p>
<p>THanks for getting back to me and sorry for taking too long to reply (I didn't get a notification this thread had been replied to!).&nbsp;I ran the scan&nbsp;but there were no&nbsp;integrity violations (I didn't expect there to be but you never can be too sure).</p>
<p>Were you able to see the problem in the images I posted? I can reproduce this on every Windows 7 machine in our office. I don't believe they all came from the same installation disc either, but I'd have to check with our IT department to&nbsp;find out what disc
 it was.&nbsp;Perhaps there is a difference in Enterprise vs Ultimate after all?</p>

            I know this is an extremely old topic, but I've been looking all over the internet for a resolution to this problem. I prefer WordPad over word oftentimes, so this has been particularly annoying for me.<br />
<br />
Anywho: I'm on Windows 7 Home Premium, and I've noticed something interesting with this issue: It appears to be directly related to your zoom on the document. Viz., if I zoom in on my document to closer than 100% I will notice the problem disappear.<br />

I also observed that by changing the zoom by as little as 8% I could remove the squish. Thus it seems to me that this is simply a display setting of a sort. I don't think there's any way to fix it unless you want to reprogram WordPad. It probably has something
 to do with how text is scaled and all that gibberish - heck, it might not even be written into WordPad at all (e.g., part of Windows)<br />
<br />
If you're having this problem just change the zoom. It's really the only realistic way to fix it, and shouldn't affect your workflow.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>(Attempted) Explanation</b><br />
<br />
I could be totally wrong about this, but this is the best explanation for this occurrence that I can come up with:<br />
<br />
Thinking about the interaction between a margin, a word, and a particular zoom I feel that this must simply be an artifact of WordPad trying to keep a word in the margin at an "odd" zoom %. To prevent artifacts due to zoom I imagine WordPad actually scales
 down the font size of text as you zoom out, and scales it up as you zoom in. However, it is probably restricted to scaling to sizes of certain order (e.g., 0.2pt, so sizes are 11.0, 10.8, 10.6, 11.2, etc.). Thus at a certain scale the words in a line may be
 slightly larger than they should be, thus leading to the line running over the margin. However, to prevent this WordPad decreases the character spacing of this last word to keep it in the margin.<br />
<br />
This is all hypothetical, of course, but it seems to be the most logical explanation given the evidence. I would find it particularly interesting to print a WordPad document which appears to have this squishing at 100% zoom, just to see if it still exhibits
 the trait then.<br />
<br />
It's quite probable that Microsoft programmed WordPad poorly on purpose, so as to encourage people to get Office, which costs $$$.&nbsp; If you're OCD about these sorts of things (like I am, a bit) you should try to use
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/112385/the-best-free-text-editors-for-windows-and-linux/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
a different program</a>, or <a href="http://www.askvg.com/how-to-get-the-good-old-wordpad-without-ribbons-working-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
maybe try to find a way to revert back to the old WordPad</a>, if you can handle its lackluster appearance.<br />
<br />
Anywho, best of luck.<br />

            <p>I know this is an old topic, but I recently ran across this problem and noticed that it only seems to affect lines that end with a SHIFT+ENTER.&nbsp; E.g., I see it in bulleted lists where I want to put in a new-line without starting a new bullet.&nbsp; I do this
 by holding the SHIFT key and then pressing the ENTER key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I don't have a work-around.&nbsp; I am changing the zoom as other users have suggested.</p>

            Hi Derek
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Start by disconnecting all non-essential hardware devices you might have attached to the computer. Only keep your mouse and keyboard attached and see if it boots successfully. 
<br />
<br />If it still freezes, its possible this might be your RAM or components within the system unit if you are using a desktop computer might need to be fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />Try resetting your BIOS defaults:

<br />
<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in again, power up
<br />
<br />If that does not work, power down, open the unit and check if all components are fitted and secured properly. You can also try swapping out RAM modules.

            Hi I'm Peter an independent advisor, which version of Windows 10 are you installing, 32-bit or 64-bit?there is an issue with the legacy BIOS on the computer. Windows 10 64 Bit requires UEFI to boot. So you have two options.<br /><br />Disable Legacy BIOS, and switch to UEFI.<br />Upgrade your hardware which supports UEFI.<br />Windows 32 bit work on Legacy BIOS, but not Windows 64 Bit. If you enable UEFI with 32 bit of Windows, it will fail too.<br /><br />Also in the bios make sure Sata configuration is set to AHCI.<br /><br />Hope this helps
