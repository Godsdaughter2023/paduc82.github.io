    <title>After upgrade to Windows 10 the numbers on my integrated keypad do not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tonicarter922  say:</h3>
<h2>            After upgrade to Windows 10 the numbers on my integrated keypad do not function</h2>
                    <p>One week after I upgraded my Windows 7 laptop to Windows 10, the numbers on my integrated keypad would not function. I do have the Num Lock on. When I turn it off, the other functions &nbsp;- arrow keys, home, end, pgup and pg down function as they are supposed
 to. Even the / * - + and enter keys work as they are supposed to. When I have shut the computer down and turned it back on hours later, I am able to use the number keypad to log in with my password. Once I am in the system, the numbers keypad stops functioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to revert my desktop from Win 10 to Win 7 and that released the numbers on my keypad, so they are functioning as they should. But that computer had only been using Win 10 for a week. The laptop has had the Win 10 upgrade for at least two months,
 and i do not have the option to revert to Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really like Win 10, but other issues were beginning to pop up, such as freezing in settings, unable to open a Word Document that was in protected view through "enable editing", annoying pop up menus that I did not call for, and the final straw came when
 I could not shut the computer down properly. I had to press and hold the power button until the computer shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas what I can do with the laptop to getting it running properly? I have checked the keyboard drivers and these are up to date.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Toni,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced, I will surely help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To understand the issue better, let me know w</span>hat is the make and model of the laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could have occurred due to these reasons:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Corrupt driver\software.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Hardware is damaged.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Try the steps listed here: </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: <br />
</span></strong><span>I suggest you to use On-Screen Keyboard to type and check if the issue occurs or not. If the issue do not occurs while using On-Screen Keyboard, this could be an issue with keyboard. I would suggest you to connect an external keyboard
 and check if it works. You may also try to connect the Keyboard to a different USB port and check if the issue occurs or not.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Use the On-Screen Keyboard (OSK) to type</strong><span> <br />

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: <br />
</span></strong><span>I see that you have latest&nbsp;keyboard drivers, however sometimes the driver might be corrupt or incompatible when we are upgrade the operating system. I suggest you to download and install latest Keyboard driver\software from the computer
 manufacturer website and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong></span><span>To resolve the issue with freezing settings option, opening Word document and shutting down the computer, I suggest you to try these steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 1:<br />
</strong></span><span>I suggest you to download and install all available Windows Updates and latest device drivers from the computer manufacturer website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 2:<br />
</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the issue persists, I suggest you to
</span><span>set the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if it helps. Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.<br />

            <p>Geethu B,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your very in depth answer. I am writing about an HP pavilion g7-1070us notebook which has an integrated keypad (numbers). &nbsp;Only the numbers are not working as they should. The rest of the keyboard and the wireless Microsoft mouse work fine.
 I tried the on screen keyboard, but there is no separate keypad for numbers, just the line across the top of the key board, and they work fine. The on screen keypad is not a good option since I do not have a touch screen. I had plugged in my Logitech wireless
 keyboard into the laptop and still did not get any response out of the numbers. I have tried the HP site and a check of the laptop from their end shows that all the drivers are up to date. The keyboard driver is a standard PS/2 keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even downloaded DriverAssist and found out that that was going to cost me, so I tried to uninstall, but all I managed to do was lock up the computer. I tried a restart and then pressing the power button. I even took away the power cord and the computer
 will not shut down. Finally after holding down the power button for 5 seconds, the computer shutdown. I turned the computer back on normally and I was able to uninstall DriverAssist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I considered performing a clean boot, but the instructions are for Win 8 and 7. There is nothing for Win 10. At this point I think it is time to go find a hands on tech. The two recovery options in Win 10 are scary. If I need to use my system recovery CD's
 I am not sure the drive will read them. It would not allow me to back up the computer. I kept getting a message that I needed to insert a flash drive or a CD even though there was a blank CD in the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I thank you for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Toni</p>

    <title>Windows Live Photo Gallery &#34;Can&#39;t import pictures. File not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elyssabrecher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Photo Gallery &#34;Can&#39;t import pictures. File not supported or may be corrupt&#34; from Droid X MicroSd</h2>
                    I have been using my Droid X to take pictures for ages and have never had a problem uploading them through Dropbox or pulling them from the card to the computer through the cord until recently.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on what might be happening? All photos have been saved as jpgs, so I haven't chosen anything odd or unusual from how I've been doing it for 3 years.<br />
<br />
Thanks much in advance!

    <title>Unable to install Windows 7 Home Premium &#40;32-bit or 64-bit&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buttonrow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to install Windows 7 Home Premium &#40;32-bit or 64-bit&#41; over 32-bit Windows XP Home SP3</h2>
                    
<p>I've purchased a retail DVD of Windows 7 Home Premium (contains 32-bit and 64-bit discs) for $200 and have spent the last two weekends trying to install it with no success.</p>
<p>Windows Upgrade Adviser says computer is capable of running either 32-bit or 64-bit. (I've double-checked and triple-checked this.)</p>
<p>I tried 64-bit first (have tried multiple times). It hangs for an hour or two at each step, so each attempt takes half a day. (I've been changing boot order in BIOS to convince it to boot from DVD.) Most often it tells me the CD/DVD driver is missing (which
 of course it isn't), and I've tried downloading various drivers onto USB drive and offering them, including motherboard driver because I've read that's what it wants, but it won't accept anything I've tried. All I know about the DVD drive is it's LG brand
 and SATA (whatever that means - I only know basic IT stuff from trial and error). I did have a second somewhat dodgy DVD drive connected but only to power, have disconnected that one altogether but it makes no difference.</p>
<p>Anyway at other attempts it hasn't come up with that error, has still been painfully slow but has managed to copy all the Windows files, then at expanding Windows files it gets stuck at 3%. An hour or two later it decides to announce the following error:</p>
<p>'Setup.exe - Wrong Volume' The wrong volume is in the drive. Please insert volume GRMCHPXFRER_EN_DVD into drive E:. [Cancel] [Try Again] [Continue]</p>
<p>Needless to say it is the correct disc. Reinsert and [Try Again] does nothing; reinsert and [Continue] gets rid of error but does nothing. Eventually I get the following error message:</p>
<p>Windows cannot install required files. Make sure all files required for installation are available, and restart the installation. Error code: 0x8007045D</p>
<p>Of course I'm booting from DVD for these attempts because I can't start a 64-bit install from within 32-bit XP (computer says no).</p>
<p>I've tried installing the 32-bit version of Windows 7 about three times now, twice from running the DVD within Windows XP and once booting from DVD. No long delays, all looks promising, copies all Windows files, starts expanding Windows files (gets to around
 27%), restarts, loads XP back up and says something along the lines of 'This version of Windows could not be installed. Your previous version has been restored. Please check compatibility.' Remove disc, shut down computer, restart, starts loading Windows 7
 and hangs on blue screen 'installing Windows' for at least an hour. Have to force power off, restart, still attempts to load Windows 7 but then restarts and loads XP. Can't convince computer to forget about loading Windows 7.</p>
<p>After these attempts I've had problems with XP, 'NTLDR is missing' - can fix that one ok from repair function on XP CD, but also 'Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt: &lt; Windows root&gt;\system32\hal.dll. Please reinstall
 a copy of the above file.' That one's too scary for me to work out how to fix so I've had to reinstall XP three or four times now, reinstall drivers and download 150+ updates including Service Pack 3 and so on. Gets boring fast.</p>
<p>I've also made sure neither the mouse nor keyboard are connected via USB, doesn't make any difference though. No other USB devices.</p>
<p>I don't know if it matters but the drive letters on my computer are around the wrong way, i.e. 80GB 'C:' drive is actually labelled D: (this is the one with XP on it that I've been trying to install Windows 7 on) and 200GB 'D:' is labelled C:. Haven't seen
 any options to fix this in BIOS.</p>
<p>Speaking of BIOS, boot order lists DVD, D: and A: (floppy) even though I've disabled floppy disk controller as there is no floppy drive.</p>
<p>Motherboard is ASUS M2N-X with AMD Athlon(tm) 64 X2 Dual Core Processor 5600+. Graphics card is nVidia GeForce 8400GS.</p>
<p>Here is some information from BIOS that doesn't mean much to me:</p>
<p>IDE Configuration</p>
<p>Onboard IDE Controller&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Enabled]</p>
<p>OnChip S-ATA Controller&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Enabled]</p>
<p>SATA Mode select&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [SATA Mode]</p>
<p>nVidia RAID Function&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Disabled]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>D: = SATA1</p>
<p>DVD drive = SATA2</p>
<p>Also saw something about ITE8712 Super IO Chipset.</p>
<p>Most of that info is probably irrelevant, I wouldn't know sorry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd be very grateful for any help, as I've tried calling the Microsoft support number but they're conveniently closed when I get home from work. I'm too stubborn to let this thing beat me and I want my $200 worth!</p>
<p>I've had several good reads through http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7install/thread/c211ce29-8e5c-4a2f-aeee-fc2a6e62aef5/ and have gleaned what I can and tried a few suggestions, but much of it is over my head.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Assuming there is only the reminants of the Windows XP Partition on your drive first try runnnig the drive test (listed below). Then use the second tool to totally delete any partitions (do not create any, just delete the partition). Then try installing
 Windows 7 (also disconnect any external device except for keyboard, mouse and display).</p>

<p>Why don't you have a "c" drive?</p>
<p>Could be the problem.</p>
<p>I'd start over with your hard drive as "c", and your dvd drive as "d" and see what happens.</p>
<p>I had XP one time install itself to a "d" drive and it was nothing but problems because Windows kept looking for a "c" drive.</p>

<p>According to Asus site they do not have win7 specific drivers for this mobo, they do have Vista 64bit drivers.</p>
<p>I have experienced the winupgrade advisor stating that all hw was ok, when the mobo site didnt have win7 specific drivers, but at the end of the day being unable to install win7 untill the mobo was changed to one that did have win7 drivers available.</p>
<p>I think I would also try disconnecting one of your HD's then checking the mobo manual as to any specific bios settings and port for the single boot drive</p>

<p>Thanks J W Stuart, this seems to be the most promising reply so far. I'll have to do some more investigating to find out the hard drive model - I know it's Western Digital and Device Manager says WDC WD800AAJS-00PSA0, just not sure how to match that up with
 any of the models at http://support.wdc.com/product/download.asp?lang=en, but I'll get hubby to take the box apart and see what we can find out.</p>
<p>I've only ever reformatted while reinstalling Windows XP, and it seems like what you're suggesting would mean I wouldn't have any OS on the computer at all while repartitioning. As you can tell I'm a bit clueless and daunted by the whole thing. Does the
 Partition Wizard kind of take the place (temporarily) of an OS? What I'm trying to say is if the computer is running XP and I boot from a Partition Wizard CD and reformat and delete partitions, won't that wipe off XP? So then when I restart (I'm assuming I'd
 have to restart), I'd have no OS... Oh no, I just boot from Windows 7 DVD and go from there. That makes sense. Thanks, I'll try it and let you know...</p>
<p>And just to save doing individual replies to the other responses -</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobo? I tried 7 different online technical jargon busters to no avail before it dawned on me that it's probably just an abbreviation for motherboard. Am I right?</li><li>CharlieDude, I'd love to start over with the drive letters the correct way around. Can anyone tell me how? J W Stuart, will I be able to swap the drive letters as part of the process you've suggested?</li><li>smlunatick, I'd need a lot more info to be able to make any sense of your suggestion to 'locate the SATA AHCI boot time install drivers for nVIDIA SATA modes'. Me no speak geek! I think I'll try J W Stuart's suggestion first and if it doesn't work I'll
 ask for more info on that one. </li><li>Palcouk, are you suggesting my motherboard is incompatible with Windows 7 despite the Upgrade Advisor saying it's compatible? If that's the case, Microsoft, I feel lied to and can I please have my $200 back? (I'm in Australia.)</li></ul>
<p>Oh, and just another question - should I be concerned that I can't see my secondary hard drive (the 200GB one currently labelled as C:) in the boot order in BIOS, or is it just not bootable and that's ok? Also when I'm trying J W Stuart's suggestion, do
 I need to delete partitions from both drives?</p>

<p>Yes I am, and have first hand experience of this, in my case it was with a couple of gigabyte motherboards, which were passed as ok by the upgrade advisor, but I and may others found this wasnt the case. (The problem being with the built in sata controler)</p>

<p>WdDiag also has a&nbsp; write "Zeros" option. If you choose from the option list&nbsp;the write zeros to "First xxx" and "Last xxx" of the drive, its fast and returns the drive to a state as when you first removed it from the box.</p>

<p>Disconnect the 200GB drive before you install Windows, that way there is no chance of installing to the wrong drive or losing any data that may be on the 200GB drive.</p>

<p>Palcouk's comment is true, there is a chance that Windows 7 will not install, Gigabyte chipsets (as opposed to the more common/standard Intel chipsets)&nbsp;more often than not are the cause.</p>

<p>In the end I contacted ASUS to find out if their M2N-X motherboard supports Windows 7 and got the following reply:</p>
<p><span>Dear Valued Customer,<br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting ASUS Customer Service.<br />
<br />
My name is Stacey and it's my pleasure to help you with your problem.<br />
<br />
I am afraid to say that this motherboard does not support Windows 7 formally at present.<br />
To ensure stable performance, I suggest you use Windows XP or VISTA for a while<br />
I have no idea why these links say it does.<br />
On our website, there is no option for Windows 7.<br />
So the motherboard does not support it formally.<br />
Maybe you could try your XP CD to install again to see if the poor performance is caused by hardware.<br />

<p>So Palcouk was right and Windows Upgrade Advisor is useless. (Must make a formal complaint to Microsoft for wasting three of my weekends.) Thankfully I was able to return Windows 7 (to Harvey Norman) and get my $200 back. Plan B: sell the computer before
 the urge to drop it off the nearest bridge gets the better of me, sell another old computer that's lying around, add the proceeds to the $200 Windows 7 refund and I might have around $500 towards a new computer. Hubby has agreed to donate the rest of the funds.</p>
<p>So now I'm just trying to create a bootable CD of Partition Wizard as per J W Stuart's instructions because I figured it might be easier to sell a computer if the drive letters are the right way round, and apparently Partition Wizard can fix that. Apparently
 Google search cannot supply simple straightforward instructions on how to create a bootable CD. I tried Nero BurnLite (the free one) and it created a CD alright, with the .ISO file on it, but it wasn't bootable (computer ignored it on startup despite being
 set to boot from CD).</p>
<p>It may be a little off-topic, but I'd love some help! Hubby suggested DAEMON Tools but their website mentions nothing about creating bootable CDs either.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help &amp; patience.</p>

<p>I would suggest getting an&nbsp;Win 7 Update/Patch....for that program, then, apply it before you try restarting the program once it has been installed properly.</p>
<p>If there's not one available, guess what, you are going to have to find yourself&nbsp;one that does work&nbsp;with Win 7.</p>
<p>But, I fear that far more damage has been done to your PC than you are letting on.</p>
<p>You may need to Back-up everything you need to SAVE, then, do a complete Re-installlation.</p>
<p>Of the whole Operating System (OS).</p>
<p>A Registry 'fix' is already out of the question, it's already in a mess.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 stuck in Safe Mode, Can&#39;t log in with my correct password</h2>
                    <p>I am currently stuck in safe mode, unable to log in. I have access to my Microsoft account, but it won't accept my password at the Windows 10 login page on startup. If i go on another computer, I am able to log in to my account on browser, via the wesbite.
 I am currently typing this up from my Dad's laptop. How can I get out of safe mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I was using a 4 digit PIN to login before and that also doesn't work. I've tried resetting my password, but nothing works. What can i do to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a result of trying to downgrade my graphics driver because the current driver is causing my computer to crash. Not sure how to get out of Safe mode.</p>

            Nothing happens on my computer. That command doesn't seem to work on the login screen, unless I'm not doing it right? Is there a certain time I'm supposed to try and Win + R? It just doesn't seem to work for me on the login screen.

            <p>Hi Brandin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience caused. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that the reason why you are unable to access your desktop in Safe Mode may be because your logged into
<strong>Safe Mode with minimal option </strong>instead of <strong>Safe Mode with Networking.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the networking mode, you will be able to access the desktop when you enter your password as the drivers which enable you to connect to the internet will
 be enabled. Whereas in the normal safe mode, your password&nbsp;will not be accepted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that on the Lock Screen, press and hold the <strong>shift key</strong> and click on the
<strong>Power Icon </strong>and select <strong>Restart.</strong></p>
<p>Once the computer restarts,&nbsp;navigate to <strong>Troubleshoot&gt; Advance Options&gt; Startup Settings&gt; Restart</strong>. This will restart the PC&nbsp;again, in the window that follows, click on the option that will let you access
<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>.Once here, re-enter the password and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

            <p>I am having the same issue where I am stuck in Safe Mode and everything that I try wants to have my Microsoft account password which I have changed 3 times in the past 3 hours.&nbsp; It still tells me that it is not my correct password.&nbsp; My computer is totally
 inoperative at this time.&nbsp; I have hooked it to the internet via cable which has me on but the network but won't come out of safe mode.&nbsp; I have had other issues with Windows 10 upgrade but have been living with it, but right now I am hating Microsoft.&nbsp; Any
 assistance would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; There is no one to talk to because it always tells me to go online and nothing I have found has helped me totally.</p>

            <p>I have tried all the remedies that has been posted with going to the run command and typing this or that, but has soon as I do it wants the Admin password which doesn't work no matter what I put in.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>My Microsoft password has been changed a few times and it won't let me enter&nbsp;any password and I also had a PIN on the login but that doesn't work either.&nbsp; I have tried to even just access my files through one of the other family members logins but can only
 see their stuff.&nbsp; If I try to install or change anything it wants the Admin password which as stated above doesn't work.&nbsp; We didn't have an Admin password, I left it blank mainly for this exact reason.&nbsp; Now my PC is still in safe mode and we are unable to
 do anything.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Is there a way to get some kind of bootable disk or like a new update or something on the PC in order to let me get around this.&nbsp; I am not totally inadequate when it comes to working&nbsp;on the PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is very annoying and surely doesn't help Microsoft's reputation.&nbsp; It sounds like this is a major problem and I haven't seen where anyone has had success using the ideas posted.</p>
<p>Please give me something that will assist with this or a way to just reinstall Windows 10.&nbsp; I downloaded it so don't have a disk.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You might try booting your machine with Windows 10 installation media...</p>
<p>if you don't have Win 10 media,&nbsp;8 would probably work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the Install screen, click on "REPAIR" on the lower left... Then Troubleshoot... Advanced..</p>

<p>
</p><p>If that gives an error, use... </p>
<p>bcdedit /deletevalue {current} safeboot</p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> BEFORE something happens, make sure that you set a known LOCAL password (not just a PIN) for your computer. Win10 setup won't volunteer to make that happen: you need to go into
<strong>Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-In Options&nbsp;</strong>and set (change) the password yourself. Then back it up somewhere safe, maybe even with a password reset disk if your computer still accepts such things. And if there is one in there already that nobdy
 knows and you can't change, don't do anything that might bollix startup!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem with a cheap little Win 10 tablet. Troubleshooting a Windows Update caused some issues, and it ended up rebooting BY ITSELF (I didn't ask for it, and neither did the Original Poster) into Safe Mode. Which of course wanted a local password
 that I did not have, since the tablet was set up with a PIN and MS Account in the first place. Recovery consisted of:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Download the correct flavor (32-bit in my case) Win10 to a USB stick using another computer (you have more than one, right?).</li><li>Figure out how to boot from USB - not trivial for my tablet as it turned out (not just a simple BIOS setting, and even getting into the BIOS took some hacking - for AMI UEFI BIOS, try hitting ESC while it's starting). Eventually, after hacking around in
 the UEFI shell, I discovered that after rebooting twice with the USB stick plugged in, the BIOS recognized it and offered it as a boot option (otherwise, it was just the internal SSD or UEFI shell). Isn't it fun when there's no documentation and you have to
 go online (from another computer) and interpret the "hey try this" posts?</li><li>Run the new Windows installation to the screen for for "Start this Installation", look for the "Repair This Computer" option, almost hidden in the bottom corner. Click on the Repair option.</li><li>At this point, you get many other options. In my case, I had a recent Restore Point from before the update, and went back to that. You do have System Restore turned on, right?</li><li>Took a while, but it's now unbricked.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Will need to spend some sysadmin time with the tablet now. Cleaning up stuff in general, and making sure that there's a KNOWN (and backed up) local password for the thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and BTW MS "answer" people: when the question is about <strong>logging in</strong> to Safe Mode (or even normal mode, really), an answer that involves pressing Windows+R and running MSCONFIG is a total FAIL. The Windows user interface is completely inaccessible
 at that point. Read the question, please, and provide something more on point.</p>

<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.

            Hi LDLS##<br /><br />After it expires, Skype will reserve your Skype Number for you on your account for 90 days. This means no one else but you can purchase this particular number during this period. You can renew your Skype Number subscription from your account. <br /><br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12164/how-do-i-cancel-my-skype-number?q=cancel+skype+number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12164/how-do...</a><br /><br />So if your number expired more than 90 days ago, then you’ll need to choose a new number

<h2>            Windows Media Player-How to reverse sync from phone another library.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm running win7 with wmp12.&nbsp; I have three music libraries, and would like to reverse sync (from my phone) to a particular library.&nbsp; The files on my phone also exist in one library, but I want certain files to exist in another library (the files on my phone).&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to sync, wmp states it's already in the library, but I'd like to sync the files to one of the other libraries.</p>
<p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Can OEM Product key be used to re-install Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I had purchased Sony Laptop with Windows7 Professional pre-installed. It did not come with Windows discovery/re-installation&nbsp;CD. During a recent malfunctioning of the laptop, I ended up re-partioned the hard drive and in the process deleted the partition
 that holds Windows 7 recovery/reinstallation files. I tried to purchase a new CD from Sony but they claim they don't have it? At the bottom of my laptop, there is windows 7 professional product key code. Currently, I am running Windows XP professional that
 I had previously purchased as a retail package. My question is: If I install a trial version of Windows 7 Professional, do you think the Windows7 product key that came with the laptop will work? or OEM Windows7 keys do not work with retail version? Any help
 will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>If you can borrow a retail version of Windows 7 Pro and perform a keyless install (see below) and then "Change product key, entering your OEM key it may well work as I recently did this on a Vista based laptop and it did activate.</p>
<p>--------------------- How to perform a 'Keyless Install' of Windows -------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>After you enter user name and password you will be asked to: 'Type your Windows product key', do not enter a key.<br />
Also located just below the box where you would enter the key is a box with a check mark to 'Automatically activate Windows when I am online', remove the check mark and click 'Next'.</p>
<p>You will now have a 30 day grace period in which to activate Windows.</p>

                    <p>I'm horrified that Windows 10 -Could- irreversibly delete a large file folder when I accidentally made a wrong move on the mousepad. &nbsp;It should at least have asked my permission for the deletion, shouldn't it?? &nbsp;The only remnants were filenames with something
 like a microsoft explorer icon but no size or location. &nbsp;The repair guy said those were the shortcuts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea what move I might accidentally have made to cause this dreadful deletion?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Since no one here is clairvoyant it's not possible to say what might have happened.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the deletion is considered "dreadful" because of there being an "important" folder, you should have had it backed up.

            Yup. They weren't in the recycle bin. &nbsp;That took a loong time to find, because it seems to be hidden when my Surface is in Tablet mode. My Compute Works, Inc. used Recuva to establish that they weren't on the computer. &nbsp;Thanks for your suggestions.

            I'm not asking for clairvoyance - just experience from anyone who might have experienced anything like this. &nbsp;Obviously, it had been backed up not too long ago, because it was an important folder; but it was dreadful to discover that such a deletion was
 possible. &nbsp;

<h2>            &#34;SYSTEM&#34; taking too much of my mobile data</h2>
                    Good day! From the very first time I used my wifi hotspot, I wondered why my data shared to my laptop is high when i was only using my email. The high usage of data is not equal to my online activity. It is too much! I checked the data usage which app
 is doing that and it says system? I've searched about it ang tried the trouble shooting. Turning on the set as metered. Disabled the background apps. How can I disbale the system from taking my data? Please help...&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi Shelly
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Windows Update
<br />
<br />Then go go Advanced options - Delivery Optimization - Advanced options
<br />
<br />There, you will find 4 sliders, pull down the values on those 4 sliders to reduce the amount of data downloaded and uploaded by Windows Update Delivery Optimization . . .

<h2>            Windows 8 Second monitor Problem</h2>
                    Windows 8 recognizes my second monitor, but only as a generic pnp monitor.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm using a dual screen setup. I have 2 of the same screen connected to my Dell Desktop, both are the hp w2071d. Only once have I saw both monitors recognized as the same thing (HP w2071d) but about 99% of the time it is recognized as LCD_VGA even though
 it is a LED Black lit monitor. When i go into the advance settings, there it says generic PnP monitor, I tried reinstalling the drivers and it didn't do anything i also try updating my drivers too, both with the monitors and graphix card, the second monitor
 can turn on but can only go onto 1280x1024 and looks wierd like that. It is suppose to go on 1600x900, any ideas how to fix?</div>

<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
Thank you for contacting Microsoft community.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
From your issue description I understand that you want to stop the sound of mouse click in windows 8.1.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
So I would like to ask a question regarding your query.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
1)&nbsp;The mouse click sound which you are mentioning about is it coming from the Operating system or from the mouse?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />
If it is coming from the mouse itself than it’s a hardware component which making the sound.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">If the sound is coming from the operating system then you can disable or enable from the Sound Tab. Please follow the step given below how to go to Sound Tab.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><br />

<h2>            My Skype is hacked&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently i've signed in my Skype (one month no use) and notice it has been hacked but the hacker didn't change the password. He sent a spam link to all my Skype friends but he didn't change anything in my profile. I got into the change password site immediately,
 when i clicked change password it shows up <em><strong>"You have two Microsoft accounts. Merge
<span>m*******11</span>&nbsp;(which is my Skype account) with
<span>m*******11</span>&nbsp;(which is my Skype account) with
<span>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (hacker's email)</span>&nbsp;as one account with a single password".</strong></em> if i click next, i will have to enter the password for that email which I do not know. There is also no Unlink button
<span>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** (hacker's email)</span>&nbsp;as one account with a single password".</strong></em> if i click next, i will have to enter the password for that email which I do not know. There is also no Unlink button
 for that email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can i get my Skype back and unlink that email from my Skype?&nbsp;</p>

I have also tried an older xbox controller with the mic that came with the xbox, along with a turtle beach elite pro plugged into my battlefield controller.

<h2>            But I don&#38;&#35;39&#59;t want to do that immoral quest&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>When I reached Riften to continue my main quest by talking to that guy in the Riften Inn, whose name starts with B, Brinhoff or something, he asks me to do the quest where I have to apparently frame someone, and that's just immoral. &nbsp;I mean, not only that
 I'm playing my character as purely good. &nbsp;But, I'd really like to avoid that kind of quest. &nbsp;The problem is, I just want to continue my main quest but he won't let me. &nbsp;He gives me that quest first no matter what, and I can't seem to remove it from my quest
 list. &nbsp;Is there a way to hold off that quest? &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

<p>If you want to earn the 1000 Gamerscore from the game, then your character will have to do some immoral things. In addition to framing people and thievery, there's also outright murder and assassination. &nbsp;If you want to explore and enjoy Skyrim for the wonderful

<p>Skyrim doesn't have good or evil. &nbsp;It is defined simply by crime and punishment. &nbsp;About the closest thing you can do to become "evil" is contract vampirism and never feed (which is odd, because if you sucked blood you think people would hate you, but in
 this case if you don't suck blood they hate you). &nbsp;At that point pretty much everyone will attack you.</p>

<p>I'm not playing my character in such a way that I'm pure and moral by today's code but I, too, prefer not to get involved with some of the more unpleasant quests. I can live with Thieve's Guild but am avoiding Black Brotherhood and some of the Daedric Quests.
 I find that Skyrim blindsides you with these quests. You can avoid Black Brotherhood by never talking to Aventus Aretino but the quest will always be in your book because it comes from asking about rumors. There are two Daedric quests that you just walk into
 blind and there is no alternative but to finish the first part and let the remainder hang around in your book. In Oblivion, the player has to seek out the Daedric Shrines to get their quests (I didn't do all of those either) and if you manage to never murder
 anyone you will never be contacted by the Black brotherhood. On the otherhand, I'm not sure if there is anypoint to playing any Elder Scrolls game if you are against killing and stealing. I have a murder by purist accident and a bit of ineptitude on my part
 and I roasted a rabbit while fighting a dragon (though I erased those by restarting). I wish I didn't have to pull the wings off of butterflies.</p>

<h2>            unable to access WD Elements 2TB portable SSD on Windows 10 due to self encryption</h2>
                    <p>Original Title - Windows 10 and Bitlocker</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>I have a windows 10 education on my laptop. It's not connected to the domain and never has been.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO i have a WD Elements 2TB portable SSD. I plugged it in my pc after a week or so and somehow its managed to self encrypt with bit locker. Every time i try to open it, it asks for a 42 digit key. I have no idea what it is, as i didn't encrypt it. I called
 Microsoft support, but they adviced me to file a paid help request. I am a student with an empty pocket. One request is USD$499. I saved up for two month just to afford the $80 SSD. I can't afford the paid help service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone is able to help me.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are facing issues with the external drive. I will try to help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Some external HDD would have a built in encryption software to provide additional security and safety for the users. It should not be confused with the BitLocker encryption. When you re-plug the drive to the pc the external drive would not show up.
 You need to use the un-locker tool to unlock the drive. </span></p>
<p>

<p>I am 100% positive it's bitlocker. As soon as i insert the drive into my pc, a pop up notofiction says "This device is bitlocker protected". Even when i look at it in windows explorer, it says bitlocker protected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This hardrive has over 500gb of family photos and they're the only copy i've got. Some of the photos are of people who are dead. They are a treasured memory.&nbsp;</p>

            Hey there DaShek :)<br />
<br />
WD Elements is an external storage drive with a HDD, not a SSD. The drive doesn't feature hardware encryption (unlike
<a href="http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=4Ax6ia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WD My Book</a> and <a href="http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=iJN2gK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
My Passport</a>&nbsp;devices) so any encryption done to it must have been through a software. Moreover, if you have swapped the HDD inside the enclosure with a SSD that has voided any warranty on the WD Elements drive.<br />
Are you referring to the <a href="http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=ivsdyl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WD Elements Portable</a> or the <a href="http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=5xC8sQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WD Elements Desktop</a> drive?<br />
<br />
I would run <a href="http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=5yh7aT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WD Data Lifeguard Diagnostic</a> tool on the drive and see if it passes both the quick and the extended tests in order to verify that the drive is at full health.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This particular drive does not have hardware nor software encryption unless you have used an application that has encrypted your data.&nbsp;<br />

            If the data is encrypted, cloning it (if that is what you are suggestion) would only transfer it the way it is - still encrypted, and you still won't be able to read it. I would suggest to try and see how was the data encrypted and you can start from there.&nbsp;<br />

            It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Product keys are embedded on the motherboard. We'd like to have some information so we can provide a suitable solution to your concern. Can you provide the answer to these questions?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does your new PC have a pre-installed Windows 10 operating system?</li><li>Are you trying to activate Windows?</li><li>Were there any error codes or messages? If yes, what was the exact error code or message?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can check this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/can-i-transfer-windows-10-to-another-computer/3704e5b9-0a43-4d29-9492-0792181a8a44">thread</a></strong> to have more information
 about transferring Windows 10 to another computer. </p>
<br />
We'll wait for your response. </blockquote>
<p>Had pre-installed Windows 10 on new PC, but preferred to swap out the new drive with my old Windows 10 Pro drive into the new PC.</p>
<p>Would not activate through Troubleshooting process when selecting the option relating to hardware replacement.</p>
<p>Assuming there was some kind of product code mismatch on MB vs HD - not sure.</p>
<p>Two calls to tech support told me to enter my product code for my old Windows 7 Pro - that should work - it did not.</p>
<p>Second call tech was very sympathetic to my problem and persistant. </p>
<p>She got into my PC, could not "fix" it, but gave me a new Windows 10 Pro product code, installed, and activated.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help!</p>
