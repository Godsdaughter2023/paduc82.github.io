<h2>            Visual Basic 2010 Express</h2>
                    I installed visual basic 2010 express with the disk I got with my book at school, and I have been using it, but today when I tried to activate it, it said I needed a registeration key.&nbsp; Why is it doing this?, and how do I obtain one?.&nbsp; It said the key
 was free, but when I go to the site, it does not reconize it.

<h2>            Cannot add files to closed DVD session</h2>
                    I used to be able to add files to a DVD+R DL that had been formated with Live File System.&nbsp; Now I cannot.&nbsp; Once the DVD has been ejected, or the session closed, no more files can be written.&nbsp; When I reinsert the DVD and try to write additional files, Vista
 (Ultimate) tells me to insert a writable disc.&nbsp; This has happene on 2 discs in a row.&nbsp; Note, I am using Windows Explorer.&nbsp; I am not finalizing the discs.&nbsp; Just closing the session.&nbsp; What can I do to write more files on this almost empty DVD?

<p>Hi,<br />
</p>
Try running StartUp Repair from a Windows 10 boot disk or USB drive. <br />
That often will work when running from the recovery environment does <br />
not. You can try Option 5 here and run StartUp&nbsp;Repair to see if it helps. <br />
You would need to make a bootable USB or DVD using the Media Creation<br />
Tool.

<h2>            How to adjust scroll bar height and width. As a geezer - unless you are very precise in placing the cursor, the &#40;disappearing&#41; scroll bar will not function.</h2>
                    <p>I tried to contact MS about how to adjust scroll bar height and width. As a geezer - unless you are very precise in placing the cursor, the (disappearing) scroll bar will not function. I spend a lot of wasted time just trying to get the darn screen to scroll.
 My call to help center was disconnected and no return call - after I was told I'd have to edit the register or perhaps wait for the probably maybe who cares - potential of a fix to this in the next update. I have auto updates.
</p>
<p>Gosh among techies, should this be a simple four click to edit menu? </p>
<p>Now I am told I will have to PAY for a tech consult to fix a dysfunctional core function. I was also told by the tech that this was the first time they had heard of this! Type in Scroll Bars too narrow on Windows 10 and press return----- about 90 or so comments
 on multiple web sites. </p>
<p>This just seems either arrogant or clueless. No wonder they are giving away free updates.
</p>
<p>I saw regedit directions for W8.1. Before I begin pawing at it - is there a fix out there for W10?

 the screen shot is here. The vertical bar and horiz bar are about .8 the width of the cursor. Very difficult o access and finicky- disappearing in seconds if the cursor is left unmoved- took me three tries to get this shot showing the cursor.

    <title>Windows 10 Photo Gallery Resizing Images - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hadijouma  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Photo Gallery Resizing Images</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am attempting to resize in bulk using photo gallery windows 10. My requirement is to resize and save overwriting the original images with the same name in the same original folder. So, I am selecting the same folder as the destination of the resized images
 however, photo gallery is not overwriting the original images instead, it keeps them and create a new resized copy of the images in the same folder. The new resized images name is appended with the image dimensions inside parentheses Which changes the name
 of the images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to make it overwrite the original without adding new copy?&nbsp; I have looked on every option but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>

            Hi Hadi, <br />
<br />
Since the sizes are different, you cannot overwrite the original with the resize photos. In this case, we suggest a new folder to save the resize photos, then delete the folder of the original photos.
<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back should you need further help.

<h2>            This week&#39;s Patch Tuesday&#58; Failed Cumulative Update KB4093112 - error message 0x80070020</h2>
                    <div>Earlier today:</div>
<div>
<p>(1) my Security Update for Adobe Flash Player for Win10 version 1709 for X64-based Systems (KB4093110) failed to install. It then installed successfully.<br />
(2) my Malicious Software&nbsp; Removal Tool KB890830 installed successfully.</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>(3) my Cumulative Update for Win10 version 1709 for x64-based Systems (KB4093112) failed to install 0x80070020.
</p>
<p>Just now, a check said my device is up-to-date so what should I do now please?
</p>
<p>According to Krebs "Microsoft issued updates to correct at least 65 security vulnerabilities in Windows and associated software". According to Qualys "Today's Patch Tuesday is smaller than last month, but there are more critical updates this time. Out of
 the vulnerabilities covered by the Microsoft patches, 22 of them are critical".</p>

<p>Hello tooney(2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The WU that failed was KB4093112. However on the 25th April, my laptop was restarted several times and I glimpsed enough info (eg initialising) to realise it was trying to install a WU.</p>
<p>Twice it stuck at 90% but eventually an April WU was installed. No mention of KB4093112 - this was shown as KB4093105 and at long last I now have v1709 16299.402:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2454956-526d-4097-9a8b-9fef8cf88590?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c2454956-526d-4097-9a8b-9fef8cf88590?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The reason I asked if you were one of the Directly team is that when I input this thread at 6.19:02 pm on the 13th April it went into the Directly pot. (I got their standard message "the last query was
 answered in x minutes" or whatever.) Yet you replied at 4.26:12 on the 14th. Perhaps Directly didn't want to reply - a frequent contributor here, an expert, PM'd me elsewhere that this suggests to him that Directly knew there was a problem with this WU and
 didn't want to get involved. Ah well - that's life I suppose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for all your efforts - the moral seems to be if having a yet another problem with a Cumulative WU, keep trying!</p>

 I visited the Qualcomm Atheros website but couldn't find anything. Any help would be greatly appreciated as this issue is also slowing down the laptop which is annoying when I try to do homework.</div>

<h2>            how can i remove my old network icon from control panel &#47; programs and features.</h2>
                    i just updated my win 8.1 to windows 10. i lost my network connection after the process. i downloaded the win 10 version drivers. and was told to remove the old drivers ( product conflict detected ). i did the uninstall and expected the icon to disapear
 but it didnt. i tried to install the new drivers and i get a message saying to remove the old drivers before the upgrade can begin. so i followed the path to the folder of the drivers ( qualcomm atheros killer network manager suite ) and deleted the folder.
 went back to programs and features and tried to uninstall and no success. i need to remove the icon from the add remove programs and then i can install the new drivers. has anyone had this problem?? any advice? i dont want to payfor this service because its
 a new install windows 10 issue that should be easy to fix .

<h2>            Dragon Anywhere software compatability with Surface 4 Pro i5 128GB</h2>
                    <p>Before I went on holiday to the Netherlands last week, I tried to instal Dragon Anywhere on my Surface 2 but ran into problems. So, I contacted Surface online and they told me that it was incompatable because Surface 2 ran on Windows RT. So whilst in customs
 I bought myself a brand new Surface 4 Pro i5 128GB. I'm hoping that I will be able to install Dragon Anywhere now even though Nuance, who make Dragon, cancelled my original order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentely, have you got any advice about how to begin using my new Surface? I have a :</p>
<p>
</p><p>ScanDisk Elite 128GB Ultra Performance microSDXC UHS-I card with Adapter - What do I use this for?</p>
<p>Microsoft Office 365 Home Premium with Word, Excel, Powepoint, OneNote, Outlook but no Access but version upgrade included</p>
<p>McAfee LiveSafe 1 Year Subscription but I use Norton &nbsp;360 Premier</p>
<p>
</p><p>MCA MCA+CLD+0 59971 Is this a Cloud subscription?</p>

            <p>1. sandisk microSD card can be used in the slot and you can store documents, files, libraries there and even install apps to it using settings:</p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fcompass-ssl.surface.com%2fassets%2f43%2f8c%2f438c64ed-8aa9-4a45-b0ee-4670439ab4e1.png%3fn%3dp-microsd-slot-325.png" /></p>
<p>2. I would never put either McAfee or Norton on a computer. Use Windows Defender.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. no idea what MCA MCA+CLD+0 59971 is</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. You will need to check with Nuance on Dragon -- we can't assist with this, sorry. You may need to repurchase.</p>

<p>A system restore may or may not fix the files that are missing, however you could also try using this utility

TIP: If you ever think your Registry needs to be cleaned, repaired, boosted, tuned-up, cured, tweaked, fixed, or optimised (it doesn't), read
<a href="http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?t=28099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?t=28099</a> and draw your own conclusions.</p>

http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/archive/2005/10/02/registry-junk-a-windows-fact-of-life.aspx</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>=&gt; If you have backups of ALL the changes you made using <a href="http://www.avg.com/us-en/avg-pctuneup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
AVG PC TuneUp</a>, restore ALL of them (i.e., using the AVG utility, <em>not</em> System Restore) &amp; reboot, then see if the updates will install.</p>
<p>COMMENT: Most "mscoree.dll was not found" errors are either symptoms of a hijackware infection, a botched install of WinXP SP3, and/or a botched Repair Install of WinXP. YMMV.</p>

            <p>If (a) you&nbsp;do NOT have backups of ALL the changes you made using &lt;spit&gt; AVG PC TuneUp and (b) you do NOT have an available (Windows) Restore Point which
<em>predates</em> your&nbsp;injudicious use of AVG PC TuneUp, your ONLY recourse would be a Repair Install or a clean install of WinXP.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT! =&gt; Should you (or the repair shop) wish to attempt a Repair Install, you MUST abide by BOTH the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • How to perform a repair installation of Windows XP if a later version of Internet Explorer is installed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/917964</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • About IE7 &amp; IE8 and Windows XP Service Pack 3<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/05/05/ie-and-xpsp3.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2008/05/05/ie-and-xpsp3.aspx</a> </p>
<p>NOTE: If you do a Repair Install without first uninstalling IE8 (and IE7), your ONLY recourse at that point will be a clean install.</p>
<p>TIP: Take the computer to a local, reputable and <em>independent</em> (i.e., <em>
not</em> BigBoxStoreUSA or Geek Squad) computer repair shop. Expect to pay a minimum $75 USD bench fee (i.e., just to have them
<em>look</em> at the computer, whether they fix it or not).</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

                    <p>I posted this question on the outloo.com forum, but they don't seem to be able to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Briefly - If I hit F1, or click on Help in Windowsl Live Mail, it immediately opens up my Oulook.com web page. If I was not logged in, it open a Hotmail sign in page!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no way that WLM Help should open my mail account! That seems to me to be a serious programming error and a security breach.</p>

            <p>There is a configuration file that is downloaded at program start and sign-in that specifies the destination of the
<em>Help</em> link, among many other things. I've noticed that it's recently reverted to the URL help.live.com, a site that was taken down two years ago. Your browser will be re-directed to something like live.com; if you're signed in, this will take you to
 mail.live.com, and if you're not, to the sign-in page.</p>

It's kind of worrysome that this kind of thing can happen on a Microsoft product that is not that old and used by millions. There does not even seem to be a simple update for WLM. It may not be that serious, but it makes one wonder about other Microsoft products.
 Long time since I have been with Apple ;)

<p>There is no way that WLM Help should open my mail account! That seems to me to be a serious programming error and a security breach.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
There's no security involved. If WLMail is open - as it has to be if you're to click the
<em>Help</em> link - then your mail accounts are visible anyway. If you're signed in, then your credentials are already stored to enable synchronization of your contacts and calendar. It would make no difference whether you then clicked on the malfunctioning
<em>Help </em>link or navigated to mail.live.com - your inbox would still appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The config file is market-specific (it carries auto-discovery data for major ISPs in each market), so users in other markets may not be seeing the same. I wonder if this is why you had the brush-off response in your other thread.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One misunderstanding to be squashed: <em>a Microsoft product that is not that old
</em>doesn't really apply to WLMail.&nbsp;Version 8&nbsp;was released in 2006; we're now on v.16.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is no dedicated help function for WLMail. A good&nbsp;way of finding help is at Windows OnLine (WOL):

I didn't say that at all. There have been many updates, two or three each year on average. The latest version for W7 is 16.4.3505.0912. The last four digits are the date the&nbsp;version was compiled for release, in this case 12 September last. You can get the latest

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as regards security: your concern is clearly about <em>privacy</em>. If you want to keep your stuff private - documents, photos, mail, for example - then don't allow anyone else to use your computer as you. Create another Windows user account for them,
 and protect your own with a password. Press Winkey + L whenever you leave your machine to prevent others from accessing your user account.</p>

            <p>The version you have was released in July 2009 and has been updated several times since then, to the latest which is 14.0.8117.0416, from April 2010. Versions 15 and 16 have a very different user interface; v.15 needs Vista SP2 or later, v.16 Windows 7 or
 8. Your version is so old that it doesn't include the automatic (and traumatic) updater that later releases have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The unified Windows Live installer has been in use since 2008.&nbsp;That is because there are several components common to two or more Windows Live programs. You have the opportunity during the installation to deselect the programs you don't want, so you end
 up with just WLMail.<br />
<br />
Whether you can simply install WE2012&nbsp;on top of&nbsp;your current installation depends on whether you normally sign in or not. If you do, there should be no problem. If you don't, then you'll probably lose your contacts and calendar. There's nothing you can do about
 the calendar, but you can export your contacts to CSV so they can be re-imported after the upgrade.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Export all your messages to be on the safe side. You can also export account settings to IAF files to make it easy to set them up in the new version. Tools &gt; Accounts &gt; {account} &gt; Export.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I were you, I'd download the offline installer from this page: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-install-offline-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Install <span>Windows</span> Essentials while offline</a>, then uninstall WLE 2009 using
<em>Programs and Features </em>in Control Panel. Disconnect from the network, close down all running programs including AV and then run the installer. When it's finished, reboot and re-enable your security software if it doesn't start automatically.</p>

            Thanks for staying with this!
<div><br />
<div>It does seem quite a&nbsp;rigmarole&nbsp;to just do a WLM update, but I WILL give it a try, if only as a learning experience!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, all I really need, is a stand alone email client (like OE used to be) where I can collect POP mail from ISP. I also forward other mail to one isp POP account from a couple of gmail accounts and Outlook.com. ISP only uses POP servers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To complicate things, I often READ my mail on a BB Playbook which has it's own way of handling things!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I do appreciate your help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>ADDED: </div>
<div>I &nbsp;followed everything you suggested except for uninstalling existing WLM. To be honest, I just forgot that step. But it seems to have worked fine. I will doa registry clean up just in case unrequired junk has been left.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried the off-line install, and it installed over existing WLM and maintained accounts, contacts and emails so I did not need the saved files. But it also installed Photo Gallery &amp; Writer giving me no choice not to. &nbsp;I think it thought I already had
 these and perhaps they were there without me knowing it. Not voluntarily installed by me. Maybe Outlook.com or Skybox added those. Anyway, I used Control Panel and deleted both.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So I do now have latest version of WLM. The appearance in menu/toolbar is kind of cluttered and I don't really like it. Maybe I will get used to it or perhaps there is a way to change it? OK I found out how to clean it up. Looks much better now with ribbon
 gone.</div>

            I have been using the new version of WLM that is part of WLE. It mostly seems to be OK.<br />
<br />
But, I have one strange thing happening.<br />
<br />
If I shutdown WLM (with nothing else running), it sometimes does this VERY slowly. What I get, is square sections of the Desktop with icons in centre. They come up one at a time and start to create the Desktop sort of like a Mosaik . After a number of these
 have appeared, it seems to get even slower. I have found that once a certain number are present, I can right click and click refresh and the complete Desktop immediately appears.<br />
<br />
WLM is the only program with this type of behaviour.<br />
<br />
Can you explain what is happening, and how it might be overcome?<br />

Please don't do that - it's totally unnecessary, and could cause more problems than it solves. Windows 7 is quite capable of managing the registry by itself, and you don't need to clean, optimize, defrag, tune or otherwise mess with it.</p>

            Thank you for the quick response.&nbsp; I completed all steps as outlined successfully on the Windows 10 laptop.&nbsp; When I repeated steps to then access the folder on the Windows 7 laptop, I got the same results outlined in my original post -- a blank window
 under Network.&nbsp; Please advise if there is another fix I can try.&nbsp; Or advise if perhaps just upgrading the Windows 7 laptop to Windows 10 might solve the issue.<br />

            I wouldn't worry too much about what the ASUS website says. It is possible that your motherboard was released before Windows 7. I have an ASUS P5N-D motherboard that works fine with Windows 7. As far as my motherboard drivers, I go to NVIDIA for the download.
 I've found that my downloads for my motherboard haven't been updated in years. I had to get a newer version of PCProbe II from MajorGeeks.com. The version listed for my motherboard kept crashing. You may have some luck finding better answers at the ASUS forums,
 I did. Someone there called Ulrich has given me some very good advice.

            To answer all your question regarding windows 7 compatibility, download and install the official software from microsoft. It checks your entire system to which is compatible and which is not.

<h2>            Cant access Hard Drive</h2>
                    <p>I backed up video files to a 1TB Western Digital hard drive while doing a clean install of Win 10 on my C drive. When i tried to access the videos on the WD hard drive later on it came up with a message saying folder empty. I am now unable to access the
 drive, I can see it in This PC and it shows it is only half full, telling me how much data is on it and what is remaining.</p>
<p>I ran SFC, CHKDSK and did a virus scan all of which were clear. Do i need data recovery software and if so which one? Thanks</p>

            Hey there jimlad007,<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to hear about the troubles. I'll try to help with whatever I can.&nbsp;<br />
What is the drive's model? How are you connecting the drive to the computer?<br />
I would recommend to see if the drive is recognized properly (model and capacity) in the BIOS, Device Manager and Disk Management. I'd also try it with another cable on another port and possibly on another computer and see if that makes any difference.&nbsp;<br />
I'd also download WD Data Lifeguard Diagnostic tool and see if it detects the drive. Here's a link: http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=hJzMK4<br />
You could also try accessing the drive by booting from Linux Live CD. If you do I'd back everything up before proceeding with any firther troubleshooting.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Post back with some results :)<br />
<br />
Captain_WD.

            <p>I had tried most of &nbsp;your steps with the exception of connecting it to another PC as that is not possible right now. Everything shows up in bios etc that you mention. Data Lifeguard found no problems. Will try the Live Linux option next.</p>
<p>When I scanned it initially with Avast I could see which files (avi) it was scanning as it went along. I tried a scan with a data recovery program and it lists all the files as recoverable. So the files still seem intact.</p>
<p>Will update with Linux option later. Thanks for suggestions.</p>

            I believe this can help regarding the Linux problem: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCD<br />
If the drive passes the WD DLg it should be safe to use and the problem should lie elsewhere. Post back if you are able to boot from Linux or if you try the drive on another PC.<br />

<p>An error message said " the NTFS is unsafe on this drive"</p>
<p>So havent been able to verify if the suspect drive is able to be read by Linux.</p>

            Could you post a screenshot of the way the drive is recognized in Disk Management and My Computer? What is the drive's exact model?&nbsp;<br />
I would contact our live support and see if the guys there can provide more help. Here's a link: http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=99k7Bc<br />
<br />
Post back :)<br />

            <p>I have contacted the Live support guys and they were unable to help either. But everything was recognised and looked healthy in Disk Management when they checked.</p>
<p>For your info the disk in question is a WD, 1Tb internal drive, WD 10EZEX</p>

            This is a regular 1TB WD Blue. A screen shot would still be useful. :)<br />
What did the guys from the support tell you? What did they try? Did you try the drive on another PC?<br />

            <p>Support took control of my PC and tried various options such as CHKDSK, SFC, Hardware Troubleshooter and I think DISM. All returned positive results.</p>
<p>i am sure he did other tests but can't remember what they were. Not currently able to try in another PC.</p>
<p>I have now recovered data from it using Data Recover Pro which worked really well but had to pay for it as I had so many files to recover. Thanks for your suggestions.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Live needs... Ninja Baseball Bat Man</h2>
                    
<p>on my weekly look at Cinemassacre.com, I've seen a new Angry Video Game Nerd video. However, it was not about a bad video **** from the past, it was about a small 16 bits arcade game named with the most awesome title ever for a video game : Ninja Baseball
 Bat Man</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>say it out loud, try to not laugh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dare you not to imagine a Ninja version of Bruce Wayne playing Baseball...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game seems amazingly funny : a good ol' 2D beat 'em all, allowing you to play as a ninja using a baseball bat as a weapon, fighting a load of weird ennemies...</p>
<p>just look at it :&nbsp;<a href="http://cinemassacre.com/2011/07/29/ninja-baseball-batman/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cinemassacre.com/2011/07/29/ninja-baseball-batman/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>what's the nerd final thoughts ? we need this game on a modern home console and I think the world needs to know Ninja Baseball Bat Man, I'll track down a Rom of this game so I can try it, but it sounds so amazing that a modern downloadable platform release
 seems pretty interresting.</p>

<p>Saw it yesterday and wow. That game looks ridiculous by far.</p>
<p>It's nothing but utter chaos. I don't understand how this was possibly conceived by a human brain. It looks like something Konami would make. It looks unnaturally wacky that it would leave your brain cells into degrading drivel without any hope of recovery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I would love to be in on that action. :) I wonder how Irem feels about it.</p>

<h2>            Sound output device will now randomly disappear</h2>
                    <p>At random times (not on startup or anything, just while the computer is on at random times) the default sound output device will disappear, and I notice this happens in the moment because I suddenly have no sound. It gets fixed by going into sound settings,
 troubleshooting, picking the monitor (where the sound is supposed to come from) and on the step where it says windows will play test sounds its suddenly fine again. This happens every day, sometimes twice a day and only started within the last 2 weeks. There
 hasn't been a window update that I'm aware of and I haven't manually changed any settings.</p>
<p>On the day it first happened I tried disabling all the other sound "devices" (NVIDIA High Definition Audio, NVIDIA Virtual Audio, and the blue yeti microphone. Note these two NVIDIA audios aren't my monitor and I'm not sure why they're there, they produce
 no sounds) from the up arrow when pressing the speaker in the bottom right as it would switch to my microphone as the sound device when the monitor disappeared. This hasn't helped however as now when the monitor disappears there is simply no sound device shown
 (it is still fixed in the moment the same way as mentioned above).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My monitor is labelled ROG PG279Q (NVIDIA High Definition Audio) if that helps any.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Afro Samurai</h2>
                    
<p>I just recently acquired Bioshock 2 and Afro Samurai i can already guess that Bioshock 2 is rather awesome from playing the first one but i am rather unsure about Afro Samurai i cant test it atm since i forgot a cable when i was at my dads this weekend...
 (curse the damn cables!) just wondering what are peoples opinion on it out of those who played it? Does it have replay value and all that good stuff or is it just a mediocre hack n slash with nothing really going for it?</p>

<p>No real replay value for me. I play through most of my games twice at least, but not that one. As you suggested, it is a mediocre hack and slash. Ninja Gaiden 2 is a far better ninja game. &nbsp;It is still fun however. I mostly played it because I really enjoyed
 all the cartoons and movies.</p>

            Hi Maria,<br />
<br />
Windows normally offers a <strong>Save </strong><strong>as </strong>option every time you download or transfer a file from Internet or via Bluetooth.<br />
<br />
If you did not see the <strong>Save </strong><strong>as </strong>prompt when the transfer got completed, those files will usually reside in a temporary folder by default. Navigate to<strong> C:\Users\&lt;profile&gt;\AppData\Local\Temp\</strong> and try searching
 for the file by sorting out the date and see if you'll be able to find them.<br />
<br />
If you can still remember the name of those photos or files, you can utilize Windows Search by pressing
<strong>Windows </strong><strong>key </strong>+ <strong>S </strong>and typing the file names. You can also search the files by using File Explorer.<br />
<br />
