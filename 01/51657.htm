                    <p>*Original Title: DirectX and Space Engineers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello, I am running Windows 7 Home Premium 64 Bit and my DirectX diagnostics tool says that my current version is DirectX 11 however when I attempt to run Space Engineers and use a world with planets it tells me that I need to run DirectX 11. When I go to
 my DirectX folder it tells me I am running DirectX 9.0, I am very confused and the internet has not helped me at all up until this point. Any and all suggestions/help and &nbsp;help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Well, isn't this an odd ball game ? Minimum System Requirements = DX9, but DX11 for planets.</p>
<p>Looks like no shore leave for you then.... :)</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"NOTE: The minimum requirements are sufficient to run the game but without planetary features,
</em></p>
<p><em>which require DirectX 11."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"When I go to my DirectX folder it tells me I am running DirectX 9.0,"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Direct X folder ? </p>
<p>Win7 has DX9, 10 &amp; 11. However, older graphics cards are not be capable of using DX11 (or DX10 if old enough).
</p>
<p>These would be graphics cards that are older than&nbsp; AMD HD 5000 ('09 release) and Nvidia GTX 400 ('10 release) series.</p>
<p>EDIT: This also applies to integrated graphics older than Intel HD4000 ( inc, HD3000 and all 'GMA' integrated graphics).</p>
<p>
</p><p>----------------------</p>
<p>- The following is a list of the Direct X .dll files you will have when the files are up to date.<br />
There are more DX files (Xinput and audio), but these are most of the graphics related Direct X&nbsp; .dll's<br />
<br />
Go to the Windows / System 32 folder, (and SysWOW64 if you have 64bit). &nbsp;<br />
- They are in alphabetical order and will start with <em>d3dx9_24.dll</em>&nbsp; &gt; 43 . Then d3dx10 - 33 &gt; 43<br />
.&amp; finally d3dx11 - 42 &gt; 43.<br />
There should also be - d3d9, d3d10 and d3d11. These come before the D3Dcompilers - 33&gt;43.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all of these files are not present update Direct X using the DX Web Installer -</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Occasionally a file gets corrupted (mostly by games always reinstalling DX unnecessarily). I this case</p>
<p>DX needs to be reinstalled using the full DirectX redist (June 2010) -</p>

    <title>Restore&#58; Buttons disabled in Sys Properties&#47;Protect window - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rabnud  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restore&#58; Buttons disabled in Sys Properties&#47;Protect window</h2>
                    I am presently unable to create a restore point, revert to a previous restore point, or configure restore settings. In the System Properties window, System Protection tab, the buttons for those three functions are always disabled (grayed out), and no drives
 are listed under "Available Drives", only the word Searching... . Consequently virtually all updates and any other action that normally wants to create a restore point first fails or simply never gets going.<br />
<br />
So far I have run System File Checker (from the command prompt): according to the log it found and fixed a number of corrupted files, mostly, it seemed, in Internet Explorer.&nbsp; I also ran the Windows fixit tool, and verified that the Volume Shadow Copy service
 had started. Neither tool made any difference.&nbsp; I should also note that, for months, Visual Studio (2010) chimes in to say that a specified file has encountered an unhandled exception - it's always the same 6 or 8 files (always an application file). And for
 months the .NET 4 updates are the ones that consistently fail.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, the PC and Win7 work well. There is plenty of RAM (4GB) and plenty of free space on the several hard drive partitions.<br />
<br />
Can anyone offer a clue and/or a further strategy for fixing this dual problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

I assume by SnapShot that you mean a jpeg image of the System Protection window. I don't see any "snaps" of yours, or a link to them (in FireFox). Am I missing something simple? Using Snagit I took a jpeg snapshot of the window in question; but I see no way
 to attach it here or otherwise make it available to you. As a new participant, are there instructions beyond "Getting Started" that I should bone up on?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I can get to the System Protection window via several routes, and each way the situation is the same - no drives are listed (I normally expect to see 5 or 6 partitions), and the only active (enabled) buttons are OK and Cancel. So I can't set up and allocate
 space as I have often done in the past - there's simply no way (that I can now discover) to get to those windows. In the past I did those allocations, and I could and frequently did set/create restore points. But something is now locking me out of that capability.<br />
<br />
Could this be a matter of permissions? Or perhaps a service that isn't starting?&nbsp; I have a full administrator account, and I turned off Account Control some time ago.

            Thanks, Vinod<br />
<br />
On your advice I downloaded and ran the System Readiness tool for Win7 32-bit. Both CheckSUR logs, which were identical, reported no errors. And as you might expect, there has been no change in the "unusable" System Protection Window described earlier in this
 thread. <br />
<br />
Soon thereafter I was able to successfully install some recent Windows updates. On each attempt Windows Update tries to create a restore point for about 20 minutes, and then proceeds without it. The dozen updates that failed, and have failed repeatedly for
 months, are all associated with .NET 4.&nbsp; And I can no longer open Visual Studio 2010 Pro:&nbsp; it fails with the message "Exception is thrown by the target of an invocation". I'm thinking about uninstalling .NET 4 (using Revo Uninstaller Pro) and reinstalling
 Client and Full with afresh download.<br />
<br />
Could there be a connection between these two issues:&nbsp; unusable System Protection Window and .NET 4 update failures?&nbsp; Could an application, such as Acronis Home Image, cause a problem?<br />
<br />
Out of desperation I'm edging toward a complete "clean" reinstall of Win7 and all applications. But that's a drastic step that I would like to avoid if at all possible.<br />
<br />
Any further ideas or words of advice?<br />
<br />

<p>Hi, I was given a 12 month membership voucher for xbox live gold yesterday, and added the code straight away. I didnt try and access an online game so don't know if it worked right away. I have tried to access an online game today, and it is saying on every
 game I try, my profile is not allowed on xbox live.</p>
<p>I have then tried to see if my account is subscribed to Xbox live, and it saying it isnt and I need to subscribe to a membership! When I try and use the voucher code I used yesterday, it tells me that the code has already been used....</p>
<p>I have tried to access the chat support, but the page wouldnt let me enter my first and last name, and so I couldn't proceed to the chat support. This is becoming more and more frustrating!</p>
<p>Please help</p>

<h2>            screen display bright red running and bleeding through photos</h2>
                    There is a bright red screen display background that seems to be running behind all photos and videos on my laptop, which appeared around Dec 20 2015. It bleeds through photos and at the edge of the screen. The IT person at my office removed all programs
 from my laptop, reset everything, tried to get rid of it, ran all kind of virus scans (found nothing). We set the screen display to a lavender blue, which is covering up the red, but the red is still visible behind it just at the edges. it shows in spots when
 I view some photos. Any way to get rid of it? &nbsp;

            <p>Dear Anil,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your advice. Deleting and reinstalling the graphic driver did not solve the problem. In fact, it was the first thing we tried, before uninstalling all the programs on the laptop and reinstalling some of them. I have verified with HP Assistant
 that I have the correct graphic driver for my laptop (a 6 year old HP dv4-2045dx Entertainment Notebook) to run MS Windows 10. The problem is odd, as it only affects a few colors, in particular the red orange. On the screen color selection array, all the colors
 appear normally, but the red-orange Calder red block has black lines through it (but not flickering). This is the red color that bleeds through some photos, videos, and other graphics. It covers the screen, though at the moment it is covered up by another
 color. The computer works in all respects, but it is tiresome not to be able to view photos with accurate colors and to have the red bleed-through on some letters and other graphics.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have had the same issue and went through all the "driver stuff" above and more.&nbsp; Also</p>
<p>went to the computer manufacturer...nothing worked.&nbsp; I decided it might be the screen (monitor)
</p>
<p>that was bad even though it isn't that old...&nbsp; I have an old small flat screen in the closet so I figured</p>
<p>I'd plug that in and see if I still had a red screen...as I was unhooking this screen from the back of</p>
<p>my computer...I noticed that one of the cable plugs was loose...so I tightened it...and just for the</p>
<p>heck of it...turned on my computer with my "red" screen to see if the loose plug was it....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Low and behold!!!&nbsp; Normal color...YEA!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I lost a whole day fooling with this....Just incase....Make sure your connections are tight.</p>
<p>I hope this helps someone &nbsp;: )</p>

            <p>Hi Diane McGhee,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft community. I will help you resolve issue with uninstall or install Windows updates. Please reply to this question to help you better.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you made any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What is the exact error message?</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Are you logged in as administrator?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you installed updates or new software on your computer, you installed the Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1, which contains a common runtime application that may be required by applications you’re running. During this installation, an account named ASP.NET
 is created. If your computer previously displayed your desktop immediately after starting, you may notice a ‘Welcome’ screen when you start the computer with your existing user account and the ASP.NET account. This happened because there are now two accounts
 on your computer.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can safely remove ASP.NET account.</p>

                    <p>Just installed Window 8 64bit prof, the problem is when I go to install my Adobe Acobat 5&nbsp; on my new system it won't install. It worked on my old system Windows XP SP3 32bit. I even tried to install it by using compatibility mode. Not going to spend more
 money for a&nbsp;newer version of Adobe Acobat 5.</p>
<p>Is there anything I am missing to install on this new system? Or am I just out of luck?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 User files lost after attempting to repair automatic repair - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xjimdim  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 User files lost after attempting to repair automatic repair loop</h2>
                    <p>Hello there</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, two days ago I got stuck in an automatic repair loop after trying to enable an old soundcard connected trhough usb in my DAW software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried everything there is about fixing it (because reinstalling all the programs I got in that drive is a nightmare) but still nothing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So today I decided i will reinstall windows from scratch and I went through my WinPE console&nbsp;(through USB) to copy all the very important files of my work that I had on my desktop. I went under the Users folder but there wasn't my username there!!! In fact
 the Users foled itself is only 8mb in size. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Where did all my user files go? Everything else looks like its there (folders like Program Files, Windows, my xampp folder, and generally anything else on C:)&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Last thing I tried is everythin in this reddit post:&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/3t2xb5/driver_irql_not_less_or_equal_storahcisys/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing of the previous commants that I run on cmd where supposed to do anything about the Users folder.</p>
<p>I run chkdsk, sfc /scannow, some bootrec commands and that's it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At one moment I replaced everything in the config folder of System32 with everything in the RegBack folder. But i got nothing so I replaced the old ones back to normal.</p>
<p>I also tried the DISM command but all i got was errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do any of those commands have to do with my Users file missing. I am getting crazy here</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi...When you open 'This PC' and select your 'C' drive and open it the 'User' folder is there...it always is....The User folder just contains all you programs,one drive,&nbsp; downloads, pictures, documents, music, video's etc...usually the largest folder next
 to 'Windows' .</p>
<p>When installing Windows the User folder is created by default.</p>

    <title>Cannot log into my Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theo_89  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot log into my Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys, I have tried to log into my microsoft account in order to gain access to the store, onenote and sway but so far I haven't had any luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything I have found in forums:</p>
<p>-msconfig&gt;services&gt;firewall&gt;automatic</p>
<p>-msconfig&gt; services&gt; deactivate all non-microsoft services</p>
<p>-use only windows firewall, I actually removed my antivirus sw to be more thorough</p>
<p>-cmd prompt&gt; add account manually</p>
<p>... and I'm pretty sure there's more I've done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Successful settings:</p>
<p>I can check for and install updates normally.</p>
<p>I have synced my "@windowslive.com" mail account (same MS account) on the mail client AS AN EXCHANGE ACCOUNT.</p>
<p>I can add an IMAP account without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unsuccessful settings:</p>
<p>1. Cannot log into my microsoft account through settings. It walks me all the way to adding my local password, then says there was an error probably from our end [Windows]. (Note: this is my personal notebook; I am the admin. Adding a new local account seems
 pointless and impractical.; I don't think it solves but bypasses the problem.)</p>
<p>2. If I choose to create the mail account on the Windows client through the option "Outlook.com, Live.com, Hotmail, MSN", it immediately returns the error
<strong>0x800706d9</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Cannot log into the store, onenote or sway. It basically loops me back to logging in on onenote and sway. On the store, it fails as soon as I choose to log in using "Microsoft account - Outlook.com, Hotmail, Live.com, MSN"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone who can help?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance! </p>

            <p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a beginner so I obviously had all your questions answered.</p>
<p>1. I am writing from the very same computer right now, so I do have a connection.</p>
<p>2. I haven't changed my password, I can sign into my account via a browser as always. Like I said, I have synced my windowslive email on the Windows 10 Mail client and it works just fine. The problem is I had to choose the Exchange option when creating it,
 though I do not think this email is an exchange account.</p>
<p>3. About typing my password: nothing happened, my password is inserted correctly. I have tried typing a different password to see what happens and it doesn't allow me to proceed to the next step (which is to insert my local login password). Typing the right
 password, gets me to the next step (local pass) and after that it says something went wrong from the OS's or Microsoft's end.</p>
<p>4. This issue arose right from the beginning. No more changes were carried out. I executed the Win 10 update last month; I never had the store or my microsoft account working. Thus, there has not been a change of state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the troubleshooter which found the following error: </p>
<p><em>"No rootcauses found and created logs"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem comes from the OS, it is not Microsoft account related, unless the
<em>windowslive</em> domain is not accepted anymore. I just don't understand how it is possible to receive Windows updates when those also require my microsoft account. I strongly believe this problem was caused by me when I was setting up my Windows 10 local
 preferences for the first time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any suggestions or should I ran the recovery procedure?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you once more!</p>
<p>

<div>Are you using Windows live mail client or built in \Mail app? </div>
<div>Windows Live ID are available with the following domains:</div>

@Hotmail.com<br />
@Outlook.com</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hey hi!<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot. I am using the built-in Mail app. I thought your last tip was the solution but, unfortunately, it didn't work.<br />
<br />
I created a new "@outlook.com" account via the browser and tried to log into this account through the windows user account settings and I had the same problem. Took some print screen's for you to see...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may see below the message window that pops up after introducing my local password. //sequence of events mentioned in previous message in the thread.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/72eec60d-6a53-4fcd-ac18-171df5839c56" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/72eec60d-6a53-4fcd-ac18-171df5839c56" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e31ca08-a9cb-4d2b-b0f6-dffa89f70dd7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e31ca08-a9cb-4d2b-b0f6-dffa89f70dd7" /></a></p>
<p>When I tried to create an account through the Windows settings it failed once more just after choosing to create a new one. Below is the message I get.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/32022a29-1ae9-4b8a-81fb-0a5ac08b2298" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/32022a29-1ae9-4b8a-81fb-0a5ac08b2298" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when I try to add the new account to the section illustrated below, it will pop the same error window up just after choosing the Outlook option. See below.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/db72fc1e-bdcf-4d8d-b567-86bba20d38d7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/db72fc1e-bdcf-4d8d-b567-86bba20d38d7" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a7e1e39-a976-476f-972e-0f65544022c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1a7e1e39-a976-476f-972e-0f65544022c0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am concluding that the problem is not only account related. This error shows before I even try to specify an account.</p>
<p>Strangely though, I am able to receive Windows updates without any problems. I am perplexed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to any ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Thanks for the update. Please answer these questions. </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>•&nbsp;Are you using any Proxy or VPN connections? </div>
<div>Something must be blocking the mail app. I would suggest you to disable the antivirus and firewall program temporary and check if it helps.
<div><br />
When you disable Antivirus:<br />
Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div><br />
If issue still persist, I would suggest you to perform Clean Boot.</div>

            Hi kingskidoo,<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Thanks again. If changing the resolution and applying the update didn't work, we're pretty much stuck until&nbsp;Brother comes out with an update that address's your issue. As I said in the previous, that dialogue box is hard coded. They set an attribute to not
 allow you to change the size of that box. So, there's not going to be a whole lot we can do at the moment. Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks,

    <title>recovery of deleted Skype chats&#47;messages from Cloud - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            recovery of deleted Skype chats&#47;messages from Cloud</h2>
                    Hi Skype, I deleted all my skype chats/messages in 1 of the chat boxes on purpose and manually but now I would like to retrieve those messages. Does anyone know how I can do that? Is there a way to contact Skype with this question? I read that there is
 a way to recover the messages from the last 30 days from the Cloud. Thank you very much for your help, Chris

            If you delete messages manually, they are deleted from the cloud. Once deleted, they cannot be recovered. If you utilize the latest Skype clients or the
<a href="http://preview.web.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for Web preview</a> and neither contain the chats you are looking for, they no longer exist in the cloud.

<h2>            FAT32 USBs write protected after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    After I upgraded my PC to Windows 10, every USB I plug in is now write protected.&nbsp; There are posts about a security tab.&nbsp; Well, the security tab is not an option when "Properties" is opened.&nbsp; I've tried 3 different ways to reformat the devices but, guess
 what, they're all write protected.&nbsp; I can't believe, well I can believe, how no one ever thought this might happen.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft&nbsp;Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try the steps below and check if the issue can be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Removing write-protection in the Registry using Regedit.exe</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so: Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For
 added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/en-us</span></a></p>
<p><span>How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p>Search and open <strong>regedit</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Navigate to <strong>Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\StorageDevicePolicies</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Double-click on the <strong>WriteProtect</strong> value in the right-hand pane of Regedit.exe. Change the Value data from 1 to 0 and click OK to save the change.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Close Regedit and restart your computer. </p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Connect your USB drive again, and you should find it is no longer write protected. You can now format the drive as normal by right-clicking on it in My Computer and choosing Format.</p>
<p>After formatting you may revert the settings(0 to 1) or if you created the value, then delete it, then reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p>
<p>If you can't find <strong>StoredDevicePolicies</strong> then you have to create one by right clicking on
<strong>Control &gt; New &gt; Key</strong> and name it as <strong>StoredDevicePolicies</strong>. Now create
<strong>WriteProtect</strong> by right clicking on <strong>Stored Device Policies&gt; New &gt; DWORD</strong> and name it as
<strong>WriteProtect</strong>.</p>
<p>*DWORD chosen depending on your system: 32bit or 64bit.</p>

<p>Connect a microphone, music player, or other audio device to your computer (you would want to be sure<br />
the&nbsp;microphone input is enabled)<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Connect-a-microphone-music-player-or-other-audio-device-to-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Connect-a-microphone-music-player-or-other-audio-device-to-your-computer</a><br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The drivers might also need to be updated :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High Definition<br />
Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
If your driver shows 06 you have the windows default and that is part of the issue.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and get latest Sound/Audio drivers - Download - SAVE - go to where you<br />
put them - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN - Reboot <br />
<br />
<strong>Check the Version on Driver's tab in Device Manager as often sound drivers rollback<br />
and then finally install the current version. Reboot and check after each try, not<br />
unusual to have to run the driver 1-4 times or so. Just make sure the version you<br />
installed shows up in the driver's tab.<br />
</strong><br />
Then go to Device Maker's site and look for even newer drivers and repeat install procedure.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
After updating driver.<br />
<br />
<strong>Right click Speaker near Clock -&nbsp;Recording Devices - right click in box - check Show&nbsp;<br />
Disconnected Devices and Show Disabled Devices - check your mic - highlight them <br />
and then on lower right properties. Make sure the proper one is enabled and check<br />
other settings - on Levels tab make sure MUTE is unchecked and APPLY / OK changes</strong>.<br />
<br />
Also in Control Panel look for some Audio Manager (maybe named after sound driver maker). Mine<br />
is RealTek Audio Manager, yours can be entirely different name if you have one.<br />

    <title>frequent USB disconnect&#47;reconnect - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            frequent USB disconnect&#47;reconnect</h2>
                    Hello all. A problem has developed recently on my system - USB devices connect and disconnect seemingly randomly.<br />
<br />
The device and particular port used don't seem to matter. I've had the problem with an external WD drive, a portable MP3 player, and now a powered USB hub that I thought might help the problem (if lack of power may have been the problem) - it didn't.<br />
<br />
I've found numerous posts online concerning the same problem, with no solutions. The "Make sure to untick the 'allow the computer to turn off this device..." suggestion is offered almost universally. I have done so to no avail.<br />
I have tried each device in all ports available with no discernible effect. Incidentally, my MS optical mouse never seems to cut out. That is the only USB device I have connected full time. There's never more than two USB devices at a time.<br />
<br />
The drive, MP3 player, etc. 'can' perform normally for a time. The problem is fairly sporadic. Noticeably odd, is that if a device is connected and I play/pause/stop a video while attempting to use one of those devices, the disconnect/connect cycle begins (this
 occurs with WMP and VLC). I have to physically unplug the device at that point.<br />
<br />
Any help would be GREATLY appreciated, as this is making my external devices rather useless. Transfers interrupted mid stream ,etc. Let me know if you need and further info. Thanks much!<br />

<p>How old is the computer? It sounds like the USB ports on the motherboard are failing. This is not uncommon, particularly if the computer is older than 4-5 years. A workaround is to purchase a PCI USB controller card. These are fairly inexpensive. If that
 solves the issue, bear in mind that motherboard failures do not bode well for the computer's future and it may be time to consider replacing it. And BTW, your computer is not patched because Service Pack 3 has been out for years.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I must stress that you should not take what I have written as a definitive diagnosis. I cannot see or test your computer from here. I'm giving you my opinion about your computer based on my professional experience as a computer tech and on what

<p>Thanks for the response. I got this board just under a year ago. It certainly isn't a high end board, but I was hoping it wasn't failing me already. I had considered the possibility. The number of hits I got on Google for 'random USB disconnects 'threw me.
 It appeared fairly common, just with no answers.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that the USB mouse works, but a powered hub doesn't (with any other peripheral) seemed odd. For example, if I unplug the mouse from its port, and plug another periph. into it, it will start the disconnect nonsense. Why would this be if the
 port is going out? And does it seem likely that all ports are failing simultaneously? Anyway, these things didn't seem to indicate the board was on its way out - but I 'spose I have to consider it.</p>
I think I will try the PCI card, that sounds like a plan - they are quite cheap. If no luck, I suppose I can spend a bit more this time around on a better quality board! Thanks again for the suggestions.
<p>Oh, and with regard to SP3, I'd been using only SP2 for years without issue, so never opted to proceed. No big. But thx for mentioning it.</p>

            Hi Reyko_
<br />
<br />Then closest thing to that is to reset Windows 10, while keeping just your own files. you would however need to re-install all your 3rd party applications when that process completes . .. 
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep just your files 
<br />Then start the Reset

<p>Depends what you mean by 'wipe a hard drive.' Regardless, there's no way to keep&nbsp;<em>only</em> the operating system and specific files, but here is the closest that you can come to that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Backup the specific files that you want to keep. Make sure to store them somewhere that is&nbsp;<em>not</em> on the computer.</p>
<p>2- Do a 'remove everything' reset. This erases your hard drive and re-installs of a fresh copy of Windows 10.</p>
<p>3- Restore the files that you previously backed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you reset you'll have to setup Windows all over again, and you'll have to re-install all your software. All that will take most of a day ... unless you run into problems.</p>
