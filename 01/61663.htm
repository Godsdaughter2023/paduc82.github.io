<div>yet, but worth a try.</div>

<h2>            Windows Media Player</h2>
                    Hi, I am trying to save a voicemail to my computer. I am running windows 10.&nbsp; It seems I have to save it via WMP (not sure but it seems that way)?&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Media player is updated.&nbsp;I have sent the voicemail to my email and it is an m4m file. &nbsp; WMP won't
 play the voicemail and won't save it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do i have to convert this to an mp3? I looked at some things about codecs but my WMP is updated.

<h2>            Windows defender - blocked start up programmes</h2>
                    
<p>Over the last couple of days, whenever I log in, windows defender pops up and says that it has blocked a programme from starting up. So I open windows defender up and choose the 'show or remove blocked start up programmes' I presume the programme that is
 blocked is the one showing on screen. How do I remove the blocked programme?&nbsp;The remove, disable and enable buttons are greyed out. I don't want to run it in case it is an infected file. The file is Digital Line Detection by Avanquest Software.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Here's some information on dlg.exe; <a href="http://www.processlibrary.com/directory/files/dlg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.processlibrary.com/directory/files/dlg</a>.&nbsp; Here's more information:<a href="http://forums.avanquestusa.com/aq/archive/index.php/t-4477.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.avanquestusa.com/aq/archive/index.php/t-4477.html</a>.&nbsp; As you can see, the makers of this
 program are known to have made Spyware in the past and that's probably why it is being blocked.</p>
<p>How did you get this program and why did you get this program?&nbsp; It seems to me that it doesn't offer much you can't get with programs that cause fewer problems (if it is needed at all).&nbsp; I checked the avanquest web site and this program is not listed:
<a href="http://www.avanquest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avanquest.com/</a>.&nbsp; I also checked BVRP Phone Tools (which dlg.exe is supposed to be a part of):<a href="http://download.cnet.com/BVRP-Mobile-Phone-Tools/3000-2349_4-93370.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/BVRP-Mobile-Phone-Tools/3000-2349_4-93370.html</a>&nbsp;but
 that seemed for mobile phones and led back to avanquest.&nbsp; I could find no information on the product (furthermore, BVRP Phone Tools did not list itself&nbsp;as compatible with Vista).</p>
<p>If I were you, I would remove/uninstall this program.&nbsp; It doesn't sound like you're using it (it's blocked) and you didn't mention any functions you can't perform that you want to perform because it isn't there.&nbsp; Go to Start / Control Panel / Programs and
 Features and see if you can find it under any of the above names and then right click on it and click uninstall.</p>
<p>If it is not listed, go to&nbsp;<span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
 run Autoruns and click on the Everything Tab.&nbsp; Look for dlg.exe or anything relating to any of the program or product names listed above and when you find&nbsp;it uncheck the box to stop&nbsp;it from starting at startup.&nbsp; Check the whole list as there may be more than
 one entry.&nbsp; When done, click OK and reboot.&nbsp;Since it is no longer starting at startup, it should no longer need to be blocked and hopefully that will eliminate the message.&nbsp; I would prefer if we could uninstall the program, but if it can't be found then we'll
 have to be satisfied with keeping it from running.</span></p>
<p><span>This will not remove it from Defender (unless it is uninstalled) and I can't explain why the buttons are greyed out (are you logged in as an Administrator?).&nbsp;
 But I think the above process will resolve the problem.&nbsp; If the message continues to appear, then I suggest you contact Avanquest Technical Support<a href="http://kb.avanquestusa.com/display/4/search.aspx?tab=search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://kb.avanquestusa.com/display/4/search.aspx?tab=search</a>&nbsp;and
 ask them how to remove it and why it's causing so many problems.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro on Microsoft Suface Laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a Microsoft Surface Laptop which had Windows 10 S installed. However, I now seem to be on Windows 10 Pro (which I much prefer!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that I have tried several times to install the latest upgrade (version 1803) but get an error message saying it fails to install and I should contact the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried the trouble shooting option and it fails to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell me how I can get the latest Windows 10 upgrade so that I can install upgrades in the future?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<h2>            Missing Tax Invoice for purchase of Microsoft Windows 10</h2>
                    Hi I recently bought MS Windows 10 online and need a document that says Tax Invoice so I can claim it as a tax deduction in Australia. The Order History page shows the purchase was made successfully, but does not show a link to the Tax Invoice. I've made
 other other purchases that do show links to Tax Invoices. Any ideas?

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try the following methods and check if it helps to resolve your issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1. Run&nbsp;Network adaptor&nbsp;trouble shooter.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may try Microsoft Automated Troubleshooting Services as a first step to diagnose and repair common&nbsp;Network&nbsp;issues.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>To run the trouble shooter follow the steps given below.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press Windows key+ X key, Select Control Panel.</span></li><li><span>Click on Troubleshooting, Click View All.</span></li><li><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Network Adaptor</strong>&nbsp;and follow the instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue still persists try method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Install the&nbsp;Network drivers in Compatibility Mode.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website.</span></li><li><span>Right-click on the driver setup file and click on <strong>‘properties’</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on the <strong>‘compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box <strong>
‘Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select Windows&nbsp;operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></li></ol>

<p><strong>Hello,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have an&nbsp;Acer Aspire E380 T180 which came with Vista installed. I have been running XP for the last few years. I have recently installed Windows 7 and i cannot find a functional sound driver. On XP i was using Realtek HD audio driver R1.39.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there anyway to get sound to function using Windows 7?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks! Any help would be amazing.</strong></p>

<p><span>Hello eradicati0n,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers Site.</span></p>
<p><span>In addition to Suresh’s reply, there does not appear to be an audio device driver for Windows 7 provided by the PC manufacturer for the model PC provided- Acer Aspire E380.&nbsp;
</span><span><span><span>You may try installing the latest audio device driver for your PC in&nbsp;compatibility mode and then check
 the issue. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span>To install the audio driver in compatibility mode, you may view the thread below:

    <title>Documents folder larger than the content - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Documents folder larger than the content</h2>
                    My Documents folder shows that it contains 10 GB of data but when I select all the content (files and folders), I reach only 0.5 GB (I don't use this folder, that's why it should not contain much). I set that it should show hidden files, too, but it did
 not show any additional stuff. How does it come? I'm using SSD, so this difference is crucial for me.

            <p>Have any of the files been compressed? In Windows Explorer compressed files are normally displayed in blue. You could also right click on the file and select properties. On the general tab you will see Size which matchs what is listed in the Windows Explorer
 Detail view and size on disk, which is after the file has been compressed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When reconciling disk space usage in Windows Explorer you can encounter a number of problems. File compression is one. The System Volume Information folder is another as it it does not display the disk space used by&nbsp;the contents of the folder, which can
 be considerable. You can also encounter a number of programmes which hide folders / files, which are&nbsp;not revealed when "Show hidden files " is selected. Norton adopted this procedure with Norton Protected Storage and others have followed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To investigate disk space usage download and install Treesize (freeware).

    <title>OneNote from Lock Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnf_77  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneNote from Lock Screen</h2>
                    Just got my Surface Pro 3. Have all the updates for the Surface Pro and the OneNote App as far as I can tell. The problem I am experiencing is that the one click of the button on top of the pen does not launch OneNote from the lock screen. Once I am signed
 in, if I click the top button of the pen OneNote launches every time like a champ. But if I close the type cover, or manually lock the Surface Pro, when I click the top of the pen nothing happens. However, clicking the top of the pen will wake up the Surface
 Pro and cause the lock screen to appear. But clicking again will not take me from the lock screen to OneNote as advertised.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've upgraded Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 one month ago. Today I got Software update of Sound Driver. After Updating this Driver my Headphones aren't working and if I plays music on speakers it's also not working for sometime. If I try to Troubleshoot Sound
 Problems for Headphones by pluging it while Troubleshooting, it's showing that "Headphone is unpluged." Please help me to resolve this problem.</p>
<p>Thanks &amp; regards,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have the same issue! It's definetly the driver that is corrupt. After installing it, the speakers didn't work.</p>
<p>I did a full system restore to before the update and it just worked fine until that **** update was installed automatically again. It creates 2 issues, either you do have sound but no video can play (no browser or program can play a video of whatever
 format) or the sound devices appear as not installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really a pain in the **** since microsoft forces driver updates but doesn't even make shure that they do work! The option to exclude drivers from windows update doesn't work anymore. You can untick the case, but windows installs them anyways. And you
 can't manually uninstall it either since it doesn't appear in the Update history.</p>
<p>The only way to "repair" your computer is to do a restore which, for me, takes almost an hour to complete and then go offline. So it is no option either..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone has to come up with a permanent fix for this issue, the old driver was only like a month old but worked perfectly! I want it back!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
        </p>

Version:8.65.17.50<br />
Date:5/25/2014</p>
<p>
</p><p>Verify in windows sound setting, Speakers is now "Conexant SmartAudio HD"</p>
<p>
</p><p>3] Problem is solved after reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck!</p>

            <p>Hi marbarak.</p>
<p>Not really a solution since you can't deactivate updates anymore. At least it's not possible on Win 10 pro. Even in the Device installation settings, it doesn't matter if you tick the case for never updating drivers, windows 10 still downloads and installs
 the Conexant driver.</p>
<p>I'm testing a fix right now but would like to try it for some days before claiming it's definitely working. In the device settings under Audio Video controler, you do a right click on the Conexant driver and click update. Then instead of installing automatically,
 you chose to search it on your pc and from a list of drivers. It will give you the choice between Conexant and "High definition Audio driver". Pick the High def. one and install it. If in the next days, windows won't replace it by Conexant, it's a permanent
 fix.</p>
<p>After installing it, your audio (also dolby) will work fine and the microphone which had issues through several drivers will work perfectly. Cortana will react faster to Hey Cortana and I have the impression that my Laptop boots like 5 seconds faster (boot
 + loading my autostart programs)</p>

            <p>Thanks Joël.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought to disable windows update until there is an updated version of the driver.<br />
</p>
<p>To stop windows update, I disabled the "Windows Update" service using the control panel.<br />
</p>
<p>You are are correct that this is not a permanent solution. Anyways, after doing the procedure above, I re-enabled windows update and checked for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surprisingly, the Conexant driver was not updated again.</p>
<p>So far so good :-)</p>

            <p>Didn't work for me. After a new start-up, the update service is always switched to on and the driver already downloading.</p>
<p>The only way I could stop that was using the windows default driver. The system won't force me back to the conexant driver. But for me, it's only a temporary solution since the sound is horrible without the dolby digital effects that come with the driver.</p>
<p>Conexant really needs to fix the issues and offer a working driver. That or offer the latest win 8.1 driver that came out before win 10 since it worked perfectly on the new os.</p>

            <p>Exactly the same problem with my Lenovo 540! All was working fine in W8.1. Did upgrade to W10 and Conexant driver was updated - then not only sound was issue but also no Flash/Shockwave in Edge or IE11. Browser(s) just crashed. Downloaded original Conexant
 driver for Lenovo E540 from Lenovo (8.66.16.50) now for W10, deleted the old driver and reinstalled from the installer. All worked fine. It also installed the new Dolby V2 which also worked and definitely enhances the sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just installed W10_TH2 and all **** has broken loose again! Now the device driver for Sound, Video and Games shows two drivers installed 1) the Conexant SmartAudio HD 20751 and 2) the High Definition Audio driver from Microsoft (10.0.10586.0 th2 release
 151029-1700). Flash/Shockwave now freezes again and crashes. Audio works. Dolby V2 works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to uninstall the Microsoft driver and on reboot it simply re-installs again! So I have disabled it and for now everything works. I have run the Devices and Drivers Troubleshooter and of course it reports the Microsoft driver as "disabled" dhuuu I know!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the Conexant Driver and everything worked fine with just the Microsoft driver except the volume was barely audible. That is because the Dolby feature is not active. Tried to install the Dolby enhancements separately but on launch it reports
 incorrect device. This is because the Dolby app is tied to Lenovo/Conexant driver and is not licensed for Microsoft driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I figure I have to get rid of the Microsoft Driver but seems no way to prevent it from installing on reboot. If you want Dolby (which is a must for the Lenovo laptops if you want high volume) you have to use the Conexant driver.</p>

 be a REFUND button. There is NOT. Tried the online help -does not go through. Will walk to the dairy and get phone credit I guess</p>

<h2>            Skype Phone Number not working</h2>
                    <p>I've been paying for this service for more than a year now.</p>
<p>Today, I needed to receive a call on my Skype number and it didn't work. I'm paying for that and I can't believe it's not been working, probably for a while. Since I cannot reach anyone from customer service, I might file a dispute as fraudulent charge.
 Because it is... fraud!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype is becoming one of the worst software I have ever saw. I've been using it since 2003 or 2004 probably, Microsoft buying it ruined it... I can't wait to see the same happened to Minecraft... The erosion already started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft used to innovate in the 90's and even 00's with new consoles. Now it's just following the trend and milking cash cows.</p>
<p>Customer service is inexistent... I hope Microsoft will be fined badly for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I advise everyone to move to Discord, it's answering all your needs and more.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have mentioned that you are unable to play any CD\DVD on your laptop. We’ll help you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a few questions first, to get a clear picture of the issue;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Did you make any recent changes to the computer before this issue started?</p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Is the CD\DVD drive listed in the Windows explorer?</p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Do you get any error message when you insert a disc?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue could be caused due to various reasons like hardware error, incorrect settings etc,. Let’s try these steps and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Check the device status in Device manager</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to first check the status of the device in device manager. The device status will usually show the reason for the issue if any device is not working properly. Try these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows key + X, select Device manager</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Locate your CD\DVD drive and right click to select properties</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Check for the device status under general tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Hardware and devices troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the built-in Hardware and devices troubleshooter to check if this issue is caused due to any hardware errors. Refer these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows key +X, select Control panel</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Run the Hardware and devices troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3: Update driver</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue could have been caused due to an outdated driver also. I would suggest you to install the updated Windows 8 driver from the manufacturer’s website and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Please get back to us with the status of the issue so that we can help you accordingly.</p>

            While I found the information regarding the windows key plus x useful, the results were less than satisfactory.&nbsp; Method 1 did not show any type of status. Method two found nothing wrong with my cd/dvd player, but apparently my bluetooth setting is off.&nbsp;
 Method 3 would have been fixed with Method 2 had there been an issue found, but again nothing mentioned about my drive.&nbsp; I have a Dell Inspiron 15R, Yes it is listed in the explorer window and No, no errors pop up. Nothing pops up.&nbsp; I have tried to play a
 workout dvd and my office inkjet printer cd, but wont do anything on either of them.&nbsp; What other information do you need for this?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You won't be able to play DVD disks or files with Media Player 12 due to licensing reasons...</p>
<p>You will either need to activate Media Center or use a 3rd party player for that...</p>
<p>That wouldn't apply to the installation CD though...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Does Device Manager show any error messages for your drive?</p>
<p>Do you have iTunes installed? There have been issues with that.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What happens with the printer disk... It may be a separate software compatibility issue.</p>
<p>Any specific message...or approximate recollection?</p>

    <title>WMC Netflix&#58; lower right control bar is gone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mylan1  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMC Netflix&#58; lower right control bar is gone</h2>
                    <p>I´m using Netflix from within Windows 7 Home Premium 64 Bit Media Center. Everything was fine, until since a few days the lower right control bar (volume, ff,...) is gone when playing back. If I hit the upper left back button to go back to the Netflix menu,
 the movie continues as&nbsp;always in small mode. Then I do see the bottom right controls and can, for example, fast forward and then maximize again. This is of course not acceptable as a long term solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to reinstall the Netflix plugin. Didn´t help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have restored system settings to a point from a few days ago when it still worked normally and before some Microsoft updates. However, after I went back I had to reinstall Silverlight, as the Netflix plugin reported it could not open the player.&nbsp; Netflix
 is working again, but I don´t see the control bar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The control bar does show up when I play back content other than Netflix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>EDIT: Going back to a 2012 version of Silverlight did not change the problem.<br />

            Actually WMC has its own updates, completely separate from Windows itself. &nbsp;You'll see the green WMC icon (with an arrow pointing down) in the system tray by the clock when they're downloading. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>But on a positive note, the controls are BACK! &nbsp;I don't know exactly when they came back, but I noticed them again this morning! &nbsp;Are they back for everyone else? &nbsp;If not, try doing the manual WMC update, it will hopefully work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks Microsoft for fixing it! &nbsp;I was starting to worry WMC was on its way out! &nbsp;(Knock on wood!)</div>

<h2>            IE, Edge and Chrome run, but Firefox won&#39;t</h2>
                    <p>Monday, I applied the April update to my Lenovo G700 laptop.I normally use Firefox as my default browser, but this morning. it won't even run. Yesterday, I found that IE, Edge and Chrome work with Mail, but Firefox wouldn't; today, Firefox won't even run,
 whether from the Start menu or my taskbar shortcut. All I get is a "This app has been blocked by your System Administrator." message. Obviously, there's some setting that isn't set properly, but I don't know what it is or how to set it. Could anyone suggest
 a solution that would let Firefox run?</p>
<p>

            Hi Roger, 
<br />
<br />First thing I would do is uninstall and reinstall Firefox. 
<br />
<br />Click start - type control panel - then go into programs and features. Locate Mozilla Firefox, right click and uninstall (If you have bookmarks, let me know, and we can save them before you do this)

    <title>Window focus lost after confirming file deletion from Windows Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hjpotter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window focus lost after confirming file deletion from Windows Explorer in dual monitor setup</h2>
                    <p>This morning, I installed the Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 7 Pro. I'm already experiencing an incredibly annoying bug when deleting files. This seems to be the case because I am using multiple monitors. What happens is the Explorer window from which I
 initiate the deletion loses focus after confirming the deletion. Instead, Windows seems to focus the most recent window that had focus on monitor #1 instead of going back to window the most recent window regardless of which monitor it was on. Note then when
 I say monitor #1, I mean #1 as seen by the video card, not the monitor that is set as the 'main display' in Windows. In my case, monitor #2 is my main display while monitor #1 is the slave. If I do this file deletion in an Explorer window on monitor #1 then
 the issue is not present things seem to work as expected. I have an NVIDIA Quadro 600 video card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps I can take to reproduce it every time. This requires that you have a dual monitor setup!</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open another program, such as a web browser, and position it completely on monitor #1 (to determine which monitor is #1, right-click on the Desktop and click on "Display settings" and the monitors will be numbered in the graphic).</p>
<p>2. Open a Windows Explorer window on monitor #2 to a directory where there are several files you wish to delete.</p>
<p>3. With the mouse, click on any file in that directory to apply focus to the file list portion of the window.</p>
<p>4. Optionally, use the arrow keys to navigate to a different file if the one you clicked on is not one you wish to delete.</p>
<p>5. Press the Delete key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>6. The 'Delete File' confirmation comes up. Press the Enter key to confirm that you wish to delete the file. The confirmation window closes and the file is deleted.</p>
<p>7. At this point, the window focus is _supposed_ to return to the list of files in that Explorer window on monitor #2 and keyboard navigation should work without any further interaction. I.e. I should be able to arrow down to the next file immediately after
 deleting a file. However, what actually happens if I arrow down is that I find that focus has been shifted to monitor #1, in my test case to a web browser window. The web page scrolls down. If I Alt+Tab, focus is back on the Explorer window and I can delete
 another file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a user like me that uses the keyboard more than the mouse, this is a pretty annoying issue that I'm hoping will get patched quickly.</p>

<h2>            I&#38;&#35;39&#59;m missing money from my card.</h2>
                    
<p>This isn't much of a problem. It's just that recently I bought a 25$ card to buy games and DLC online. I bought fallout 3 which costed 15$ so I should've had 10$ left. So I went to buy a DLC for Borderlands, but it turned out I had 9.67$ instead of 10$.
 So I couldn't buy the DLC I wanted. Could someone tell me what happened or could someone who works here please add the money to my account so I can get the DLC? Any explanation would help.</p>

<p>Hi there, Danny8849;</p>
<p>With the switch from Microsoft Points to local currency, dear old "Uncle Sam" has now begun to dip his hand in the cookie jar. With every purchase you make from your Microsoft Account, your local sales tax is added to the total just like it would be were
 to purchase the content at a local retail store. You should receive a confirmation e-mail in the e-mail associated with your Microsoft Account that details the purchase including the sales tax.</p>

            <p>As Hyrule alludes to, it seems like you were charge sales tax on the Fallout purchase, meaning more was taken out of the account than the $15 list price. It also means that to purchase the Borderlands content you would need a bit more than $10 in there to make the purchase.</p>

    <title>Screen Dims while watching Vudu&#47;Netflix - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gasher71  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Dims while watching Vudu&#47;Netflix</h2>
                    
<p>While watching a Vudu movie for about 10 minutes the screen dims and you have to move the remote to wake it back up. &nbsp;The way I fixed this issue when it happens while Watching Netflix was to use Amazon fire or built in app in TV. or PC connected to TV. &nbsp;Anyway
 is that what I will have to do to 'fix' this issue (i.e. just use something else that works?) &nbsp;Is there a setting that says do do this? I've turned off the auto shut off just in case that would help but it doesn't.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>This does seem like a fairly widespread issue from what I can see and unfortunately I haven't found a solid fix. Some have said the good old power cycle worked, hold the power button on the console until the system completely powers down, unplug it from
 the power socket for 30 seconds and plug back in and start it up.</p>
<p>I also read that having your headphones plugged into your controller stops it without you having to constantly move the controller.</p>
<p>One last thing is checking your ambient lighting settings on the TV itself as again a few have said this was their issue, unfortunately I couldn't find a consistent fix for it.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about the trouble with the screen dimming in Netflix. To check does this happen with any other apps? To look a bit more into this, can you clarify if you're using a Kinect sensor and which OS version your Xbox One is on? Also, can you clarify which power mode you have your console set to?</p>

            Then I would take it back to where you bought because i would assume you would have warranty on it.
<br />Thing is a clean install would be first troubleshooting step.
<br />Then if that doesn't work then we would have to move to hardware and that can be very tedious trying to pinpoint.
<br />That's why i suggest get it replaced while you can.
<br />
<br />Let me know what you think.

                    Musicmatch&nbsp;Jukebox no longer exist. Was sold to Yahoo then sold to Rhapsody. MJ was taken down around 2006 - 2007 and yet to be replaced. Theres no Support for MusicMatch Jukebox Player. Majority of past users are highly disappointed due to the lost of
 the "best MP3 player" online.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10- can&#39;t save stuff to the Desktop</h2>
                    <p>Since I uninstalled Norton security I lost the capability to save stuff to the desktop. I'm also unable to locate a solution to fixing it via google information till now stumbling into win10 support. I purchased my HP Envy on-line via Costco but didn't&nbsp;
 receive the shipping till</p>
<p>Dec2016. I've read many instructions on this website but the most hopeful one doesn't give the right answer. I'm unable to follow this because I can't keep it to the desktop for any follow up.</p>

<p>Hi Luis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having no administrator access is one of the reasons why a user has limitations in accessing or saving files in the computer. Answering the following questions may help us in resolving the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Aside from uninstalling Norton, were there any changes made on your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Do you have an administrator access to the computer?</li><li>Are you getting an error message or code?</li><li>Have you tried creating a temporary user profile to isolate the issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you already performed?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>I am the only owner and administrator of my computer. Since I uninstalled norton security the issue started immediately. I have no idea what causes it and Norton</p>
<p>denies they have nothing to do with the issue. I will continue with the recommended steps 2-5.</p>

<p>A corrupted user profile may cause this issue with your computer. To isolate the issue, let's follow these steps&nbsp; to create a temporary user profile and check if the problem persist:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Professional editions:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;button, then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Settings</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&gt;<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Accounts<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>&gt;<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Family &amp; other people<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>&gt;<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Add
 someone else to this PC</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter a user name, password, password hint, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Next</strong>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 10 Enterprise edition:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<ol>
<li>Select the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;button, then select&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;<strong>&nbsp;Accounts&nbsp;</strong>&gt;<strong>&nbsp;Other people&nbsp;</strong>&gt;<strong>&nbsp;Add someone else to this PC</strong>.</li><li>At the bottom of the page, select&nbsp;<strong>I don’t have this person’s sign-in information</strong>, and at the bottom of the next page, select&nbsp;<strong>Add a user without a Microsoft account</strong>.</li><li>Enter a user name, password, password hint, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>To make the new account an administrator account, select&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Account&nbsp;</strong>&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Family &amp; other people</strong>&nbsp;(or&nbsp;<strong>Other people</strong>, if you're using Windows 10 Enterprise), and
 select&nbsp;<strong>Change account type</strong>. Under&nbsp;<strong>Account type</strong>, select&nbsp;<strong>Administrator</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>. Restart your machine and sign in with the new administrator account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need any other assistance.</p>

<p>Hey</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wondering if you found a solution? &nbsp;I had a similar issue today and managed to solve it. &nbsp;I previously used AVG and uninstalled it today as I was hacked off at the constant upgrade nag screens and false positives it generates. &nbsp;I went back to using
 MS Security Essentials. &nbsp;I noticed a setting therein regarding folder access and turned it on. &nbsp;Later in the day I came across the issue of being unable to save to the desktop. &nbsp;Turning off this setting solved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that uninstalling Norton automatically turned that setting on. &nbsp;PIty no-one at Microsoft thought to suggest that.</p>

<p>YES!</p>
<p>I had the same problem of not being able to save files on the desktop, I did several tutorials, including creating a new user. When I just set up a new profile, I went to test it and was sure to save again in to desktop. Five minutes later, I could not save
 anymore. Very frustrating.&nbsp; The process is easy to complete.</p>
<p>The solution is in MS Security Essentials...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Update and Security</strong>, click in <strong>Windows Defender</strong> on left tab and then click in<strong> Open Windows Defender Security Center</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In new window, click in&nbsp;<strong>Protection from V</strong><strong>irus and Threats &gt;&nbsp;</strong><strong>V</strong><strong>irus and Threats Settings&nbsp;</strong>and
<p>

            Many thanks ! I'm just back from two years with Apple, and I'm very frustrated to find that since then, microsoft is still struggling with UX. To name just a few : screenshots with no easy access crop feature, multiple desktops that you can't reorder,
 big troubles with 4K screens, bing, headache to connect with smart tv&nbsp; and so on... I pray that I could be back to Apple. I also feel like the only skilled people here are the users, a word to the wise !

1. Which browser is installed on the computer?<br />
2. Were there any changes (hardware or software) made to the computer prior to the issue?
<div><br />
