<h2>            Restore computer to factory settings without a disc.</h2>
                    I have an acer aspire 7110 laptop computer. I would like to restore it to factory setting, by this I mean wipe it clean and start over. The problem is it was preinstalled with all the software and i do not have a disc. Is there a way to reset it and start
 from scratch?

<p><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Contact your Computer Manufacturer for the EXACT advice on how to put it back to Factory Settings.<br />
Read the Guide below:</span></p>
<br />
<br />
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer</span></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.acer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.acer.com/</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process. Acer is normally Alt +F10..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.<br />
</span><span><br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You can also make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Driver failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with your System maker as they all have slightly different methods. They may have included a Recovery<br />
Partition or other methods to restore to default. Also your System maker will sell&nbsp;you the physical disks cheaply<br />
since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
What are the system recovery options in Windows Vista?<br />

<br />
Check with your System Maker's Support&nbsp;as they may have included Recovery Partitions, Vista DVD's, and/or
<br />
other methods to return to original setup.<br />
<br />

you know all the options you have.</strong><br />

 in correct network security key from router into printer to set up wireless internet the printer said it was wrong. It was not wrong. Can't figure this out.

            Hi bonnedomer... make sure you are on the same wifi as your printer.
<br />So for example at my house I have 2 x wifi... one is wifi_5g and the other wifi_2g.
<br />Printer is on wifi_2g... so that means my machine has to be on that wifi as well.
<br />See link below for wifi settings on your brother printer.

<p>Which operating system is installed on your computer?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check if the keyboard works on another computer and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<span>If the issue still persists you may contact the keyboard manufacturer for further assistance.</span>

            I'm not with the computer currently.&nbsp; I left it at work since I was going to let a trainee use to help facilitate some classes he has to take online and this is the first time I've ever gone to settings to add someone.&nbsp; I went to settings and followed
 the links to add a non family member with no Microsoft account which was no problem.&nbsp; But when I went to sign myself out and sign in as him, I would click on his name then click on the sign in box and it would work for a second then say "signing out" and then
 just go back to the start screen without ever giving me any apps, icons or even a task bar to be able to do anything.

    <title>Unable to boot Stuck at blue circles - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to boot Stuck at blue circles</h2>
                    <p>Hi, family. I had the upgrade icon on my task bar until windows 10 came out 8/29. &nbsp;From that date forward every time I booted I would get the nag screen to update to 10. &nbsp;I finally gave in and ok'd&nbsp;the update and the download started, but the connection
 to my server ( Windstream ) kept dropping the connection. I wound up leaving the computer on for two days before getting the notification to install 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instructions until the computer said that 10 had been installed. I began to check out the new operating system to see what I wanted to use and everything seemed to be alright. I shut&nbsp;it down at the end of the day and was pleased to find that
 it shut down so much quicker than 7 and didn't hang up shutting down the task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next day, it booted ok and shut down ok. But when I turned it on the next day it started to boot and got to the windows 10 start screen and the little circle of beads just kept going around but 10 never launched. I left the computer on for 12 hours and it
 never started windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all boot options I had at my disposal. Nothing got me past that windows start screen with the little balls going in a circle like something was in process but nada..... nothing happened. I was ready to admit defeat and reinstall windows 7 sp1
 but couldn't get &nbsp;windows to boot from the HP disc. I have been without my laptop since the 2nd of Sept. and all my records and business&nbsp;docs are on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone in this community help me out? Please ?</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth on computer will not find my bluetooth phone </h2>
                    I am trying to add my phone to my bluetooth devices on my computer. I have tried going to Control Panel, Hardware and Devices, Bluetooth, and then Add a Device and another window comes open like it is trying to find my phone but it never does. The bluetooth
 on my phone is turned on and is visible. I've also tried looking for Bluetooth Services and cannot find it. Also, when I click on Bluetooth Settings on my computer, it does nothing...it is unresponsive. Thanks for your help. My OS is Windows Vista.

<p><span>Hi BeKahE,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Do you have any security software installed on the computer?</span></li><li><span>Do you any software provided by the phone manufacturer to be installed for Bluetooth?</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If youâre using Bluetooth software from a manufacturer other than Microsoft,<span>Windows</span> might
 not be able to detect your Bluetooth device and let you add it to your computer. To check if your Bluetooth software came from Microsoft, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open Control Panel by clicking
 the </span></span><span><span>Start</span></span><span><span> button, and then clicking&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Control
 Panel</span></span><span><strong><span>.</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the Control Panel search box,
 type bluetooth, and click on <span><span>Change&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Bluetooth</span></span><span><span>settings</span></span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In the&nbsp;<span><span>Bluetooth
 Settings</span></span> dialog box, click the&nbsp;<span><span>Hardware</span></span> tab and look for&nbsp;<span><span>Microsoft Bluetooth&nbsp;
</span></span><span><span>Enumerator</span></span>. If you don't see this, then your Bluetooth software didn't come from Microsoft.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try to temporarily disable security software from the computer and try to connect your Bluetooth Phone and check if it works. If the Bluetooth
 is detected and if it works, you may contact the security software Manufacturer and check if you need to change any settings. Later re-enable the security software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step3</span></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, you may access the link below and follow the steps to troubleshoot connection Bluetooth devices on your computer.</span></p>

<h2>            Game Compatability - Sim City 4 Deluxe</h2>
                    &nbsp;Has anyone tried to play Sim Cities 4 Deluxe edition? My game used to play in Windows 7 64bit with no problem. In Windows 10 it will not play. I tried uninstalling it But now it will not install! I know its an old game , but it was fun to play. I tried
 running it in compatibility mode But none of the settings worked. That's when I decided to uninstall it. But like I said It will not install now. Its the same for Sim Cities Societies as well. But Sims 3 plays ok so far.

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What happens when you try to play game? Do you receive any error message?</span></p>

</p><p><span>As I see from the Windows compatibility center the game SimCity 4 deluxe is compatible with windows 10, so it should work with no issues.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue might occur if the third party software conflict I suggest you to perform clean boot and check if it helps:<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You may boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the issue persists. When you start Microsoft Windows, typically there are several programs that start automatically and
 run in the background that may interfere with the system. These programs may include antivirus and system utility programs. When you perform a clean startup procedure, you prevent these programs from starting automatically.</span></p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This issue has nothing to do with Xbox. The sim cities 4 deluxe game is for Windows XP SP3. Which I had working in Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit. I completely uninstalled the game from Windows 10 Pro 64bit . Then I re-installed it, But it will not run.
 When the disc is inserted the drive reads the disc and you must click on the game icon for the game to start. But nothing happens. As I said I tried this in compatibility mode for all configurations available and I still get nothing.&nbsp;

<div>I might be wrong, but not as far as I know. They are different</div>

    <title>Windows 10 driver disconnected while associating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ratfingers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 driver disconnected while associating</h2>
                    My wi-fi won't connect and I've tried just about every solution I could find. In my latest wlan report, the top two reasons for disconnecting are "this specific network is not available" (count 106) and "the driver disconnected while associating" (count
 102). I've tried resetting my wireless network driver, uninstalling it manually and letting Windows automatically reinstall it, restarting in general, resetting the modem, and fiddling around in various other settings I don't fully understand. I don't know
 how to interpret the results of the wlan report fully either, and I've tried using all the official Windows guides online that I can find. As far as I can tell, nothing is wrong (and it's not the wi-fi itself). Help?

    <title>open backup file from a different computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamessmartin  say:</h3>
<h2>            open backup file from a different computer</h2>
                    <p>I had problems with my PC using windows 10 so made a backup on an external hard disk.&nbsp; It starts with a WindowsImBackup file to a User-PC sub file with sub files Backup&nbsp;(with date and number),&nbsp;Catalog, Logs, SPPMetadataCache, and Medial.&nbsp; Catalog has two
 named catalog&nbsp;files and Cache has one ed* file but both request with which file I want to open them with.&nbsp; Logs has an error file&nbsp;which does open in Notepad but appears to have nothing.</p>
<p>Backup has three Hard Disk Image Files and a number of .XML files all using a coded file name except for one XML named BackupSpecs.&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe my working files are located in these XML files but&nbsp;my attempts to open them are denied.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The problem I had forced me to reinstall my operating system and all of my programs.&nbsp; As consequence I am denied restoring from my backup.&nbsp; As there are a number of important files I would like to recover how can I open my backup from a different computer
 so I can recover these files?</p>

            Thank you Vanessa Oca for your attempt to answer my question but it does not address&nbsp;my problem.&nbsp; The information provided by Kiran Kishore&nbsp;explains how to make a restore point and how to&nbsp;create an image.&nbsp; I had previously created that image but now cannot
 open it because my computer configuration has changed, meaning it no longer has the "keys" to&nbsp;open&nbsp;them and the files refuse to give me permission to open them manually.&nbsp; What I am looking for is a manner to circumvent these blocking keys so I will be able
 to manually open the files and selectively recover them.

            No Vanessa.&nbsp; I am referring to the apparent verification "keys", or perhaps better stated to be codes, which were created when the backup&nbsp;image was created to insure&nbsp;only the originating PC would be permitted to use the files&nbsp;in a&nbsp;recovery.&nbsp; This system
 correctly prevents creating an image file from being installed on a different computer but I do not know how to open these .XML files to see the text contained so that&nbsp;part can be recovered, either by a "copy and paste" method or some other manner.&nbsp; Thank
 you for your assistance.

<p>Thank you for your attempts Vanessa but I RE-tried what you are suggesting.&nbsp; While it is physically the same computer a corruption (which had escaped my antivirus) blocked my&nbsp;access so I was forced to use the restart + shift (if I remember correctly) method
 but was unaware would completely wipe out my entire hard disk.&nbsp; So as far as the image control is concerned the restore request is denied since it understands it is not coming from the same computer.&nbsp; The complete system reinstallation means I do not have
 any missing or corrupted system files but before I was unable to get to your system file checker tool.</p>
<p>I mentioned the file types since I know they can be opened if knowing what the codes used are.&nbsp; But I have no way to determine them.</p>

            Thanks for the efforts but my problem has not been resolved since the system does not consider my computer to be the same as the one with which I created the image.&nbsp; As Vanessa stated the Restore command will only work with the same computer which created
 it, a link which was lost when I had to reinstall Windows.&nbsp; This action also removed any possibility to use a system file checker tool for missing or corrupted system files.&nbsp; If there is no way I can recover these codes which are needed for me to have my backup
 recognize my computer as the same I have no solution but to consider these files as lost and to try and recreate them from memory, which I have started for the critical ones.

<h2>            802.1x Authentication issues for Wired Connection. Authentication Tab missing.</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I have a Dell Inspiron 15R with Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>My <strong>LAN adapter is a Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller. </strong>Now I needed 802.1x Authentication for setting up a new wired connection. For that I know that am first required to start the dot3svc service. Now I have
<strong>started the Wired AutoConfig service</strong> and put it on Automatic start, is shows that is running in Task Manager but my LAN properties
<strong>still </strong><strong>does not show the Authentication tab</strong>. I have tried shutting down the service in question and restarting it again and have also uninstalled and re-installed the driver but still the outcome is the same.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone with any idea about the same please help me with this. Urgently needed! Much appreciated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>

            <p>Hello Kvothe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you check the status of WLAN autoConfig service?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
It is possible that <strong>WLAN autoConfig service </strong>is either not started or not set to automatic.</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check in services if the <strong>service is started and set to automatic</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To open "Services" window, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Click Start, type services.msc in Start search box and press Enter. The "Services" window will open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. Double-click on the WLAN AutoConfig service. </p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click on âStartâ to start the service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>d. Click the "General" tab. Verify that the service is not disabled in the "Startup Type" box. If it is, select "Automatic".</p>
<p>
</p><p>e. Click apply and ok.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
It is possible that <strong>WLAN autoConfig service </strong>is either not started or not set to automatic.</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check in services if the <strong>service is started and set to automatic</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To open "Services" window, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Click Start, type services.msc in Start search box and press Enter. The "Services" window will open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. Double-click on the WLAN AutoConfig service. </p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click on âStartâ to start the service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>d. Click the "General" tab. Verify that the service is not disabled in the "Startup Type" box. If it is, select "Automatic".</p>
<p>
</p><p>e. Click apply and ok.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated on the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, antivirus software installed on the computer may cause this issue. I would suggest you to
<strong>disable antivirus software</strong> and check if it helps.<br />

<p>

<p>
</p><p>Note: : Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as
 soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>

<h2>            Youtube Overscan Issue on Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Ok looked around on the forum and could not find an answer that would work with what I have. So Youtube videos badly overscan on my system, This is the ONLY thing that overscans on my system. Is there a solution that does not involve me having to change
 my TV settings? And if this is the only solutions &nbsp;why do I have to change my settings for one app? I wish I would quit running into to these nagging little issue with the Xbox One, it just keeps me from being able to enjoy the system. Everything is 16:9 and
 1080P all HDMI, If there is not solution please let me know also. Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Analisa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Missing function and options on the system are usually caused by broken system components. For us to provide an accurate solution, we would need you to answer the following questions:

</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest running <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12373/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update</a></strong> and then install the available updates for your device. Restart your computer
 and then check if the same issue persists. </p>

    <title>Cannot rotate page from landscape to portrait in Paint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adriande angelis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot rotate page from landscape to portrait in Paint</h2>
                    <p>From my last update of Windows 10 this common feature stop working.</p>
<p>By default Paint starts with a landscape setting and when I try to change it the program stops working. The first time it "recuperates" the document, the second attempt it closes the application.</p>
<p>I have not downloaded fonts neither new programs. This problem started soon after the las update of Windows 10.</p>
<p>I use Paint a lot for basic formatting of graphics in my work.</p>
<p>Is there any setting in the register or somewhere else that needs reconfiguration?</p>
<p>Thank you for your help or suggestions</p>

            Hi Adrian.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See the troubleshooting steps here for auto-rotation to make sure everything is in order:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-fix-screen-rotation-problems-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-fix-screen-r...</a>
<br />
<br />If there is no newer driver then I'd uninstall the present motion sensor driver and reinstall it.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update all of your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps what I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows 10 black screen - again&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aargos  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 black screen - again&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Recently got the black screen of death on my win 8.1 machine. After trying
<strong>many</strong> reinstalls and not being able to get around it (I posted here 2 yrs ago with same issue but found a way around it then). That way did not work this time so I decided to go Win10. I installed a clean install of Win 8.1 &amp; then ran the Win10
 upgrade via the DL from MS site. This is a PC I built 2 years ago:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my components:</p>
<p>Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-F2A88XM-HD3 with latest&nbsp;BIOS</p>
<p>CPU: AMD A10-7850k, utilizing the onchip Radeon R7 graphics (no discrete video card installed)</p>
<p>OS: Win 10 64bit</p>
<p>Nothing connected to PC other than what is required to minimize any potential driver conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screen went black at the end of the upgrade. I had a strong suspicion of what it was so I rebooted into safe mode and disabled the video adapter. Rebooted normally and ran windows update. I updated the LAN and audio drivers to latest from Gigabyte
 site. Computer works as long as I don't try to upgrade/enable the video driver. If I do, the screen goes dark, my monitor goes into sleep mode and I cannot get any image back. I downloaded the latest drivers for video and MB but as soon as the installer tries
 to enable the video adapter the result is the same, black screen with no cursor. My only option is to boot into safe mode and disable the video adapter, then I can boot into Win10 normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried updating the video drivers via Device Manager in safe mode (the way I got it working in Win8.1 2 yrs ago) and also in normal mode. Result same, seconds after it starts screen goes dark (I'm guessing the installer enables the video adapter
 early on).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. I tried for days to get it working in 8.1 first but after so many failed attempts I gave up and decided to try Win10.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Got it working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides doing countless reinstalls and scouring the internet for info on how to get around it (and nothing working for me) I thought maybe the video signal was somehow changed to another port. I've been using the DVI port so I thought to try an HDMI cable
 and if that didn't work, the ancient VGA connector. I really had no idea what else to try. Here is what fixed it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disconnected the DVI cable from my monitor and reconnected it. Bang it worked. I kid you not, that was all I did. Nothing else. I wonder if this would have worked for Win8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I rebooted normally with my video adapter enabled I was able to install all of the latest drivers not yet installed and so far it all works as it should.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I 'only' spent 60-70 hours over the last week + trying to get around this issue, first in 8.1 &amp; then 10. All I wanna say at this point is: Microsoft, really ? REALLY ? &nbsp; R E A L L Y &nbsp;???????&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Connecting to public wi-fi hotspots - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim morey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting to public wi-fi hotspots</h2>
                    <p>All of a sudden I am having problems connecting to public wi-fi hotspots.</p>
<p>I am running Internet Explorer 9 in Windows 7 on a tablet PC with a Gobi Sierra 2000 wireless module.
</p>
<p>What usually happens is this: I check for available wireless networks - e.g. my local public<span>&nbsp;</span>transport&nbsp;(transit) provider which has wi-fi on its vehicles - and click âconnectâ. I then get the balloon telling me that âadditional logon information
 may be requiredâ. Then I click on the balloon and an Internet Explorer window opens.</p>
<p>What should happen is that this goes to a 'welcome' page whereby<span>&nbsp; </span>
I am asked to read and agree to the companyâs internet usage terms and conditions. Once this is done, I can use the internet, download email, etc.</p>
<p>Since last Thursday, this last part hasnât happened. Instead of the welcome page, I have been getting he following message in Internet Explorer:</p>
<p>âBrowser error! Your browser does not support redirectsâ</p>
<p>Without the opportunity to agreee tot he terms and conditions, I never get a proper connection that I can use.</p>
<p>However, when I do the same thing on my workplace wi-fi, Explorer goes straight to the 'login' page with no problems. The difference between the workplace wi-fi and the&nbsp;public wi-fi is that to use the work system I need to input a username and password rather
 than just tick a box.</p>
<p>Thinking that it was a browser issue, I uninstalled IE9 and am now using Explorer 8 â with exactly the same problem.</p>
<p>I was able to log on during my commute to work on Thursday morning, but by Thursday evening I was unable to use the public wi-fi on the way home. That very&nbsp;morning, I downloaded and installed the most recent Windows updates. Could these be part of the problem?</p>

<p><span>Does it only happen at this one wi-fi spot or multiple places?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to provide us with the KB number of the updates that were installed on your computer.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a system restore to a point before the issue occurred.</span>

</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Further,</span></p>
<p><span>If, the issue happens at this one wi-fi spot then the administrators might have changed something in their environment.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Laura,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are getting error message&nbsp;after installing Pacesetter BES Embroidery Software. I would suggest you to first check the compatibility of the software with Windows 8 operating system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly refer to: <strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=Windows%208.1&amp;Locale=en-in&amp;Architecture=X64&amp;TextSearch=Pacesetter%2BBES%2BEmbroidery%2BSoftware&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows
 Compatibility Center</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also try the following two steps and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the common reason is<strong> lack of administration rights</strong><span>. If you are logged in as Standard user, the installation&nbsp;may give you&nbsp;errors. So make sure youâre logged in as a Local Administrator. When I mean Local administrator,&nbsp;I
 mean that to say that&nbsp;you need to login as</span><strong> Local administrator â&nbsp;not Domain administrator</strong><span>. Because even if you are a Domain administrator, sometimes Domain policies will restrict access to certain locations.
<span>For instance, if you are installing Microsoft SQL Server, itâs highly recommend that you ensure that you are logged into the machine as Local administrator, otherwise you might get a lot
 of error message including </span></span><em><span>Microsoft SQL Service Fails to start</span></em><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The other most common reason is <strong>User Account Control</strong>. Sometimes UAC&nbsp;will restrict you from&nbsp;accessing certain file locations or&nbsp;registry locations. The best practice is to always right-click on the setup and click on âRun as administratorâ.
 By doing so, setup will elevate with full administrator rights. In some cases however,&nbsp;we may need to disable UAC temporarily, until you finish the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do so, go to Start under search type in âUACâ.</p>
<p>Click on â<strong>Change User Account Control settings</strong>â.</p>
<p>Make sure you drag the bar all the way to â<strong>Never Notify</strong>â then click OK and reboot the system and try to install it again. Do remember to change back the UAC settings, after you have completed the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, I would request you to contact the software developer and check.
</p>
<p>

</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

</p><p>I solved it but it is clumsy but normal when working with Windows. One must generate an App Specific password for the iCloud account. Look here&nbsp;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397 then us it in lieu of the normal iCloud password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That works!</p>

<h2>            Installation of italian language pack fail</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a problem with Italian language pack on Windows 8. When I try to install language pack from the control panel it says: "The following update are not installed: Language pack..."</p>
<p>I try everything but it doesn't work. I want to try to install manually by downloading lg.cab file with Italian language pack and install them with the command "LPKSetup.exe".</p>
<p>It's this possible to do?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that you are unable to install Italian language Pack in Windows 8 computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What is the complete error message you get when you try to install?</span></p>
<p><span>Have you installed Windows 8 in dual boot setup?</span><span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span>What troubleshooting steps have you followed till now?</span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Are you facing issues while installing other language pack?</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<span>If you have downloaded the lp.cab language pack file on your computer, Windows 8 does not give any straight forward option to select the source language pack file to be installed.</span></p>
<span>There are two more ways to manually install a language pack in Windows 8 (only if you have downloaded the language pack in your computer).</span></span>
<p><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span>Method 1: Using lpksetup command</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go to Run â&gt; lpksetup</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>You will be taken to a window which will let you add the language pack of your choice.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>You will be required to restart the computer once the language pack is installed completely.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>You may change your display language through Control Panel languages option.</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Method 2: Using dism command</p>
</span><span><br />
</span>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open command prompt with administrative privileges.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Issue the following command <br />
<strong><span>dism /online /add-package /packagepath:C:\downloads\Win8lang\ar-sa\lp.cab
</span></strong><b><br />
</b>you will need to change the path with the path of the cab file in your local computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer when the command has been successfully completed.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Change the display language from the Control Panel.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This will help the users who are trying to install Windows 8 language packs manually.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 7 Pro x64 Freezes after RAM Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paulleming  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Pro x64 Freezes after RAM Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Pavilion a6010e desktop running an AMD 64 X2 5600+ CPU (dual core 2.9GHz) on an ASUS<span style="font-weight: bold">
</span>M2N68-LA (Narra) motherboard and I'm running Windows 7 Pro 64 bit. </p>
<p>According to the documentation for the motherboard and the CPU the system can support 8GB of DDR2 PC2-6400 RAM, and of course Windows 7 Pro 64 bit supports 8GB of RAM.
</p>
<p><br />
Now the problem is that after the upgrade to the 8GB of RAM Windows will load but after about one minute the system freezes, totally locks up and I have to restart the system. I looked in the system BIOS and it shows that it recognizes the RAM on board. Even
 more odd is that if I start Windows in Safe Mode it runs just fine and shows that there is 8GB of physical RAM. I have taken the PC into my local shop and had a full hardware diagnostic performed and they found no errors, and said they can find no reason why
 Windows won't run. </p>
<p><br />
If I remove 4GB of RAM and only keep two of the 2GB sticks on board then windows loads and runs perfectly.
<br />
Does anyone have a suggestion on what to do to fix this problem? All hardware specs say that I should have no problem with running this 8GB of RAM, but Windows won't have it.
</p>
<p>Suggestions or resources are appreciated and if anyone else has had this problem and resolved it, please share your secret, I'm about at my wits end here.
</p>
<p>Thank you in advance. <br />

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
Since it is working fine in safe mode, I would suggest you to try performing clean boot and check if it helps:<br />

<p><span>NOTE: After you have finished troubleshooting, make sure you reset the computer to normal startup mode as suggested
 in step7 from the above KB article.</span></p>
<p><span>Check if this helps.</span></p>
