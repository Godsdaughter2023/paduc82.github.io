<h2>            Latency is 157 ms on xbox one decreasing my online playability. Need help.</h2>
                    <p>I did a network test and it showed that my xbox one was giving me 157 ms latency. I did a speed test on my pc and it shows 25 ms. I have a wireless connection but my router is downstairs. Battlefield 1 and FIFA 17 are the worst culprits online as gameplay would pause for 3&nbsp;seconds and then drastically speed up for 3 seconds and then back to normal.&nbsp;Would an extended wired ethernet cable&nbsp;connection improve my latency?</p>

<p>I receive this same error related to the start of "Home". The only way to get my Xbox to boot all the way to the home screen is to do a hard restart each time I want to play. The error only started a couple of days ago. I have not downloaded any new apps,
 games, etc. for a long time and I never use the Xbox to browse the internet. I guess what I'm saying is that this issue just seemed to manifest without any changes to the system on my part. I've searched this error code to no avail... only get results relating
 to a game or app. I really don't want to do a factory reset because of the time it will take to reconfigure and reinstall everything. I'm curious to know when the next update will be and whether or not it will resolve this issue. Until then, I just plan to
 do a hard restart every time I want to play, which is only 1-2 times a week anyway.</p>

    <title>Browers not loading web pages connection but email works - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Browers not loading web pages connection but email works</h2>
                    All three of my WEB browsers are having connection problems. I started out okay using FireFox v.18, then pages refuse to load and I received the message that the connection was reset. (I'm connected directly to a satellite modem, no other computers involved.)
 Interestingly, I DO have Internet connection because my Outlook email still functions fine, and I can see pinging and connectivity on the modem. I opened my alternative browsers, GoogleChrome and IE 9, and neither will load the homepage. When I reboot - things
 work again for a while. I've emptied my FF cache, don't know what else to do. Any ideas would be very appreciated as I am at least 100 miles from a computer consultant and this old lady is stumped. I have Windows 7 Professional.<br />
Thanks...<br />

            <p><span>Hi Canyon,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>As per the description, none of the browsers are able to connect to internet,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Does it happen with any particular webpage or with all the web pages?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the error message/code you get?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try the methods to find the cause of the issue in the computer:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Ping a website</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type <b>Windows key + R</b> on the keyboard,</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type "<b>cmd</b>" in the box and click "OK" ,</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type "<b>ping</b>" in the
<b>Command Window,</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type the website address that you want to ping, after the space. For example, if you want to ping
<b>MSN</b>, type "<b>www.MSN.com</b>" after the space.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Hit "<b>Enter</b>." If the website is up and actively responding, you receive four to five replies back from the Server that you pinged.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><b><span> </span></b><b><span>Temporarily disable security software and firewall settings and check if the Internet Connection drops.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b>Disable antivirus software</b></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Start your computer in safe mode with networking to see if there are any conflicting applications/programs in the computer:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for your response, Sandeep. I already tried working without the Firewall, and F-Secure. No difference. Here is the latest:
<br />
<br />
<b>YESTERDAY</b>, when I turn on my computeter, web browsing works for a few pages then not.. I'd get a message "Connection was reset." When I went to troubleshoot it, I am told "Your computer appears to be correctly configured, but the device or resource (DNS
 server) is not responding." Troubleshooting was unable to automatically fix all of the issues found."<br />
<br />
Remember, I am connected directly to my satellite modem and I can watch the pinging and activity for email service (working), updates downloading (working). So I am left with believing that at some point, my entering a new domain (www.****) is not getting
 resolved. <br />
<br />
<u><b>This morning,</b></u> I shut everything down (computer off), including unplugging the modem cable to my computer again. Turning off power to the satellite modem, again, and then turn it back on, reconnected the cable to the laptop and turned the laptop
 on. So far, I am able to surf the web going to many sites without the intermittent disconnect. Don't know if this will last.
<br />
<br />
If anyone has any idea why what I have done might have remedied my issue (we'll see...) please tell me! Thank you SO much.<br />

            Back again, folks, this time in Safe Mode, as my normal mode browsing is not working again. Sometimes I can get to a site, but in normal mode, I could not get the reply selection to work. I sailed along for more than an hour today with no intermittent
 disconnect of my browser. After leaving the computer for a few hours, I returned to test it out and found that the old problem of failing to load pages has returned. I get the message that the connection was reset while loading the page. I am back to square
 one on this frustrating problem. I can't see myself going through the process of shutting down my satellite modem, disconnection my laptop and shutting it down, and then bringing everything back on again every time I want to browse the internet! Any ideas,
 PLEEEEZ?<br />
Thanks<br />
Canyonkat<br />

Also, this in this mode, things load sooooooo slooooow.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Here are some things to test:</p>
<p>Open a command prompt and run as administrator</p>
<p>Does the computer get an IP address - ipconfig</p>
<p>If so, can you ping your router/modem (if you know the IP) - ping x.x.x.x</p>
<p>Ping an external IP address like Google DNS - ping 8.8.8.8</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it appears that the network works (you are successful with the above commands)&nbsp;but your browsers can't get to the internet then run this command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>netsh int ip reset c:\resetlog.txt </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then reboot your computer.</p>

            <p>Hello Merle,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be able to assist you better, let us know if you are referring to external drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hard disks, which are the primary storage devices on your computer, need to be formatted before you can use them. Formatting a disk means configuring the disk with a file system so that Windows can store information on the disk.</p>
<p>Other types of storage devices, including many USB flash drives and flash memory cards, might come preformatted by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're installing an external hard disk that is connected by a USB cable, Windows should recognize the hard disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Write to us for further information.</p>

<p>Simply I do not like the new Skype interface and I need to download the old classic Skype
</p>
<p>This problem came just in the last 24 hour as Microsoft has updated the system without advising the users with the change or giving the user the option to select which one is suitable for them

<h2>            Xbox enforcement could be a bit more professional</h2>
                    If you are going to ban me for no reason, when i have done nothing then atleast do it properly. I have been through hell this week. Couldnt sleep or concentrate at work. My account, my 1000s spent on digital content and all my time levelling up in games,
 all taken from me by "xblet?" What does that even mean? Some sort of street tag? In any other company they communicate to you like a human being. They sign the document with a priper name and give their position. I work hard and barely make any money. Come
 home to an empty flat and my one pleasure in life was gaming. And you are going to place it all in the hands of kids? Well thank you so much. I have had people treat me like total crap my whole life i am used to it, but nothing like this. This is an unprovoked
 and uncalled for attack on another human being. This is abuse, makin someone wish they were dead. All i had was gaming.

<p>It wouldn't happen to me as i'm not silly enough to break the rules.</p>
<p>When you are banned you forfeit all digital purchases,remaining live time etc. which you agreed to when you started your account.</p>
<p>Sorry but only one person is to blame for you getting banned.</p>
<p>You can still play your disc games by starting a new account.</p>

<p>Im sorry but i have shown the emails and the reasons behind my suspension to Several UK bodies. &nbsp;Each one of them has said that the suspension was unwarranted. In line with ms terms of service and UK consumer laws. &nbsp;So yeah, i was banned when i did nothing
 wrong. &nbsp;I realise you are a fan of microsoft and xbox but that does not make it ok. &nbsp;I do not wish to argue with you since you seem like a nice person.</p>

<p>I;m not biased towards any company but whoever you showed these emails to do not know what they are talking about.</p>
<p>I do think the rules about refunds should be made clearer then confusion like yours would be avoided.</p>
<p>Yes,certain consumer laws are a bit different here in the U.K. but you still have to abide by the ToU/CoC you agreed to when joining xbox live &amp; you didn't which is why you were banned.</p>
<p>You can persue other roads with this if you wish but you wont get anywhere,.</p>
<p>As this is going around in circles there's nothing to add so i'm done with this thread.</p>

                    I recently had to buy a new PC, but my HP Deskjet f2200 series printer won't work for Windows 7. It says it is only compatible with Windows 2000, XP, and Vista. I think I have to download a driver, but which one. Also, how do I go about doing this? Can
 someone please help me? Thanks.

                    I've just lost an email that I've been working on for several hours. I accidentally came out of windows live mail. No alert message came up asking me if I wanted to save. I did not delete or save to drafts. I've checked deleted/spam/junk/sent folders without
 success. is there anything I can do? I'm using windows live mail and windows 7

My problem is not that the microphone is muted (as Scruffy_nick reported), my problem is that incoming sound is not audible.&nbsp; I have un-installed and re-installed Skype, but have not yet been able to test the fix&nbsp; (due to no person available on the other end

            The problem doesn't begin until after the call has been connected for a couple minutes, so, No, I can't test it from within the program because the sound test only lasts a few seconds.

<p>Hi Mark,&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you look back in this thread you'll see that I've already been asked that and provided that information.&nbsp; I've also uninstalled that version of Skype and downloaded and installed a newer version based on the instructions given me in the original thread.&nbsp;
 At this point, I'm simply awaiting an opportunity to test the new version.&nbsp; The only question you asked that I haven't answered is that I always initiate the Skype call when the sound fails after a little while on the call.&nbsp; I'll write back when I am sure
 the issue is resolved.&nbsp; Thank you for your checkin</p>

            Internet Hearts is not available in Windows 7 as it was in Windows XP. <br />
You might try and copy the .exe over from Windows XP and install into a different dirctory other than Windows/System32 and see if it will work.
<br />
<br />
I will have to test that as I have not tried it yet.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's too bad that MS won't make this available for WIndows 7 because a lot of people enjoyed playing it.</p>

I just upgraded to Windows 7 from XP - I played Internet Hearts everyday, since I am house bound with a broken neck. &nbsp;I will be returning the new computer - I will keep my slower less efficient Windows XP and will continue to enjoy internet hearts. &nbsp;Frankly
 I should have just upgraded to a MAC. &nbsp;At least that way, if I can't have Internet Hearts - Gates and company won't get any more of my money. &nbsp;SHAME on you Microsoft for not listening to your customer base. &nbsp;Did the concept of "User Experience" totally escape
 you and the marketing dept.? &nbsp;I just can't understand why - and by the way the MS game site leaves a lot to be desired.

            You can still play in MSN gamezone just not within the OS but via an Internet browser.
<div><br />
<div>Does MACs have Internet Hearts I don't think so you still would have to download it from the MAC store and it is free but its not hard to play a game in a browser.</div>

            The MSN Hearts is a total bust.&nbsp; I can never find anyone to play with there.&nbsp; XP Internet Hearts where you played with LIVE people was the absolute best.&nbsp;&nbsp; Providing us with a boring computer version is hardly filling a need.

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><i><font><font color="#000000"><font>Did you find this against “pen and Touch” in System info/properties?</font></font></font></i></p>
<p><i><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></i></p>

<p><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Touchscreens support a feature called multi-touch, the ability to recognize the presence of more two or more points of contact with the touchscreen surface. For example, you can use two fingers at the same time to perform
 a specific tasks like pinch/stretch. Some touchscreens allow two touch points whereas others allow multiple touch points.
</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>The surface RT has a multi-touch screen, which can recognize multiple touch points. So this might be displayed as “Full touch support” whereas your laptop might be displayed as “Limited touch support with two/three touch
 points”. If you can provide me your laptop make and model, I can check this out and get back to you.</font></font></font></p>

<p>If your computer came with Windows 7 pre-installed by the computer's manufacturer, your product key is on the COA sticker.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On laptops, the COA is on the bottom or sometimes inside the battery compartment.</p>

</p><p>On desktop/towers, the COA is usually on the side, but could be on the top of back of the case.</p>

<p>
</p><p>For retail copies of Windows 7 (and perhaps for "OEM System Builder" versions as well), you can view the product key of a working Windows 7 system using a utility such as Nirsoft's ProduKey (<a href="http://nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://nirsoft.net/utils/product_cd_key_viewer.html</a>)
 or BelArc Advisor (<a href="https://www.belarc.com/products_belarc_advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.belarc.com/products_belarc_advisor</a>).&nbsp; These utilities will
<strong>NOT </strong>work for systems where Windows was pre-installed.</p>

                    My Epson Workforce 630 wireless printer suddenly is not working from one Compaq laptop in the office while it continues to work with the other Compaq. &nbsp;I've tried reinstalling the software AND reestablishing the LAN both to no avail. Troubleshooting tells
 me the printer is not set as default and asks if I would like it to do so. &nbsp;I say yes and it tells me the printer is not turned on and it cannot perform the function. &nbsp;The printer IS turned on. &nbsp;Anyone have any thoughts, ideas or constructive suggestions?
 &nbsp;Thanks for any help offered.

<h2>            Faulty controller replacement under warranty</h2>
                    <p>So, my controller has packed up 4 months after buying it, well i say packed up, the left analogue stick seems to have become unseated and it i press the stick in and rotate it, it seems to catch and crunch on something inside the pad.&nbsp;<br /><br />So, i contact customer support via web chat, 1 hour later after proving proof of purchase etc,&nbsp;i get told i have to send the pad to Germany at my own cost, then upto 14 days later i will receive a replacement! &nbsp;****!<br /><br />This is the worst customer support i have EVER come accross, send back your faulty pad at my own cost! I think not, today i move to playstation 4!<br /><br />What i expect is a new one sent out to me, bearing in mind&nbsp;over&nbsp;10 years and 1000 of pounds iv spent with xbox, then i send the bust one back at YOUR&nbsp;cost because its failed in YOUR&nbsp;warranty period.&nbsp;</p>

 </blockquote> <p>The warranty on controllers, at least here in the U.S. is 90 days. You stated, "So, my controller has packed up 4 months after buying it...", so it would appear they were being nice just making you pay a one way shipping charge.</p><p><br /></p><p>You also stated, "I think not, today i move to playstation 4!". They also have a 90 warranty on controllers.

 </blockquote> <p>I agree with this too. under NZ and Australian Law, companies must pay shipping for faulty warranty items. microsoft has offices in these countries and just like visitors into other countries everyone falls under those countries jurisdictions. microsoft is no exception. their terms of use do not override Law.

 </blockquote> <p>It would appear you have better consumer rights. Here in the U.S. there is usually a 15 day return policy on computers, tablets, video game consoles, etc.; after the 15 days you deal with the manufacturer. Wasn't always the case, but I would imagine it's because of some of the consumers (Idiots.) of my country. Lol. A few years ago I was waiting in the line to return something. The lady in front of me was "trying" to return a child's bicycle that obviously was run over by a car; by the damage...possibly a bulldozer. Watching this lady flip out, screaming that she, "Bought it this WAY!", and just generally being a obnoxious twit, both saddened and amused me. I could never work in retail. Lol.    <br /></p>

            To function properly, your Walkman player must be recognized by the computer as a Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) device. If the portable player was connected to the computer and recognized as a Mass Storage Class (MSC) device it will not function properly. 
<br />
<br />In that case, an Article: How to confirm the portable player is recognized by the computer as a Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) ... will help you to correct this issue.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://us.en.kb.sony.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/30877" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://us.en.kb.sony.com/app/answers/detail/a_...</a>
<br />
<br /> For some models, when you use the portable player for the first time, if you have not used it for a long time, or the battery is depleted, it may take up to 5 minutes for it to be recognized or start charging. On models with a display, the display will remain blank. If it the portable player is not recognized or does not begin to charge after waiting 5 minutes, reset the player by pressing the reset button.
<br />
<br />If this is not the first time using your player and it was working properly at one time with no major changes performed (such as restoring the operating system or replacing a hard drive), follow the procedure below:
<br />
<br />Connect the portable player to the computer using the supplied USB cable.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If none of these options corrects the situation you can try a reset on your Walkman player. A soft reset procedure will close all open or running applications and services, and then restart the Walkman player. No data is erased and no applications are removed.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Locate the reset slot.
<br />
<br />Take a small paperclip, insert the paperclip into the slot and press gently. You will see the Walkman player restart.
<br />
<br />Once the Walkman player restarts, plug it back into the computer.
<br />
<br />Check the connection status again.
<br />
<br />If the Walkman player is still not recognized, restart the computer.
<br />
<br />Check the connection status again.
<br />
<br />Check that the USB cable is firmly connected to both the computer and the player.
<br />
<br />Check the connection status again.
<br />
<br />If the player is connected to a USB hub, disconnect it and connect it directly to the computer with a dedicated USB cable.
<br />
<br />Check the connection status again.
<br />
<br />If the player is still not recognized by the computer, disconnect all devices connected to the computer with a USB connection and restart the computer.
<br />
<br />After the computer restarts, connect only the Walkman player and test the connection again.
<br />
<br />If the player is still not recognized by the computer, try a different USB port.
<br />
<br />Check the connection status again.
<br />
<br />Under the Common settings menu of the player, format the player using the built-in Format utility.
<br />
<br />Check the connection status again.

</p><p>I have been repeatedly told that they could help, only to inevitably be told directly that Jamar would not help me unless I could furnish the Xbox ID for a device that I have not had in my possession since my ex-wife divorced me. Jamar referenced how it
 is Microsoft's duty to protect the customer, but what I see is that they are failing to investigate a valid escalation request by a customer because I do not currently own the console, despite being able to authenticate using credit card information, billing
 statements, billing addresses, and more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told to fill out the account recovery form using the Xbox Live email address that was valid at the time of use. This referenced address has apparently been deleted in the time since. I know it was the accurate email of the time of use and I have no
 ability to access the Account Recovery form that would be necessary to submit all of my verification data, including my ID with a valid billing address on the account tied to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work in account and database management, including supporting MS products. I know a SQL query can be ran on my account to verify all of the data I have submitted by someone somewhere with the Microsoft account team, as this issue extends far beyond the
 Xbox account alone with my billing data. It seems that support agents are unwilling to give assistance to this request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is this: Is there either A. a way to manually submit the Account Recovery form without having to login or point to a referenced email address (the normal login will not get me anywhere) or B. how can I get in contact with an escalated party to
 attempt to have this issue resolved. I wasted 4 hours today trying to resolve this issue with absolutely no progress. I have tons of information to give, but it seems no one would like to help me verify said information since I am not this Jared person who
 is now accessing my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there Guy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out here in forums. I'm sorry to hear about the issue with trying to recover a Microsoft account. Unfortunately, here in forums we do not have tool to help assist with Microsoft Account.&nbsp; In reference to your questions:</p>
<p>A. You can fill out an Account Recovery account. You will have to know the email that is associated with the Microsoft Account.&nbsp; Click Forgot Password and proceed. Once you get to the section, Where should we send the code? Choose: I don't have access and
 proceed with a valid email. </p>
<p>B.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that is not a valid option to contact the escalation party. You will have to go through the steps to create a case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the resources available for the issue:</p>

<p>Hi Rich,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that you need to reset the Notepad settings to get this sorted out or make changes in your Display settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before doing anything, just to clarify, is the grey text specific to notepad? Is it also showing on other applications? Do you recall any recent changes made on your Surface? Any recent applications installed? Which Surface do you own? Can you product a
 screenshot or sample images of the issue you're having?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>
