<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What’s the Skype version that you’re using? Can you still see your previous conversations and your profile photo?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is there something else missing aside from your contacts?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I look forward to your response.

<h2>            Windows Media Player won&#39;t sync with my MP3 Player</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've seen some similar questions, but no answers that work...I'm hoping somebody can help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm using a Phillips GoGear 2gb MP3 player that I've had for about a year, and the latest version of Windows Media Player. &nbsp;I also just installed whatever Windows Updates were availble. &nbsp;I'm using Windows Vista Home Premium SP 1. &nbsp;I have been able to play
 and sync with this MP3 player just fine until today. &nbsp;When I plug it in, the device will not show up in windows media player. &nbsp;It will play the music in it, but it won't recognize it to sync to it. &nbsp;The computer knows it's plugged in, but it just never shows
 up as a device in WMP. &nbsp;I searched Phillips for updates, but I already have the latest driver, so with the latest version of everything, I'm wondering if something in the updates caused the problems. &nbsp;Any suggestions?</div>
<div><br />

            Hi Zack,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
None of the Phillps suggestions are applicable, or I have tried them.&nbsp; There is nothing wrong with the USB ports or cable.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned, I already have the latest software for the MP3 player and Windows Media Player.<br />
<br />
Is there anything else short of doing a system restore point I can do?&nbsp; I know that's pretty much the default MS answer for everything, but I downloaded some music, and I don't want to lose it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks.

<p>Thanks!&nbsp; I went ahead and did a system restore, but no luck.&nbsp; WMP still won't pick up the device.&nbsp; The computer sees it just fine, and I can play the music on it through WMP, but it just won't show up as a device I can sync to.&nbsp; Philips says it's updated
 and working properly.</p>

<br />
I now suspect that this is related directly to a Windows Update.&nbsp; Which one, I can't be sure, but I found a system restore point early enough to give me back my sync capabilities.&nbsp; Eventually, though, after several days of automatic Windows Updates, it stopped
 working again.&nbsp; Vista will not let me shut down without installing the udpates.&nbsp; I've had
<em>many</em> problems with Windows Updates at work, and I really don't&nbsp;feel like hunting around the update&nbsp;discussion boards where most of the talk is over my head anyway.&nbsp; Any further thoughts?&nbsp;

            I too have the same problem with a Philips Go Gear 2980/02. Philips support lady who is in Holland I think was surprised as she has the same machine in Holland and WMP 11 at home so prehaps its a UK update problem? What I cant understand is how it works
 with WMP10 but not 11?<br />
<br />
Can anyone at MS confirm they have checked thier updates please? <br />

<p>Well, I spoke with Philips, and, according to them, the GoGear simply will NOT work with anything greater than WMP10. My GoGear is less than 1 year old, but, for whatever reason, it is just not compatible with WMP11. My computer, however, still recognizes
 the device when it's plugged in, so the only solution they offered was to cut and paste music from my library into the (F:) drive (or whatever compatible drive your Go Gear is). It's not as convenient as syncing, but at least it works, and I can still use
 my MP3 player. It's disappointing that something that was manufactured in 2008 is already out of date, especially considering that the only reason I went with GoGear is because it was affordable. I wish Microsoft would remedy this for the next WMP upgrade.</p>

    <title>Startech USB 3 PCI card causes an issue with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alan hb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Startech USB 3 PCI card causes an issue with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Just upgraded to Windows 10 and all hardware working fine but after a couple of hours my Seagate 3 TB expansion drive suddenly became un-usable!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The drive is USB 3 and I have fitted a Startech PEXUSB3S2 PCI card that provides 2 USB 3 ports.&nbsp; Device manager shows the device as disabled.&nbsp; The device was working fine in Windows 7 (and for a couple of hours in Windows 10).</p>
<p>I have checked the Startech website but they have no drivers for Windows 10.</p>
<p>My Dell Inspiron PC has dual boot to also run Ubuntu. The Seagate 3TB expansion drive is working fine in Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Fortunately I took a disc image using Macrium Reflect prior to the Windows 10 upgrade so I have been able to restore Windows 7. The 3TB drive is again working fine.
</p>
<p>Seems to be a driver issue with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas please?</p>

            <p>Kiran,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restored Windows 10 using an image that I took on 29 July after updating to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I then updated McAfee Internet Security and ran Windows Update.</p>
<p>The PC was then restarted and during the restart I received the message "UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP"&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; "PC Preparing for Repair"&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; "Diagnosing your PC"&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; "Your PC did not start correctly"</p>
<p>I selected "Restart" and received the same messages again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time I selected "Advanced options" &gt; "Reset this PC". The message "Resetting this PC 1%" stayed on screen for 20 minutes at which time I switched the PC off and restored Windows 7 from a Macrium Reflect image.&nbsp; All devices are now working as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I was unable to follow the procedure that you advised (above) to check my USB 3 card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to update Windows 10 again in a few months time in the hope that whatever caused the system to crash has been fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue with the PEXUSB3S2 card with Windows 10. The only thing that works is shutting down the computer and disconnecting the power so that the motherboard is powered down completely. This seems to reset the card and when you boot it up again
 it has the correct driver Renesas 3.0 USB controller driver is loaded and it is working in device manager and the drives appear in Windows that are connected to the USB 3.0 ports.</p>

<p>"I have checked the Startech website but they have no drivers for Windows 10."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to site and downloaded the most recent drivers and they installed ok.</p>
<p>They showed up as the driver name with "(Microsoft)" appended to the end.&nbsp; The site says these should work for windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still in middle of install. &nbsp; I checked drivers when windows 10 did a massive update which failed repeatedly. The old drivers had left a issues so I uninstalled them and removed the drivers to clear problem. &nbsp; Rebooted and ran the update a couple of
 times and it succeeded.&nbsp; Drivers and USB 3 shows now in device manager.&nbsp;</p>

That would depend&nbsp;upon how much time you have to investigate the issue. The first thing to do is to rule out a hardware issue.<br />
<a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/SYSTEMS/dim2400/en/sm_en/advtshoo.htm#1105412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">This Dell page shows</a> how you can tell if there is a hardware issue by checking the&nbsp;Diagnostic Lights on the back of the tower.<br />
Also on that page is list of <a href="http://support.dell.com/support/edocs/SYSTEMS/dim2400/en/sm_en/advtshoo.htm#1105830" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Beep Codes</a>, the first <strong>2</strong> pertain to&nbsp;the memory.<br />
If neither of those helps -</p>
<p>1. Test the memory - <a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">memtest86+</a><br />
2. Test the Hard Drive. If you don't know who manufactured the Hard Drive, please see -&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://support.dell.com/support/DPP/Index.aspx?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Product Support for Dimension 4700C</a><br />
You can either enter the Service Tag or, using Internet Explorer, have Dell <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Scan My System</span>.<br />
Once you've identified who manufactured the Hard Drive, visit the manufacturer's web site for&nbsp;their tool that will test the Hard Drive's integrity.</p>
<p>If the issue is not hardware related, try running sfc /scannow and see if the System File Checker can replace&nbsp;a corrupted/damaged&nbsp;USP10.dll -<br />

            Well I checked the diagnostic lights on the back and they all are green. I hear no beeps on start up. Went in to diagnostic mode from f12 and ran all driver tests, all passed. Not really sure how to test the memory. But still unable to login just goes
 to blue screen with error message still. Could I have gotten some kind of virus or bug? Thanks for the help so far.

<p><br />
The test will not <strong>run</strong> despite the fact that&nbsp;you configured the system to&nbsp;<strong>first</strong>&nbsp;boot from the CD&nbsp;&nbsp;? From the memtest86+ Frequently Asked Questions &nbsp;-</p>
<blockquote>If your machine simply boots back into Windows/Linux you will most likely<br />
have to configure your BIOS to attempt to boot from CD-ROM drive on<br />
startup, refer to your computer's/mainboard's manual how to do this.<br />
<br />
When you are done testing simply remove the CD and reset your computer,<br />
if ever you want to execute the test again simply reinsert the CD and<br />
reboot/start your computer.</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;To enter the BIOS settings for Dell computers press the DEL key prior to Windows loading to access the&nbsp;<strong>Boot Configuration</strong> settings.<br />
Set the CD/DVD drive to the number 1 position, press the ESC key, choose the 'Save changes and exit' option.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Bending</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have bought a Surface Pro 4 about two weeks ago and 3 days ago, I noticed that it is bending. The curve is obvious and more at the bottom of screen (keyboard side). Is it normal? I use it very carefully and I'm sure that there was no impact or unusual
 force on it. Any body has a problem like this? What should I do? Two pictures of the device is posted to show my problem.</p>

<h2>            Skype for iOS Updated, Now Defaults to Speakerphone</h2>
                    Since I updated to the latest version of Skype (8.2.1) today on my iPhone (OS 10.3.3) it defaults to making all phone calls with the speakerphone and I have to manually enable the earpiece if I want to make a normal phone call. &nbsp;Is this another new 'feature'
 introduced with the new design or is something wrong? &nbsp;Can I make the default to use it as a normal phone? &nbsp;I have looked through the settings but I've not been able to find anything useful.

                    <p>Late last week my surface pro become unbootable giving a WHEA_uncorrectable_error.&nbsp; Many many hours of diagnostics and attempts to repair were unsuccessful.&nbsp; Finally I re-loaded Win10 Fresh and things were good until it took updates and installed KB4056892.&nbsp;
 The very next reboot it went back to blowing up at login.&nbsp; This is a 4GB i5-6300U Surface 4 Pro.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These problems persisted on a fresh copy of win10 (all partitions removed prior to re-install).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to block the update and now the system is stable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What gives?&nbsp; This took 30+ hours to get working again.&nbsp; I was under the impression that AMD processors were having trouble with 6892 and I don't see a lot of others complaining about Surface 4 Pro machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why me?</p>

<p>I think you missed the point of what I was saying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am aware that Meltdown and Spectre can effect all CPU's, but what I was trying to say is why did KB4056892 cause my Microsoft Surface 4 Pro with an Intel i5 processor to start throwing the WHEA_Uncorrectable_Error and not allow me to login to the machine?&nbsp;
 I don't see others reporting this happening to their Intel based Surface 4 Pro devices?&nbsp; Why did this happen to me? 6892 is only supposed to Bork AMD machines right?&nbsp; Otherwise lots of people would be reporting borkage with this patch on Surface 4 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This continued to happen after a totally fresh installation of windows.&nbsp; The only way I have access to my machine is by using&nbsp;<span>wushowhide.diagcab to block KB4056892.&nbsp; I don't want to do this, but it is the only way my
 machine will operate.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This also means that I have no Meltdown/Spectre protection at this point.&nbsp; Installing KB4056892 will bork my machine once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's going on here?&nbsp; Do I have to tear my Surface apart to see that it actually has an AMD processor but is reporting an intel processor?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's time for some real answers here.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>As I mentioned there apparently others have found it necessary to disable virtualization in the BIOS to get the update installed but at least in the case that I saw it was not as extreme as some AMD users were claiming; e.g. there was a rollback happening.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I was able to boot it in safe mode command prompt.&nbsp; I checked the updates and 2 were installed since the last time it was stable.&nbsp; KB4090913 &amp; KB4090914.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled (wusa /uninstall /kb:4090913) and rebooted and now it's stable again.&nbsp; I manually downloaded KB4090913 and installed and right after reboot it went back to&nbsp;<span>WHEA_uncorrectable_error.&nbsp; I once again uninstalled
 KB4090913 and back to stable.&nbsp; I've added this update to wushowhide so that it won't install.&nbsp; This is no way to go through life.&nbsp; This isn't a Chinese&nbsp;clone I've got here.&nbsp; It's a Microsoft Surface Pro 4.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I'll ask once again.&nbsp; WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?&nbsp; Microsoft hardware, Microsoft software.&nbsp; I shouldn't have to go through this.&nbsp; How do I get an explanation?&nbsp; hours and hours wasted on making a computer (an expensive one

                    <p>Skype to Go doesn't work with my new cell phone.&nbsp; I have a Samsung 8+ on Consumer Cellular.&nbsp; I called my Skype to Go number to call my sister in London from the US.&nbsp; The call rang through and connected, but I could barely hear her and she could not hear
 me at all.&nbsp; After trying twice, I called from my land line and the call went through fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to using a new cell phone (Skype to Go worked fine with my old flip phone), I was placing the call over internet instead of using the cellular network.&nbsp; Could this be the problem?</p>

            Hi Marius,
<br />
<br />Go to Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Expand the Display Adapters section - is there a proper Video driver loaded, or is that showing as Microsoft Basic Display Adapter?
<br />
<br />What is the Make and exact Model No. of your device - that will be on a sticker on the bottom casing of your device . . .

<p>have you tried other resolutions in between these two you listed ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try 1280x720</p>
<p>
</p><p>always restart pc after making changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And you most likely have Microsoft generic drivers for display adapter and I would go to the OEM website for your PC model and see if they have Windows 10 drivers/software and install them. But I doubt they do since you had windows 7, Pc is pretty old.</p>

            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:

<h2>            Problem with network adapter or access point on Windows 7</h2>
                    Hi everyone! I have a new Acer laptop with Windows 7 Ultimate. My husband initially used it in Saudi and it connected with the router without a problem. When it was brought in the Philippines, it was able to connect for a couple of days only. We have another
 laptop and a desktop with XP on both in addition to cellular phones that connect also to the wifi. After a couple of days, my Windows 7 cannot connect anymore. It can detect all the wireless networks in the vicinity but is unable to connect. One i hit the
 troubleshoot button, "Problem with network adapter or access point." and microsoft cannot solve it. I already disabled IPv6, the virtual wifi, the power management, the home group among others. Please explain and tell us what are we suppose to do, if possible,
 for a not-so-computer-savvy person like me. Thanks so much. I am looking forward for hearing from you soon

<h3> stilezy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows won&#39;t let me restore a system image made just 2 hours ago&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm installing and configuring a new PC with Windows 7 x64 and came up to a tricky point with some software that was likely to go badly wrong, so I took a system image (Backup and Restore) to a convenient network share (for convenience I'll call the path
 I backed up to "\\server\backups\") first. &nbsp;As expected the tricky bit didn't work first time, but Windows won't let me restore my backup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I go to Restore in windows, it won't find the backup whatever folder in the hierachy I point it to. It insists there's no backup there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The network share is fine, the disks and OSes (all Win7 x64 SP1 clean installs and up to date) are fine, the network drive has everyone and SYSTEM both with full control down to individual files so it's unlikely to be permissions, there is a MediaID file
 in the backup folder, nothing has changed at all that's relevant to this, it's been under 2 hours .....restore still fails completely. &nbsp;I've tried copying the folder to a local drive in case network permissions or issues (trusted zone etc) were the problem,
 and it still wouldn't see the backup folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I went back to the recovery options on reboot ("advanced"). &nbsp;That was even less successful. &nbsp;It can't find the local HD backup copy, it doesn't have a browse function, and the only way to enter a network share seems to need me to type in a 200 character
 path (no "browse" function!), asks me for the login, and then says it's inaccessible (it isn't, it maps just fine with that login).</p>
<p>Can someone help me to get my backup restoring? Thanks!</p>
<p><br />

            <p>I suggest you get away from the Windows backup program and get yourself a good commercial backup program. This forum is fraught with problem reports for the Windows one. I know I was very unimpressed when I tried it. Two I'm familiar with and like are Norton
 Ghost (which I've been using for 8 years without the 1st problem), and Memeo which has a 30 day free trial and you can buy it for $29.99 - you can download it from
</p>
<p><a href="http://memeo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://memeo.com</u></a> . You can get Ghost for next to
 nothing (like I did) if you watch the sales. </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The March 2012 issue of PC World is very high on the FREE program from Easeus,
<b><i>Easeus Todo Backup Free</i></b>, which you can download from </p>
<p><a href="http://www.todo-backup.com/products/home/free-backup-software.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://www.todo-backup.com/products/home/free-backup-software.htm</u></a>
 . </p>
<p>-</p>
<p>CNET has a lot of backup program reviews at </p>
<p><a href="http://download.cnet.com/windows/backup-software/?tag=contentBody;sideBar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://download.cnet.com/windows/backup-software/?tag=contentBody;sideBar</u></a>
 .</p>
<p>Some of these are free (last time I checked there were over 300), some have free trials (over 1000), and some are purchase only (over 200).</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>External hard drives are best for backup. You can get a 500 GB one for around $70 and a 1.5 TB one for around $100. You can also buy a 16 GB flash drive for as little as $10. It's the best insurance you can ever buy!</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Good luck</p>

            <p>I gather that, though a bit late. &nbsp;It will help in future, but right now I need to restore that specific backup. &nbsp;The irony is that wbadmin can see the image - but Win7 wbadmin does't have the "start recovery" option - while the Win7 GUI tool has the recovery
 option but can't see the image.</p>
<p>If you know how I can persuade that image into restoring I'd appreciate it. Obviously all the data's there and I won't make the same mistake again.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I wouldn't use an external drive for valuable data. &nbsp;I used Drive Image &nbsp;(years ago!) which was perfect. The problem is most current software tries to be too comprehensive and causes real problems. I don't want it running in the background. I want a simple
 backup/restore that works reliably, and all it needs to do is compressed imaging, restore, copy, verify., and maybe incremental backup to save space, needs to work both within or outside Windows - and doesn't do anything until asked. &nbsp;Absolutely no running
 in the background when not manually started (no wasted resources, no automatic timed backups, no need). &nbsp;Live CD tools hit an opposite problem, you can't run them in Windows and they don't necessarily recognise all storage devices. &nbsp;If you have a recommendation
 for this kind of prog let me know :)</p>

            <p>&nbsp;I hear you re Drive Image.&nbsp; It's my understanding that Symantec bought Drive Image and replaced the Ghost software with it back in 2004.&nbsp; You don't have to have it do automatic backups if you don't want it to.&nbsp; In fact you can install it, then run MSCONFIG
 and keep it from starting.&nbsp; If you do that, you'll need to run MSCONFIG and let it start itself when you want to use it though.&nbsp; Like I said, I've been using it for 8 years and have found it to be rock solid without the first&nbsp;sign of a problem at any time.&nbsp;
 The county I live in uses it to back up their computers, and that's where I got the idea.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; I've been using WD and Seagate external hard drives further back than I can remember (at least 8 years or more), and have only had to replace one of them.&nbsp; This is comparable to my experence with internal drives at home.&nbsp; You can always buy an enclosure
 and put an internal type drive in it if you feel that increases reliability.&nbsp; Of course if you have a server with its own HDs, that's a possibility too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As I mentioned, there're many other programs out there, but Ghost is the one I know and depend on.&nbsp; I'm not a fan of Symantec, but so far they haven't managed to screw up Ghost (knock, knock)!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

            <p>What anti-virus software is installed?</p>
<p>What error reports in Event Viewer?</p>
<p><span>Here are some notes about Event Viewer Reports which may help. When you have a lot of errors you need to concentrate on system errors and warnings, even
 if it is applications that are giving you grief. Sorting system problems first can make resolving application problems easier. Note the time the computer is last booted and deal with those at the beginning of the boot first. Correcting the earlier errors can
 resolve later ones.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution. Most system related errors
 are logged and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes System is by far the most important.</span></p>
<p><span>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows
 Logs and System. Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to click a second time to see
 the latest Report at the top. </span></p>
<p><span>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Click on the Copy button on the General
 tab to place a copy on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</span></p>
<p><span>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports that offer the best information
 but occasionally Warning Reports provide useful clues. </span></p>
<p><span>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports. Study reports since the point
 when the computer was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session. If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on the internet. The description
 is equally important and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting better results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</span></p>

            <p>tested with antivirus not running on this and the backup machine, same result.</p>
<p>Event log - nothing, not surprising as not the kind of error one would expect to see in the event log (as far as the control panel is concerned its probably not an "event" to report if a backup doesn't exist on a local disk or in a folder entered by the
 user). &nbsp;Event log is uneventful. Looked at applications &amp; service logs\MS\windows\backup, nothing there either.</p>
<p>So what exactly do I need to do, so it recognises this as a backup and lets me restore it (in GUI) or to get the equivalent of wbadmin start recovery on Windows 7? One or the other should be simple, either forcing the location so backup "sees" them, or a
 workaround for the crippled win7 wbadmin function.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;I hope somebody with a good answer will come along and give you a good one, but I wouldn't hold my breath.&nbsp; Since Windows 7 came out in 2009, I've seen a whole lot of folks fight this battle and go down swinging.&nbsp; Occasionally they get something to work,
 but you mentioned backup programs that've gotten too complicated.&nbsp; The Windows 7 backup program is the worst offender of this that I've ever seen!&nbsp; :-(</p>

            <p>I was reinstalling my system (Win7 x64) and had reached a point where all updates and config were as desired and working, but no end-use software beyond antivirus installed. I took a system image at that &nbsp;point as it's a good restore base for future. Also
 I was planning to experiment with some configuration and possible software including trialling Outlook in different modes and other downloaded trial software such as a different text editor and newest version of Opera browser, and maybe experiment with disabling
 a couple of services, then afterwards restore from the system image to guarantee everything I tested was undone and nothing "forgotten".</p>
<p>As I remember, I went into "backup and restore" and it asked for where to put the backups if not on a local disk, so I gave it the "backups" folder on my network share which it was happy with. Specifically I browsed to a path like this: &nbsp;"\\fileserver\system
 image backups\myname" and gave that as the backup location. &nbsp;On the "what to back up" tab I deselected all files and folders and left only "system image (C:)" checked at the bottom. &nbsp;I disabled backup scheduling as I don't need scheduled backup on my system
 drive. &nbsp;I think that was all the settings I gave. &nbsp;It was fine with it and the backup seemed to go fine, eventually it notified me the backup was finished.</p>
<p>At the fileserver end, it is also Win7 x64 + Kaspersky Internet Security 2012. Permissions for the backup seem fine in that I can&nbsp; traverse and read its files and folders completely whether locally on the server and via its network share from this machine,
 and I can copy the backup correctly to a local drive via its network share, if I need to check permissions for any other account let me know.</p>

<h2>            Blue Screen at startup - IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</h2>
                    
<p>original title: Getting BSOD when windows starts up, I cannot log into my PC at all.</p>
<p>When my computer starts up it loads to the user login page of windows. Then it BSOD's, I cannot log into windows at all. Ive gotten two different error messages on the bsod. First one being "IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL" the other being "interupt exception not
 handled" I am currently reinstalling windows. I did the memory test and it passed. Im thinking it may be my graphics card from what ive read on other forums. The fix seems to be to uninstall and reinstall it but I cannot even log into my computer to do so.
 Is there another way to do this or does someone have a suggestion of what else this could possibly be? Any help is appreciated. Thanks. :]</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi Mrs.Beth,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><span><span><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>You may check if you can use the Last known good configuration. It is a<span>Windows</span> startup option that
 uses the most recent system settings that worked correctly. Every time you turn your computer off and<span>Windows</span> shuts down successfully, important system settings are saved in the registry. So it starts<span>Windows</span> with the last registry
 and driver configuration that worked successfully.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>You may refer to the below links for further assistance on the issue -</span></strong></span></span><span><span><span><br />
</span></span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Using-Last-Known-Good-Configuration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Using-Last-Known-Good-Configuration</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</span></span></span></span></a></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may disconnect all the external devices like printer, etc and check if you are able to boot in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
In Safe mode; you have access to only basic files and drivers. Refer to the link to start the computer in safe mode and then check -<br />
<strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>If you are able to login to safe mode</span></strong><span>it
 is highly possible that a device driver is causing this problem.<br />
Go to device manager to disable device drivers.<br />
a.&nbsp;Go to start and type device manager.<br />
b.&nbsp;Select device manager from the control panel list.<br />
c. To disable a driver, right-click on the device and select properties. Go to driver tab and select disable.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Disable the following devices (if present).</span></strong><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a. Video Cards<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Sound Card&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Network Card&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d. USB Devices and controller (Please don’t do this if you are using USB keyboard or Mouse or Wireless Keyboard or mouse)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e. CD and DVD&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f. Modems<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g. Ports (serial and parallel)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
d.&nbsp;Reboot the computer into normal mode.<br />
e.&nbsp;If the computer successfully boots into normal mode, re-enable half of the device drivers that were disabled and reboot.<br />
f.&nbsp;Continue rebooting and re-enabling successively more devices until Windows no longer boots normally.<br />
g.&nbsp;One of the device drivers in the most recently re-enabled group of drivers is causing the problem.<br />
h.&nbsp;Boot to safe mode to remove the device driver for the particular device.<br />
i.&nbsp;To remove a device driver:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. Go to device manager by following the steps 1 and 2.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii. To remove a device driver, right-click on the device, select properties, go to driver tab and click uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>Once this is done, you can boot to normal mode and check the driver for the device from the manufacturer’s website that is compatible with Windows
 7.</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

    <title>files using double space when moved to different partition - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            files using double space when moved to different partition</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an annoying problem when I move a file to a different partition on my Windows 10 systems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice that, when I copy/cut and paste a file from a partition to another, the file uses 2 times its size in the new partition (like an invisible backup copy) and it goes back to normal just if I reboot the system (or unplug and plug it again in the case
 of an external drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried different solutions (setting the history file on and off, changing the drive properties (cache on and off), etc) but nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried even to search online for a solution but I don't really know what so search/what keywords to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>

<p>

</p><p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you are using any third party antivirus software please try disabling it and see if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Important Note:</strong><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps below to check the issue occurs in safe mode if not perform a clean boot please follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: Safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC. For example, if the problem doesn't happen in safe mode, you'll know default settings and basic device drivers
 aren't causing the issue.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: Cleanboot</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I&nbsp; also suggest you to do a clean boot and check if any third party apps are causing the issue.
</span><span>Placing the computer in a clean boot state can reduce software conflicts and help identify the root cause of the issue.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can exclude the method 1, because I tried on different systems with different antivirus software (or none at all) and there is the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried both steps of method 2 and nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to use my partition with Windows 8.1 on it and it doesn't show the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's strange because when I move a file (easier to notice with big ones), the system initially allocate the space according to the size of the file and, while moving it, keep using the space until completed. So, at the end, in this way a file occupies double
 of its real size. And the extra space is given back after a restart (or unplug and replug an external drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We upgraded from windows 7.&nbsp; The computer created an account for us under another member of the families user name - we didn't to my knowledge have a Microsoft account, or if we did we never used it for anything as we didn't need to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest this whole upgrade has caused so much stress I really think it hasn't been worth it, and we are very frustrated as it has caused other issues as well like our screen looks terrible - we have a rectangle computer screen and none of the icons
 look like they did before, and no amount of fiddling under the settings for display are working to sort this out.&nbsp; We cannot access our photographs as it tells us we are not allowed access - I am seriously thinking of opting back to our old system if that
 is possible - my concern is that it won't ever be the same again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will take a look at the articles you have referred to but if you can shed any further light on this it would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

</div>
<div>Hi,</div>
<div>I've been trying to restore my Dell Laptop to it's&nbsp;original factory settings using the F8 option:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kcs/document?&amp;docid=DSN_362066&amp;isLegacy=true#Issue3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kcs/document?&amp;docid=DSN_362066&amp;isLegacy=true#Issue3</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've already done this once before so I know how it works, but it's not working for me this time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>First&nbsp;of all, clicking F8 just once doesn't do anything, I have to&nbsp;continuously&nbsp;press it. When it finally works, it take me to this screen (which is where it's supposed to take me):&nbsp;<a href="http://cdn.webtrickz.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/AdvancedBootOptions.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cdn.webtrickz.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/AdvancedBootOptions.jpg</a>&nbsp;I'm
 supposed to press <i>"Repair Your Computer"</i> which is supposed to take me to the next step. But when I click&nbsp;<i>"Repair Your Computer"</i>&nbsp; it takes me to this screen instead:&nbsp;<a href="http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Recov-1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://notebooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Recov-1.jpg</a>&nbsp;
 Then if I click <i>"Launch&nbsp;Startup Repair (recommended)" </i>it just takes me back to this screen again. If I hold down "enter" on&nbsp;<i>"Launch&nbsp;Startup Repair (recommended)"
</i>I hear really loud beeps until I let go of "enter" and then it just take me back to this screen again. Thid F8 restore process is just refusing to work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've already backed up&nbsp;everything&nbsp;in my USB and I don't need anything on my laptop. I really need it to return to it's factory settings because my laptop is really annoying right now and I'm very&nbsp;frustrated. I tried contacting Dell too but my warranty
 is expired so if I want help from them, I have to pay $250. I am really confused, did I&nbsp;disable&nbsp;the F8 restore feature or something? Please help and thank you in advance.</div>

            <p>1&nbsp; It might be a longshot but can you boot into Windows normally still so that you can run sfc?&nbsp;&nbsp; The System File Checker can fix corrupt files in Win7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a><em>There is additional guidance on it in
</em><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/sfcexe-scannow/15200dff-f45e-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5"><em>sfc.exe /scannow</em></a>&nbsp; Perhaps this will fix some element of Windows
 startup that is preventing the System Recovery Options window appearing.&nbsp; I suggest this because [from memory only] I think Windows has not handed over to Dell by the stage of recovery when your system failed.&nbsp; By the way, the F8 key does need to be pressed
 repeatedly so there was nothing going wrong at that earlier stage.</p>
<p>2&nbsp; Did you make the recommended system repair disk &amp; set of recovery disks when you got the PC [or after your first factory restoration]?&nbsp; These can also be used to return the system to [almost] its original factory condition.</p>
<p>3&nbsp; Did you make any other system images soon after getting the PC / Factory Restoring?</p>
<p>4&nbsp; Did you use Dell DataSafe Local Backup [or its equivalent on a Studio 1558] to make a backup USB/DVD-R of the Factory Restore partition?</p>
<p>5&nbsp;Does Dell Support Center or its associated PC Checkup application report any specific errors that you might try fixing?</p>
<p>6&nbsp; Do you know anybody else who has a Studio 1558 of the same age [hence same configuration] with the same operating system as you?</p>
<p>7&nbsp; Have you tried putting in the Win7 installation DVD then booting using it to do a general Windows repair?&nbsp; And then retrying the Factory restoration.</p>
<p>8&nbsp; If not, and I suppose that's the case or you would not have posted, then you will have lost the Factory restore facility.&nbsp; I have also lost it but it is not the end of the world.</p>
<p>9&nbsp; You are correct in thinking that you can use your Win7 installation disc.&nbsp; You can then retry the Factory Restore just in case it was a Windows glitch &amp; not a Dell one.&nbsp; You will have to be careful during your Windows installation to let Windows install
 to its original partition and not to overwrite the Recovery partition created by Dell - it might wreck this anyway but it's worth trying to avoid doing so.&nbsp; Before starting any reinstallation have a look at the partiitons in Computer management, Disk management
 so you can see what is what - you'll see the main C:\ partition &amp; the 8 or 16GB Recovery partition put in by Dell as well as another very small one [just 100MB or so]</p>
<p>10&nbsp; When you have restored the system using the Windows installation disk, you can then go to the Dell support website to get
<em><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/uk/en/ukdhs1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">drivers &amp; downloads</a> [the link is the UK one but will at least illustrate what you will find]
</em>that will include all drivesr &amp; some of the utilities you might otherwise have lost.&nbsp; The original versions of these will be on the Dell Utilities CD that you will have received along with your PC - it's worth putting this in the PC &amp; getting Windows to
 look at it when updating drivers but you'll also be checking for updates on the Dell website anyway so this CD is just a bit of a shortcut to the original versions.</p>
<p>11&nbsp; You may have already created a Dell account.&nbsp; If not then do so because this will also give you the chance of downloading a fresh copy of some Dell utilities.&nbsp; In my case, this allowed me to download then ignore the Roxio Burn utility.&nbsp; I don't know
 how to set this up as I must have done it when the PC first arrived but I have just found a card directing me to
<a href="http://downloadstore.dell.com/media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://downloadstore.dell.com/media</a> to set up "My Dell Downloads" which sounds like the right place.</p>
<p>12&nbsp; All in all, the only utility I lost was Dell DataSafe Local Backup.&nbsp; The only unique function of this is to create the USB/DVD-R I mentioned above.&nbsp; So not a great loss really.</p>
<p>Let me know if there's anything else I can help with.&nbsp; And check in <a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Surface Pro 4 Screen Flicker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ranzjb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Screen Flicker</h2>
                    <p>About a month or two ago my surface pro 4 screen started to flicker. I've tried all of the tips to make it stop that I've found and so far none have stopped the problem. Also unlike most other screen flickers I see from other users, the problem only stops
 when nothing on the screen is moving. It usually stops for other people when something is moving on the display.</p>

            Mine also did this (the bottom 2/3rds of the screen image started jumping up and down continuously after about half an hour of use.) I could not solve this with any software changes, and it seemed to be linked to the screen temperature as it only started
 up when it had been in use for a while. Luckily I had bought it with a two year guarantee so returned to the seller for repair... and have now been issued with a full refund.

            Where did you purchase it from. Did you receive an email with the licence key. Is the licence attached to your MS Account.
