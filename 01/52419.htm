<h2>            Can connect via VPN, but can&#39;t see files</h2>
                    I can connect via VPN to my company's network, but the files don't show up on Vista. I have no problem seeing them on my old Windows PC, so it's a Vista specific problem. On my old system, I just click on Computer and it shows me all my company's folders
 on the network. Not Vista - can't find them anywhere, even though I'm connected via VPN. Where are they?

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Since it is company's network, there is No way to know hwo the security is configured unless you are an IT person in the company.</p>
<p>Do not "mess up" your computer, talk first to the person in charge of VPN connections.</p>

            Hi,  Lufuno
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try entering Safe Mode to repair
<br />
<br />Turn off your computer; then, turn it on. 
<br />As soon as you see the Windows logo with the spinning dots, press and hold the power button until your computer turns off. Do this process twice.
<br />.-Turn on your computer for the third time, and let it load.
<br />.-You should get this message: Preparing Automatic Repair.
<br />.-On the next screen that would appear, click on Advanced Options.
<br />.-Select Troubleshoot.
<br />.-Go to Advanced Options.
<br />.-Click on Startup Repair.
<br />.-Wait for the repair to finish.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            Hi Lufano.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You'll need to get into Safe Mode or Repair Mode to use the Command Prompt to remove Write Protection for the drive:
<br /><a href="https://www.easeus.com/storage-media-recovery/fix-read-only-error-on-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.easeus.com/storage-media-recovery/f...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/windows-10-read-only-problem-has-a-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.  These steps don't cover possible hardware failure which might become apparent while performing the steps, so please report back as you go:
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest may be to force shut down the PC (by holding in the power button) three separate times to trigger the Startup Options.  If one of these methods work, then go to Step 3.
<br /> 
<br />2) If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC following the steps in the middle of the downloads page here:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  Make sure to uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose only the licensed version.
<br />
<br />If the Media Creation Tool will not cooperate use the alternate download site at <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options access Command Prompt to try to remove Write Protection using command in the tutorial link I gave at the top, or if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode.  
<br />
<br />If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt following Step 5 here: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enable-disable-f8-advanced-boot-options-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/22455-enabl...</a> where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration. 
<br /> 
<br />4) From Safe Mode w/Networking access Command Prompt to try the Write Protect removal command, work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get donehttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00:    If it doesn’t fix Windows enough to start it normally, then try a Windows 10 Refresh: <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br /> 
<br />5) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Advanced Troubleshoot options.   Next try Command Prompt to run through Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist (above link) repair commands including sfc /scannow,  DISM, a full Disk Check <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>,  or return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC.   You can also try System Restore to a point before the problem began.  
<br /> 
<br />6) Better yet do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />7) There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media or Repair Mode  Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These steps are excerpted from my tutorial that compiles everything possible for Troubleshooting Windows 10 Failure to Start:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  You can continue with the other steps there.
<br /> 
<br /> I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>I recently had an issue with my internet connection to the laptop which I am using(only my laptop can't connect to the internet). I went to acer page(Yes, I have an acer computer) and I downloaded all the wireless adapter drivers(you can find their names
 at the end of this post). Since then when I open my computer it takes too long to open and it just loads something that didn't use to at the past.</p>
<p>When that is done it says : "no bootable file name" and then it boots and even when it had left the boot page it still keeps going so slow(something that didn't use to). I have tried lot of things but nothing solved it.</p>

    <title>BSODs on brand new Windows 10 Installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> callous4567  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSODs on brand new Windows 10 Installation</h2>
                    <p>Hello; I've ran into several issues with a fresh Windows 10 Install. I've attached the a Drive folder with all of the minidumps from my crashes beneath this sentence, well, next to it:&nbsp;https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-acGFnEdX6mTh8Uvb0UeY8SI_6NkPpCg</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple weeks ago I built this PC and originally had an ASUS TUF Pro Gaming motherboard installed, and it faced many BSODs. Initially I thought this was simply due to the motherboard, thus I diagnosed it and indeed found that the BIOS chip was faulty and
 sent it back under RMA and replaced it with a new motherboard, an MSI Carbon Black Gaming motherboard. This didn't fix my issues, even with a clean install of Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This pointed me toward thinking that my RAM was at fault. After diagnosing my RAM with Memtest x86, there were no errors present: the RAM is in workable condition. They're two sticks of new TeamGroup Elite Black DDR4 2400MHz. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus, my hardware was fine. I ran the PC in safe mode, and didn't encounter any crashes, either. I'm also running it right now without safe mode, with all drivers activated, and although I do get BSOD crashes occasionally, I've not had one since this startup,
 thus my luck when it comes to making this plea for help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I presume it's a driver issue, after all the hardware is fine and this is a brand new Windows installation, however I have little ways in finding out the broken drivers or how to fix them. The issue occurred before I installed the driver CD that came with
 the motherboard, and this installed plenty of MSI drivers and utilities, but didn't rectify the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to update all the drivers in my device manager, reinstalled my video card drivers, and my LAN drivers (not that this helps, I'm running with WiFi since the LAN in my flat is broken right now)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be infinitely grateful for assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Sebastian</p>

<p>I've rectified the issue. After hours of painstaking effort and tracking the drivers down, the issue was rectified by updating the motherboards BIOS drivers, moving the RAM around the slots, and changing the VGA slot of my GPU. Seems like it was a RAM/Motherboard
 issue after all?</p>
<p>I also downgraded my GPU drivers.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Help my Samsung laptop won&#39;t start after updating to windows 10</h2>
                    My Samsung notebook model NP350V5C won't even start after updating to windows 10. The blue start light comes on on the button and the charging light and that's it. I have replaced both battery and charger in case they were the problem but they are not.
 Very occasionally &nbsp;the laptop seems to start after a prolonged waiting period but now it seems pretty dead. It's there anything I can do. Microsoft seemed to have killed my laptop!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your kind response. Unfortunately it doesn't react to any of the buttons you suggested. Any other ideas? Yours hopefully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, my laptop has windows 8 on it when I bought it which I upgraded to 8.1 and then up to windows 10.<br />

            <p>Hi again,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once more thanks for replying. I'm not seeing the manufacturers logo anymore....Infact I'm not getting any life out of my laptop at all. It was ok though before the windows 10 update, and it's only used for my work so had light usage and it's still looked
 after..no-one else allowed on it....so I really don't understand this problem. So frustrating!!!</p>

            <p>Enter your computer's BIOS and move through the screens until you find the configuration setting that enables the Firewire port. You may see Firewire called by its technical name: 1394. Every manufacturer's BIOS screens look different, but if you have a
 Firewire/1394 port, the setting to enable it is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Typically, you enter the BIOS by restarting your computer and tapping on the F2 or Delete key while the computer is starting - before Windows loads.</p>

<p><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When exactly do you receive the error message? Is it at Windows startup?</p>
<p><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Is this a Microsoft Excel file?</p>

<p>What are you planning to do? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you simply prefer XP, you can get some of the feel of it by using a tool like Classic Shell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to run XP software, your best option would be to set up a virtual machine on a WIn 7 or 10 laptop. Basically, software that simulates a computer so you can run XP within the OS installed on your computer. It would also give you some of the security
 protection of the newer version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as Bill said, running XP itself is not a good idea these days. It isn't being updated, so it's defenseless against any new threats.</p>

I have installed a .NET Framework Cleaner and ran it--I did what it said uninstall 2.0 and restart my computer when the Cleaner prompted and tried reinstalling. It did not work<br />
<br />
Next I tried to run a batch file with this command:<br />
<br />
{\rtf1\ansi\deff0{\fonttbl{\f0\fswiss\fcharset0 Arial;}}<br />
{\*\generator Msftedit 5.41.15.1515;}\viewkind4\uc1\pard\lang1033\f0\fs20 cd %SYSTEMROOT%\\WinSXS\par<br />
for /D %%i in (*vc80*) do rd %%i /s /q\par<br />
del manifests\\*vc80* /q\par<br />
cd policies\par<br />
for /D %%i in (*vc80*) do del %%i\\* /q\par<br />
}<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I restarted the computer (It did not say too, but I did anyway) and it did not work, I also tried without restarting.<br />
<br />
Another one I found said to delete a this file: C:\WINDOWS\WinSxS\Policies<br />
<br />
I did it and ran the installation again and it did not work yet again... This is starting to frustrate me and been trying for weeks now to install this. My graphic driver need .NET Framework 2.0 installed in order for it to work.<br />
<br />
I got a reg cleaner as well and erased all the regs and restarted my computer and it did not work either.<br />
<br />
Please do not direct me to another thread with the 'answer' because I have looked and everything I tried is describe is further up. This should be fixable. Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
Oh and while I am here on a side note... Anyone know why all my Uninstall folders in 'C:\WINDOWS' randomly deleted itself? I know for a fact I did not do this.<br />

            Have you tried lowering your screen resolution to see if the game launches?
<br />
<br />How much free space do you have on the drive?
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator/active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Do you have the latest cumulative updates for Windows 10 1803 installed?
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />		Scroll down to Forza Horizon 3
<br />		Select it
<br />		Click Advanced options
<br />		Click Reset
<br />
<br />		Restart
<br />
<br />		Check the Store for updates
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />download the following utility and use it to remove Forza Horizon 3:

<br />
<br />I am going to admit, you are not the first to report of issues with installing Forza Horizon series of games on Windows 10. There doesn't seem to be a documented solution of works and doesn't work. I have recommended to users to downgrade to an older release such as Windows 10 1703 and they report it works. 
<br />
<br />See example case:

<h2>            Game Room support</h2>
                    <p>So when I cleared the cache on my xbox 360, it erased all updates for the old game called "Game Room". Unfortunately, it also erased all progress for that game as well. I have talked with support multiple times about this and have been told that the progress is forever gone :( So I figured I would just re-earn all of my progress but the server is shut down and you can not unlock everything without being online. When I inquired about turning the game server back on (just for a very short time and possibly paying a service fee to do so) I get all kinds of different answers from tech support. One person told me it's an old game and they are just not going to do it, another said I have to contact the developer, etc. A different answer each time. I have been a gold member for several years and Game Room cost me a lot of money to purchase everything (which Microsoft happily took). How about a little help here? Everytime I call support about my xbox 360 (glitched avatar awards, avatar store no

 </blockquote> <p>Thank you for the reply. I have e-mailed the developer (Krome Studios) and have not received any reply as of yet. I wish there was a way to connect this game back online. There are a lot of us retro gamers still out here and a lot of people I know still play this game for the gems in the collection.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>So, Just an update to anyone who is interested. ALL UNLOCKABLES in this this game must be done online. Even though you go up a level and it says you unlocked, say, a theme for your arcade, said theme will NOT be unlocked in your collection. I was really upset to find this out. To any retro gamers out there who have things unlocked in this game, DO NOT CLEAR YOUR CACHE. This game has a habit of deleting your progress when you do so and you will have no way to get them back. Both Microsoft and Krome studios will be very unsympathetic to your situation.</p>

<h2>            Steam resize client window</h2>
                    When I try to re size steam client and exit steam so it can save, it does not save. It saves the horizontal re sizing but does not save the vertical re sizing. Is this normal. I also checked it out on my laptop and it's the same thing. So it's not just
 my desktop. Please can someone verify if this is normal. I just really realised this. lol.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For your query I would recommend contacting Steam's support team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steam is a digital distribution, digital rights management, multiplayer and communications platform developed by Valve Corporation. It is used to distribute games and related media online, from small independent developers to larger software houses. One
 of the ideas behind it is to help with the fight against videa game piracy. For alot of games you need to have a Steam account, and it is through this that you authenticate using your account so that steam and the game know that it is being used legally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The steam website is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://store.steampowered.com/</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From there you can find out more information, download Steam&nbsp;and sign up for an account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know if you face any Windows related issues in future. We will be glad to assist you.</p>

<p>Hi Stevens,</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the above description, I understand that the Screen saver fails to work on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to boot your computer in <strong>Clean Boot </strong>state and check if the issue persists. Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow
 the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot. </p>

<span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important:</strong> After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "<strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode</p>

<p>I have tried the above and it makes no difference. The screensaver works after a re-start UNTIL I open any MS Office 2013 application, which puts the kiss of death on it - the screensaver does not then work until the next re-start.<br />

                    After upgrading from Window 7 to Windows 10 my screen saver does not come on, the screen does not get turned off, and the computer runs continuously unless I turn it off. &nbsp;All of these functions worked properly under Windows 7. &nbsp;I have gone to "Settings"
 and I can set the screen turnoff time and the computer turn off time, but no matter the settings the screen stays on and the computer continues to run. &nbsp;Any ideas how to remedy this problem?

            <p>Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked the power plan advanced settings in Control panel?&nbsp; The "Settings" app is not the whole story.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get to the Control panel, right-click on the Start button &amp; select it.&nbsp; Then
<em>Power options</em>, <em>Change plan settings</em> &amp;&nbsp;<em>Change advanced power plan settings</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the power plan looks okay there but the faulty behaviour persists then it might be worth using the
<em>Restore default settings for this plan </em>item you'll also see there.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I have checked the power plan settings and have created&nbsp; a custom plan. I have also tried the balanced plan and the triple S, which it was on when I first accessed the area.&nbsp; I can't find any "restore defaults" option.</p>

<p>After approx 60 seconds of inactivity, Windows 10 pro goes to sleep and disconnects from router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was not happening when I first upgraded to Windows 10 pro (from Windows 7 pro.) I believe this started after the recent update to "fix" sleep issues some were having where they could not get Windows to sleep. Seems ironic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have sleep setting to Never and power settings to Balanced, but I have tried various settings with no resolution to problem. I read at forums others have same problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is a huge problem. </p>

</p><p>I meant the option in the power left of this dialog</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Please note that I have not seen a power plan called Triple S.&nbsp; This&nbsp;might be a power plan created by your computer maker.&nbsp; It's only a shot in the dark but if they also included one of those annoying power utilities for your previous OS, it might be less
 than completely compatible with Windows 10 and might therefore be the cause of your problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does occur to me that the recent update to which you refer might have disrupted your display driver [display drivers in Windows 7 often caused sleep problems with baffling symptoms].&nbsp; So checking / updating your display driver might help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try to understand the problem better by using PowerCfg to check just what power plan settings the system actually has set on it [as opposed to what power plan settings you have told the user interface to set on it].&nbsp; In an elevated command prompt,
 enter</p>
<p>PowerCfg -qh &gt;%UserProfile%\Desktop\CurrentPowerPlanDetailedSettings.txt</p>
<p><em>I paste the output into Excel to look through the very long output file.&nbsp; </em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It might look daunting at first but is just a large number of repetitions of a simple pattern -
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Power Setting GUID: 245d8541-3943-4422-b025-13a784f679b7&nbsp; (Power plan type)<br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Possible Setting Index: 000</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Possible Setting Friendly Name: Power saver</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Possible Setting Index: 001</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Possible Setting Friendly Name: High performance</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Possible Setting Index: 002</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Possible Setting Friendly Name: Balanced</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current AC Power Setting Index: 0x00000002</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Current DC Power Setting Index: 0x00000002</em></p>
<p>The&nbsp;initial GUID entries for each group are the reference number[s] for that item</p>
<p>The last two lines tell you what the settings are for AC &amp; DC.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The intervening lines tell you what units are used for the setting and, where relevant,&nbsp;what the range of possible settings is.&nbsp; I chose a simple example above but the units could be %, seconds, Yes/No or many other things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck,</p>

            <p>Thanks again for the detailed response.&nbsp; I would guess that "Triple S" is proprietary, but I did try it on "balanced".&nbsp; I have noted a new wrinkle.&nbsp; I put the computer to sleep last night using the power button and everything seemed proper. I went to bed
 and this morning the computer is on, I have no idea for how long.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I tried running the report using the command which you provided.&nbsp; I pasted into the elevated command prompt C:\Windows\system32&gt; and also the root C:\&gt; with no return but no error indicated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp; Before posting I did run a utility I found online provided by Microsoft that purportly checked the power management settings and it reported that the computer off time was set too long(even though it was set at two hours on the user interface) and that
 it fixed the problem.&nbsp; Unfortunately it didn't fix the problem and it didn't change any of the settings on the user interface.&nbsp; Any further ideas.&nbsp; This is a frustrating problem and, judging by this&nbsp;forum,&nbsp;it&nbsp; is fairly widespread.&nbsp; Thanks again for your input.</p>

<p>
</p><p>"run a utility I found online provided by Microsoft" - that is the Power Troubleshooter.&nbsp; It is also on your computer [Control panel, Troubleshooting].&nbsp; It is a highly sophisticated tool for arguing with you about how long you have set the display to stay
 on for.&nbsp; I have never seen a user report that the Power Troubleshooter achieved anything useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>
</p><p>About PowerCfg -qh &gt;%UserProfile%\Desktop\CurrentPowerPlanDetailedSettings.txt</p>
<p>
</p><p>[How stupid of me, use a hard folder path instead&nbsp;and add "" in case there are spaces in the path [that's what I do normally but I put in the %UserProfile% instead when I posted the line so it would be more general.]&nbsp; The output file might be on the desktop
 of your Admin user given that you had no error message returned.&nbsp; Or not.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, check your Admin account has write permission for the chosen C:\Users\<em>YourUserName</em>\Desktop folder then enter this command using&nbsp;the real folder path instead of C:\Users\<em>YourUserName</em>\Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">PowerCfg -qh &gt;"C:\Users\<em>YourUserName</em>\Desktop\PowerPlanProperties-Balanced.txt"</p>
<p>
</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find out what last woke up the computer from sleep using <em>PowerCfg -lastwake</em>, by checking&nbsp;recent tasks in Task scheduler or by looking in the Event viewer log.&nbsp; That can be a longer discussion so perhaps you would prefer to delay that until
 you have sorted out the main problem.</p>

<h2>            Rise of the Tomb Raider Achievement didn&#39;t unlock</h2>
                    Hello! I just finished Rise of the Tomb Raider on the ''Survivor'' difficulty and was disappointed to see that I didn't unlock the ''Ultimate Survivor'' achievement that you get when you beat the game on survivor. I then noticed that I wasn't connected
 to the internet, so I decided to connect. Unfortunately, it was too late and I did not get the achievement.

<p>Sometimes it takes a couple of days for them to unlock.&nbsp; Try performing a hard reset EXACTLY like this.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.&nbsp;
 Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

            This achievement sometimes take awhile to pop after the completion though reviewing some other posts related to it.&nbsp; &nbsp; Also know that this one does not stack with the DLC achievement for Extreme.&nbsp; If you complete on Extreme, this one does not pop.

<p>since rockstar wants to build la noire into a franchise, what would you like to see happen with it? stay in la or go to another city like New York or Chicago or Las Vegas? what decade would you like to play around in, keeping in mind the obvious noire genre.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>personally i would love to see the good ol' days of Vegas with bugsy and the rat pack over a couple decades or so, though Chicago would make a fantastic playground to fight against, or for, the mob.</p>

<p>Here is what I am hoping, and I discussed this with a friend of mine who agrees:</p>
<p>This is Rockstar. I don't want a goodie goodie game. Next time I hope they explore the possibilities of being a dirty crooked cop. Planting evidence. Intimidating witnesses. Taking bribes. Murdering suspects that just really annoy you. Working with the criminals
 to get information on the streets when you need it. Essentially, if I have to play a cop, I want him to be like Vic Mackey from The Shield.

<p>^ ha your evil. That is actually my favorite thing about this and red dead, that I do not feel the urge to mow down hookers or be stupid. But your idea is a good one and I think it would make a good game if you have some leeway from being a good cop to what
 you just suggested. &nbsp;</p>

<p>How could the game possibly work with a protagonist that is working for the mob?
</p>
<p>According to Rockstar Social, i spent twice as much time investigating as i did in gunfights. The detective thing is as integral to the franchise as the "noire" thing.
</p>
<p>I think that Chicago is the obvious choice to relocate, but wouldn't mind if things stayed in L.A with Jack Kelso.</p>

<h2>            Google Earth Pro Will Not Appear on my Surface Pro 4 with Windows 10</h2>
                    I am trying to open Google Earth Pro on my Surface Pro 4 running Windows 10. I've never had a problem with it until recently, but whenever I open Google Earth, the startup screen shows and then nothing happens. the program shows in the tray and it seems
 to be running, but it's not up on my screen. When I toggle between maximizing and minimizing, I see a brief "ghost window" fly down to my lower lefthand corner of the screen, but then nothing. When I close Google Earth from the tray, a window pops up and asks
 me if I want to save my places before closing the program. Any ideas? Thanks!!

<p>Hello Sahil,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, please use your account and sign in on your colleague’s mobile device to see if you can sign in successfully.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the error message you provided, the organization set up the policy to stop you from using Skype for Business mobile application. Please contact the Office 365 admins in your organization to check if they did it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the admins didn’t set up some special policies, please try to re-install Skype for Business for Android application and sign in again.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>
        </p>
