<h2>            Is there a settting that I can use to change the position of the taskbar previews images&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there a setting that can be used to adjust <u>the position</u> of the taskbar previews, such that they are
<u>displayed higher on the screen</u>, resulting in more space between the <u>top of the taskbar</u> and the
<u>bottom of the taskbar previews area</u>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's why I am asking this question:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The taskbar previews feature of Windows 7 is nice.&nbsp; However, I have not been able to find a way to
<u>change the position</u> of the taskbar previews on the screen.&nbsp; That is, the taskbar previews are always positioned immediately above the taskbar, with only a few pixels of space between the
<u>taskbar previews area</u> and the <u>taskbar itself</u>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In many applications (e.g. Word, Excel, UltraEdit, SAP GUI, etc.), there is helpful information displayed at the bottow of the application window.&nbsp; The fact that the taskbar previews are positioned immediately above the taskbar, with little space between
 them and the taskbar, can be an issue, because then the taskbar previews block that helpful information at the bottom of the application windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My desire is to shift the position of the taskbar previews up on the screen, so that the taskbar previews do not cover the helpful information at the bottom of application windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm not aware of any setting, but I know a nifty little freeware utility from The Windows Club that will do exactly what you ask. Info and download from here:&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this fixes the issue for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            Thanks for this info, BearPup.
<div><br />
<div>I'm not sure if I'll try this third party tool or not. &nbsp;This could be useful for me, but I'm often hesitant about installing third party tools from developers that I'm not familiar with.</div>
<div><br />
<div>(What would be great is if there were standard Windows registry keys that could accomplish the same thing as this program.)</div>

            <p>Hello Jeremiah,</p>
<p>I understand your reluctance to download unknown apps from unknown developers. The Windows Club is a site that's been around for many years with a solid reputation. I use several of their apps on my computer, including a variation of the one I recommended
 to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously its your choice, but I wouldn't recommend them unless they were safe and reliable - my reputation here in the Community demands that!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know what you decide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            <p><span>Hi BearPup,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks again for this info, and for your endorsement of The Windows Club.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After a bit more research, I found additional endorsements of Kishan's Windows 7 Taskbar Thumbnail Customizer app, which is great.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, though, I found a site that lists the registry settings that can accomplish the same thing as Kishan's app. &nbsp;That doesn't take anything away from his app, but gives
 people another option to effect those changes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here's another link which mentions Kishan's app:</span></p>
<p><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/14442/increase-the-size-of-taskbar-preview-thumbnails-in-windows-7/</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And here's a link which lists the registry settings that can be used to accomplish the same thing:</span></p>
<p><span>http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/increase-taskbar-thumbnail-preview-size-windows-7</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>--------</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><u><span>Unfortunately</span></u><span>, it looks like none of this is going
 to actually fully accomplish what I'm looking to do.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>That is, neither Kishan's Windows 7 Taskbar Thumbnail Customizer app nor the corresponding registry settings fully address my question.</span></p>
<p><span>Specifically, with either Kishan's app or the BottomMarginPx registry setting, I can increase the bottom margin, effectively moving the taskbar preview images up higher on
 the screen. &nbsp;<u><span>BUT</span></u>, the taskbar preview area itself does not move up. &nbsp;So, that taskbar preview area still covers the information at the bottom of the screen that I want to see. &nbsp;Even with the
 lowest color intensity setting (Control Panel\Appearance and Personalization\Personalization\Window Color and Appearance), I still can't read words that are under the taskbar preview area margin, and being able to read those words is the central purpose of
 my question.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What I really want is to move the&nbsp;<u><span>entire taskbar preview area</span></u>&nbsp;up on the screen, not simply the thumbnail
 images that are inside it. &nbsp;If anyone knows of other registry settings or config (or even a third party app) that could do that, please let me know. &nbsp;I have not found that yet, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, so I am still holding out hope that
 it does.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Jeremiah</span></p>

            <p>Hello Jeremiah,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post - you've obviously done a lot of work on this, and I appreciate your passing the info onto me. I also want to apologize that I didn't fully understand what you are trying to accomplish. I thought the whole point was to move the images
 off the Taskbar, and not move the Taskbar itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In furtherance of your quest, 3 sites that might be able to help - I've posted at all three and feel they are good and safe sites to use. They are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Computing.net - <a href="http://www.computing.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.computing.net/</a>&nbsp;;</p>
<p>Bleeping Computer - <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com</a> ; and</p>
<p>Tom's Hardware - <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tomshardware.com/</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck to you. Let me know how you fare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi BearPup,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again for your help with this, and for your list of additional sites for further reference.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just a minor point of clarification: &nbsp;My aim is <u>not</u>&nbsp;to move the Taskbar itself. &nbsp;My aim
<u>is</u> to move the preview images off the Taskbar; but, my aim is not just to move the preview images themselves off the Taskbar, but rather to move the
<u>entire preview images area</u>&nbsp;(including the "frame" around the preview images) off the Taskbar. &nbsp;That's a subtle, but important, difference, one which I was not aware of when I first posted my question. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The image at the following link shows a mockup screenshot of what I am looking to accomplish:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=99C9AE6CB51B5CEE!127&amp;authkey=!AIWQAxze5OFexb8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=99C9AE6CB51B5CEE!127&amp;authkey=!AIWQAxze5OFexb8</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>In that mockup, the red line with arrows on each end shows the space that I am looking to add between the
<u>Taskbar</u>&nbsp;and the <u>Taskbar preview images area</u>.</div>

            <p>Hello Jeremiah,</p>
<p>Nice work - your image is what I've imagined you wanted, I just thought that the taskbar thumbnail customizer would do that. But apparently not. The only other thought that I can offer is to write to the author of that utility, explain what you want, and
 see if it can be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if I can do anything else.</p>

<p>Vedo che se questo problema è presente anche nel terzo capitolo incomincio a pensare che a quelli della Epic non gli interessi più di tanto risolverlo anzi non hanno fatto proprio niente</p>

<h2>            Xbox one X stuck&#47;froze during shut down</h2>
                    <p>hey everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>first i want to say ive had my one x for like 4-5 months never had any power issues with it untill today</p>
<p>when i got done playing i went to settings to do a full shut down cause i was going to bed (my settings is on energy savings not instant on)</p>
<p>normally it will take a few seconds for it to shut down this time it like froze my screen it was black which is normal it does this before shutting down completely but the light on the power button stayed lid and the console fans stayed on for over an half
 hour and it still didnt shut down so what i did was i held the power button to power cycle it (can this hurt the console btw? ive only done it once ) after it was forced shut down i turned it back on and it was working fine again...</p>
<p>has anyone seen this issue before?&nbsp;</p>
<p>also is it bad for my console to hold the powerbutton to force shut down? i had no choice tho</p>
                </div>

<p>Doing a forced shutdown/holding the button until it powers down is fine when it's locked up and is unable to self correct. It's the same thing you do when a PC totally locks up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't have your console set to auto update, make sure you are running the latest version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the lock up repeats you might contact support. at 4-5 months you should still be under warranty&nbsp;</p>

            Make sure your console is updated by turning on auto update, if this keeps happening, contact support because your console should still be under warranty, and no, a hard reset is not a bad thing 😊

            No not bad at all. It happens at time. A fresh unplug always works...youll be ok. Only time I dont do it is during system updates.

<p>If it occurs again make sure you report it using long press of the Nexus button, choose Report a Problem.</p>
<p>You can still report a problem right after the console restarts.</p>

<h2>            Family time limits and ways to override</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I currently have time restrictions setup for a family member, both total time per day, as well as hours of usage on a XBOX one system.&nbsp; If that family member were to somehow get the parent member password and successfully request more more time, would that
 override the time limits and hours allowed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            The parent account has access to screen time limits. If you are the parent, I would suggest you set a strong password and never allow your child access to it.

            Family time limits make sense only if you do not share a parent password with your kids. Anyone with parent login details can override the time limits. You should never share your password with anyone.

<p>If they have the password, they have full access. Changing the password to something hard to guess or use is suggested.</p>
<p>Write down the password maybe and save it to a notes app on your phone could help.<br />

<p>Thanks Nozzle,</p>
<p>Further to this, is there any logging available on the XBOX One that would allow me (parent) to see when my PIN was used to extend screen time hours by any other family member?</p>

<p>There is no way to specifically see when an account was used for extending a screen time limit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can however see the general sign in activity of your account if you sign in on
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com</a> and then in the top menu click on "Security", and on the Security website, click on the activity tile to see your account's sign in activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your problem, I wouldn't let the kid access your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please change your account's pin on the console, and also go to <a href="https://account.live.com/Proofs/Manage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/Proofs/Manage</a> and change the password of your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While on the account security proofs managing page, also enable Two Step Verification and set up the free Authenticator App on your smartphone if you have one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That way, whenever someone tries to sign in with your account on a new device that you haven't set as a trusted device yet, they are asked for a secret code number that only the authenticator app on your phone can provide, or depending on your phone, you
 might get a request to allow the sign in process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That way you keep your kid locked out of your account, and they can't override their play time limit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the kid has your account password or access to your account, it's like putting a lock on the cookie jar, and giving your kid the key to the lock, telling them to not to try to take cookies and to not use the key, because you locked the jar.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By giving your kids access to your account, you are defeating the purpose of the family settings and child restrictions mechanisms on Xbox Live.&nbsp;</p>

            Other ways to override them is just by signing in with or creating a new account.&nbsp; If they do that, screen&nbsp;time limits do not affect them.

<p>Thank you Animator,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me give some back story on this and you will understand where I am coming from here.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, I have never, nor do I ever share my password or PIN to my children ever.&nbsp; I do have the authentication app.&nbsp; So here is my issue presently:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: left">6 months ago: I had total screen time limits set for my son, as well as hours allowed specifically for the xbox one.&nbsp; So for Monday-Thursday total time allowed was 1 hour, from 8am to 8pm.&nbsp; I had weekly reporting turned on.&nbsp; After
 some time, both my wife and I noticed that he was on his xbox for much monger than we expected based on those limits set.&nbsp; As well the weekly email indicated he was using it more than the hours set.&nbsp; So more than 1 hour.&nbsp; We confronted him, and he admitted
 that he was able to guess my PIN (not my account password string) on the XBOX one.&nbsp; So his limit would approach and you can extend it 2 ways, an email to the parent to approve, or inputting the PIN of the parent.&nbsp; He put my PIN in and extended it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">Ok so he got in trouble, nothing too serious here, just loosing privilege of an xbox for a couple days.&nbsp; I changed my PIN on the XBOX one.&nbsp; Ok back to normal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">Ok fast forward to present.&nbsp; I have noticed that again over the last 2 weeks, his screen time played reported by the weekly email does not match the set limits.&nbsp; So Mon-Thursday hes been reported at 2 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">we confronted him again, however this time there was no admission of guilt, and he steadfastly denies using my PIN or being able to guess it..&nbsp; So I have done the following:</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">1.) removed my PIN altogether from the XBOX one.&nbsp; so when I sign in, it asks for my full password.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">2.) changed the xbox one signin to "lock down"</p>
<p style="text-align: left">3.) changed my Microsoft account password.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">4.) removed guest access altogether.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">I am really just trying to figure out the discrepancy between what Microsoft sends in the report, versus I am pretty darn sure of the fact that he still did not know my pin prior to removing the pin.</p>
<p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">

<p>Hey Nub1,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, you won't be able to see exact details&nbsp;of how long they were logged in. However, you will be able to&nbsp;see genera login activity, time, and location&nbsp;on your security&nbsp;tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To combat your issue, however, you could enable&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12408/microsoft-account-how-to-use-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">2-Step verification.</a> When you log in it will require a second
 means to confirm your&nbsp;identity&nbsp;such as your personal phone or personal email. So if they do log in&nbsp;you will get a text with a pin to authorize your sign-in. A dead giveaway someone else is attempting to access your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you could always enable 2-Step and he won't be able to access your account with the pin sent via a phone or email. Granted your&nbsp;email is protected and they do not use your phone as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have deleted a user account and all the files attached to that user are gone, can the files be recovered?&nbsp; Sceniario:&nbsp; User was trying to load new software.&nbsp; Got a message saying someone was already logged onto the computer.&nbsp; This confused the user
 so the disk was removed, the computer shut down and booted up again.&nbsp; The user (also admin) went into Admin settings and selected to delete the user accounts.&nbsp; The user thought this would prevent the above message when loading that software.&nbsp; Before the delete
 user account was done, a message came up asking if the user wanted to make a copy of all user account files on the desktop.&nbsp; The user said yes and completed the deletion.&nbsp; However, when the user opened the folders on the desktop, they were empty.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I clean a Microsoft Wireless Mouse 5000</h2>
                    <p>The mouse (and keyboard) have worked perfectly for the last four years but today the mouse scroll function is beginning to fail and I suspect the failure is due to debris inside the housing.</p>
<p>1. Should I attempt to disassemble and clean &amp; if so, do you have instructions ?</p>
<p>2. Should I remove the batteries and give it a good soak in Isopropyl Alcohol or other reccommended fluid ?</p>
<p>3. Other reccomendations ?</p>
<p>4. If I purchase a replacement mouse, will it pair with the existing transceiver ?</p>

<p>Cleaned the bits I could get to with isopropyl alchohol, but then the rubber ring stretched and would intermittently grab and release probably due to loss of aromatics.</p>

    <title>Unwanted Search Engine Removal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> james r_760  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unwanted Search Engine Removal</h2>
                    <p>I have run into a serious problem with an unknown search engine taking over my explorer, Firefox, Opera browser. Every time I try to type into my search engine ( whether it's Bing, Google, or yahoo) this toolbar appears at the bottom ( or top of explorer)
 and takes over. I have tried everything I know of to get rid of it. No unknown programs appear in my control panel uninstall. I am running Norton 360 2013 and have run all scans possible ( including their erase scan) without results. I have also tried running
 software such as Spybot,malware, registry cleaners, etc. without results. I'm at a loss to find a solution. Many web-sites for spyware describe the problem but running their software doesn't work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It appears this is also affecting my start search, so it is much more than a browser problem.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
Can anyone HELP?<br />

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft community forums and thank you for posting the question. As per the description, you need help in removing the browser redirect infection while using the search engine. Let’s perform few steps and try to resolve the issue.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
1. Are you able to browse other websites? Is this issue confined only while using search engines?
<br />
2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>3. What is the name of the toolbar that appears while using the search engines?
<br />
4. Which is the version of Internet Explorer that you are using? </span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><b>Method 1: </b></p>
&nbsp;
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b><span> Check if the issue persists in Safe Mode with Networking.</span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode starts </span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span> with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start
</span><span><span>Windows</span></span><span> are installed.</span></p>
<p><span>Safe Mode with Networking starts </span><span><span><span>Windows</span></span></span><span><span> in safe mode and includes the network drivers and services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Refer this link to boot into Safe Mode:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Start your computer in safe mode<br />
<br />
</span></b><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u><span><span>ht<span>tp://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-comp<span>u<span>ter-in-safe-mode</span></span></span></span></span></u></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer this link for more information:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: <br />
</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check if the issue persists in no add-ons mode. Also try the remaining steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
<strong>How to optimize Internet Explorer <br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213/ro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213/ro</a><br />
<br />
<b>Note:</b> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that
 you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 2</b><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run online virus scan using Microsoft safety scanner.<br />
<br />
<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
<br />
<b>Note: </b>When you perform online virus scan<b> </b>you will lose some data that is affected by virus. Microsoft is not responsible for such data loss.<br />
<br />
<b>Also refer: </b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Fix your hijacked web browser<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/browser-hijacking.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/pc-security/browser-hijacking.aspx</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Please note that running Reset Internet Explorer Settings will reset all user-defined settings including those set by installed extensions, toolbars and other add-ons to IE Defaults. This includes all Security, Privacy and
 Zone settings. Also this will clear browsing history, delete all temporary Internet Files, cookies, form data and especially all stored passwords.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please reply with the status so that we could help you further.

Thanks for the reply. I haven't tried your suggestions yet but wanted to answer your questions:<br />
<br />
1. Yes, I am able to browse other web-sites. The search bar sometimes appears when I try to fill in a
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; web form. A search toolbar appears, when I click the (X) it disappears but letters on my browser
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start to flash - sometimes a full screen comes up with the search bar on to; I have to press&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Control/Alt/Delete) to get task manager to end the program.<br />
2. The only change I can think of was installing a APC power back-up - I tried to install their software
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; it was causing problems with windows 7 so I uninstalled it.<br />
3. The only name that appears on the screen and in Task Manager is " Search Results".<br />
4. I use Internet Explorer 9.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>I tried all the suggestions nothing works. In fact, when I just tried to write to you the bar came up and stole my writing to it's box. I had to X it out to get rid of it. The Microsoft scan came up with nothing as did all the others. Safe mode doesn't help
 because it doesn't happen all the time. </p>
<p>&nbsp;I'm at a real loss here.</p>

            My problem is the same as James R_760 except that now it is 2015 and my O.S. is Windows 10. My Web browser is Edge and my Windows&nbsp;Explorer has the same problem. I dare not open Chrome because the whole mess up&nbsp;seems to have started there! I have Norton
 360 Premier and ran Power Eraser, partially resolving some problems&nbsp; but the on my Microsoft Edge I cannot as yet move, it has frozen the browser and it won't close. Fortunately I can open new a new page on the browser! I have also just completed a full scan
 with Norton and as I am in the process of writing I haven't tried to close it again. The search engine presents itself as "<strong>istartsurf"
</strong>and as I've said it wont be eliminated or allow the browser to be closed - what can I do?

            Since this is a specific software issue rather than a Windows 10 issue, I feel you should go to the MSDN Forum for Expression Encoder, you will probably get a much faster solution to your problem there -

            Your camera most likely uses Bluetooth to do that. Could you make sure Bluetooth is configured properly?
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />

<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />Use the Add Bluetooth wizard in Control Panel
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control printers
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click Add device then add the Bluetooth device again.
<br />
<br />Have you checked for updated chipset drivers for your make and model?
<br />Also, some manufacturers will provide separate Bluetooth drivers.

<br />Under the General tab
<br />Click in the Startup type: listbox
<br />Choose Automatic
<br />Click Start

<br />Select the driver tab, click Rollback if its not grayed out.
<br />
<br />If it is grayed out, right click Bluetooth driver then click uninstall
<br />Restart your computer then check if its working again.
<br />
<br />If not, remove any other Bluetooth devices since they might be causing interference .
<br />
<br />You can also try pairing through Devices and Printers. Learn more:

<p>Andre thanks it seems a little less complicated. I am actually now getting to the stage of it asking for a password "security: WPA2-PSK (AES)" on the camera.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now i believe that to be my router modem password which i have and I know off by heart. I type that in and it says incorrect password.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It is actually finding my camera and the camera is finding the laptop. Partial success but they wont connect</strong></p>
<p>I also try to access it via a pin method. The camera gives me a pin code. The laptop finds the camera, I type in the pin code to the laptopwhere requested and I hit next on the camera and it times out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now the Bluetooth doesn't always find the camera, I now believe this to be the issue. I go to add a device choose the last option Xbox everything else and sometimes it comes up. sometimes it doesn't. I refresh and if I'm lucky I find it. So now maybe it
 is a Bluetooth driver, thoughts?????&nbsp; I have located the camera now on numerous occasions so again it is purely now a connection issue</p>
<p>Any thoughts welcome of course</p>
<p>Thx Mark</p>

<h2>            How to speed up windows 8.1 without reinstalling the operating system</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if you have any explanations, in laymen's terms, as to how to speed up a windows 8.1 computer without doing a reinstall of the operating system. Although Windows 8.1 makes it easy to reinstall the operating system by using a recovery partition
 and resetting the C drive with the files on the recovery partition, this method is a little more drastic and shouldn't have to be done all that frequently just to keep the computer fast. So I was wondering if any of you had any ideas. I should mention that
 I have done some internet research on the subject. Here's what I do on a regular basis to try to maintain the computer's speed. Let me know if I should change/improve anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically what I do is use CCleaner to delete the temp files, log files, error reporting files etc. similar to a windows disk cleanup except it goes further with that concept and deletes more than disk cleanup. This application is free too by the way and
 highly recommended by lots of computer experts. After that, then I manually delete files in the temp folder, the %temp% folder, and the prefetch folders. Then I delete the recycle bin. Then I optimize my solid state drive which is actually trimming the drive
 rather than doing a defragment whicih would be bad on an SSD. Then I run malwarebytes and windows defender antivirus to make sure no malware is slowing the computer down. I also disable unwanted startup programs. And I always look at the task manager performance
 tab to make sure no programs are taking up all the resources. I restart the computer reasonably frequently, a few times a week. And I make sure I keep enough free disk space by uninstalling unwanted programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above description is basically all I do to maintain the computer. Am I on track? Or is there something else you'd recommend. I'm wondering why my computer acts likes it's okay and reasonably quick one moment, and then in another moment it is inconsistent
 and starts actiing slowly. This has got me to wondering if I should use CCleaner's registry cleaner which may make the computer more stable. But I've heard mixed reviews on registry cleaners. So any other ideas I can try to speed up windows 8.1 with answers
 in laymen's terms?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tim.</p>

            <p>You're doing a lot of things that probably have no effect on general speed issues, such as cleaning up disk space (unless you're low on disk space to begin with).&nbsp; Because "slow" is subjective, it's hard to say what might be causing your issues from this
 distance.&nbsp; You don't mention what kind of CPU you have, how much RAM, whether you're using a dedicated video card (and RAM), what types of programs you run, etc., all of which can have an effect on speed.&nbsp; More information would be good.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response. I did method 1 as you describe and it found no issues in the maintenance troubleshooter. I've done that troubleshooter a few times in the past too, and it found nothing. That's probably because I try to maintain my computer. But
 I may not be doing everything correctly or perfectly either though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I looked at method 2. I went to the link you gave and I saw a couple links. I don't have any problems with windows update. I hardly installed anything on the hard drive and even uninstalled a few things that came with the computer that I didn't use,
 so free space is not an issue as I have plenty. Although it did recommend to use disk cleanup to delete unneeded files, and I have done CCleaner utility wihch does that same thing. It also recommended to optimize the drives which I appreciate, and have actually
 made sure to do myself. Everytime I delete something I try to optimize the solid state drive so that it empties the memory cells and keeps it running well. The next tip about power plans might be reasonable. I know if you set the power plan to "high performance"
 then it might increase speed. However, I've had a fast computer at the HP recommended power plan setting, and didn't need high performance for that. So I'm used to it being on HP recommended. It's possible that it might increase the speed a little to be on
 high performance, but that doesn't get to the heart of what might be causing the problem in the operating system or on the hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is to try to get to the heart as to why computers slow down over time from the time they're new due to regular use, installing and uninstalling of apps. Most articles I've read indicate that there's lots of junk from regular use and temp files
 that slow down the computer over time. And when you install and uninstall apps, remnants of those programs will be left in the registry making the computer unstable and slower than it was when it was new. I know that the best fix is to reinstall the operating
 system. But I don't want to have to do that too often, and I've been researching ways to maintain the computer so gets rid of all the junk that accumulates with use and keeps it fast. Even microsoft has admitted that clearing the temporary files leads to an
 increase in speed of the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas. I'm guessing you're looking at all the things windows has built in to try to troubleshoot itself. Do you know of any free third party utilities that might do the job well of maintaining the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tim.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi. Even microsoft says clearing out the temporary files on the hard drive (by disk cleanup or CCleaner) increases the speed of the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I say "slow" I mean two things. One is how quickly the computer turns on and off, and how quickly the applications load. Second, is how quickly the internet browser works. And my browser used to be much quicker even with the same internet speed I have
 now, whereas now it's slower. That leads me to believe that it has something to do with the computer. I know the condition of the hard drive has a lot to do with how quickly applications load and how quickly it turns on or shuts off the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give you more information, my CPU is an Intel i7 quad core 2.5 ghz (turbo to 3.5 ghz) processor, with 16 GB of RAM and a 256 gb solid state drive. My video graphics is Intel 4600 graphics. I didn't require the extra expense of getting a dedicated graphics
 card since I don't do demanding games. The types of programs I run are, America Online software, Microsoft word, malwarebytes, CClearner, Iobit uninstaller to help properly uninstall apps, and a chess game that I installed. These are the only things I really
 installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that there are many people selling registry cleaners singing their praises. However, Ccleaner I spoke of is highly praised from several tech websites, and it's free there's not a vested interest in profits. It cleans junk on the PC and also has
 a registry cleaner. I tried to use the registry cleaner once, but before I did it I created a manual restore point. Then I tried the cleaner. I got a little paranoid, so I just restored it back to the restore point to before I even used the registry cleaner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I hope you can help now that I gave you more information.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sincerely,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tim.</p>

<p>I think my machine is running okay with applications sometimes loading slower than normal and a little bit slower internet browsing speed. However i have noticed a clear decline in performance from when I did the Factory Reset and now after regular use,
 installing, and uninstalling apps. I've also noticed a little bit longer startup time compared to when it was new. Little things like that bother me, and I want to do the maintenance required to get rid of the junk that slows the computer down over time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something you said was interesting to me when you talked about creating a system image to refresh the PC. After I reset the computer to factory settings and after I reinstall all the software, i immeidately create a system restore point so I can restore
 the computer back to that point if need be. However, restore points don't last long and eventually go away. So would this system image as a way to refresh the computer be something that would not go away with time? Like once you create the image, is it permanent
 so that as months go by it will still be there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, somewhere I read that when you create a system image and use that to refresh the PC, that it might get rid of my recovery partition already installed on the computer. Let me be clear, I don't want to do anything to get rid of the recovery partition.
 And I want to be able to restore the computer using the recovery partition instead of the system image only if I need to. So if I create a system image will that take the place of the recovery partition? And if I use the system image to refresh the PC, will
 the recovery partition not be able to be used to refresh the computer in the future?</p>
<p>
</p><p>That thought interests me, but I don't want to screw anything up or prevent the recovery partition from properly doing the recovery in the future.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So would creating a system image and refreshing the pc by doing that, cause the recovery partition to not work to restore the computer anymore? I read that somewhere I think. I want to make sure I don't do anything to ruin the recovery partition that came
 with the computer, and if a system image does not interfere with that in any way then it might be useful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other dieas?<br />

<h2>            no printer listed in device mamager</h2>
                    I&nbsp;have a hp wireless c4580 printer that wont print. Gone through the list of answers that someone kindly gave me, but to no avail. I went on device manager, looked under ports. &nbsp;And nothing. This is so frustrating, someone please help. Many thanks.

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It would be great if you could provide more information about your computer, like the Edition of Windows installed on the computer?</div>
<div>When was the last time the wireless printer worked correctly?</div>
<div>Was there any changes made to the computer recently?<br />
<div><br />
First we will try to uninstall the drivers for the printer from the computer.<br />
<br />
You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps. <br />
<div>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager. If you are prompted for an administrator
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Device Manager, locate the device, and then double-click the device name.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Driver tab, and then click Uninstall Driver and follow the instructions<br />
<br />
Here you may visit this below link and downlaod the complete version of the drivers for the device.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;product=3418707" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;product=3418707</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After downloading the driver you may install it and check if the issue gets fixed.<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists then you may follow these below steps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Open the Printer troubleshooter</strong><br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also visit this below link.</div>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply but my question is a little different.</p>
<p>Let me try to explain it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two monitors and use them both like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8cfb3cb5-c3f2-49d2-a4c9-80fb1b7144c1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8cfb3cb5-c3f2-49d2-a4c9-80fb1b7144c1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My question:</p>
<p>is it possible to have a&nbsp;separate desktop on my second monitor (or screen, this is how I call the "monitor" :) )? Like this</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7c16f7d-5e01-41b6-9993-1f830dc582c5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c7c16f7d-5e01-41b6-9993-1f830dc582c5" /></a></p>

 goes back to the original, unrotated version.&nbsp; How do I save the rotation?&nbsp;&nbsp; (using windows 8.1)&nbsp; thanks....

==========================================<br />
Are you rotating the video clip in Movie Maker? The<br />
video may not be fully compatible with Movie Maker.<br />
<br />
Anyway...did you try saving in the .WMV movie format?<br />
<br />
The following article may be worth a look:<br />
<br />
Shoot your video in the wrong orientation? Here's how to rotate it back<br />

<br />
<br />
Two freeware apps that can easily rotate a video clip:<br />
<br />
1) Freemake Video Converter<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

Freemake Free Video Converter (freeware)<br />
<a href="http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.freemake.com/free_video_converter/</a><br />
(Windows XP / Vista / 7 / 8)<br />
(***Choose the Custom installation and carefully<br />
read *all* the install screens...there may be some<br />
items you want to uncheck***)<br />
<br />
If a green Install button appears when you launch<br />
Freemake...you can ignore it and it should disappear<br />
when you import files.<br />

(XP SP3, Vista, 7, 8 and .Net Framework 2 SP2)<br />
(*You may want to uncheck the options to install the<br />

<br />
When you left click the download text you will be<br />

<h2>            Windows Update gets closed by Windows Data Execution Prevention</h2>
                    
<p>Running Windows XP Pro with SP3.&nbsp; Windows Update is set to notify me of new updates.</p>
<p>For the last two days, every time I switch on, a popup window appears saying</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Data Execution Prevention - Microsoft Windows.&nbsp; To help protect your computer, Windows has closed this program.&nbsp; Name: Windows Update.&nbsp; Publisher: Microsoft Corporation.</p>
<p>It gives me a "close window" button but if I click it it just reappears.&nbsp; The offending executable appears to be wuauctl.exe.</p>
<p>I've checked and the only wuauctl.exe on my system is where it ought to be, in \Windows\System32\, although there are also a lot of \Windows\pchealth\ErrorRep\UserDumps entries all dating from&nbsp;when I first encountered the problem.</p>
<p>What has gone wrong and what should I do about it?</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I would suggest that you make sure you have the <span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/949104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Latest Windows Update Agent</span></a>.&nbsp; If you do and are still getting the error then try the steps listed below.</span></p>
<p><span>If your computer is set to apply DEP to all programs and services, the DEP error message will have a
<strong>Change Settings</strong> button. If an update to the program is not available, follow these steps to add an exception for the program from the DEP error message:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>When you receive the error message , click <strong>Change Settings</strong>. </li><li>Click to select the check box next to the program, and then click <strong>Apply</strong>.
</li><li>When you are prompted to restart your computer, click <strong>OK</strong> two times, and then restart your system.
</li></ol>
<p><br />
You can also add an exception for the program by using <strong>System Properties</strong> in Control Panel. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Run</strong>, type <span>sysdm.cpl</span>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. </li><li>Click the <strong>Advanced </strong>tab, click <strong>Performance</strong>, and then click
<strong>Settings</strong>. </li><li>In<strong> Performance Options</strong>, click the <strong>Data Execution Prevention</strong> tab, and then click
<strong>Add</strong>. </li><li>In the <strong>Open </strong>dialog box, locate and then click the program. </li><li>Click <strong>Open</strong>, click <strong>Apply</strong>, and then click <strong>
OK</strong>. When you are prompted to restart your computer, click <strong>OK</strong>.
</li></ol>

<h2>            Players failed to load content</h2>
                    
<p>I have 2 machines that I use system linked regularly. I have bought and downloaded map packs for both Halo 3 and Halo Reach. I have downloaded them to both machines. The maps work fine on each machine but will NOT work when system linked. I get a message
 that says "Players failed to load content" and the maps only show in the list when I have my gamer tag signed in. Is there any way to play them without buying them for each player?</p>

<p>nope only 1 copy of the said purchased dlc can be used at a time as the dlc associated to the purchased console can use it offline and the console that is not the purchasing console has to have the original gamertag be connected to live</p>
<p>the only way to use it on 2 consoles is to have 1 console signed into live and the other console has to be the purchasing console. or purchase another copy of the dlc with another account</p>

<p>So, without purchasing it again, there is no way to use the new maps for offline, system linked games? With the system link cable connected there is no way to connect to the internet cable is there?</p>

<p>You can only use the content offline on the console the content was purchased on first. Every other console you downloaded the content to will have to be signed into xbox live with the gamertag that purchased the content with.</p>

<h2>            Headphones not working</h2>
                    Randomly while using my computer, when I plug in my headphones the computer will act like they're not there and continue playing through the speakers. I've tried disabling and re-enabling my audio drivers, updating them, and several other things suggested
 by other posts, but the only thing that works is resetting the computer, and then they work fine for a bit before failing again. I shouldn't have to restart my computer every time I plug in headphones.

<p>There may be some problem in headphones too like the type of jack and the version they are supportable too. But if thatsnot the problem then you can troubleshoot by clicking on the play audio and run the troubleshoot option. I think it will help.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>No more sound&#58; Windows 8 dectected a Nvidia HD audio problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dpm2009  say:</h3>
<h2>            No more sound&#58; Windows 8 dectected a Nvidia HD audio problem</h2>
                    <p>After starting up my machine today, Windows 8 detected a problem with the Nvidia HD audio driver&nbsp; (version 306.97 32-bit). Its automatic fix did not work. There was no log entry available of a driver conflict for instance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My machine was upgraded from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 8 Pro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was unable to solve this issue and tried the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Re-installation of the&nbsp;HD audio drivers only.</li><li>Re-installation of the complete NVIDIA driver set.</li><li>Installation of the NVIDIA drivers in windows 7 compatibility mode. After I did that, I was&nbsp;no longer able to uninstall the NVIDIA drivers or install another version of the driver. When trying to&nbsp;install or uninstall I got stuck with a message that the
 system required a restart even after a reboot.</li></ul>
<p>A complete image restore of my previous Windows 8 system was the only option left, but this is always a method of last resort. I have no guarantees that this problem will not occur again in future.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do next time to solve this issue if it occurs again?</p>

            <p>Hi,
</p>
<p>Thanks for asking! As I understand, you are facing issue with the sound in Windows 8.</p>
<p>Have you updated the drivers?</p>
<p>If not, I would suggest you to download the latest drivers from the Manufacturer’s website and update the drivers.</p>
<p><b>Method:</b></p>
<p>Follow these steps and run the audio troubleshooter, check if it helps.</p>
<p>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Press “<b>Windows Key + R</b>”, type <b>Control Panel</b>.</p>
<p>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Then type “<b>Troubleshooter</b>” in the Search box and hit enter.</p>
<p>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Select “<b>Hardware and Sound</b>” from the Troubleshooter Window.</p>
<p>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Select “<b>Playing Audio Troubleshooter</b>”.</p>
<p>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Follow the On Screen instructions.</p>
<p>Reply back with the results, I would be glad to assist you further.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. I'll keep the Troubleshooter in mind, although I suspect I already used it before and it did not solve the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's hope it won't happen again. My sound is back after a image restore.</p>

    <title>New Laptop keeps NUM LOCK on every reboot - tried changing in - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            New Laptop keeps NUM LOCK on every reboot - tried changing in BIOS&#47;Registry</h2>
                    <p>Hey Everyone,</p>
<p>First time using Microsoft Answers, hopefully someone can help.<br />
</p>
<p>Recently our company purchased a Fujitsu T901 laptop. Wiped the Windows 7 Prof&nbsp;it came with and reimaged it with our companys image Windows 7 Enterprise.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The image works great with all devices, whether a desktop or laptop. Never had any issues til this particular brand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everytime we start the computer, after the Starting Windows screen. The NUM LOCK light comes on. Its becomes tedious when typing in a password, because I forget to turn off NUM LOCK and type my password in. Then I have to turn it off, input my password again
 and then log in. Every reboot/logoff, this problem persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spoke with Fujitsu customer service. They said once you log in with a profile and log out. That particular profile will remember if you choose to have NUM LOCK on/off. Everytime I log out, I had NUM LOCK off... When I reboot, its back on again. The woman
 said it worked for her (apparently she had that very same laptop in front of her when troubleshooting) She said it might have something to do with Enterprise, so that's when I thanked her for my time and researched the issue some more online.<br />
</p>
<p>I also went into the BIOS under Advanced Settings and had NUM LOCK off. Same results.</p>
<p>I also went to the REGEDIT:<br />
HKEY_USERS\.Default\Control Panel\Keyboard<br />
<br />
And made sure the variable was set to 0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surprise still no luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts or ideas would be great. Thanks!</p>
<p>-J</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Since it’s a new laptop having this issue, you may have to continually seek assistance with the hardware
 manufacturer, in this case, Fujitsu. If they still are not able to come to a solution, they should contact their work IT department, who created the system image that is on the laptop. This may be some sort of strange global policy setting that was created
 by the IT department and cannot be changed</span></p>

            We wiped their system image with one of ours. No global policies or group policies that would conflict with this were created.
