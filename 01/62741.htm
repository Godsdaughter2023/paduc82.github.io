                    <p>Still getting error after rolling back to previous graphics driver, here's the dmp file in debugger. Haven't had much luck in finding cause, looks like HDAudBus issue. . .&nbsp;</p>

DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION (133)
The DPC watchdog detected a prolonged run time at an IRQL of DISPATCH_LEVEL
or above.
Arguments:
Arg1: 0000000000000000, A single DPC or ISR exceeded its time allotment. The offending
	component can usually be identified with a stack trace.
Arg2: 0000000000000501, The DPC time count (in ticks).
Arg3: 0000000000000500, The DPC time allotment (in ticks).
Arg4: fffff801c9ef3378, cast to nt!DPC_WATCHDOG_GLOBAL_TRIAGE_BLOCK, which contains

            Hi maniacalmichael
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.       
        </p>

            Hi Maniacal Michael, from reading that dump, it seems to be your Audio card device diver that is causing the crashes, however,  to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Text posted doesn't provide opportunity to run various commands to get to root cause. It is not about opening minidump in WinDBG but doing stack analysis by running commands. 
<br />
<br />A. Analysis Results
<br />
<br />File Name: 021519-12500-01.dmp
<br />DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION (133)
<br />IMAGE_NAME:  HDAudBus.sys
<br />
<br />B. Third Party Drivers
<br />
<br />None
<br />
<br />C. Recommendations
<br />
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />Type restore point in Cortana Search &gt; Create a Restore point &gt; Check whether against your drive, Protection is ON or not. If not ON, click Configure button below to Make it ON &gt; Now press Create to create a restore point 
<br />
<br />2.  Most of the time, third party drivers are the cause of BSODs. To know if a driver is one of the causes - Enable Driver Verifier and generate dump files and upload to Onedrive and share the link here (Don't forget to turn off Driver Verifier after the job is done). Do read the instructions carefully particularly how to get back into Windows when you get the crash.

            Hi Maniacal Michael
<br />
<br />Yes, it is your Audio device driver causing the problems . . .
<br />
<br />You should uninstall the audio driver/software you are currently using, then go to the support page for your PC, then download and install the Audio driver/software they recommend, that may be an older version, but it will be compatible . . .

            Issue seems to be occurring randomly, did what you suggested above, still haven't had BSOD &amp; have done no changes to driver configuration. Sorry to lash out regarding dmp file. Today the BSOD occurred as soon as I booted up my computer and started playing
 a game. Just now tried stressing out the drivers with the same game &amp; driver verifier running, nothing bad happened other than sluggishness of response which is expected with verifier. Notes on the verifier page say to not leave it running more than 48 hours,
 since this morning is the first time for a BSOD in 2 or 3 days, curious if I should leave the verifier running longer.

<h2>            Tracking receipts and store purchases in the win app store</h2>
                    I'm setting up a display screen for work, using the touch features of Win 8. After setting up the account and billing info, including email details, i've made an app purchase, which went through fine. Unfortuantly i've not received any receipt for tax
 purposes to either email account listed.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to track purchases, and print a receipt from within either the store itself or from the website portal?<br />
<br />

<h2>            Identifying the com port number of a USB connected device in Windows 7</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7 64 bit on a ThinkPad laptop. I have an external device plugged in to a USB Port and need to know what com port number it is assign so I can point the program I am using at the device. When I go to the Device Manager it lists the
 device in "Portable Devices" with no port number. When I look at the device Properties it has the location as on UMBus Enumerator. How can I get the com port number the device has been assigned?

<p>After recovering the document, you might want to review your backup philosophy. If this file was created two weeks ago then it should have made it to your external backup disk a long time ago. Lots of people ignore the need to keep a copy of their important
 files until the suffer a major catastrophe. Yours is minor by comparison - this time.</p>

Palcouk,
<div>I downloaded the program you linked me and first I did a quic scan. It found 2 infected programs so I deleted them, it didn't solve anything.</div>
<div>So then I decided to do a full scan. When the scan was almost done, it scanned really slowly so I walked away from my PC (at the time it had found 5 infected files). Later, when I walked back to my PC, the screen was black and there was a white text which
 said something like this:</div>
<div>'Reboot system or insert proper boot device, press any key to continue'. Do you have any other solutions?</div>

Hello there,<br />
Please also consider performing scan using superantispyware:<br />
http://www.superantispyware.com/<br />
<br />
If above failed to solve your problem then consider performing clean boot.<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us<br />
It involves disabling all start up programs and none windows services through msconfig (type in windows search in start menu) then restart your PC see if that make a difference?<br />
if it did then you will need find out which program or service is causing the problem!<br />
<br />
For now try all above and let me know about the results!<br />

Amiroof,
<div>I've done all of the things you said and this is what happened:</div>
<div><br />
<div>I downloaded the program you linked me, and did a quick scan. I deleted all the bad files but with no result. Then I did a full scan. It found some bad files again so I deleted all of them.</div>
<div>But when I restarted my PC in normal mode, something weird happened. I started it up, and after a while, all icons on my desktop dissapeared except the recycle bin (which actually had the name 'recycle bin' instead of the dutch name 'vuilnisbak' which
 it was before).</div>
<div>When I clicked google chrome in my menu bar, it said that it wasn't able to find the file and if I wanted to delete that item out of the menu bar. I can't imagine that this a hard drive problem since I am able to access all my files in safe mode.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So then I did a clean boot. That worked succesfully. Then I only enabled the windows services but then my PC did the same thing as I said in my original question. Does this mean that a windows service is causing all my problems?</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For programs that you are facing problems consider repairing installation or re install them or reset to their default settings.</p>
<p>For Windows, Go to safe mode or in normal mode&nbsp;then run cmd (Command prompt)&nbsp;run as admin through windows search&nbsp;then type sfc /scannow</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This should fix most problems caused by malware, spyware etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Also perform scan using Hitman Pro</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.surfright.nl/en/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.surfright.nl/en/downloads/</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>to make sure that your system is clean. Remove any thing it finds using free trial. No need to install.<br />
</p>
<p>Also consider checking your disc for errors. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please try all above see if it make any difference??</p>

Unfortunately, none of these solutions worked. The programs you linked me didn't find anything. But I think you understand me wrong. I went to the post you linked me where someone had all of his desktop icons dissapear. That's not what happens to me. The whole
 screen turns black and the only thing I can do is to press ctrl+alt+del so that the message said in my original post pops up, meaning I can do nothing.

Hello there,<br />
Please also consider performing scan using superantispyware:<br />
http://www.superantispyware.com/<br />
<br />
If above failed to solve your problem then consider performing clean boot.<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us<br />
It involves disabling all start up programs and none windows services through msconfig (type in windows search in start menu) then restart your PC see if that make a difference?<br />
if it did then you will need find out which program or service is causing the problem!<br />
<br />
For now try all above and let me know about the results!<br />
</blockquote>
Amiroof,
<div>I've done all of the things you said and this is what happened:</div>
<div><br />
<div>I downloaded the program you linked me, and did a quick scan. I deleted all the bad files but with no result. Then I did a full scan. It found some bad files again so I deleted all of them.</div>
<div>But when I restarted my PC in normal mode, something weird happened. I started it up, and after a while, all icons on my desktop dissapeared except the recycle bin (which actually had the name 'recycle bin' instead of the dutch name 'vuilnisbak' which
 it was before).</div>
<div>When I clicked google chrome in my menu bar, it said that it wasn't able to find the file and if I wanted to delete that item out of the menu bar. I can't imagine that this a hard drive problem since I am able to access all my files in safe mode.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So then I did a clean boot. That worked succesfully. Then I only enabled the windows services but then my PC did the same thing as I said in my original question. Does this mean that a windows service is causing all my problems?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please reply as quick as possible.</div>

Sorry if above did not help as I misunderstood your case. <br />
Only other thing I can think is to check device manager in the safe mode. Check all your drivers for danger signs and make sure they are working properly.<br />
Also make sure that the hidden devices are also working properly. You can view them using view menu in device manager then select show hidden devices..... after that check the none plug and play devices for danger signs and uninstall any driver with danger
 sign. After you did all of them then restart.<br />
<br />
and consider running system file checker in safe mode. You will need to run cmd as admin then type
<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow <br />
<br />
Also did clean boot resolved any issues on accessing on normal mode? Do you get the same result?<br />
<br />
Also for viruses I think you may also try http://housecall.trendmicro.com/uk/index.html<br />

            Thanks amiroof for your help, unfortunately nothing worked and I actually fixed it myself. For other peoples sake, I'm gonna tell how i fixed it.
<div>When I found out that a microsoft service was causing my problems (as said before) I first disabled half of the microsoft services. I kept doing this, eliminating the services I was sure weren't dangerous. I did this until I had about 10 services left
 and I googled all off them. One of them I couldn't find on google except for a page where it said that that service was malware. I just disabled that service and that worked for me. For the people that want to know what service it was, the service is called:
 'Internet Explorer ETW Collector Service'. I haven't found a way to delete it but I just disabled it. If you don't know how to disable services, here's how:</div>
<div>1. go to start</div>
<div>2. type 'msconfig' and press enter</div>
<div>3. go to the services tab and uncheck the 'hide microsoft services'</div>
<div>4. look if you have the 'Internet Explorer ETW Collector Service', if so, disable it. If not and you have the same problems as I had, start eliminating services to see which are safe and which aren't.</div>

I am glad that you have finally resolved your problem and sorry if my guidance was not helpful.
<br />
It is a strange service... Only thing that you might consider is to reset IE settings see if it helps:<br />
<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737/en-us<br />
<br />
For deleting the service, have a look here:<br />
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/how-to-delete-a-windows-service-in-vista-or-xp/<br />
<br />
Hope above helps!<br />
Please be careful and create restore points and backups before trying anything. <br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Activation Key Not Accepted</h2>
                    Hi All xx<br />
<br />
Upgraded from vista to windows 7 via a free upgrade disc from Acer. The upgrade went ahead without a hitch and I entered the activation key when requested which was accepted. Now a month later it's now again asking for the activation key on start up but when
 I enter it a message comes up saying it's not the correct key. I can click to ignore the message and my comp works fine. I'm concerned that one day it won't start up though. Any ideas please and should I be worried? Thanks to anyone that replies x

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>^^^This. The same thing happened in halo reach. It is a defective system since even the people who are not abusing the voice chat can be voice banned. Getting muted over and over again should not be the only factor in deciding if you get voiced banned or
 not.</p>

Probably not going to get much help though. The banhammer is automated and the implications for bans are&nbsp;ambiguous at best. Like others have said, he was probably muted by numerous players, I would check to see if his mic is giving a lot of feedback, maybe
 he yells into the mic..or sings... or other things I've noticed small children like to do on the headset. Nine is a bit young to be on the mic anyway...<br />

<p>9 year olds (well any young child for that matter) tend to be over talkative and act hyperactive when playing, which could tick some people off. &nbsp;Also the voices, can't forget about those *shivers*.</p>

<p>Thoric, I'm going to have to call your parenting skills into question here. A) Halo 4 is a Mature (17+) rated game. Any parent should think twice before letting a 9 year old play the campaign. Which leads me to; B) No parent should EVER allow a 9 year old
 to openly communicate with random strangers over Xbox live. Not only is the chat environment on live a veritable minefield of X-rated conversations and perverted behavior, it's not necessarily a safe place for him to communicate. Unless you're there every
 moment he's on chat listening to both sides of the conversation his voice privacy needs to be set to friends only, or completely disabled.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Also, as long as he sounds like a 9 year old people are going to mute him the instant he speaks. Not everyone, but probably enough that he'll regularly have a voice ban on his account. It doesn't matter how well he behaves.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>So, in summary, your son probably doesn't need to be playing Halo online at all. If you do choose to allow him to play on live you need to disable his ability to communicate with strangers. Then you won't have to worry about voice bans anymore.

<p>
</p><p>My name is Gabriel and I thought odd that my computer was slow, so I found out that this "Windows Error Reporting" is creating 100gb of files inside of my SSD without my permission.</p>
<p>So I had my&nbsp;computer restored because after an ANNOYING update. (100% clean, only windows).</p>
<p>and it happens again because of the update that I cannot avoid!</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I want to ask you guys what can I do because I deleted them all by myself</p>
<p>
</p><p>here is how it works:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- I was on the internet then the computer started to work a lot, 100% usage of my SSD.</p>
<p>2- I found out that only the temp files had 100gb of memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3-this is what I found out:</p>

<p>Hi Gabriel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Storage sense has the capability to automatically free up disk space my making older, unused, locally available OneDrive files be available online only. When connected to internet, you'll be able to use online-only files just like any other file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enable and configure storage sense:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press 'Windows key + I' together to open Settings.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Click on System &gt; Storage.</p>
<p>3. Turn on 'Storage sense'.</p>
<p>4. Click on 'Change how we free up space automatically', and you can change when to run Storage sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove temporary files:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press 'Windows key + I' to open Settings.</p>
<p>2. Click on System &gt; Storage &gt; Free up space now.</p>
<p>3. Select the files that you want to remove, and select 'Remove files'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows can automatically free up space by getting rid of files you don't need, like temporary files and content in your recycle bin. Once it is enabled, it will run whenever your device runs on low on storage space, and clear all temporary files that you
 no longer need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

    <title>Suddenly Unable to Sign On to Windows 8 Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Suddenly Unable to Sign On to Windows 8 Laptop</h2>
                    <div>Good evening!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
After restarting my laptop which is running Windows 8, I've encountered a problem that I have not recently had with logging into my user account, or any other account for that matter.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After the restart, I attempted to enter my usual pin that I've used hundreds of times and a message come up saying "Your PIN Sign-in enrollment contains an old password. Please sign in with your new password." So naturally, I attempt to sign in with my
 password. It then gives me a message saying "The password is incorrect. Try again."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>• My password has always been exactly eight characters long, so the 15 character limit is not causing this problem.</div>
<div>• My caps-lock is not on.</div>
<div>• I am 100% sure my password is correct.</div>
<div>• I am using the standard US keyboard layout and have revealed my password on the screen to double check that it is typing what I want it to type.</div>
<div>• I am able to log onto my Microsoft account online, but unable to do so on this laptop that uses the same account and password.</div>
<div>• I have changed the account's password online twice.</div>
<div>• I have tried both of the new passwords and the old one on this laptop's login screen while the laptop is connected to the internet.</div>
<div>• I do not have a disc that can restore the computer or a copy of any windows operating system.</div>
<div>• I have another computer running windows 8 and everything works fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm not sure what the problem is, but it has rendered my machine completely useless. I cannot log on to change a password, restore, or do anything other than what you can do from the log in screen. I don't know what caused this problem because it was working
 fine just moments before I restarted.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you have any suggestions or fixes, those are greatly appreciated!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
                </div>

            This seems to be a pretty common problem, I'm seeing dozens of people on forums with the exact same issues. I'm currently experiencing the same issue as well, and needless to say I'm extremely frustrated. Microsoft hasn't responded to the issue at all,
 which I find unbelievable.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>-My computer is custom built</div>
<div><br />
<div>-I cannot logon with either account, local or live</div>
<div><br />
<div>-"That password is incorrect. Make sure you're using the password for your Microsoft account. You can always reset it at account.live.com/password/reset"</div>
<div><br />
<div>-Prior to the error, Win8 tried to install updates unsuccessfully. After failed update attempt it reverted back to previous state. That seems to be a&nbsp;reoccurring&nbsp;issue with others as well.</div>
<div><br />
<div>-Date and time are correct, no 3rd party. Only had Win8 for a week.</div>
<div><br />
<div>-Not unusual password. alpha numeric 8 characters.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I already was upset when trying to activate my copy upon realizing (after long trial and error) that the copy I had was one with an update only serial and was not a system builder, even though I work at best buy and we sell an update version, the version
 I bought not labeled at all as such. We don't even sell the system builder version. I think this is a pretty underhanded marketing move on Microsoft's point. This must have been done on purpose. I'm getting pretty upset with Microsoft. I already own many Apple
 products and haven't had nearly the issues or frustration with them. This may be the nail in the coffin for MS.</div>

            <p>How did you fix this problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is strange that I see this topic come up a lot the forum site and there is never a solution. This is very frustrating. How can I be locked out of my own computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have reset the password via Outlook.com but my laptop will not recognize it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody, please fix this stupid problem.</p>

            Hi, I have the same problem...
<div>The secario is:</div>
<div>&nbsp;I moved my pc from home to work, the pc was on sleep mode</div>
<div>When I try to log in I get the message " your pc is offline....."</div>
<div>After I read some threads I realised that the reason that we are locked out is cause the pc Is not connected to the Internet to confirm the password .</div>
<div>You can either take it back to a network you have you used a before or plug in a network cable to your network card.</div>
<div>&nbsp;Unfortunately at the moment I can not do any of that.</div>
<div>I ave to wait about 2-3 weeks till I get home.</div>
<div>What I am looking and if anyone can help is :</div>
<div>How can I logon the pc locally?</div>
<div>Or how can no get to safe mode?</div>
<div>Or how can I log in as a different user?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards</div>

            <p>This happened to me to-day,&nbsp; The solution was to manually turn the computer off and restart, letting it re-boot,&nbsp; My husband and I have no idea why this happened but hey- alls well that ends well- it appeared the lock out was to do with the laptop password
 lock was triggered by the immobility of laptop for a spell while it was not turned off...?? I took me about a half hour to arrive at this conclusion</p>

            <p>Two days ago I was prompted for a Windows update and I clicked okay!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then when the laptop (HP) started again I was asked to sign up for a login password. Previously NO password was required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so I created a login password and used that. Now the desktop is completely different. All my documents and many software programs, such as Microsoft Office and MYOB are gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried "system restore" a hundred times and it always comes back with an error that it could not complete this for some idiotic reason, one of them was to disable my anti-virus software, which I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need my real system back. Nothing works. I HATE Windows 8!</p>

After the above :<br />
<br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your
<br />
CD/DVD drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<a href="http://www.myce.com/storage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.myce.com/storage/</span></a></p>
<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays
<br />
all devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

            <blockquote>I am on a ship and have a local network. We have a V-Sat satellite system which we access the internet and is connected to our LAN system.&nbsp; On one deck we have a wireless router connected which works ok. We are wanting to connect another one&nbsp; a
 Linksys&nbsp; E1000 to a computer on another deck to get wireless there but having problems setting it up. We have the set-up DVD but this doesnt help&nbsp; Any advice appreciated</blockquote>
<br />
Assuming that there is a wired connection to the LAN on the deck in question, what you really need is a "wireless access point" rather than a wireless router.&nbsp; As it turns out, a wireless access point usually costs more than a wireless router -- but the latter
<br />
The following assumes that you DO have access to the wired LAN.&nbsp; You will connect the E1000 to the LAN -- not "to a computer" that is connected to the LAN.&nbsp; If there is already a computer using the only available LAN connection (and that computer doesn't have
 wifi capability), just connect that computer to one of the available LAN ports on the E1000 when you are done following the directions below.&nbsp; Do
<br />
Directions for doing the above are here --&gt; <a href="http://ezlan.net/router_AP.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://ezlan.net/router_AP.html&nbsp; </a><br />
<br />
The User Manual for the E1000 should be on the CD, but if not, go here --&gt; <a href="http://homesupport.cisco.com/en-us/support/routers/E1000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://homesupport.cisco.com/en-us/support/routers/E1000<br />
</a><br />
<br />
To find the IP address of what the directions call the "main router," go to any Windows computer now connected to the ship's LAN, open a Command Prompt window (Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd &gt; OK), type "ipconfig" (without quotes), and Press Enter.&nbsp; You will see something
 like this:<br />
<br />
Ethernet adapter Local Area Connection:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connection-specific DNS Suffix&nbsp; . :<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IP Address. . . . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.100<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.255.0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : 192.168.1.1<br />
<br />
The IP address for the "Default Gateway" is the IP address of the main router.<br />
<br />
<br />
The default IP address of the E1000 is 192.168.1.1.&nbsp; This needs to be changed to an IP address that is compatible with the IP addresses assigned by the main router but not the same as any other IP address on the LAN.&nbsp; This is what the directions mean by "give
 it an IP that doesn’t conflict with the main router's base IP address, or the DHCP server range."&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Assuming that the "subnet mask" that was shown when you did the above procedure was 255.255.255.0, the first 3 segments of the IP address must be the same.&nbsp; For example, if the Default Gateway is shown as 192.168.0.1, you need to change the E1000's IP address
 to 192.168.0.x, where x is between 2 and 254 but not within the range of addresses used by the main router's DHCP server.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
To find the "range of addresses used by the main router's DHCP server," you'll have to access that router's configuration utility.&nbsp; The corresponding information for the E1000 is shown on page 16 of the User Manual.&nbsp; The same page also has directions for disabling
 the DHCP router of the E1000 and setting its IP address.<br />

            Hi Besal.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />I will give you everything possible to get the keyboard working.  If you need help with any steps I'll be standing by here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try the Keyboard Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br /> 
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update can roll back to in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />What also might work is to go into Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Keyboard device, on Driver tab try Updating the driver automatically.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the same location try rolling back or Uninstalling the Keyboard driver, which works in a surprising number of cases where keyboard is messed up by Updates.  Restart PC to reinstall driver. 
<br />
<br />See if the keyboard will work in Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If not see if the On-screen Keyboard works at Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Keyboard &gt; Turn On the On Screen Keyboard.  
<br />
<br />If so then it could confirm the keyboard is failing, so test it in repair mode to see if it works since it uses different drivers there:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If not you can contact a laptop manufacturer to see if you can still get it replaced under warranty, or check for replacement keyboards for that model from the PC maker or online from after-market OEM's that exactly match it.  
<br />
<br />This keyboard bulletin from Lenovo can also apply to other brands:  <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht118432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht...</a>
<br />
<br />Try resetting the keyboard:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-settings-default-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-se...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also remap keyboard keys using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap-fix-keyboard-layout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap...</a>
<br />
<br />Check in your BIOS or UEFI firmware Setup for keyboard settings there, too.  
<br />
<br />If none of these works then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>Hi Reejudas, <br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forums.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your issue description, I understand that you are getting an error message when you are trying to update Apps in your Windows 8 computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me ask you few questions.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) What is the exact/complete error message? <br />
2) Have you installed any third party antivirus or security software?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please follow the troubleshooting methods given.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Run the Network troubleshooter and check.</strong></p>
<strong>
<p><br />
</p>
</strong>
<p>a. Move the Mouse to bottom right corner and select ‘search’.<br />
b. Select ‘Settings’ and type ‘Troubleshooting’ and then press enter.<br />
c. Select ‘Network and Internet’ and click ‘Network adapter’ and then click next.<br />
Refer this link.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What to do if you have problems with an app</strong></p>
<strong>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>

</strong>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: I suggest you to run the App troubleshooter mentioned in the Notes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Clear the cache from Windows store.</strong></p>
<strong>
<p><br />
</p></strong>&nbsp;
<p>Each time you access a file through your web browser, the browser caches (i.e., stores) it. By doing this, the browser doesn't have to newly retrieve files (including any images) from the remote web site each time you click Back or Forward. You should periodically
 clear the cache to allow your browser to function more efficiently.<br />
</p>
<p>Please follow the steps given below. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press "Windows+R" key on the keyboard to open Run window.<br />
b) In the Run window type "wsreset.exe" and then click ok it will clear all the cache in Windows store<br />
Please go to Windows Store and try to downlaod any app after performing the steps given above.</p>
<p>Please move to the next method if the issue still persists.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3: Temporality disable security software and check for the issue.</strong></p>
<strong>
<p><br />
</p></strong>&nbsp;
<p>Please disable the Microsoft or any Security Systems if you have on your system.</p>
<p>Important Note: Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 4 :</strong></p>
<strong>
<p><br />
</p></strong>&nbsp;
<p>Place the computer in clean boot and check if the issue persists. You may follow the article mentioned to perform a clean boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Perform a Clean Boot</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>Follow the instructions (Step 1 for Windows 8) given in this link to perform a clean boot:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow these steps to return the computer to Normal startup mode.<br />
</p>
<p>a. On the Start screen, type msconfig, and then press Enter.<br />
b. On the General tab, tap or click the Normal Startup option, and then tap or clickOK.<br />
c. When you are prompted to restart the computer, tap or click Restart.</p>
<p>Please go to the link given below to follow as a reference.<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Why can't I find or install an app from the Windows Store?</strong></p>

<h2>            Why Won&#39;t My Music Play&#63;</h2>
                    i store my music in an external terabyte drive so that the hard drive on my computer isnt half full of just music. last night after plugging in my hard drive, neither iTunes nor WMP could play my music. this happened before, but after a systemme restore
 it was all sorted. after trying another systemme restore this afternoon, a message after start up said that the restore failed. i tried several different restore points but no no avail. so i took a different route and scanned the external disk for errors,
 but it came up clean after mulitple scans. could my data have been corrupted? it wasnt last time but i dont know what to do so i need some advice as to how to recover/fix the systemme restore<br />

===============================================<br />
Sometimes other software like virus scanners can interfere with System Restore.<br />
<br />
When System Restore fails it's&nbsp;always worth a try to&nbsp;run it from Safe Mode.<br />

<br />
As for the media files on your external hard drive...as an experiment<br />
to be sure the files are not corrupted...I think I would copy a few to <br />
my main system drive and try to play them from there.

                    I m residing in India and in the process of buying a surface laptop (Not Pro) from USA. I have read the Warranty PDF document which states it will be supported in the country which is brought from..Agreed. Also the forum states that if the devices is sold
 in that country, the available version would be replaced if required... Agreed. All &nbsp;I wanted to know if Microsoft would help me in India if I have any basic issues with the product like battery or office subscription etc.

My lower scores in the index is a 2.9 in Graphics and a 3.4 in Gaming Graphics. I have an -Intel (R) HD Graphics- adapter, but my update icon keeps telling me to update the Nvidia graphics. Anyway, when I try to update with Nvidia, it fails. And when I try
 to look for updates in the Intel page, it fails also.&nbsp; </p>

<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What error message you receive when the graphics card fails to install?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on your computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><br />
I would suggest you to uninstall the display adapter drivers from device manager &amp; install the default Windows display adapter drivers:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
i. Type ‘devmgmt.msc’ in <b>Start Search</b> box and hit <b>Enter on </b>the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>ii. In device manager, expand the display adapter drivers listed in the device list.</span></p>
<p><span>iii. Right click on it, click <b>Uninstall</b> (Put a check in the option delete all driver files).</span></p>
<p><span>iv. Install the latest drivers.</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
<br />
Refer: </span></b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Update drivers: recommended links</span></a></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Hope the information helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Authentication error for  Gmail after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I keep on receiving this error message for my GMail and outlook.com&nbsp; email accounts. I know other have posted a similar message. This problem surfaced since I upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp;I have also tried the solution given to&nbsp; allow less secure apps. I've checked
 my passwords and all is correct and I am receiving mail. &nbsp;However, nothing has helped. It does not appear to be a problem with the software I'm using. I've tested this with half a dozen applications and also direct web access.&nbsp;The content of the error message
 is as follows. Any help would be appreciated since being unable to solve the problem is driving me CRAZY! I hope I am posting in the correct forum.
