<h2>            XBox One Media Remote and IR Extender Not Working</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have an Xbox One media remote and the IR extender cable. My xbox is not connected to my cable. I have not been able to get the IR extender cable to respond when using the remote (pointed directly at it). Most of the buttons on the remote work except
 for volume, mute and channel (which i wouldn't need). I have tried to sync the device to my TV (Samsung) but it has not worked. I have entered codes manually and automatically. Does anyone else have this issue or a solution?</span></p>

    <title>Corrupted Thumb Flash Drive - It Worked Fine Before MS &#39;Fixed&#39; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Corrupted Thumb Flash Drive - It Worked Fine Before MS &#39;Fixed&#39; It</h2>
                    <p>I have a flash drive that kept giving me messages about it having a problem and needing to be scanned and fixed every time I plugged it into a different machine (all running Windows 8.1 and 7, and with up-to-date security protection). Every time I would
 scan it, it would say no problems found. After enduring a wasted five or ten minutes each time over a couple of dozen of these seemingly spurious error messages, I no longer bothered scanning, and had no problem with the drive or the files on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night it was plugged into an 8.1 machine and I restarted it (rather than shutting it down), and as it came up, it said it was 'repairing the flash drive, even though I didn't ask it to. Guess what? I now have directory names on it that are corrupted,
 hence those directories can't be accessed, as well as some directories that appear fine but are missing files. Because I have been traveling, I didn't have time to make backups, meaning I don't have backups that are anywhere near up-to-date. The lack of recent
 backups is entirely my fault of course, but I will say that MS doesn't make it as easy as it could be, what with spaces in path names, and if you want to use a location other than 'My Documents'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run chkdsk with both the /f and /r flags to no avail. Examples of the corrupted directory contents are "INST@L&gt;1" (old, proper name was 'Installation Files') and 'TIIPDOC~1' (old, proper name was 'TmpDocs'). I've also tried programs like Recuva to no
 avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody suggest a non-paid solution? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to get it out of my system, I should note that I have been using MS products since DOS version 1, and have always happily upgraded, including Office, so I've spent a fair amount of money on MS products over the years, and I've also been a bit of a shill
 for MS. Apple has always been too 'We know what's best for you' for my tastes, and unfortunately MS seems to be following is that totalitarian mindset - remember, I didn't ask to have the drive 'repaired'. I've been a casual user of FreeBSD for over 10 years,
 although not out of any great dissatisfaction with MS, and although it requires more effort, it's looking better all the time... at least you don't have someone deciding what's good for you, whether it is or isn't.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand that it is frustrating when things don’t go as expected. I appreciate your efforts trying to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your issue description, I understand that you are unable to access certain directories in you flash drive and some of the files are missing as well. Here are some common reasons for corruption in USB drive are :</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Interruption in the transferring process leading to data loss.<br />
2. Improper system shutdown without properly ejecting the USB drive from it.<br />
3. Loss of crucial data due to a virus infection.<br />
4. Other known or unknown reasons leading to loss or corruption of files or drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer the question below to help me get a clear picture of the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the Flash Drive?</li><li>Are you able to access flash drive using a different computer?</li><li>Which antivirus application/software are you using?</li></ol>
<p>The issue might have occurred due to corrupted files been archived by your security software. Try accessing the flash drive on a different computer and if the issue does not re-occur,
<strong>create a backup</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Try to format drive from Disk management. Follow the steps given below.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Swipe up to open the <strong><span>Apps </span></strong>screen. If you're using a mouse or stylus, click on the arrow icon at the bottom of the screen instead.</li><li>On the&nbsp;Apps screen, scroll or swipe toward the right and locate <span>Windows&nbsp;System</span>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Click on&nbsp;or touch <strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>, located under the
<span>Windows&nbsp;System</span><em> </em>category<em>.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 8 will open Control Panel on the Desktop.</li><li>Click on&nbsp;or touch the <strong><span>System&nbsp;and Security</span></strong> link.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><span>Note:</span></strong> You won't see <span>System&nbsp; and Security</span><em>
</em>if your&nbsp;&nbsp;Control Panel view is set to <span>Small icons</span> or <span>Large&nbsp;</span><em><span>icons</span></em>. If you are on one of those views, just touch or click&nbsp;on
<strong><span>Administrative Tools</span></strong> and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then skip to Step 6.</li><li>In the <span>System&nbsp;&nbsp;and Security</span> window, click or touch the <strong><span>Administrative Tools</span></strong>&nbsp;heading, located at or near the bottom of the screen. You may need to&nbsp;scroll down to see it.</li><li>With Administrative&nbsp;Tools now open, double-tap or double-click on <strong><span>Computer Management</span></strong>.</li><li>With&nbsp;Computer Management now open, click or touch <strong><span>Disk Management</span></strong>, located &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on the left-hand side of the
<em><span>Computer Management</span></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; window, under the <em><span>Storage</span></em> heading. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you don't see it, you may need to expand
<em><span>Storage</span></em> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by clicking or touching the <strong><span>|&gt;</span></strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; icon next to it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disk Management may take several seconds to load but will eventually &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appear to the right.</li><li>You can&nbsp;now format a hard drive, change a drive's letter, or whatever other task &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you were planning from Windows 8's Disk Management utility.
</li><li>Right&nbsp;click on the flash drive select format and select file system as NTFS.</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong>Note: If you format the Flash drive data on it will be lost.</strong></p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply, but 'things don't go as expected'? To review:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I got tired of wasting time every time I plugged the thumb drive into another machine and receiving messages that there was a problem with the disk, and then spending 5-10 minutes scanning only to have it report no problems found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I only wanted to restart my machine - I did not ask MS in its infinite wisdom to 'repair' my disk - it was working fine and all my files were intact and accessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I now have a flash drive with both corrupt directories that can't be accessed and files that are missing from directories that appear to otherwise be fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Lexar 32GB USB 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) No, I can't access those directories and files on other machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Norton Internet Security, MacAfee, and unknown security software at two libraries that is 'behind' the scene' on a server and not visible</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would I reformat this drive? I'm asking how to recover my data, not obliterate it, as the suggested course of action points out will happen. I know that the sun will rise in the west before this will happen, but MS should recover my data, or failing
 that, pay to have that done.</p>

            <p>The first indication that something was seriously wrong with the flash drive was the warning that something was wrong and a scan was needed.&nbsp; The fact that this repeatedly happened, with the scan reporting no issues, was an indication that something was
 wrong beyond the ability of the scan to deal with it.&nbsp; This is the point when you should have moved files off of the drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are running both McAfee and Norton, which is not a good thing and conceivably could be the root of your problem.&nbsp; Both are known to cause&nbsp; more trouble than they are worth, and in combination you are bound to have problems.&nbsp; I would get rid of both and
 use the built-in Windows Defender and firewall. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that you've used Recuva to no avail doesn't bode well for being able to recover your files.&nbsp; There are
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/filerecovery/tp/free-file-recovery-programs.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
many free recovery programs</a> available, and some will succeed where others fail.&nbsp; Keep trying.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, it's generally not a good idea to boot or reboot with an external drive connected, especially a flash drive.&nbsp; It's also not a good idea to store important files on flash media as a matter of habit.&nbsp; They are far more likely to fail than hard drives.&nbsp;

            <p>I don't think this is a Windows or Microsoft problem here. Flash drives die.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're running multiple security products, that's likely one major source of your problem in the first place. Doing that can (and does) cause significant corruption, especially on removable media when the virus scanners are trying to scan when it's attached.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply. You make a couple of good points, and as I've noted, I should have had a more recent backup, in addition to other mistakes on my part, but I still think that my point that my drive should not have been 'repaired' without my permission
 is valid, especially because I wasn't prevented from using the drive until it was scanned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the first time that I've ever had this problem (those repeated error messages), and searching online didn't turn up the fact that something was 'wrong' with the drive, if that was in fact the case, nor that the drive should be discarded.&nbsp; Given that
 the drive was only a few months old (I'm aware it could have been defective and gone bad very quickly); that I'm careful about moving files off of the drive to work on so them before working on them to minimize writes to them; that I always make sure the drive
 is safely ejected; and that none of the files were in any problematic before this happened, I'm inclined to think the drive was fine. You might say that it should have been common sense to replace the drive, but given the frequency of other innocuous 'bump
 in the night' errors with operating system and other software, it's easy to ignore seemingly -- and what could be -- erroneous error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should note that if there was a problem that the scan could not deal with, it should throw an error message to that effect, rather than a bogus one about there being no problem. This is not a situation where a generic, one-size-fits-all error message is
 mostly an inconvenience - if the software detects a problem that it can't fix, it should say so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should have made it clearer that the different security software were on the different machines that I was using in different places - I know better than to use more than one on the same machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also note -- and this is not a criticism of you or your point -- that there are no warnings about&nbsp; not booting or rebooting with external drives plugged in, which is probably very common behavior, I usually am religious about making backups on other
 media precisely because of the fragility of flash media, but as I pointed out, because of circumstances, I was unable to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still think that Windows should not have tried to repair my drive without my express permission (it should have prevented it from being used as it sometimes does). I now also think that there is a serious problem with both a lack of information on 'best
 practices' and with error messages.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've noted above, I should have been clearer about the situation regarding the fact that the differing software was on different machines. I thought that was obvious, but obviously not...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've noted above, the flash drive may have died prematurely (it was very new), but I think that is unlikely given the care with which I treated it. It does make me wonder about the fragility of flash memory and the wisdom of using it in place of a hard
 drive, unless of course the problem has something to do with USB in some way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to beat a dead horse, MS should not have 'fixed' my drive without my permission - the better thing to do would have been to prevent its use until it was scanned and fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyond that, if, as the prior reply from another person suggested, the operating system was unable to resolve the problem, it should report that rather than wrongly report that all is well after the scan. THAT is a MS problem, and as much as I think I could
 prove my point by rustling up some class-action lawyer, I just want to get my data back and move on...</p>

<h2>            How do I get rid of a Windows &#34;Can&#39;t find file&#34; pop-up message&#63;</h2>
                    I have Windows XP.&nbsp; I've suddenly started getting a Windows pop-up message, every time I click on a shortcut to an online-site: "Windows cannot find [file name].&nbsp; Make sure you've typed the correct name, and then try again."&nbsp; The funny thing is, Windows
 still opens up the file I clicked on.&nbsp; But that darn message keeps popping up before it does.&nbsp; If anyone can help me get rid of it, I'd really appreciate it.&nbsp; Thanks in advance!

&nbsp;Hi,<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to try to help me!&nbsp; Much appreciated!<br />
<br />
To answer your questions:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; It happens with just about all of my online shortcuts.&nbsp; These sites are dating sites, my brokerage account, MSN Finance.&nbsp; No questionable (in terms of security) sites.<br />
<br />
2. Here, too, all of these files are opened quickly after the message appears, so I have no problems there.&nbsp; It's just annoying having to delete the "cannot find file" message every time.<br />
<br />
3. Yes, actually.&nbsp; I downloaded the "new improved Yahoo Messenger," which seems to have lots of features.&nbsp; Might be just a coincidence, but the "Cannot find file" Windows message did seem to happen just around the time I downloaded Yahoo M.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.&nbsp; Look forward to hearing back at your convenience.<br />
<br />
My best,<br />
Art<br />

<div><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></div>
<div><strong>Search</strong> Google for the name of the driver, or go to the computer makers site.</div>
<div><span><br />
<strong>Compare</strong> the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to<br />
<strong>Visit</strong> the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).<br />
If there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program<br />

    <title>Windows 10 extremely slow after a short time&#47;while - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crazed hermit  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 extremely slow after a short time&#47;while</h2>
                    <p>I was on Windows 7 but for any new install, it seems Windows Update just doesn't function anymore. I used one of the Digital River ISOs for my native language (dutch).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried everything I could find to fix windows update and it just won't work, at least not when I run it manually and interactively. And I have no time to wait for days until perhaps the **** thing has done something in the background.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I upgraded to Windows 10 and initially, everything seemed to be fine. But after a while (not longer than a few weeks) the thing started slowing down. This is an older laptop and it is said the video driver / chipset is not supported (by Intel) for Windows
 10, but all the same, in the beginning it worked perfectly, it seemed. It was when I started doing more demanding things, games, virtual machines, file transfers, that I began to notice deep slowdowns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started out with a game from GOG -- a DOSBOX game. Then I noticed it with the virtual machine I was using (VirtualBox) as well as other games (Diablo II) and just doing a file copy. I can do a file copy and the disk itself does about 40MB/s. So on copy
 to the same disk you ought to get about 15MB/s. But it can seriously slow down to 1MB/s or less with nothing visible going on in the system at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, I am just downloading a file off the internet at 600K/s and everything (ie., browsers) become totally unresponsile, not because of the internet bottleneck, but because they cannot access their required (cache) files from the disk. The disk is taken up.
 By a 600K/s file transfer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SMART finds no errors. And it only happens perhaps 15 minutes after reboot, so it can never be a hard drive failure. I have plenty of ram (4GB) of which normally only 50% is used. During these times CPU is not taken up more than 20-40%, usually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance, in my virtual machine, the guest reported 15MB/s disk reads. After reboot, that same figure was now 35MB/s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can play my game for maybe 15 minutes, then it starts to slow down so much I have to reboot or quit the game and wait 10 minutes and hope the system recovers. Otherwise it becomes too sluggish to play safely and it starts to lag. Maybe the display driver
 is doing something weird but it would be very odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system can also totally lock up or almost freeze completely when I am playing for instance one of those games. It is a dosbox game placing no demands on the system. The game will always slow down as time goes on, often I have to quit the game, wait a
 few minutes, restart it. If I restart it too soon, it will keep the same slowness. These are just games and they are important to me for now, but I also need to do bigger things with this system. For most, I was hoping I could use this as a backup image to
 restore to other systems if the need should arise. I want to create a solid image with all my applications and settings and use that on my always-then-current system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing Windows from scratch takes too much time, you see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I generally takes weeks before you have a system running the way you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But now because Windows 10 is flawing down, and Windows 7 won't work with updates, what else can I do? That Windows 7 license probably won't work on Windows 8. Either something is wrong with my hardware (but Linux works fine on it) or a combination with
 hardware and device drivers, or something is seriously wrong with Windows 10. I could wrap up this installation and use it on a different machine, but what if the problems remain? And I will need to get my hands on another Windows 7 license, but is beside
 the point here really.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 8 license at home that I cannot reach, and I hated Windows 8. So what can I do? Use a pirated Windows 7 and try to use my license on that? Maybe then updates will work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I'm gonna have to buy a new (?) Windows 7 license for this laptop? But chances of success are very slim. I cannot have a system that cannot even download .NET updates and all that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can try to reinstall Windows 10 but that will take me another 2 weeks to get back to where I am now. All of this takes a lot of energy, you know. And I don't have much of that. Nor do I have the time really.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that looks promising for this laptop is Windows 8 HATE HATE HATE. I also don't have the money for a full license when a "new" second hand laptop WITH PRO license costs the same as a pro license itself.</p>

            <p>Another asinine Microsoft response and still no solution to the abysmal slow file transfer rates in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's break this down so even a Microsoft tech can understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File transfer rate in Windows 7: OK</p>
<p>File transfer rate in Windows 8: OK</p>
<p>File transfer rate in Windows 8.1:OK</p>
<p>File transfer rate in Windows 10: What took seconds now takes hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ONLY change in the system (myself and many others) was that it was updated to Windows 10 from Windows 7, 8 or 8.1. &nbsp;That's it. &nbsp;No other changes were made.</p>

            <p>I had the same unbearable slowness after a few weeks of using Windows 10.&nbsp; I did a clean reinstall to fix it the first time. After the second time that it happened, I tried upgrading the video driver and that fixed it - wished I had though of that in the
 first place.&nbsp; All I did was go to Device Manager -&gt; expanded Display Adaptors -&gt; double-clicked on my adaptor (GeForce GT 635) -&gt; Driver tab -&gt; click on Update Driver -&gt; Search automatically for updated driver software.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the update, I was prompted to reboot. After the reboot, my computer was back to working at normal speeds.

<p><strong>After the above : (</strong><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.)</strong></p>
<p>Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High
<br />
Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version.
<br />
Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers.
<br />
Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on
<br />
and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the
<br />
reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot
<br />
until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

    <title>Origins mode - extra 30 seconds not added - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paltryamoeba564  say:</h3>
<h2>            Origins mode - extra 30 seconds not added</h2>
                    
<p>After I updated the app to the latest version, the 2 new Origins pack (Arch &amp; Cascade) are available. However, the feature where we can&nbsp;watch a commercial to get an extra of 30 seconds is no longer working. The commercial will not load and the 30 seconds
 will not be added.</p>
<p>This is okay for 15 of the 16 new levels. However, for Arch #8 it is a big problem because it is virtually impossible to score 3 stars on it, as we'd need to complete the&nbsp;level in 2:45&nbsp;with the gigantic&nbsp;final 5th board having 400-500 tiles,&nbsp;and it already
 takes a very lucky run to finish the first 4 boards in 2 minutes.</p>
<p>In fact even with the extra 30 seconds it's still a huge challenge to finish the level in 3:15. It took me 4 tries to get the 2 stars on this level, while I've finished all other levels with 3 stars mostly in the very first try (that's except the infamous&nbsp;Terra
 #7, but that's another story). Currently stuck on 185 out of a possible 186 stars, and feeling very frustrated. :-(</p>

<h2>            What happened with the One Drive - Upload Studio integration&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey folks. Upload Studio always had an option to save a video in your one drive account. However, this option isn't appearing any more, at least not in the same place (at the upload confirmation).
<br />
<br />
Whas the integration removed or something like it? Does any of you guys know why?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

<br />If these do not fully remove the virus/malware then it will be wise to register with a malware removal site to receive dedicated malware removal instructions, an expert will remain with you throughout the process until confirmation that your PC is 100% clean.

    <title>Blue screen of death when hard drive is plugged in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnnysquidbrain  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue screen of death when hard drive is plugged in</h2>
                    <p>so every time i boot my pc with my hard drive plugged it i get the blue screen of death with the message:
</p>
<p>Stop code SYSTEM THREAD EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED</p>
<p>what failed: Ntfs.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i unplug my hard drive and just use my SSD (where windows 10 is actually installed) it boots fine. From looking online it looks like there's a driver on the HDD which is causing the failure but I can't see what it is or wipe it because my PC dies if
 i plug it in before boot and windows doesn't detect it at all if I plug it in post-boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is my hard drive corrupted or something? is there a way to wipe it?</p>

            It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ca/onedrive/sha...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

<h2>            Can play.wma files fully but only first few seconds of .mp3 files on home wireless network with Windows 7 and WMP 12.0.7601</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an issue with Windows Media Player 12.0.7061 when I try to listen to music through my Window 7 home network.&nbsp; Windows Media Player has no problem playing all media files types locally on the Windows 7 system.&nbsp; On my home network, .wma files play well
 through the wireless speaker (Pioneer), but .mp3 and .mp4 files only play for the first ~5 seconds and then the audio stops.&nbsp; If I wait long enough, Windows Media Player will move on to the next song and continue to play that .wma file well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a DRM issue?&nbsp; Is my home wireless network too slow to allow .mp3 or .mp4 to fully transmit to the wireless speaker?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

    <title>MicroSD &#38; SD cards not recognized on Windows 7 PC when they used - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flash7575  say:</h3>
<h2>            MicroSD &#38; SD cards not recognized on Windows 7 PC when they used to work.</h2>
                    I have a perplexing issue. &nbsp;I have an internal USB multi-card reader connected to my custom-built Windows 7 Ultimate PC. &nbsp;I have been using SD cards and MIcroSD cards w/ SD adapters in the reader for years with no issues. &nbsp;MY printer also has a multicard
 reader installed in it as well, and I have used the SD card slot in that reader for years without problems as well. &nbsp;All of a sudden, about a month ago, I noticed that whenever I inserted a MicroSD card &amp; adapter into the SD card slot or the reader, the reader
 would not recognise that a card was inserted; the autoplay window no longer pops up and the drive itself says that no media is inserted. &nbsp;I try the same card &amp; adapter in the printer's reader with the same result. &nbsp;However, if I use a different type of media
 in the reader (I have an old 64mb Smartmedia Memory Card) &nbsp;everything works fine and I am able to drag and drop files between my desktop and the Smartmedia Card.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Before any states that it must be that the MicroSD card is faulty, I have tried NUMEROUS MicroSD and regular SD cards in the reader with the same result. &nbsp;However, when I take the cards and place them into the multi-card reader of my kid's pc (Windows
 7 Pro, home built w/ the same exact multi-card reader as the PC in question) the cards work with no problems.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If the MicroSD and SD cards work in my kid's PC and not mine, I am assuming it could be a software/driver issue. &nbsp;However, I have not changed ANYTHING with regards to setup that would make the SD cards not work all of a sudden when They used to a month
 or so ago. &nbsp;There are no drivers for my card reader as it is an internal USB and uses generic windows 7 drivers that were installed during setup.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone can help it would be very much appreciated. &nbsp;I used to use this reader often to transfer photos from my camera's SD card to my NAS drive as well as transfer files from my phone's MicroSD card to my PC and vice-versa as this way is quicker and
 easier than plugging the phone or camera into the pc using the UBS cable.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance.</div>

            HEllo..
<div><br />
<div>I have tried all of your suggestions, and nothing has worked. &nbsp;All other items I plug into the USB ports of my PC work. &nbsp; &nbsp;As far as the INTERNAL card reader, it reads other media types (SmartMedia Cards, etc) just NOT SD or MicroSD cards. &nbsp;This is the
 same for my USB printer's internal card reader, it will read other storage media (SmartMedia cards, etc) but not SD or MicroSD cards.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I know the SD and MicroSD cards are not corrupted because the cards work fine in my kids pc's internal card reader.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am at a loss as the card reader in my PC was reading all media, including SD &amp; MicroSD cards, fine as of a few weeks ago, then suddenly, no more.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I know it has to be a Windows problem, as I have the latest USB drivers installed and my kids pc has the same exact card reader as my pc. &nbsp;Just seems very odd that the reader would no longer read JUST SD &amp; MicroSD cards, but easily recognise and read other
 portable storage media like a Smartmedia Card.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated, as I use MicroSD cards alot with my phone and camera to transfer file back and forth without having to plug the devices into my pc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank You.</div>

            I don't think it is a software issue. It's related to the hardware. Since you've mentioned you are using the card reader device for years, it's very likely that there is degradation in the conductivity (normal wear and tear). But, it's not the case with
 SmartMedia, and so it's working fine. Replacing the card reader will solve the issue. After all, even electronic goods have their own lifespan.

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>I am experiencing the same issue since I installed win7 ultimate 64bits latest updates.</div>
<div>Update installation is not set automatic in my computer, and so when I checked for the latest updates around two weeks ago the issue started.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have a new card reader installed a month ago and it works great, NEW no hardware issues. all my PC USB ports work great. even have 2 hubs connected and all work fine until the updates were installed.
<div><br />
<div>Situation: I connect either a USB micro card reader, My cell phone, camera or a pendrive to any usb port in the computer. Windows displays de message a device has been connected and even install de drivers for the device. All devices I was able to access
 before and now I can´t.</div>
<div>On my computer window I can see a quick flash of the drive information appear and inmediately dissapear.</div>
<div>I go to disc management, the drives, all of them appear, each of them have a name or unit name assigned to it, but the drive shows grayed, with a disclaimer that says no media.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried: uninstalling the unit, left the card reader, phone, etc plugged in, and windows recognizes it, reinstall them, and again the same.</div>
<div>I have also tried this disabeling the antivirus and the firewall, and the result is the same.</div>
<div>Have also run an indeph scan and no viruses or threads were found.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It seems the issue is with devices with memories, internal or not.</div>
<div>NOTE all this devices work great on my work laptop running winXP. no again NOT a hardware issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there any solution to this bug?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you</div>

            I´m Still having the same issue.
<div><br />
<div>I have tried running the hardware manufacters latest dirver on my computer (which were already installed, but re runned them anyway) but after doing so the issue remains.</div>
<div>Also tried installing the win7 updates in case any of them resolved this, but had no luck.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Finally tried disconectiong the internal universal card reader unit I installed. (Which worked normally for weeks before installing the win7 updates that initiated the issue) = issue remains = obviously a Win7 issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What worked: keeping the sd card and camera connected and reboot. After rebooting I can access to then through My compuer as normally, BUT if the devices are unplugged the computer will not see them again. There is no sense on reconnecting and rebooting
 everytime you need to read a memory or flash drive device.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I still have not found a solution to this issue,</div>
<div><br />
<div>What other information do you need to deliver a solution to the win7 issue?</div>
<div>I think I have not miss anything, but let me know if something is missing and I will answer you. I need a solution to this as well as many other users.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks</div>

            My Neighbour was having the same problem trying to load photos to her photoframe memory card. I did all the same tasks as mentioned here to no avail with her windows 7. Then thought I would put the card in my Dell windows 7 and use dropbox to load her
 pix for her. Guess what it did the same in my laptop, flicked twice in Device Manager and start task bar., but did not show or open. The problem is with windows 7 and someone at MICROSOFT SHOULD SORT THIS AND FIX.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The manufacturers are the ones who provide updated drivers for their devices, but we can have Windows to install the drivers automatically. However, if Windows can't find an updated driver for your device online, then it would be best to check your printer
 manufacturer's website for updated drivers. <br />
<br />
By the way, what's the make and model of your printer? To update your printer drivers automatically, follow the steps in
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/ad5a063e-5f57-c715-2566-b983195752c1/update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Update drivers in Windows 10</a>.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to your reply.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />
<br />

            He wasn't asking about a printer driver. &nbsp;He was asking about the driver for Windows Journal that allows you to add Journal to your list of printer option from any software with a Print feature. &nbsp;Just as Adobe Acrobat adds a "Print to PDF" feature, Journal
 used to add "Print to Journal" under Options, but now it's gone. &nbsp;Please advise! &nbsp;I use Journal to do my job. &nbsp;<br />

            returning the ability to print to Windows Journal would certainly be very useful, as I have just found it again I do feel a bit short changed. In my previous job this was a really useful application and solved many editing issues for me. I would like to
 be able to use it in the same way again

                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried adding Windowslive accounts(*** Email address is removed for privacy ***) to WLM with these two ways:</div>
<div><b>First:</b> via choosing the sever type "Windows Live Hotmail" Or&nbsp;<font>The
</font><font>'</font><font><b>http</b></font><font><b>'</b></font><font> server which automatically was chosen after finishing adding the account.</font></div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>This is error while choosing 'windows live hotmail' as incoming sever type::</b></div>

<br />
<div>Thanks a lot, yes, I am logging in with the complete email address for the user name.</div>
<div>Also, I tried logging in without domain *** Email address is removed for privacy ***'</div>
<div><br />
<div>I really don't think that incoming and outgoing server names for windowslive accounts can be configured as&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Incoming (POP3) Server</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Server address:&nbsp;pop-mail.outlook.com</p>
</li><li>
<p>Port: 995</p>
</li><li>
<p>Encrypted Connection: SSL</p>
</li></ul>

<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>because Hotmail accounts cannot be configured at all. In other words, they don't have incoming and outgoing sever names. So windowslive accounts would be so.</p>

            Xbox live is so trash,&nbsp; 'get a thousand dollars worth of games for free each year' **** off none the games given for free this year aren't even worth 500 dollars,&nbsp; Microsoft learn from ps4 and start to improve your **** cause there is now much much better
 exclusives on ps4 and when next gen consoles comes out people who have Xbox will switch to ps4.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            I don’t know if this counts because I was using my cousins account and xbox since I didn’t have an account or xbox back then. I remember playing The Sims 2 on the original Xbox. That was the first time I have ever used Xbox live. If yall want like a current
