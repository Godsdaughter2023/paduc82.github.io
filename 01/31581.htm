    <title>Why Aren&#39;t Core Windows Operations Multi-Threaded - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why Aren&#39;t Core Windows Operations Multi-Threaded</h2>
                    <p>The Year is 2019. Mainstream multi-core/multi-threaded cpu's have been out for over 20 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why has Microsoft not optimized many of the basic tasks in Windows to use more than one thread. Here is an example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk Cleanup Utility. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing system update / update log / previous windows version cleanup. <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97546e03-7d0b-495d-bb4b-97729d75215d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>During Windows update, system file check, chkdsk, only takes advantage of a single cpu thread.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why has this never been optimized? </p>
<p>

<h2>            Gaming and relationships v2</h2>
                    
<p>So, with the new(ish) forum layout comes a new start and no posts; this one's from the old forums which I started, and it seemed to be a success. So...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In your relationship, where do video games stand? <br />
Does your S.O. play along with you and enjoy the co-op sector in a game? Or are you both more competitive and like to play against each other?<br />
Or do they rather enjoy watching you play, if they don't play video games themselves?<br />
OR have you had any bad luck with your S.O. and gaming? Considering many couples do seem to have that problem, which is unfortunate IMO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get the idea. <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-4.gif" /></p>
<p><br />
<br />
Myself; I very much enjoy playing the co-op side of video games with my boyfriend; when he stays over, we always order a takeaway, put out feet up and usually play some form of video game together, which, at the moment is Portal 2. I also actually enjoy watching
 him play, and even sometimes I give him hints on games I've finished. However, on the flipside, we can also be rather competitive when we are pitted against each other and play split-screen against each other.<br />
I do think that, in a way, playing games together has brought me and my boyfriend together; through communication with each other on co-op, and through the banter we share when we are playing against each other. In short, gaming in my relationship is a big
<strong>yes.</strong>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-4.gif" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to post your little stories on gaming and your partners, too. :-)</p>

<p>The only game my girlfriend likes is Angry Birds. She is accepting of the time I spend playing them. But that's mostly because she works nights and I work days. So most of the time I spend gaming is while she is at work. But if there's a game I'm super hyped
 about, she understands and gives me time and space to do what I enjoy. In fact, she claims to be planning a going away party for me on November 10th.</p>

<p>The games my wifey likes are few and far between. Puzzle Fighter is the ONLY Xbox (retail, Arcade, indie) that she plays, and that's cause we played the heck out of it on the PS1. We still have our PS1 disc btw. We get very competitive with each other when
 we play vs. together. Her list is extremely short, and pretty standard 'girlie gamer' fare:</p>
<p>Tetris,</p>
<p>Solitare,</p>
<p>Super Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo (HD),</p>
<p>Illusion of Gaia,</p>
<p>Bust a Groove.</p>
<p>Fairyland (on FB)</p>
<p>But believe me, she is hardcore on all of them.</p>

<p>I don't multiplay, so my wife and I haven't really done much in the way of playing together.&nbsp; We've ran around together in Fable III for a bit, mainly me helping her out in exchange for me gaining money and experience, as I recall, and we played a few things
 together on Wii like New Super Mario Bros. Wii, but generally we play games alone.&nbsp; We don't normally watch each other play, either, and usually the games that interest one of us don't interest the other, with but few exceptions.&nbsp; She does like Fable, though,
 and I do as well.</p>

<p>My girlfriend used to hate me playing games. But one day she watched me play Assassins Creed and she got quite interested. Now she as her own xbox and all the Creeds. She likes&nbsp;some co-op games aslong as they&nbsp;are not FPS&nbsp;or online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aslong as she can watch her soaps and we still spend time doing stuff over then playing games (e.g out for meals, watching movies and days out) she understands that games are a keen interest to me. And lets me get on with it. I also have a 3 year old son,
 so I only get the evenings to game now a days. </p>
<p>Normally if I buy a game I'm hyped about, she treats her self to a girls night out to leave me to play it. The only thing we argue over now&nbsp;is the F1.

<br />
<br />Good news, all is good with your account. :-)
<br />
<br />As such, reinstalling Skype should solve the issue. 
<br />
<br />Please see here how to do a clean uninstall and reinstall of Skype on Mac:

<h2>            Statuscode 80150017 Games with Gold</h2>
                    
<p>Dear support,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have a problem (again) with getting games for gold purchases.</p>
<p>I receive the status code 80150017 saying not available in your region or the file is damaged or we do not recognise the file index. This errorcode status on the website explains a total different issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had contact with helpdesk through chat about Halo 3 and have said they would escalate the problem and I could expect a response within 3 weeks. Over 4 weeks have passed and now I have the same problem with Gears of War.</p>
<p>I have done every suggested method of getting the purchase done, but nothing works. Region is accurate. Payment method is valid. Clearing cache or using usb stick do not work in any way. With or without reset of the console.</p>
<p>Please look into this asap, because I feel I'm missing out on games that should be available to me and the support has been insufficient.</p>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>MistahE</p>
<p>Gamertag: mistahe420</p>
<p>Account region: Norway (originally The Netherlands)</p>
<p>Physical region: Norway</p>
<p>Games with Gold: Halo 3, Gears of War</p>
<p>Statuscode: 80150017</p>
<p>Purchase does not complete. Download never starts. Errorcode message displays faulty situation and website does not imply same issue. Other purchases/downloads have no issues.</p>

<p>the same problem has occurs with me but there is nothing to do about it. it is a account error some accounts face these errors. if you still want the game the only way is to make another account with gold and purchase it.</p>

<p>two questions </p>
<p>first have you recently migrated your account from lets say uk etc to get english content and then changed back?</p>
<p>you will have to wait till the migration completes it sometimes takes 30days contact support to see if they can rush it</p>
<p>2nd have you contacted &nbsp;your ISP?</p>
<p>you can check your gateway by going to speedtest.net</p>
<p>sometimes hardreseting your modem and router helps too but sometimes manually entering new gateway settings will resolve the issue with different geoIPs</p>

            Hi Drew
<br />
<br />Windows itself cannot rotate a video, you need a 3rd party application to rotate a video file . .. 
<br />
<br />Try the totally free and very fast FreeMake Video Converter available form this link:

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />- Open Windows Movie Maker. 
<br />- Drag and drop your video into the program or use the “Add videos and photos” option in the Home toolbar. 
<br />- Once added, scroll to the right to the Editing options within the Home tab. Click on “Rotate left” or “Rotate right” depending on the original orientation of your video.
<br />- Save the video.
<br />
<br />
<br />If you don't have Windows Movie Maker, kindly follow these steps to Rotate and view video .
<br />
<br />You need to install VLC Media player.
<br />
<br />- Open your video in VLC Media player.
<br />
<br />- Go to “Tools -&gt; Effects and Filters.”
<br />
<br />- Next, click the Video Effects tab, then the Geometry tab, 
<br />
<br />- Tick the checkbox that says “Transform.” The dropdown menu below should no longer be greyed out, and you should be able to rotate your video as you see fit.
<br />
<br />Once you’ve made the rotation adjustments you wanted, click Save.
<br />
<br />
<br />To Save the rotated video: 
<br />
<br />Click Tools in the ribbon at the top, then Preferences. At the bottom-left of the Preferences window, click “All” under “Show settings,” then click “Video” and “Filters” in the pane on the left.
<br />
<br />On the right side, tick the “Video transformation filter” box and click “Save.”
<br />
<br />Next, click “Media” in the ribbon at the top of your VLC window, then “Convert/Save.”
<br />
<br />In the new window click “Add,” then browse to your video and select it. Click “Convert/Save” with it selected.
<br />
<br />In the next window click the Profile dropdown menu and select a video format profile you’re happy with – the first one, H.264 + MP3 (MP4), is fine for most purposes.
<br />
<br />Next, click the wrench icon next to the Profile dropdown, and then click the “Video codec” tab. (Beforehand, you can select the video format you want to save to if you like – we’re happy sticking with the default MPEG-TS.)
<br />
<br />Under the “Video codec” tab, tick the “Video” checkbox, the Filters tab, then scroll down and tick the box that says “Video transformation filter” and click “Save.”
<br />
<br />
<br />Back at the “Convert” window, the last thing you need to do is select the destination you want to save your rotated file to (at the bottom of the window) and give it a new filename. Make the name distinct, as we had problems when using a variant of the original name. Do this, then click “Start” to begin the conversion process.
<br />
<br />Your newly rotated video should now appear in the destination you saved it to. 
<br />
<br />To reset your VLC settings to default. Go to “Tools -&gt; Preferences,” then click “Reset Preferences” at the bottom of the window.
<br />
<br />Thanks to maketecheasier.com 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            HD Webcam for Windows 8.1 on Acer Aspire E1-472G is not working</h2>
                    <p>I just bought this laptop this afternoon. In all the hype, I turned the HD Webcam and took a selfie and it all looks fine. I switched off the laptop for a while. I turn it back on after a few hours and curiously clicked on the Skitch Touch app and clicked
 the camera option and displays a question asking for allowance for the app to use the camera and I clicked "Allow". The camera starts to turn itself off and on while the screen displays a "Connect your camera" message. I exited the app and camera. Then I went
 to the normal camera "app" and the camera does not work showing the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I went on Help and searched for webcam and did the steps as told by the Help instruction. (Installing a new driver and etc.) It still does not work. This is also my first time on Windows 8 or now, 8.1. I do not know the webcam hardware model number or
 how to find it or whether it a hardware failure but I could from observation might say it's not since I just bought it.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the issue is driver related. The imaging device in the device manager is the device driver for your webcam. You can also boot to
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Safe mode</strong></a><strong>
</strong></span>to check if the webcam works inside it. If no go, then probably it's a hardware problem. If it works great inside safe mode, then it just needs driver updating. You can also contact the computer manufacturer and ask then to test your webcam
 online. </p>

<h3> josiahwinslow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana not connecting to the internet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I first got my new Windows 10 computer, Cortana worked just fine. A while ago, however, Cortana stopped being able to connect to the internet. I am able to conduct web searches in the search bar and do offline tasks with her, but she responds to everything
 else I say with "I'm sorry, the internet and I aren't talking right now" or similar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be clear, my internet is working completely fine, and every other program that connects to the internet does so perfectly. Cortana just won't connect to the internet.</p>
<p>

            Lets start with the basics:
<br />
<br />Method 1: Run the Search and Indexing Troubleshooter.
<br />Follow the below steps:
<br /> 1. Open Control Panel.
<br /> 2. Select Troubleshooting.
<br /> 3. Click on Search and Indexing Troubleshooter.
<br /> 4. Run the Troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Run the DISM Tool. If the issue persists, I would have run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.  
<br /> 1. Click on 'Start'.
<br /> 2. Enter 'Command prompt' in the Search box.   
<br /> 3. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command Prompt, and then tap or click 'Run as administrator'.  
<br /> 4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt Window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, 
<br />and then press Enter.
<br />Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it. 
<br />
<br />Method 3: Restart the Cortana Process in Task Manager
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Processes tab
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list of processes, select Cortana then click End Task.
<br />
<br />Restart Windows 10 then see if it starts working.
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 4: Reinstall Cortana
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />At the command Prompt, type then following the hit Enter.
<br />Exit Powershell the restart
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -Name Microsoft.Windows.Cortana | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}

<p>I have tried each of the methods, and none of them have had any effect. Cortana's "interests" are not available when I click the search bar, and Cortana can't use the internet.</p>

            The problem persisted on another account. However, now I've connected to the network at my local coffee shop, and Cortana is working perfectly. Perhaps it was the network I was connected to at the time.

</p><p>The <strong>last 30 days </strong>of your conversation is saved on the cloud. You can access them as long as you sign in to your account on a supported device. Histories older than 30 days are saved on the device's local hard drive, however, for mobile devices,
 we do not have an option to back up conversations nor recover them. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you let us know why you exactly need the conversation history for? Have you previously used a desktop to log in to your account?

 To use it you must move it to your Xbox 360 hard drive" and only gives me the option to say "Ok" and move on. I update the software but nothing happens and i'm getting nowhere to fixing it. Help much appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

Sorry to hear you're having issues accessing your DLC.<br />

<h2>            Old email address sending out spam - HOW DO I COMPLETELY CLOSE THE ACCOUNT</h2>
                    My old email address started sending out spam about a week ago. I went on the forums and did all they said, scanned and fixed vulnerabilities on my computer, and changed my password to a really complicated one. In the next few days it still sent out spam
 emails to my contacts, I wouldn't have known at all if my friends hadn't told me because there was nothing in my sent box.<br />
<br />
I deactivates the account and deleted it from all devices. Anyway, I found out the next day that it was still sending out these emails and I dont know what to do to fix it. I have closed the account so it should have been shut down.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help? I don't want this account out there and I also want it to stop being used to send spam links<br />

            If the messages aren't in your <em>Sent</em> folder, then it's not your account that's sending the spam. Someone may have got hold of your contacts list, or - just as likely - one of your friends' contacts list and is spamming everyone on the list, using
 their own computer or a compromised one. There's nothing you can do about it other than warn your&nbsp;contacts&nbsp;that it's happening. Closing the account won't help if your email address is being used illegally.<br />

    <title>Disable notification about automatic sample submission being turned - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oscarstankard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable notification about automatic sample submission being turned off</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep having to dismiss the notification that there is a problem with my Windows Defender, uppon inspeciton there is no actual problem, Windows seemingly considers Automatic Sample Submission being switched off as a fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have turned off automatic sample submission, I have also dismissed the warning.&nbsp; It seems either this setting is designed to keep warning you periodically or this choice is not correctly being saved as this warning keeps returning every few weeks.&nbsp; How
 can I get this warning permanently dismissed so I can once again see when something new actually requires my action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I live in hope this is an error on my particular system, this would seem to be in line with my recent experience of Microsoft's policy of 'annoy people until they give in', hopefully not and there's a way to fix it forgetting I've dismissed the
 warning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I am aware of and am not asking about;</p>
<p>The benefits of automatic sample submission.</p>
<p>How to dismiss the notification once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

            Hi Oscar.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is more here about Automatic Sample Submission:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/323537/how-do-windows-defenders-automatic-sample-submission-and-cloud-based-protection-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/323537/how-do-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />And here is a way to disable it:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/windows-10-tip-disable-data-collection-and-telemetry-in-windows-defender/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/windows-10-tip-disable-da...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to voice your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying so fast, so great thanks for that info.&nbsp; Although it appears to relate to turning off sample submission rather than permanently dismissing the warnings about having it disabled, I've done both the GP and reg fixes and hope that this both
 turns it off AND stops the repeated warnings.&nbsp; I presume that organisations where such a policy is set centrally they woudn't like their users warned about their central IT department's decision on this, so I can but hope this will be treated as a permanent
 and not to be nagged about setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping this was a fault rather than a MS policy decision, hence my asking on a technical help forum.&nbsp; If you happen to know that this is a policy decision rather than a fault then do let me know and I'll address my problem/oppinion accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Oscar</p>

            Oscar, there is constantly a tension between Microsoft needing more data to improve security and WIndows and the consumer's need for privacy.  So if one turns off much of the telemetry that provides this, things can start to go sideways with Windows 10 - especially Administrator rights and permissioning.  It may flag something as not allowed by Administrator because the toggle was normally only available in Professional Group Policy but hacked via a regedit in Home.  So we can get drawn in and it's both a hornets nest and a complex puzzle.  
<br />
<br />So be aware of your regedits and how they affect things.  I would always preserve a Clean Install soon after it's up and running best via an Image so you can always go back in 20 minutes if something messes up and can't be reversed.  Keep plenty of System Restore points and make sure nothing has turned that off:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />I am not aware of anything more than I gave which has helped others who asked about this.  But I do encourage you  to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.

<h2>            Windows 10 - Family Safety- Web and App activity not updating</h2>
                    <p>My Family Safety is not recording my child's web history and activities. &nbsp;It seems as if this question has been asked again and again in this community without resolution. &nbsp;Microsoft where are you? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record: &nbsp;I was initially impressed with Family Safety when Windows 10 first came out. &nbsp;Only complaint was it forced my child to have an on-line account. &nbsp;Now it only works for microsoft browsers which makes it TOTALLY WORTHLESS. &nbsp;Child can just download
 Chrome or other non-mircosoft browser. &nbsp;What's even more disappointing is the reason microsoft gives. &nbsp;They say that the non-microsoft browsers do updates and that once they are notified children are left unprotected until microsoft can update family safety.
 &nbsp;So their solution to this problem, allow children to be completely, permanently unprotected!!! &nbsp;Talk about throwing the baby out with the bath water. &nbsp;Microsoft you had a great product and made it WORTHLESS. &nbsp; Why don't you tell the truth which is most likely
 that you want only use of your browsers or you no longer want to devote the effort to updating family safety for other browsers. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What exactly happens when you try installing the drivers?<br />
Do you get any error message?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to check if the device is detected in the device manager.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click on Start and type Device Manager in the search box, hit enter to open it.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. In Device Manager, if you cannot find the device then click on “View” menu and select “Show Hidden Devices”.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. &nbsp;Now, scroll down to locate the device.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. &nbsp; Right click on it and select “Update Driver” to update it.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5. &nbsp;Reboot your computer and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you don’t find any drivers there, then I would suggest you to download the drivers from the below link, install and check if it gets
 installed.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also try uninstalling the infrared device from the device manager and restart the computer and check if the drivers get installed.

<p>Please Help</p>
<p>As I said initially "Windows-7 64bit does not detect the IR receiver hardware ". When I run the Toshiba IR driver there are no messages. BUT the IR device is not listed in "<span>Device Manager " so ther is
 nothing to check or delete.</span></p>
<p>As I also initially said "It works great with Vista 32 ultimate and Windows-7 32bit ultimate " so I think this is a Windows 7 64bit installer issue.</p>
<p>Thanks for you help</p>

<p>Thanks Debra for the lead, However</p>
<p>I went to "<span>What-to-do-when-a-device-isnt-installed-properly" and read all of the article. The most helpful seemed to be "manual Install" so i tried that.&nbsp;</span><span>
 The device is now&nbsp;detected in the device manager using a generic Microsoft IR driver. But it doesn't function. It was installed in hardware in sytem devices VS Human interface as it is in Vista and Win7 32bit. I then tried to install the Toshiba version "driver_ir_winbond_TC00233000B"
 but the install gave a message that it couldn't complete.&nbsp; As I said before this IR device
<span>works great with Vista 32 ultimate and Windows-7 32bit ultimate(including beta). I still think this problem is a 64bit windows 7 installer problem. I don't think the plug and play information was included with the installer.
 Nor does the hardware installer see the device.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Any more suggestions</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks Steve</span></p>

            Did you ever come up with an answer for this ?<br />
<br />
I've been searching high and low for a solution to this remote control not working in Win7 64 bit issue, and its very frustrating. The physical form factor of the remote is perfect and makes it portable, but if it doesn't work, what's the good of all that ???<br />
<br />
Any MC remote will work, just not the RC6 one that HP decided to include...<br />

    <title>Redeemed Card Didn&#39;t Work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> snarkypotato17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Redeemed Card Didn&#39;t Work</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought the Xbox One S Minecraft Explorer's Pack Bundle from Microsoft.com. When it came,&nbsp;I redeemed and installed the Minecraft card without any problems. The next day I&nbsp;went to install the Explorer's Pack which adds new skins and texture packs. I put in the code, and it said it redeemed. However, I&nbsp;went to my "ready to install" page, and found, to my dismay, that it wasn't there ready to install. I went back to the Xbox store, and punched in the code again, but I&nbsp;got a message saying: "This code has already been redeemed". I am really angry about this. The day after I redeemed the code&nbsp;I messaged support (and they were very eager to help btw) but what they suggested didn't work. They said that my code had actually redeemed at 4 am that morning, and to give it 24-48 hours to appear in my "ready to install". Here I&nbsp;am 54 hours later, and it's still not there. Does anyone know how to fix this issue?</p>

<h2>            Win 10 Pro- Sleep mode enabled when double tap on any Arrow Keys</h2>
                    Running a WIN10 Pro on Dell Precision 5510. Something has happened that is trigging my system to go into Sleep Mode whenever I double hit any Arrow key. (up-up, down-down, right-right, left-left or any combination of these). It's like it could be an Ease
 of Accessibility feature but there is nothing in that module to manage this. I have been forced to turn off the Sleep Button feature in Power Management to prevent this double arrow event from occurring while I type. Please advise how to correct this problem?

            Hi Kurt.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try the Keyboard Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />This could have been caused by Windows Update.  See if you can  System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Check which Updates were installed at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History and try uninstalling any from around the time this started.  If they return and cause the same problem then hide them with the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />What also might work is to go into Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Keyboard device, on Driver tab try Updating the driver automatically.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the same location try rolling back or Uninstalling the Keyboard driver, which works in a surprising number of cases where keyboard is messed up by Updates.  Restart PC to reinstall driver. 
<br />
<br />See if the keyboard will work correctly in Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If not see if the On-screen Keyboard works at Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Keyboard &gt; Turn On the On Screen Keyboard.  
<br />
<br />If so then it could confirm the keyboard is failing, so we'd want to test it in repair mode to see if it works since it uses different drivers there:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If not you can contact a laptop manufacturer to see if you can still get it replaced under warranty, or check for replacement keyboards for that model from the PC maker or online from after-market OEM's that exactly match it.  
<br />
<br />This keyboard bulletin from Lenovo can also apply to other brands:  <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht118432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht...</a>
<br />
<br />Try resetting the keyboard:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-settings-default-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-se...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of these works then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Printer showing on the network and printing test page but nothing else - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelmiskelly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printer showing on the network and printing test page but nothing else</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all&nbsp;I have already searched this problem on the forum and Google and could not find a solution.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am trying to set up a shared printer across two windows 7 machines. The printer is a HP designjet 450 CAD plotter and I have successfully shared it over the homegroup so it is showing on the shared PC. I can print a test page&nbsp;from the shared PC no problem
 but when I try to print a PDF or anything else it does not seem to send anything. The print does not even go into the queue from what I can see. I can print fine from the main PC just not the shared one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply, unfortunately there is nothing in those articles which are of any help. I have shared the printer over the homegroup successfully and as I say I can print the printer test page from the shared PC but no other documents seem to print
 to it. The test page says I have successfully installed the printer too.&nbsp;Network discovery is ON on both computers so that shouldn't be the problem either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't seem to find a fix here.</p>
