<h2>            The Fallen quest bug - Odahviing won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t talk to me</h2>
                    
<p>I've seen this glitch referenced on the PC side of things, but I haven't heard if this is happening to anybody else on a console.</p>

<p>In the quest "The Fallen", I've arranged a trap for the dragon Odahviing at Dragonsreach. &nbsp;He responds to my shout, and Dragonrend brings him down onto the palace's main porch. &nbsp;He is quickly trapped, but nothing else happens. &nbsp;He just sits there glaring
 at me. &nbsp;I can fight him, reducing him to zero health which causes him to rear back (clipping through the dragon trap) before he re-enters the trap animation. &nbsp;At no point in this does it let me speak to him to advance the story.</p>

<p>Does anyone else know what causes this bug, and what (if anything) I can do to move forward? &nbsp;PC players can force a state in the game using a console command, but that's not exactly something we can do on the XBox.</p>

<h2>            Icons of Store UWP apps are not correctly displayed anywhere. How to fix this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Icons of UWP apps are not being shown correctly in the taskbar, app list in the Settings app and most other places. This problem started sometime ago with Windows 10 Anniversary update. I didn't do anything about it then. However the problem still persists
 after Creators update. Icons of normal applications are displayed correctly. Only the UWP app icons are affected. Any fix for this?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you've mentioned that it is an ongoing issue, this could due to a broken system file that affects the Windows Explorer. We'd like to know the following information and help you as we move:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which version or build of Windows device are you using? To know, press Windows + R to open the Run window. Type WINVER and press Enter. A new window will open showing the version and build number of your Windows device.</li><li>To avoid repetition, can you provide us with all the troubleshooting steps that you've done so far?<br />

<p>I have Windows version 1709, build 16299.64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't done anything about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Classic Shell installed. Uninstalled it and nothing happened. Though the problem did not occur due to Classic Shell installation. I had been running it since a long time with no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't bother me much then, but now it kind of looks ugly. </p>

    <title>Change Computer Name and User Folders - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denmarfl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change Computer Name and User Folders</h2>
                    <p>Just purchased a Desktop with Windows8&nbsp; (not 8.1).&nbsp; Why should something so simple appear to be so hard to accomplish?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the 1st Bootup of in8....I responded to all the questions filling in the requested information.&nbsp; I don't recall being asked to establish a Computer Name.&nbsp; I completed all the initials steps.&nbsp; When my Win8 PC Boots up I see my real name.....ie "Bob
 Smith" and all my prior Windows PC's have always showed the Computer name I gave Them&nbsp; ie "Desktop XPS".&nbsp; Also, when I open C:\users...I see my "real name" whereas I want to see the Computer name...."Desktop XPS"&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have none some research and found an article where you go to "netplwiz (which I used to turn off the requirement to bootup by entering a Password)....changing the Name there, then going to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList"&nbsp;
 and changing C:\users\my real name" to C:users\the PC name I wish to use".&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My 1st try I only changed the name using the registry change...when I re-booted my Windows8 Tiles screen was Blank.&nbsp; I went back to the Registry Key and changed it back to my real name, on Reboot all was fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then tried changing my real name to the selected Computer name using "Netplwiz"...and, the registry Key.&nbsp; On Reboot the PC started fine, Windows8 Tile screen was fine......&nbsp; Thought I had it made.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I opened C:\users....I saw the original Folder with my Real Name and a new Folder with my selected Computer name.&nbsp; When I opened the C;\users\realName" folder...there were many sub folders.&nbsp; When I opened C;\users\PCname...there were NO Folders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had expected that the Folder C:\users\Realname....would have been changed to C:\users\PCname.....and did not expect to see both folders.&nbsp; Not sure how this was going to effect my PC.....since now there were 2 C:\users\xxx folders...I opted to go back and
 reverse what I had done....putting my real name back in using netplwiz and changing the&nbsp;Registry key back to C:\users\myrealname.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So all is back to how it was originally created..ot at least it appears to be so, all is running.....I did delete the c:\users\PCname Folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My goal was to get my real name not to display on this Win8 PC, not only at Bootup but also in the C:\users\ Folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there an easy sure way to accomplish my goal without the need of creating new accts\copying files and Folders?</p>

            <p>The Users folder has always shown your username as the folder name (going back to Windows 95 and Windows NT).&nbsp; It has never shown your PC name under the Users folder (if it did, then you just used your computer name
<em>as your </em>username).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To change your computer name, use the System Dialog (this is also been the same since Windows 95).&nbsp; A quick way to access this is
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fskeene.net%2fanswers%2fwin8.jpg" />+R to show the Run box, then run <strong>
sysdm.cpl</strong> to show the System Properties dialog.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d4fe38f-6b67-45a7-803a-f40269f40ad3" /></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>While the username you use to login to Windows can be changed, as well as the display name as it appears in various places (like the login screen), the folder inside C:\Users (<em>formerly c:\documents and settings\</em>) cannot be changed.&nbsp; This isn't new,
 this also goes back to Windows 95.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The only supported way to change that folder is to create an account with the name you want. The username is used to name the folder (just like always).</p>

            Your "New" computer does not have enough RAM.<br />
<br />
Vista requires a "Minimum" of 1Gbs to run properly, but still at a slow speed.<br />
<br />
You need a minimum of 2Gbs of RAM.<br />
<br />
And with a 40Gb Hard drive, very soon you will have no free space on it.<br />
<br />
Bigger Hard drive, and more RAM is required<br />

<h2>            OK Microsoft, get ready for the rant of your life.</h2>
                    <p>Here we go...</p>
<p>
</p><p>&lt;removed&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, that feels much better. Please Microsoft cease to update the operating system on my computer without my consent. It is hindering my ability to work and can cause out breaks of anger. especially in high stress situations (like having an assignment I need
 to turn in).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to note that Lenovo is also a pain. I have gone to them several times complaining about my thinkpad and how slow it has become over the last year due to wear and tear on the hard drive. You know what they do? They keep me on the phone for two hours
 telling me I need to do a systems check before they more forward in the process of fixing my computer. Even after the process has been completed they only replace my screen and initially attempt to bill me out to a local tech firm that does not accept the
 insurance I bought for the system. I even had next day service and from day one of the problem to day 18, nobody showed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am writing this complaint from a lab Mac computer in the engineering building I am working from. I must sadly say I will now be switching to Mac as the services I received for my phone were exceptional and I would expect the same service to carry over
 to my so to be new Mac Book Pro. Good buy windows, you were great when I could actually do work with you.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely, </p>
<p>
</p><p>ex-windows user&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: They took away my profanity because so many customers have gone to there forums and sworn up the wall how pissed they are about the new system. &nbsp;I had a cuss word in a apple question and guess what? They didn't filter it out. Probably because so few
 people ever swear on there forums its not necessary. **** **** your **** **** software &lt;removed&gt;</p>

            <p>To prevent Windows 10 from downloading (and installing) updates automatically, just change your wifi connection from unmetered to metered (Settings --&gt; Network &amp; Internet --&gt; Advanced Options). Windows won't download updates automatically if it thinks it
 is using a cellular data connection.</p>

            <p>This dosn't solve the problem. &nbsp;This is a workaround that ONLY applies to those using wifi. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I don't mind the auto-updates, but I have multiple computers, so if something crappy happens to my windows machine, I'll switch to my Mac or Linux machines and carry on with my day. &nbsp;I don't think most people have that luxury. &nbsp;MS needs to recognize
 that this is a real problem that deserves a real solution.</p>

            This is a temp solution to a problem (Feature?!) that did not exist version ago. Microsoft, by trying to solve problems with outdated software (Noble cause!) essentialy made certain fraction of PC's unusable, with basically ZERO chance to fix it, even
 if you know how. Here, have a link: https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/3g2hnz/windows_10_autoupdate_fail_and_what_i_am_going_to/

            <p>Dear Microsoft;</p>
<p>In 2015 I left for a vacation and upon my return I booted my computer and everything was as I left it. About 3 weeks later I got an "update" to my operating system that left me with a black screen and a blinking cursor, thats it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not, in the imperfect words of the english language tell you how utterly angry and frustrated I was to have your update make my desktop computer that had my taxes, personal finance information, my resume, every document and application I had on it.
 &nbsp;You turned my Sony Viao into a brick! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent over 10 hours with different tech supports, 40 hours trying to methodically diagnose trouble shoot the problem from the thousands of other users that experienced this horrid upgrade. I paid for a tech to come out and trouble shoot it, I bundled it
 up and hauled it to a store and all they wanted to do was re-format the hard drive. I still to this day struggle with the things I have lost, and get angry and frustrated every time I have to re-buy software or transcribe from paper copies or dig through old
 paper files when I had it all organized on my computer, the one you made a brick. I curse your name and rail at the outragiousness of your &nbsp;willy-nilly installation of an update that hosed my computer. I curse Microsoft every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I called Microsoft I got the run around over and over. You see I bought the Sony Viao and it had Vista on it, which I could never get to hold a network connection. So I
 the restore function, so when I tried to back out of the nasty, putrid update you infected my computer and my life with, I could neither go back to vista or forward with the newer version I purchased. Very bad regression testing on your part!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I called Microsoft tech support I got an oh well, too bad for you answer. &nbsp;Even when I purchased the upgrade to the operating system direct from Microsoft, &nbsp;they wanted to have the license key, which was on my now brick of a computer! They refused to
 help back me out of the mess of your creation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, My brother, a Linux expert, after shaking his head at the fact that I even used a Microsoft based product, updated the boot order and promptly booted my computer to Linux. I was able to retrieve my files but not all my software programs. &nbsp;After
 looking at the update he determined that the reason it hosed the operating system is that you tried to install the 64bit version to my 32bit Sony Viao.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I make my living with computers and have been a very loyal Microsoft user for decades and decades since DOS. Now every time I think of Microsoft I get red in the face angry and want to reach through the screen and shake who ever pushed out that untested
 mess to my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have my Sony Viao which now has Linux on it. &nbsp;We tried to re-purpose it as a server and relegate it to the server closet, but every device, phones and tablet can see it on the network except the windows based laptop with the tiny screen I now use.
 One more stick in the eye from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Curse you Microsoft and your crappy QA department and untested code! You owe me at least $10,000. for the computer, time and effort to restore my data.</p>

            Those idiots at Microsoft had the nerve to mess with my SD card. I tried installing Windows 10 IoT Core on an SD card (big mistake) and then put it in my Raspberry Pi 3. All I got was a red light, meaning it couldn't read the SD card. I tried another SD
 card. It wouldn't read that one, either. I tried it on my trusty, older Raspberry Pi. It worked. Either the SD card broke my Raspberry Pi 3, or it broke over time. I erased Windows 10 IoT core, and you know what those sh**s at Microsoft did? They made the
 installer format my 8gb SD card in such a way that the storage was permanently 64mb. I tried every combination of formatting the SD card, but it would only go up to 64mb. I was PISED 🔫😠. I didn't call Microsoft yet, but I'm pretty sure they'll try to sell
 me some crap (like they usually do with most of their products). I mostly use Mac and Ubuntu now. I'm never buying anything from Microsoft again.&nbsp;

<h2>            Error 1406 Registry Key &#92;HWXInk.E-Ink problem</h2>
                    I have&nbsp;Window Vista Home Premium on this (sons) laptop.&nbsp; I downloaded my 2003 Microsoft office Student edition.&nbsp; Worked fine for a week, then I removed the 2007 Excel&nbsp;sample tryout software from the laptop and now I can't use my 2003.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
While windows is configuring&nbsp;Microsoft Windows Office 2003 edition&nbsp;it stops and<br />
I get:<br />
Error 1406. Setup cannot write the value to the registry key \HWXInk.E-Ink .&nbsp; Verify&nbsp;that you have sufficient permissions to access the registry or contact Microsoft Prod Supp services (PSS) for assist. For information about how to contact PSS see C:\Program

<br />
I really need to use the software since I'm away from home and didn't bring my desktop.<br />
Any help appreciated.

            Hello Rocndave,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting.&nbsp; It seems that your install of Office 2003 has some corrupt files.&nbsp; To possibly correct this issue, I would suggest that you reinstall Office 2003 to replace the missing/corrupt files and Registry entries.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Please let me know if this helps you.

<p>I found the problem. I had downloaded a Theme a while ago via the link on Theme page and it had re set my screen saver to go blank after 1 minute. I didn't notice this change. I have never used a screen saver since W XP and I guess the default since W7 is
 for it to be off. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure who does the themes but all of them apparently will set this 1 minute blank to on. I tried a few others too. I you folks here have away to offer feedback it would be nice if they leave the screen saver off. After all they are offering these wonderful
 desktop backgrounds and then shutting them off after 1 minute? Makes no sense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to anyone &nbsp;who download and open the extra Themes be aware that they make a few global changes to your personal settings. Like sound and screen savers for one. Easy to fix, but this had me spend about 4 hours trying to sort it out over the last month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5e955b02-3876-47e8-8d84-8806a02d380b" title="YorkJL">YorkJL</a>,</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. For us to further assist you, we would like to know more about this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Just want to make sure, you are using the docking station. Am I correct? Please see photo below.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5dbaac07-604d-4462-ab19-c9f1e9962dcf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5dbaac07-604d-4462-ab19-c9f1e9962dcf?upload=true" /></a>2.
 Is this working before without any issue?</p>
<p>3. When did this issue occur?</p>
<p>4. Does the issue occur every time you connect a removable drive to the USB 3.0 port? How about the USB 2.0 port?</p>
<p>5. Have you tried to use another removable drive to connect to the USB port?</p>
<p>6. Have you tried to connect your removable drive to the Surface itself?</p>
<p>7. What windows version and OS build that is currently installed on your Surface Pro 2?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Looking forward for your response.</p>

<h2>            CD&#47;DVD drive not found in Windows 7</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron 1545 Laptop.&nbsp; I did a clean install of Windows 7 (x32 Edition) and since then my CD/DVD drive is nowhere to be found except for in BIOS and when I manually eject the drive it will pop up for a few seconds.&nbsp; It is a TSST corp DVD+-RW
 T5-L633B ATA Device.&nbsp; Dell released a driver for the problem but since my computer can't find the drive it will not download the driver.&nbsp; It will only show up in device manager for a few seconds when I eject it but then it disappears again and will not reappear
 unless I eject it again.&nbsp; When I put a disk in there then the disk will show up but that's about it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have tried deleting the upper and lower registry and I also tried the disable integrity checks suggestion with no success.

            Same problem with my inspiron 1545 laptop.<br />
<br />
see microsoft kb975270. refers to ts-l633b incompatability with adaptive link power management in win 7.<br />
<br />
drive firmware is available on dell website. Problem is installing it when computer thinks drive is not there. some friends had to revert to vista in order to flash the drive.<br />
<br />
Firmware was not available when I originally had the problem so had to use the powercfg workaround. I later flashed my drive when it became available.

<h3> chewiegdy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 &#34;We couldn&#39;t complete the updates, Getting ready to retry, Don&#39;t turn off your computer&#34;</h2>
                    <p>On Oct 20th 2015, I went to reboot my computer and it said it had updates to perform. &nbsp;It has not come back from that reboot or given me the option to restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That evening I saw it saying ""We couldn't complete the updates, Getting ready to retry, Don't turn off your computer". So, I left it running all night. &nbsp;When I got up, 8 hours later, it said&nbsp;"Rebooting" and was spinning. I came back 2 hours later and it
 was still there "Rebooting" since it did not have the "Don't turn off your computer warning" I went ahead and tried a hard reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the system booted it tried to run the updates again and then said&nbsp;"We couldn't complete the updates, Getting ready to retry, Don't turn off your computer" It has been this way for 2 more hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? I looked up booting into a safe mode or system restore mode and apparently that is no longer an option from just a keystroke. You need to actually boot and then restart into the system restore prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<h3> santoriansnapple  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 driving me crazy.</h2>
                    <p>I have been around since windows 3.1, I thought Vista was bad, but windows 10 is the CRAPPIEST thing I have ever seen.</p>
<p>It's bad enough there's several setting options missing (like automatic updates), but after every single update there's something that goes screwy in the system that makes me spend least an hour trying to fix.</p>
<p>One time was the power button from the windows menu. It just dissapeared. Took me couple hour to figure out.</p>
<p>Last one, just today, the clock disapeared from the taskbar. Took me an hr to find it, but it displays letters instead of numbers for the time. The date displays correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is not the worse thing with updates. WHY THE HELL does it take half hour to one hour to install updates? Everything that windows 10 updates or installs takes forever. As I said, I've been around since windows 3.1. I never seen a system that took
 so long to update/install. I'm talking 3-4 times than what I've seen in previous systems. And they were far from perfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never seen a system to load this slowly, this windows is loaded with so much crap, the computer is virtually unusable for the first 5-10 minutes as it churns through 10,000 services to load. I have a very fast computer, and still, I open the task manager
 and I watch for 5 minutes how my CPU, disk, and memory is at 100% from the services windows is loading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then there's the freezing, every few minutes everything freezes, it's only half a second, but it's so annoying. From searching the internet this is a pretty common issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is absolutely ridiculous how poorly this is made.</p>

<p>Alexei,</p>
<p>These are all common issues that you can find many others have them by doing a quick search.</p>
<p>Look, as I said it before, I have been around since windows 3.1. Bottom line is: I NEVER spent so much time upgrading, updating, fixing things as with Windows 10.</p>
<p>So either I have become an idiot over night, either Windows 10 is so far off from the previous ones that I'm just lost, or it is the crappiest thing on earth.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but let me repeat again: I started with win 3.1, and went through ALL of them in the last 25 years, but I never been more frustrated with any one than I am with this. And GOD KNOWS none of them were stellar pieces of software. I've
 got more grief for windows 10 in last years and a half than I got from all others in 23 years. Does that say anything?<br />

<p>So what's that garble where the time should be then? Hardware issue? This happened RIGHT after windows did latest update an hr or so again. Didn't touch anything, just clicked "update and restart". After half an hr (this was an update, not an upgrade), no
 clock, after half an hr, finally got it back: like that. Searching the internet it seems I'm not the only one.</p>

<p>You hit the nail on the head Windows 10 is terrible and the updates&nbsp; are the worst I have ever seen.&nbsp; Most importantly you don't even get a choice to install them or not.&nbsp; I have many PC's running Windows 10 and almost all of them are unstable after updates.&nbsp;
 My only solution is to move to a Linux distro.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Consider that Windows 10 is installed on more than 500 million devices. Also read the professional journals, written by the folks who understand technology,&nbsp; and see all the interesting things that people are doing with Windows 10. Perhaps you wonder: So
 many people are successful with Windows 10, and I can't even get it off the ground.</p>

<p>Gee Bulldog - sorry to rain on your fanboy parade!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am only stating my opinion and in my opinion Windows 10 is the biggest mess ever created by man.&nbsp; You can love it all you want, but I'm moving all of my PC's, (and I have a lot of them) over to Linux Mint.&nbsp; I have been doing trials on Mint and have found
 it to be stable and it doesn't force updates on you when you don't want them.&nbsp; It also runs everything I want it to run.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's logically laid out, is lean to run and just doesn't get in my way.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, on one of my Windows 10 machines I was doing business work, (financials) and windows 10 started running it's weekly update and&nbsp; blew away my session while corrupting my desktop.&nbsp;&nbsp; I never asked it to do an update while I was working.&nbsp; The only way
 to solve the problem was to hard boot the machine.&nbsp; Luckily, my financial files were still in tact.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have over 30 years of technology experience and know what I'm doing, so don't patronize me.&nbsp; If you love Windows, great!, but stop chastizing others who don't.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll let you go on with your Windows 10 love fest and won't bother you any longer.&nbsp;
</p>

                    <p>Hi -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I noticed that there were 3 transactions with Skype on my paypal account, all for 25EUR each. When trying to contact Paypal, they indicated that it's a Skype issue, but I have zero transactions even showing up in my transaction history and do not have
 automatic reload authorized or even as an option (there is zero billing information in my account).&nbsp; How can I get Skype and Paypal to work together to credit me the 75EUR?????</p>

<h2>            Windows Updates infinitely hang on my Windows XP Pro SP3</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows updates persistently hang on (Installation) phase instantly right after starting the installation task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I tried to upgrade Windows Installer to v4.5 but no luck - the same behavior.</p>
<p>2. I went further and enabled Windows Installer logging. I noticed that installer continuesly attempts to delete a registry key which fails and gets the msiexec into infinite loop.<br />
===</p>

....<br />
===</p>
<p>3. I used procmon to figure out which registry key it was. It turned out that msiexec attempts to delete HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\*FF1CE}* keys (these are office reg keys) and persistently fails with error code 0xC000017D
 error (STATUS_NO_LOG_SPACE). To note that I have more than 10GB free on my system disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Manual deletion of the Key does not help&nbsp; - the next time msiexec fails in the same manner on deleting the next key.</p>
<p>5. To note that before running wu all these keys look OK in registry and deletable. Once msiexec gets into the situation where it inifinitely attempts to delete the reg key, that key is not manually deletable any longer even after rebooting the machine.
 Manual deletion of such key using rescue disks helps to pass that item but msiexec fails on deleting next one (#4).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts what I can try? Any your comments/help will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Tigran</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I localized the issue to the following extend:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Windows XP Professional SP3. <br />
<br />
I am logged-in with administrator user. I am permanently not being able to delete certain Office 2007 keys from the<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/253161-45-error-0xc000017d-deleting-registry-keys#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>registry</span></span></a>(using
 simple regedit now) even if office is already uninstalled. To note that I am able to delete other keys.<br />
<br />
I removed the antivirus software from the machine to make sure it is not the cause. I receive a generic error message "Error while deleting the key".<br />
<br />
When I monitored the deletion process with the procmon I observed the following error code: 0xC000017D.<br />
<br />
To note that I have more than 20GB available free space on my <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/253161-45-error-0xc000017d-deleting-registry-keys#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>system</span></span></a>disk. Also observing the stack I haven't noticed
 any 3rd party <a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/253161-45-error-0xc000017d-deleting-registry-keys#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>driver</span></span></a>involved in the deletion. Stack is below.
<br />
To note that installers and windows updates permanently fail ion the same keys with the same problem. I runned full chkdsk but it didn't help to resolve the issue either.<br />
<br />
Please, help to resolve the problem. I already spent many hours to solve the miracle.<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No antiviruses are present at the moment. MS forefront is the only related software running. Disabling it does not change the situation.</p>
<p>2. Has a(nother) Norton or McAfee application ever been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, McAfee was installed but currently it is uninstalled though problem still exists.</p>
<p>3. Did a Norton or McAfee free-trial come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not recall it now.</p>
<p>4. What version of Office is installed (e.g., Office 2003 SP3)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Office 2007 was installed. Currently it is removed but problem still persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Action is performed but no help. Please, refer to my simplified case where no WU is involved. Simply attempt to delete remaining office reg keys fail with error 0xC000017D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any clues why I see error 0xC000017D? Note that I can successfully delete other reg keys and have more than 20GB free space on my system drive.</p>

<p>A1. Forefront includes realtime anti-virus protection.</p>
<p>A2a. Were the McAfee application and Forefront BOTH installed when this problem started?</p>
<p>A2b. Was the McAfee subscription still current when you uninstalled it or had it already expired?</p>
<p>A2c. After you uninstalled the McAfee application, did you also&nbsp;download/run the<a href="http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</a>?</p>
<p>Comments:</p>
<p>• Ideally, the McAfee application should have been uninstalled AND the removal tool run BEFORE Forefront was installed.</p>
<p>• If the McAfee subscription had already expired by the time Forefront was installed, chances are that Forefront is not protecting the computer.</p>

<p>I stopped all 3 services of Forefront at the moment and verified with Process Explorer that no other process is running by forefront. Still no success. Also ran fltmc from console to make sure no filter is present in the kernel other than procmon. This is
 the case. Though I understand that this does not yet eliminate the change of other non-filter kernel modules get involved in the IRP stack of the delete call.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can you suggest as the next step to attack the 0xC000017D error? Should I attempt to look the kernel stack from WinDbg to see what drivers are involved when the issue occurs?</p>
