    <title>Storing Entire User Profile on Removable USB Flash Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ja1122  say:</h3>
<h2>            Storing Entire User Profile on Removable USB Flash Drive</h2>
                    I'm looking for a way to store my entire User Profile on a removable drive (USB Flash Drive, SD card, etc.) so that I can keep all my settings, documents, etc. with me at all times - partially for security, but also for ease of switching from laptop to
 desktop.<br />
<br />
Network roaming profiles have worked in the past, but my laptop is often without Internet now, and even with Wifi hotspots, accessing large amounts of data over remote connections isn't preferable.<br />
<br />
Simply mapping folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to the removable drive isn't very preferable either, as application preferences aren't kept on the drive with this method - bookmarks, chat histories, and applications that store settings in the registry wouldn't
 store their settings on the removable drive.<br />
<br />
Changing my user profile directory to the removable drive sounds like it would work, but if I remember correctly, Windows doesn't flush NTUSER.DAT until system shutdown, so "safely removing" a USB disk containing such a file sounds like it would be unsafe (although
 I haven't tested this yet).<br />
<br />
Full OS virtualization sounds like a good method as it guarantees consistent environments across different machines, but that requires storing an entire OS and several applications on the removable drive, which is substantially slower than the hard drives,
 as well as requiring several gigs of extra storage.<br />
<br />
What would be the correct and most optimal way of accomplishing this goal?

            Hi ja1122,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Vista Support forum,<br />
<br />
In this case, it seem like using Virtual Machine would be the best options for you.&nbsp; Storing the OS on a separate drive and using VM to run it.&nbsp; Storing profile on a USB device will only cause issues due to the fact that its more prone to accident, corruption
 and slow access.&nbsp; It would not be the optimal way to store your profile for security either.&nbsp; The choice is still up to you.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps,<br />

            It has no any trick to be fast? And the only trick is that just do faster. But you know, if you have many videos and editing to do, I don't think you can make it as a whole video. I said it because this same thing happened to me. I too was having many
 videos to do and it took a long time to make it as movie but after my work &nbsp;i tried to make it as a one movie but it didn't worked. This was for fast time and after some years I made another long movie and it didn't worked. Then after few days I made a short
 movie which doesn't took much time to make. To say the truth, &nbsp;it worked.

            <p>I stop every couple of minutes then put them all together in Movie maker. It's been<strong> 1 1/2 hours
</strong>and it's <strong>not even half done</strong>. It's a 4 minute section. I just don't have time for this. I would LOVE to know why it has to prepare these videos. It's already on the screen.

            <p>Hello Heatherg23 and&nbsp;Lospearl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. First, I would like to apologize for the delay in responding to your inquiry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the issue of preparing the video, Movie Maker needs to prepare these videos so that when you use it for another time, the data has been stored and the editing of the video will be faster as it loads the data itself within Movie Maker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the preparation of the videos being slow, this depends on how long and how big the file size of the video that you're using. Yes, the video might be short but, if the file has been recorded on a high end camera that has a bigger resolution, then the
 videos preparation will be slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have other inquiries regarding Movie Maker. We'll be here to provide assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            USB 2 WEB camera incorrect recognition</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have installed a USB 2.0 web camera on my PC with Vista 64bit and it worked fine. The camera driver automatically recognized by Vista and installed from Microsoft through internet connection. It installed as Lenovo Q350 usb 2 web camera. When I tried to install
 the same camera onto another computer with Vista 32 bit it has been recognized another camera driver Look312 and didn't work with Skype although Vista told that device installed successfully and works. With Windows 7 it recognizes as a Lenovo Q350 usb 2 web
 camera device and works fine. My question: how can I install this camera on PC with Vista 32 bit installed? Please don't suggest me reinstall the Vista with 64 bit version. I need camera to be work on Vista 32 bit.<br />
Thanks.<br />

</p><p>After looking around online, i cannot find any solutions to this problem. I've tried to find what the dll is but can't find any information about it. I then ran a full scan with AVG anti-virus and malwarebytes but couldn't find any threats. I'm hoping it
 isn't a virus or malware that is evading my AVG and malwarebytes. It would be very much appreciated if someone could help me out :)</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a new Asus desktop computer with Windows 8. Whenever I try to run Asus MX Suite( asus video easy and asus music maker), I get an error message&nbsp;stating the program could not be started. It's possible that the installation folder may be damaged. Reinstalling

            <p>Hi Monica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have tried all of the steps provided in this thread and still issue persist, I would suggest you&nbsp;<span>to re-register Store app again by following the steps provided below and check if it fixes the issue.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run the command from the link to re-register Store app:</span></p>
<p><span><span>In order to
<strong><span>re-register Store app you </span>
</strong>need to&nbsp;run the below mentioned command in the command prompt.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Press the Windows key + X.</span></li><li>
<span>Select <strong><span>Command Prompt (Admin).</span></strong></span></li><li>
<span>Type the mentioned command: <strong><span>powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\News360\AppxManifest.xml&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong>and hit
<strong><span>enter</span></strong></span><strong><span>.</span></strong></li></ul>
<p><strong><span>For more clarification you may refer to the article mentioned below.</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/notime/archive/2013/10/21/10458031.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/notime/archive/2013/10/21/10458031.aspx</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly.
 Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, you can
 refer to the following steps to back the registry files on the computer:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
Press <strong>Windows and R</strong> keys to open the run box.</li><li>
Type ‘<strong>regedit’</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong> from the keyboard.</li><li>
Open the <strong>file</strong> option on the menu bar.</li><li>
Click on <strong>Export</strong> and save the file with a name on the desktop.</li><li>
If you want to restore the file, you can do so by double clicking the file that you have saved on the desktop.</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to provide the event viewer log files to find out the exact cause that is causing the issue. &nbsp;Follow the steps to collect the log files:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
Go to the Start Screen, type in Event Viewer. This will bring up the <strong>Event Viewer</strong> tile, Click to open the event viewer.
</li><li>
In the left pane, expand out <strong>Windows Logs</strong>. Click on <strong>Application log</strong> and highlight the first event in the log and use your arrow keys to scroll down.
</li><li>
Most of your event will be Information. You may see Yellow Warnings or Red Errors. If you see any red error, you can double click on it to bring it up and copy the contents to a document.</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Hope this would do the trick. If issue still persists post
</span>back with current status of your computer and result of proposed suggestion, we will be glad to assist you.</span></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<h2>            Missing Api-ms-win-shcore-scaling-l1-1-1.dll causes my win7 x64 system not able to run the compiled exe file</h2>
                    Dear Sirs&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Recently I run the exe file compiled from visual studio 2012.&nbsp;<br />
The failure comes out due to the missing <strong>Api-ms-win-shcore-scaling-l1-1-1.dll</strong> which is detected by dependency walker.<br />
Operating System is <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Win7 x64</strong></span></em>.&nbsp;<br />
I'm wondering where to get the missing dll or any solutions for this issue.<br />
(Only x86 version Api-ms-win-shcore-scaling-l1-1-1.dll can be found...)<br />
<br />
Appreciate your help sincerely!!<br />
<br />

            <p>Your motherboard does not support win7 it only supports win versions up to WinXP, and no you cannot integrate anything that win8 provides.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your partition sizes are far too small for any meaningfull use of either win7 or win8</p>
<p>If you wish to update your graphics you would need to install a dedicated graphics card that supports win7 or win8</p>

<h3> tr0lldem0rt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Steward Lydia</h2>
                    
<p>So as it says in the title, Lydia is my steward. I live at Lakeview but resently i`ve notice shes not there. Ever. It`s like shes just upped and left. Last time I saw her I gave her a long list of improvements to make and trotted off to burn Whiterun to
 the ground. My house is geting updated everytime I go back but shes just no where to be seen. I`ve run round the surounding area and theres not even a corpse. I havn`t checked Sky Haven (shes a blade) or Whiterun since I dont think shes goes there as a Steward.
 Any ideas anyone?</p>

<p>Not sure about all that as her real "Home" is your Whiterun house "Breezehome". The other upstairs "owned bed" is Lydia's. Whenever I release her she returns to Breezehome. It usually takes her 2 game days no matter where I release her from. I treid to follow
 her once from Heljarchen and as soon as she left through the door she disappeared. Sure enough, 2 days later was at Breezehome.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Now the fact that your destroying Whiterun may have something to do with her disappearance.</p>
<p>Not real sure why some of us insist on giving the hired help two tasks in this game. Clearly Bethesda doesn't have the knowhow to seperate that sort of thing. Why else would we still get guards telling us over and over again about locations that we have
 cleared multiple times. Or why would we not get an option to accept the new housecarls if we saw the need for one.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>What makes me wonder is why didn't Mjoll ask to take the job as soon as the home was ready, she was my follower when I had the first manor ready. She didn't have the dialogue to do so. Yarra imediately offered to take the job and she wasn't really my follower
 at the time. She showed up at Lakeview on her own and was wondering the property. When I questioned her about being there, the first line of dialogue was for her to be the steward. Bethesda does things like this to mess with our heads.</p>

<p>At my first home in Falkreath, I have Lydia as my steward and Rayya as housecarl. &nbsp;When I brought Rayya to the house first, she offered to be steward, but I kept her in the role of housecarl. &nbsp;I then went to Breezehome and had Lydia follow me to Lakeview
 where I made her steward. &nbsp;I did this to ensure that I would have the two of them there to protect the family when I'm away. &nbsp;I'm not sure exactly what happens when I'm not there, but that's why I did it. &nbsp;Both of them seem to be there whenever I return home,
 and so far everyone is still alive, so they must be doing something right I guess. &nbsp;To Sc0ttsw0rth... I'm not sure why Lydia would be leaving Lakeview to return to Breezehome in your game and not in mine. &nbsp;I have not done any of the CW quests yet though, and
 though I owned the house, I never lived at Breezehome. &nbsp;Maybe of of these factors makes a difference in how she behaves??</p>

<p>that is what i did, i have Lydia as steward and kept Rayya as the housecarl, because the more people protecting the house the better. I did have just Fendal as my steward before i was able to have a housecarl aswell, and he got killed well i was away in
 a cave so watch out. atleast you know Lydias not dead you havent had a letter from the couier yet.</p>

<p>If you don't own Breezehome she will return to Dragonreach if she somehow was dismissed by the game or dumped you (which as far as i know is only possible if you leave a follower waiting somewhere for three days)... From your comments Scotty, I think you
 probably know this. Are you sure she did not die in the battle for Whiterun? </p>
<p>That girl has a penchant for finding trouble, she is my wife and currently @ Proudspire, I came home from adventuring a few months ago and found a dead a-hole just inside my front door, cups and bowls scattered about. I assume she stomped him a new mudhole
 after he somehow got in. Any thoughts of ditching her went out the window right then, when I finally adopt I think my kids will be safe as bugs in a rug with Lydia to look after them.</p>

<h2>            My hotmail account was stolen</h2>
                    <p>original title: A stolen hotmail account</p>
<p>My hotmail account was stolen&nbsp;by some bad people. They changed the password, blocked the ways for me to change or reset my password. I cannot access my account anymore. And these people use my account to send emails to my contacts asking for money. I tried
 the 'Account Password Recovery' in the<a href="https://windowslivehelp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Windows Live Solution Center</span></a>&nbsp;to try to get the access to my account and delete all the important&nbsp;information, close the account. But,&nbsp;the reply was
 they cannot validate my ID after I&nbsp;provided&nbsp;all the necessary information about this account.</p>
<p>I am very desperated now.&nbsp;I want to stop the thief from using my account and info. in there, but the Help Center cannot help. I even cannot close my account. What should I do? Do I just wait to see those people&nbsp;use my&nbsp;account&nbsp;to do things bad???? Help, please!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for your time to help!</p>
<p>Seems there is no possibility to recover my stolen account but taking steps to report&nbsp;the incident.</p>
<p>I am so depressed because of this incident. At least Hotmail should take some actions to stop those theives from doing more bad things&nbsp;using the stolen account, like freeze or block or close the account, if they say they cannot validate our ID, though, we
 are the actual victims&nbsp;and suffering from this incident a lot.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this difficult 'account password recovery' process will block the REAL owners of the accounts out and allow the theives freely use our accounts. Feels this difficult 'account password recovery' process protect the heckers not the real owners.
 Because the fact this&nbsp;'account password recovery' process brings is: we, the real owners are blocked out of the account and in pain, and those who stole our account are really protected.</p>
<p>Don't know&nbsp;what to say about this.....</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Save Movie on Windows Movie Maker&#58; Corrupt Files, Availability, Error&#58; 0x87160139</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have Windows Movie Maker 2012 and all my video drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>I saved all my media files onto my OneDrive, rather than onto my actual computer. They all play fine as a movie maker Project, but twice now I have been prevented from saving it as a Final Movie, because of an Error 0x87160139.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I double click the media files with a yellow triangle it says that they are corrupt or unavailable, which doesn't make sense because they work great as a project. All the media files are either mp4's, jpg's, or png's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It needs to save as a final movie in two days. Thanks in advance. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read on an old forum from 2010 that maybe Windows Movie Maker doesn't accept movies that have been split or trimmed, because then they have two media files under the same name. I have been splitting and trimming movies all throughout the project (thats
 why I used Movie Maker), so hopefully this isn't the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main suspicion is that Movie Maker can't find the media files because they are all on my OneDrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

    <title>Win 10 not compatible with Webcam, etc. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s2esmith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 not compatible with Webcam, etc.</h2>
                    <p>After being bombarded by 'upgrade to wonderful Windows 10' messages at every startup I succumbed and did it. Never did I see (maybe is was in a long disclaimer, but I did not peruse those) any message that said 'after 30 days you will not be able to revert
 to your previous o/s' nor was there any message that said something like 'not all computers are fully functional with Windows 10 - please check **** or .....&nbsp; before proceeding.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have an unstable Dell Inspiron laptop with a non-functioning webcam and lots of other little problems. I did not realize this until I tried using the webcam on Skype when traveling, and of course it was &gt;30 after conversion. So, after talking with
 Tech Support (very patient and helpful - thank you Jaena B) and being told I cannot go back to Win 7, and that I must live with the problems or do reinstallations. The latter option will be hundreds of dollars and huge amount of time and headache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, why didn't MS do a better job of informing us about the revert deadline and the incompatibility potential?&nbsp; They sure put a lot of effort cramming the new version down our throats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At a loss as to what to do now as it seems there is no going back and any other step involves a huge amount of money and time...or live with lack of functions and instability under current situation.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10- I just lost start menu and taskbar</h2>
                    <p>I was working in my email. Not sure if my hand slipped on a key and lost the start menu. The windows 10 icon on the lower left of the screen will not left click...only right click. I can find Corteina and none of my programs and do not know what to do.</p>

            <p>Renee, you might be frustrated about the issue. However, the moderator seems asking about the build version of your OS because some features on Windows 10 enhanced, Specially the Windows Insider Preview.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway if your start menu didn't function try the following suggestions on the articles below:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue occurs because of the power saving features that are included in Windows. The default power plan that Windows uses for a mobile PC is the&nbsp;</span><strong>Balanced</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>power plan. To resolve this issue, we recommend
 connecting your&nbsp; laptop to a power source.</span> This switches the<span> wireless network adapter power setting in the default power plan from the&nbsp;</span><strong>Medium Power Saving</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>setting to the<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Maximum
 Performance</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>setting.</span></p>
<p>Alternatively, if you are not able to connect your computer to a power source, we recommend modifying the default power saving plan. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Power Options</span><span>&nbsp;</span>by clicking/tapping the
<strong>Start </strong>menu, tap<span>/click </span><span>Search</span>, enter<span>
</span><span>Power options</span><span>&nbsp;</span>in the search box, and tap/click<span>
</span><span>Power options</span>.</li><li>Tap&nbsp;or click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Change plan settings</span></strong>&nbsp;under the power plan that is selected. For example, if the&nbsp;<strong><span>Balanced</span></strong>&nbsp;option is selected, tap or click&nbsp;<strong><span>Change plan settings</span></strong>&nbsp;under&nbsp;<strong><span>Balanced</span></strong>.</li><li>Tap or click&nbsp;<strong><span>Change advanced power settings</span></strong>.</li><li>In the&nbsp;<strong><span>Power Options</span></strong>&nbsp;dialog box, expand&nbsp;<strong><span>Wireless Adapter Settings</span></strong>, and then expand&nbsp;<strong><span>Power Saving Mode</span></strong>.</li><li>In the list that appears next to&nbsp;<strong><span>On battery</span></strong>, tap or click&nbsp;the current setting and select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Maximum Performance</span></strong>, and then&nbsp;<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need any other assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Setting your laptop on airplane mode would sometimes cause this issue. Follow these steps to make sure that your laptop is not on airplane mode:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Select the&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>.</span> </li><li><span>Select&nbsp;</span><strong>Settings</strong><span><span>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click </span></span><strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Airplane mode</strong><span> and turn off airplane mode if it's on.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Moreover, </span></span>an outdated <span>or incompatible network adapter driver can cause connection problems.
</span><span><span>We recommend checking if you computer has the latest network adapter driver that is compatible for it. Here is how:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Device Manager</strong>, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Device Manager</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>from the list of results.</li><li>In Device Manager, select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Network adapters</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt; the network adapter name.</li><li>Press and hold (or right-click)&nbsp;the network adapter, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Update driver</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>. Follow the steps, then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Close</strong>.</li><li>After installing the updated driver, select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>button &gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Power</strong>&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Restart</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>if you're asked to restart, and
 see if that resolves the connection issue.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong><span>If Windows can’t find a new driver for your network adapter, visit the PC manufacturer’s website and download the latest network adapter driver from there. If your PC can't connect to the Internet, you'll need to download a driver
 on a different PC and save it to a USB flash drive, so you can manually install the driver on your PC. You’ll need to know the PC manufacturer and model name or number.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know if you need further help.</span></p>

    <title>Aetherial Crown ended up giving me 3 standing stone effects - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dance caravandj service  say:</h3>
<h2>            Aetherial Crown ended up giving me 3 standing stone effects</h2>
                    
<p>As cool as this is, I'm kind of hoping that it isn't a permanent effect.&nbsp; I'm afraid of a bug doing something to my game.&nbsp; I chose the crown as my reward, and when I was going to different stones to choose the ones I wanted, an extra one ended up sticking.&nbsp;
 Even with the crown off, I have the Steed Stone and Lord Stone effects, and the crown itself retained the Atronach.&nbsp; When this happened I was trying to get rid of the Atronach, because it was causing my summons to fail, and make me go invisible for a short
 time.&nbsp; The stone's effect somehow stuck to the crown, but the other two ended up with me even without the crown.&nbsp; Weird.</p>

<p>It can do this, yeah.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Mine did it at one point but it didn't last very long so I wouldn't worry about it. Just change stones a few times, take the Crown on and off a few times and you should pretty much be good.</p>

<p>I'm trying to figure out if I did something wrong as far as setting the effects. &nbsp;Do I need to be wearing the crown whenever I acquire new stone effects, or does it just know to use the one prior to your current one?</p>

<p>Back Lot,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I have the Lover Stone and Steed Stone as mine. I had the Lover at the time I completed the quest, I fast traveled to the Steed, not wearing the crown, I took the blessing, still not wearing the crown. Then I fast traveled for the Lover, put on the crown
 and THEN asked for and received the blessing of the Lover Stone. I can take off the crown at any time now and reacquire the Steed's blessing when I put it on. That is the order in which I did it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I have not seen this bug in the wiki, though I only gave it a quick glance between meetings today. I'm with CSB, chances are your third ability will not fail to show up at some point in the future, and just be gone. If it doesn't, there are less desirable
 glitches to have I suppose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Have or can you verify that the third stone is actually having an effect? Not just showing up in the "Effects" list? Best wishes in getting this resolved.</p>

<p>Geddy...I'm not sure if it was having an effect or not. &nbsp;I did end up changing stones and went back to just having one active, with one locked to the AC. &nbsp;I ended up not using the crown anyway, as I have the perk that gives me an armor bonus if I wear all
 Heavy. &nbsp;I didn't see many references to the bug either when I looked it up. &nbsp;Maybe it's not as common (or I wasn't looking hard enough)... :)</p>

<p>Sounds more like a blip than a glitch... ; )</p>

<p>Glad it is sorted. I don't use the Crown much either unless I need to some help humping my pack. It's just another augment for carrying capacity. I could switch it's blessing and I liked Katria's character, so I keep it around for sentiment.</p>

<br />
That's an interesting suggestion.&nbsp; I run with the Steed Stone as my main stone because I'm a Heavy Armor character, and it not only adds 100 to my carry weight, but makes my armor weigh nothing.&nbsp; I'm not sure if I could remove it now, with everything I carry,
 but this might be a good alternative for looting.</p>

"It's not a true crash, in the sense that the Blue Screen was initiated only because the combination of video driver and video hardware was being unresponsive, and not because of any synchronous processing exception".</b><br />
<br />
<i>Since Vista, the "Timeout Detection and Recovery" (TDR) components of the OS video subsystem have been capable of doing some truly impressive things to try to recover from issues which would have caused earlier OS's like XP to crash.</i><br />
<br />
<i>As a last resort, the TDR subsystem sends the video driver a "please restart yourself now!" command and waits a few seconds.<br />
If there's no response, the OS concludes that the video driver/hardware combo has truly collapsed in a heap, and it fires off that stop 0x116 BSOD.</i><br />
<br />
<i>If playing with video driver versions hasn't helped, make sure the box is not overheating.<br />
&nbsp;Try removing a side panel and aiming a big mains fan straight at the motherboard and GPU.<br />
&nbsp;Run it like that for a few hours or days - long enough to ascertain whether cooler temperatures make a difference.</i><br />
<br />
<span>If so, it might be as simple as dust buildup and subsequently inadequate cooling.</span><br />
<br />
<span>I would download cpu-z and gpu-z (both free) and keep an eye on the video temps</span>

            Thank you very much for you help so far. Sounds a bit more promising now i have more of an idea about what the problem is. I have just a few questions which I would find extremely helpful in resolving the problem.
<div><br />
<div>
<ul>
<li>There are no updates for my Nvidia Graphics card is there anything else I can do like roll it back? would this have any knock on effects?</li><li>Is there a safe way to remove dust, without buying any gear?&nbsp;</li><li>Whats a stable temperature for a computer to run at</li></ul>

<br />
1-BCC116 are usually heat related and your driver is current but I would still re-install the driver (they do become corrupt) as it is easier than the rest.<br />
<br />
2-If it is a laptop (116's are usually in laptops) you can get a can of compressed air and carefully blow out the vents and fan.&nbsp; Do this with the computer off, and be sure to keep the compressed air can vertical.<br />
<br />
3- A stable temp varies by computer contact the mfr for the acceptable range.<br />

<p>Hi Jody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are unable to turn off PC using power bottom also; we recommend you to remove the power card from the PC and try restating the PC again and check if it helps.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue persists after restating the system as well, I suggest you to start your computer safe mode with check if you are getting the error. If in safe mode issue didn’t persists, I suggest you to perform Clean boot in your system.<br />
Follow the below steps:</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Start your computer in safe mode.</div>
<div><br />
Refer to the below Microsoft help article, which explains; how to start your computer in safe mode.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</span></a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> Perform clean boot.</div>
<div>
<p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further reference refer the&nbsp;article <strong>Windows hangs and freezes.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2681286" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2681286</span></a><span>
</span></p>
&nbsp;
<p><span>Keep us informed whether the PC getting&nbsp;freezes is fixed or&nbsp;not. We will be&nbsp;happy to assist you further.&nbsp;</span></p>
