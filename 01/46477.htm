            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft community forums and thank you for posting the question. It looks like "Ripping : 2 tracks remaining" has been stuck on Windows Media Player.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer few questions to narrow down the issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When you insert a CD to be ripped, does any program opens automatically? <br />
<br />
2. Have you installed any third party burner software or codecs installed on the computer?
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you installed any third party codec, I will suggest you to uninstall it and check.</span></p>

<h2>            Is there a folder where the pause &#38; rewind data for live TV from Windows Media Center is being stored&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>Is there a folder where the pause-&amp;-rewind data for live TV from Windows Media Center is being stored? More to the point - how can I record the time-shift buffer in WMC?</span></p>
<p>I would like to know if it is possible to find the data Windows Media Center is storing during the watching of live TV. I am talking about the data WMC is storing by itself to enable the use of the pause-&amp;-rewind live TV function, not how to find files you
 have recorded yourself by hitting the red record button.<br />
<br />
E.g. I often have live TV playing on the computer in the background whilst I'm doing something else. Then I see or hear a brief fact/clip/segment of interest, which flashes by and I think, "I wish I had recorded that". If I rewind back to the bit I wanted to
 capture and hit record, it won't capture the part that I want, it will start recording from the point the programme has reached in real time.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know where the live TV data is being kept so I can retrieve those clips that interest me but were never recorded by me manually? I've found the 'TempRec'&nbsp;in the 'Recorded TV' folder - does anyone know of a way to convert this to video (if indeed
 that is the location where the temporary data for pause-&amp;-rewind live TV is being stored)?</p>
<p>Alternatively, is there a way to turn on a feature in WMC which automatically begins recording TV channels as soon as you switch to them? That way I can record everything then just cut out all the scenes of interest using Movie Maker. If not, are there any
 other Win7-compatible programs that will do this?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

<p>Apparently there is a way to achieve the objective. <br />
<br />
A nice gentleman from Germany has written DLLs that create a "record time-shift buffer" add-in for WindowsMedia<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fimages.intellitxt.com%2fast%2fadTypes%2f2_bing.gif" />
 Center (for Vista and XP only) which which can be found at:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://thegreenbutton.com/forums/p/38348/162083.aspx#162083" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://thegreenbutton.com/forums/p/3...83.aspx#162083</span></a><br />
<br />
For Windows 7, it would currently have to be via a 3rd party program, i.e. PowerCinema 6, which records from any point within the time-shift buffer -&nbsp;I'm not sure why Microsoft did not also integrate this feature into WMC seeing as other 3rd party programs
 have it (including EyeTV for the Mac). <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, suggestions from another forum to change the file extensions in TempSBE from .tmp to .dvr-ms and double-click the file to play the time-shift file in WMC, did not work in Windows 7 x64 (the post in that forum was in regard to Vista x64), however,
 I haven't tried it with other Windows versions - let me know if anyone's had any luck using that method.</p>
<p>Even if it had worked, I think I&nbsp;still would have preferred the ease of use and functionality of a program that does the job for me, as Power Cinema does - pity it couldn't have been WMC. What do you think?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 says my product key is being used by another computer</h2>
                    The key I am using was once used by another computer (my old computer) but then that one got trashed. I got a new computer and I installed Win8 on it. The key worked at first but then random popups saying "Activate Windows" came up. I don't need the old
 computer anymore, nor does it have anything working in it. It doesn't even have a graphics driver or a power thing. I don't want my copy of windows on that computer anymore. Any ideas on how to remove the copy from the old computer?

<h2>            Screen dimming when unplugged</h2>
                    <p>I've had this problem since I've purchased my computer but could never figure out how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's happening is when my laptop is unplugged from the charger and I turn the brightness all the way down the screen will randomly dim to near black (almost as if I had pressed the F9 dimmer key but I'm still able to see some light colors behind it) and
 will randomly switch back to being at the normal brightness again. This has never happened when my computer is plugged in though. I can turn my brightness down all the way and not have any issues. I've also tried turning on and off the "adjust screen brightness
 automatically" setting but that didn't seem to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running on Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>My laptop is a Lenovo Yoga.</p>
<p>My power settings are currently at Power Saver.</p>

<h2>            How to ruin ufc undisputed 4.</h2>
                    
<p>As if THQ didn`t ruin the game enough this time with their pathetic servers and many in game annoyances,it is now apparently EA taking over for the next one.</p>
<p>EA MMA was a terrible game that reminded me of the old sega dreamcast version of the ufc games,which if any of you played were terrible.</p>
<p>add to that EA`s tendency to shut down servers very quickly as they did with EA MMA,it really is not looking good for the next one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This news comes a few days after THQ anounce they are nearly ready to submit a patch to MS and PS, yeah can't see that happening now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Onto EA i don't think this is a bad move EA MMA would've sold more had it had a UFC license and the servers would most likely not&nbsp;have not been shut down so early as more people would likely be playing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EA only close servers that have fewer than 1% peak time online users <a href="http://www.ea.com/1/service-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ea.com/1/service-updates</a> From my experience when i went online there were very few people playing so i can understand the decision to close the servers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wether EA will build a new engine from the ground up or stick with what they've got remains to be seen, i'd like them to take their time though and listen to the community unlike THQ.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They will most likely want to get it out sooner but how about a November 2013 release to tie in with the 20 year anniversary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I guess there is more dlc due to be released soon if they are promising a patch.</p>
<p>the dlc will happen,i bet the patch doesn`t.</p>

<p>Couldn't disagree more. &nbsp;EA MMA was far superior to UFC 2009 and 2010, in both visuals and control schemes. &nbsp;The move set and variety has always been deeper in the UFC games, but I thought the core game mechanics in MMA were really well done; to me MMA felt
 way more fluid where UFC was kind of stiff and rigid by comparison.</p>
<p>I'm no EA fanboy either, they could absolutely eff this up, but I don't think they will.</p>
<p>Back to the UFC games though, what don't you like about UFC 3? &nbsp;I thought it was a huge improvement over 2009 and 2010. &nbsp;Especially with the addition of Pride mode. &nbsp;Do you just have a problem with the servers or with the game itself?</p>

<p>the servers were a joke from day one.</p>
<p>i never liked the new sub system either and most of the training games were so annoying,the gameplan option was totally pointless too.</p>
<p>as far as fighting i found it daft that some fighters totally lost abilities from he last game,such as many fighters loosing the ability to do a takedown.</p>
<p>the only thing that was wrong with 2009 was the inability to escape the thai clinch,that was never fixed.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>i was playing EA MMA &nbsp;a few weeks back and after playing ufc games their game is just awful.</p>
<p>its slow,clunky ,totally random when it comes to striking,the only nice change was the sub variations when defending and attacking them.</p>
<p>i really liked the fight night games,if they manage to find a balance between them and the current ufc games then it may be ok,if they follow the EA MMA path its doomed to fail.</p>

<p>I'm not happy at all with the news but that is the price to pay when &nbsp;you disappoint the fans . I only hope EA work with good career mode like they did in FNC without lose the focus in online. The problem with THQ since UFC 2010 was the poor focus in career
 mode ...but in UFC 3 they did it worst for focus only in online play. IMO.</p>

<p>I guess UFC 2009 Undisputed is still the last decent MMA game IMO. Less problems regarding the online servers and I &nbsp;still feel much comfortable with the controls in the game as well. I also thought that UFC 3 was an improvement towards the last several
 UFC games, until THQ never had a chance to patched the game that was consisted of bugs and glitches nor fully sort out the issues with the online servers.</p>

                    <p>I'm having some BSOD today and yesterday - about 5. It says:</p>
<p>MULTIPLE_IRP_COMPLETE_REQUESTS</p>
<p>
</p><p>All threads says the problem is LogMeIn Hamachi, but I have never had that program installed.</p>

            <p>Hi again Patrick</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found a semi stable driver. I only get BSOD ones a week or so. I think it's the best solution for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have REALLY appreciated your help. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            how to set up an email client in windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Currently have windows 7 Hotmail account but do not know how to set up an email client that appears as a message every time I attempt to send something.</p>
<p>I am not well versed with the computer thing so any assistance will be appreciated. I have the windows 7 for dummies book but each time I attempt to follow the instructions there I end up receiving a download page for windows 10, WHICH I WANT NOTHING TO
 DO WITH.</p>
<p>TRIED IT AND ALL IT CREATED WAS A NIGHTMARE FOR ME AND HAD TO DUMP AND RELOAD EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cannot say that this 97 year old approves of the way Microsoft does business these days. Sorry about the rant but I rapidly grow weary of the issues I encounter by following their suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just want to know how to set up the email client so I can send things to friends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>God Bless.</p>

            <p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that Windows 7 does not come with an e-mail client like XP (Outlook Express) or Vista (Windows Mail) did. You need to download an e-mail client such as Windows Live Mail, or Microsoft Outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can use a free online service like
 Hotmail for your e‑mail, Windows&nbsp;Live Calendar for your schedule, and the Windows&nbsp;Live People webpage for keeping track of your contacts. If you use multiple PCs or travel a lot, Windows&nbsp;Live services are a convenient way to go, because you can access all
 your information from any computer with an Internet connection.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download and install Windows Live Mail from the below link:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Windows Live</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/windows-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/windows-live</span></a></span></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

    <title>DirectX 10&#47;11 applications not working after Windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dumpster fire  say:</h3>
<h2>            DirectX 10&#47;11 applications not working after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded last week and every program that runs with DX10 or 11 no longer works, DX9 games run but 10/11 either just plain don't load, give a blank window, or in the case of Startrek Online spit out an error saying my video card does not support DX10 (GTX1050
 Ti) despite everything working perfectly fine on Win7, or Saint's Row 3 giving an error about not being able to create graphics device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried doing a clean reinstall of my video drivers, reinstalling DirectX, reinstalling some of the affected games, and nothing has worked. 3 different MS tech people tried to help with the remote assistance tool but nothing they tried worked either.
 The option to roll back to Win7 is not there so I can't do that and try the upgrade again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I'm starting to think my only option is a reinstall of windows but I really don't want to lose all my programs and settings, so any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>it's not silently blocking the games.</p>

<p>These games will run on Win10 v. 1803 as well as they did on previous Win10 versions. If the update went well</p>
<p>(generally does if you leave the machine to the update rather than <em>'go on with what you are doing'</em> as MS suggest ),</p>
<p>something that was not conflicting prior to 1803 must be conflicting now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- While it does not affect SR3 on my machine (BioShock Infinite is affected though).
<em>Steam Overlay</em> tends to steal focus </p>
<p>when using DX10/11, and will prevent some DX10/11 games from launching. This should have been apparent with</p>
<p>Win10 1709, but maybe not ?</p>
<p>Similarly, overlays for <em>Origin, U-Play</em> and similar could cause issues.
<em>Nvidias 'Experience' </em>has also been known to cause problems </p>
<p>at times, but I don't use it, so don't know if it still does.<em> Steam Community, Skype</em> and similar are all potentials as well.</p>
<p>As I mentioned above AV's can also go astray from time to time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- It&nbsp; could also be due to C++ corruption.&nbsp; I see that SR3 has an installer&nbsp; for C++ 2008 (
<em>vcredist_x86.exe </em>) in the </p>
<p>games main install folder. Try running this to reinstall this version of C++ .</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Run in<em> Clean Boot</em> to troubleshoot potential conflicts from Services or Startup programs (does not help isolate</p>
<p>programs you may launch manually after booting into Windows though).</p>

<p>They ran fine in windows 7 but as soon as I upgraded to win10 (1709) I started having this problem, which is why I patched to 1803.....but unfortunately it didn't fix the issue and overwrote the "return to windows 7" option in the restore menu, which would
 have been my next step since I knew for sure it was all fine before the win10 upgrade.

</p><p>I tried reinstalling the C++ and a clean boot but neither seems to have fixed it.</p>

<p>Does your machine also have an integrated graphics (Intel HD or AMD APU) that is DX11 capable ? If so, switch over to that to
</p>
<p>verify if the problem is to do with the Nvidia card or if it's is actually a Win10 issue.</p>
<p>- I reckon updating a faulty 1709 to 1803 is only likely to fix issues if the 1803 update overwrites the same parts of Windows that may be
</p>
<p>responsible for the problems that 1709 has. </p>
<p>- Is your GTX1050ti an upgrade from a previous gpu ? If the previous gpu was AMD have you done a thorough uinstall of the AMD drivers ?</p>
<p>- Have you done any motherboard driver updates or BIOS update since upgrading to Win10 ?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If not, go the the mfg's driver download page, download and install any Win10 drivers and the most recent BIOS they may have available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- If all of the games that are having issues are from Steam you may want to try reinstalling the Steam Client software.</p>
<p>I had a major Steam meltdown after one of the previous Win10 version/feature updates. I don't recall the details, but I do</p>
<p>remember having to reinstall the Steam client.</p>
<p>You can find details how to do this without uninstalling your games at Steam support pages. I don't recall if&nbsp; they advise</p>
<p>backing up our&nbsp; <em>Steam\UserData</em> folder, but do make a backup, or rename it as you do the SteamApps folder.
</p>
<p>(This folder has your game settings and saves - for most Steam games).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Before reinstalling, or doing a 'repair' reinstall ( an overwrite of Windows that preserves your software and documents)</p>
<p>try using the&nbsp; <em>DISM&nbsp; </em>tool . </p>

</p><p>- My Win10 is also an upgrade from Win7, and all the games to that date ( Sept 2015) had been installed to Win7. Many as far</p>
<p>back as 2010 when I first installed Win7, so it's not a case of any version of Win10 having issues with games, Old or new.</p>
<p>Games run as well on Win10 as they do on Win7, and games had plenty of issues on Win7 too.</p>
<p>However, these updates are a big risk. I just had my first update fail, and it was from the current Cumulative&nbsp; Update, which is not an</p>
<p>update I expected to take out the AMD graphics card on that machine. </p>
<p>I always make a clone of my Win10 before doing the version/feature updates, but didn't think it necessary for
</p>
<p>Security or Cumulative updates ... Whacked by MS and Murphy's Law&nbsp; <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85b17b67-5e3e-4bbd-bc23-8bfc5e58a1d1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Yet to investigate if the AMD card (HD7970 from 2012) coincidentally had a massive heart attack on reboot, or the update has stuffed up something else such as the&nbsp; motherboard drivers, which uninstalling the update did not fix. Running that machine on Intel
 HD4000 now.</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Family Safety Username Email Deleted - Cannot Update</h2>
                    <p><span>I recently changed jobs and had to update all of my accounts with my new&nbsp;home email address.&nbsp; I added an alias for my home email to my MicrosoftLive account and made it primary and deleted
 the old business email address.&nbsp; I am able to successfully log in with my new credentials to all MS/Windows related accounts but for some reason this Windows Live Family Safety account/page/setting is still connected to the now-deleted&nbsp;business email address.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The pop up reads, "Please ask your parent to sign in so Family Safety can get the latest settings." and then it auto-populates the "Parent's Microsoft account" username&nbsp;with the old business
 email address. I cannot override or manually enter a different email address here.&nbsp; I've tried clicking the "Forgot your password" link but when I enter the&nbsp;business email address/username (knowing I wouldn't ever be able to retrieve it anyway, but trying
 everything...) it says that is not a valid email address.&nbsp; When I use the home email address in the "Forgot your password" window,&nbsp;I reset all of my other MS Live/WindowsLive accounts but doesn't effect this pop up in anyway.&nbsp; I've been in touch with FIVE
 MS support reps now and no one can solve this.&nbsp; The 2nd guy directed me to https://account.live.com/acsr and even that site immediately informed us that the account I had entered does not exist. He passed me along.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The pop up will not go away.&nbsp; If I close it, it returns within 30 minutes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Something broke along the way and I cannot fix it.&nbsp; I have spent HOURS over the past month trying to resolve this on my own and online with support.&nbsp; Each contact has literally told me,
 "I promise, this next resource will be able to solve your issue."&nbsp; The last rep directed me here, where apparently I am to ask the universe for help. &nbsp;I am exceedingly frustrated at this point as you might imagine. Any ideas out there???</span></p>

            <p>Hi Amy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the detailed information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you change any Family Safety settings, for just one child or for all family members, it's a good idea to refresh the Family Safety Filter to make sure it's using the most current info. The Family Safety Filter refreshes its settings automatically at certain
 times, but if you notice that web content isn't being filtered the way you would like or if you don’t see activity reported as you expect, you can refresh the Family Safety Filter manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To apply all the changes always make sure to refresh your Family Safety settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I refresh the Family Safety Filter?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hope the information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance with Windows related issues. We will be happy to help.</p>

            <p>Thank you Ganesh.&nbsp; Somehow I am not able to make myself clear.&nbsp; I&nbsp;can no longer make ANY changes to my Family Safety settings because I CANNOT LOG IN! I'm sorry to&nbsp;bust out the&nbsp;all caps but I am beyond frustrated.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click the refresh icon as you indicate the Sign In window pops up again.&nbsp; I cannot do ANYTHING with Windows Live Family Safety without logging in and I cannot log in because&nbsp;I no longer have access to the email account that is defaulting for the "Parent's
 Microsoft account" in the screen shot below. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This really has nothing to do with the settings I've applied for my children except for the fact that I no longer receive the activity reports because they are going to this old defunct email address. There doesn't appear to be any way for me to reset this
 account name, including contacting Microsoft support. I just keep getting sent in circles.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To date:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started with the Microsoft Answer desk, where I was referred to a call center at 855-425-8761.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called the 855 number and was referred to "Live.com" support for escalation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke with a rep at Live.com who referred me to "Technical support." Technical support sent me a link which wound up being the Microsoft Answer desk again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called the 855 number again and was directed to the following link and assured that this was finally the group who could solve my problem:

<h2>            How long does repairing disk errors &#40;Startup Repair&#41; take&#63;</h2>
                    Hi. I've upgraded Windows 8 Consumer Preview to Release Preview. I also had Windows 7 before I Dualbooted Windows 8. Everything was fine except for having to put the installation disc to boot Windows 8 and disk check every time I switch Operating systems.
 After I upgraded to release preview, I tried Windows 7. But then it restarted and gave me the Startup Repair and Start Windows Normally choice. I chose Start Windows Normally and it started Windows 7. Then it restarted and gave me the options again, so I chose
 Startup Repair and it said it will repair disk errors and may take over an hour. It's been 2 hours and it still hasn't completed. Is that normal? Will it takes a few days? If I turn off the machine will it currupt my hard drive? Thank for everything! ^.^

<div>So I actually fixed it a long time ago. I just forgot about this forum. Oops!<br />
Anyways, I went to Windows 8 Release Preview and allowed every user to have full control for Windows 7. I went to Windows 7 and Surprise to me! It worked. However, most of the programs didn't work. They would have an error message or apparently too much RAM
 was taken (which was not). But I was fine because I could access Windows Explorer and backup all of our files.
<div>I bought Windows 8 and I managed to upgrade Windows 7 (I couldn't open anything but Windows Explorer and I can't upgrade when starting up via BIOS) by going to Windows 8 RP and upgrading the Windows 7 hard drive instead of the Windows 8 RP.</div>
<div>So now, I'm currently writing this from my Windows 7/Windows 8 computer!</div>
<div>Thanks all for trying to help!</div>

<h2>            LG GH20LS10 - Windows 10 - unable to find device</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded to windows 10 and I have noticed that my dvd player no longer is listed in my PC. I have tried scanning for devices but Windows seems to be unable to detect it. It was working previously so was wondering if this could be an issue with no
 device drivers available for this rom since it is a fairly old model.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Xbox One controller not charging - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bassile005  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One controller not charging</h2>
                    
<p>Hi sorry if this has been asked before but I just had a quick look around and, while there appears to be numerous issues with the XBone controller, I didn't see this particular issue.</p>
<p>A while ago I purchased the Play &amp; Charge kit. From day one, the cable that went into my controller was flimsy and I would usually have to prop the controller up on something just to get the charging light to stay on consistently. Anyways, that finally stopped
 working a couple months ago.</p>
<p>So I switched to the short USB cable that comes with the controllers for updating as I heard any USB cable would charge my controller. Happily, that was the case for a while. Until now. Now when I connect my controller to my One with the USB cable, it just
 shows the wired battery symbol - no longer the animated charging thingy. And it's just not a cosmetic change. My controller really won't charge.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is a recent issue produced by a recent update but I've been looking all over and haven't found an answer to my issue. Guys, I just want to charge my controller, help me please.</p>

            <p>I just started getting this issue, though no difficulty charging previously. I have two controllers and one is hardly ever used and both died at the same time. Definitely not the controllers battery packs or cables. Tried multiple cables and still no joy. No idea what just happened between last night and this afternoon. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you using Windows 8 or Windows 8 pro? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually, you need to have Windows 8 Pro for Hyper-V. You can upgrade from 8 to 8 Pro.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Virtual Machines (VMs) are great for a wide variety of tasks including running different operating systems or software configurations on a single machine. Windows 8 is the first Windows client operating system to include hardware virtualization support without
 the need for separate downloads or installs. This feature in Windows 8 is called Client Hyper-V.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
What You’ll Need to Run Hyper-V on Windows 8
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to run Client Hyper-V on Windows 8 you’ll need the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 8 Pro or Enterprise 64 bit Operating System</li><li>64 bit processor with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Level_Address_Translation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Second Level Address Translation</a> (SLAT)</li><li>BIOS-level Hardware Virtualization support</li><li>At least 4GB system ram</li></ul>
<p>If you are running 64-bit Windows 8 and meet the hardware requirements listed above you’re equipped to give Client Hyper-V a try!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To know more information, refer this <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/extremewindows/archive/2013/06/20/hyper-v-support-in-windows-8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. </p>

            I have hyper-v. It shows up in my msconfig box(there are 5 or 6 kinds of hyper-v there, but it doesn't show up in windows features so I can turn it on and off. From what I read &nbsp;in earlier posts about the static problem I'm having when I record my voice
 or other outside sounds, they say to turn off hyper-v but it's not there in the windows features like I said, to turn off. &nbsp;As far as I know I just have Windows 8. I need to lose the static or I won't be able to record my home videos or my own sound effects.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have Windows 8, hyper V will be by default disabled. However, I would suggest you perform the clean boot step mentioned by '<strong>Geethu B replied on September 11, 2013</strong>' regarding the 'Static in my voice recordings'. You may respond
 to the other thread and keep a track of it. </p>

<p>Yes, you are able to remove the broken update from your console, to do so:</p>
<p>First open the "System" blade in the Xbox 360 dashboard, then go to memory, and press Y on the hard drive to open the "Device Options" menu. Then press the following sequence of buttons: X, X, Left Bumper (LB), Right Bumper (RB), X, X. You will be asked
 if you want to perform maintenance on your hard drive. (This will delete all game updates) Choose yes. The updates will be then all removed and you will be able to reinstall them by attempting to play the games on Xbox LIVE.</p>

    <title>Surface Studio Bad Bluetooth - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wataru1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Studio Bad Bluetooth</h2>
                    <p>I have seemly bad Bluetooth connection from the latest Studio that I got. The issue occurs usually after a period of inactivity (but the system is still powered on), like a moment of thought between typing periods. The symptom is that the Bluetooth keyboard
 and mouse 'lag' mightily for a few seconds before restoring back to normal (as if lost connection).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, as soon as I hit Win key and type Mail and hit Enter, a burst of letter 'a' appears in the search box (see attached picture). And when this happens, the mouse is often not responsive as well (major lags). A few seconds pass by and everything
 returns to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are ample battery life on both Bluetooth devices. The issue has persisted with this latest Studio ever since it's open box. I have three previous Studios (replaced by this one) placed at the exact same desk spot without Bluetooth issue - this excludes
 possible Bluetooth interference problem. It happens several times a day - a not so insignificant annoyance. I don't know what could be the cause of the issue at the moment.</p>

<p>I come to believe this is an issue with Cortana/Windows Search. Why is that? Because I never have repeated strokes in all other apps that I am using. I recently have the same issue with the Surface Pro (2017), and that one is using a physical keyboard (not
 bluetooth).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either Windows Search/Cortana is the cause of Bluetooth lag, or the Bluetooth lag is causing Windows Search/Cortana to mailfunction. I can't tell which, but the association between these two is so frequent that I find it hard to not think that it's a not
 a software bug. There seems a race going between displaying the start screen and properly outputting the received keystrokes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The short term solution is to avoid using Windows Search. I have grown more and more disgusted by Windows bugs that I have no hope they are competent to solve any issue.&nbsp;</p>
