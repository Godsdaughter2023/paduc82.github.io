this thread</a>. </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>First off let me say I'm a loyal Microsoft person. &nbsp;I have invested thousands of dollars into the entire Microsoft ecosystem. &nbsp;I have three surfaces, my whole family has windows phones and of course I purchased an Xbox one. &nbsp;My complaint has nothing to do
 with hardware or software it's simply the phone representatives that I got today to handle an issue over billing for rentals.</p>
<p>Stuff happens I get that. &nbsp;I attempted to rent a movie on my Xbox one. &nbsp;It said processing then went back to the main movie page. No option to play. &nbsp;I checked my movie collection and the movie wasn't there. &nbsp;So I attempted to do it again. &nbsp;and again and
 again. (Definition of insanity but for some reason I really wanted to watch american hustle and so did my wife) &nbsp;All told, I attempted to rent the movie seven times and was getting frustrated. &nbsp;At that point I logged in with my surface and just rented the
 movie using that. &nbsp;The movie instantly showed my movie collection and I was able to watch it with no issues. &nbsp;Fast forward three days and I look at my bank account and sure enough I was billed for each time that I tried to rent the movie. &nbsp;Ok, no big deal
 I'll call Microsoft and get this straightened out. &nbsp; After 25 minutes on with chat support I'm told that there's nothing they can do they have to transfer me to a phone representative. &nbsp;(Ok, fine I get it. &nbsp;Security. I don't like wasting my time but I'm ok.)
 &nbsp;A phone rep calls me in 38 minutes and begins to dig into the account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>First attempt: &nbsp;<strong>We didn't bill you those are temporary charges and they will go away.</strong> &nbsp;I'm looking at my bank account. &nbsp;I'm a college educated person I know the difference between temporary charges and regular charges. &nbsp;These are regular
 charges and they are on my bank account right now. <strong>&nbsp;Strike One.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>(Ok, hang in there be reasonable. It's not his fault. &nbsp;It's not showing up on his computer)......the snarkiness continues.....</p>
<p>Second Attempt: <strong>I don't see those charges you didn't get billed. &nbsp;I can't refund charges to movies you already watched.
</strong>&nbsp;I'm still looking at my bank account the charges are right there I read you off the charges the date, the amounts and I read you the titles of the email receipt that I received. &nbsp;Three charges on the first email two charges on the second email and
 three charges on the third. &nbsp;The last one I was able to watch. &nbsp;American Hustle was an ok movie but I don't think I was watching it on seven different devices at the same time. &nbsp;I'd have to develop some sort of a surface hat. &nbsp;Google Glass eat your heart out.
 &nbsp;<strong>Strike Two.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Now I'm getting frustrated. &nbsp;You billed me would you like the credit card number to prove it. &nbsp;He did..... and after putting me on hold he took the card number......Ah there are the charges. &nbsp;I proceed to inform the rep that I transferred my gamer tag between
 Microsoft accounts using the instructions right here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/switch-gamertag-to-different-microsoft-account</a></p>
<p>Notice the URL xbox.com. &nbsp;Microsoft instructions.</p>
<p>Attempt three: &nbsp;<strong>You shouldn't have done that. &nbsp;Your account is broken now. &nbsp;You can watch it on xbox.com.</strong> &nbsp;Now it's my fault that my account is broken. &nbsp;I inform the rep that I followed Microsoft instructions and switched the gamertag, the
 rentals are not showing up on any device or app or XBOX.com and even if they did I don't think I'm going to watch American hustle 7 times. &nbsp;I could have purchased it for less than that. &nbsp;Lastly I'm not watching it on xbox.com. &nbsp;I've purchased this ecosystem
 so that I can watch it on any device. &nbsp;I'm attempting to rent the movie from my xbox one to watch it on my xbox one. &nbsp;Xbox.com does not work and is not an answer. &nbsp;<strong>Strike Three</strong></p>
<p>Now I'm really frustrated. &nbsp;I want my money back and I want it now. &nbsp;He agrees to refund my money after harsh words are exchanged. &nbsp;All but the one movie I watched. &nbsp;I'm not happy but this is a fair resolution &nbsp;60 minutes into the conversation until we get
 to future movie rentals. &nbsp;I'd like to transfer you to our technical team to get that account fixed for you. &nbsp;My frustration boils over it's been an hour and a half of my time arguing to get a refund on charges that should have been refunded with no question.
 &nbsp;It was the same movie. &nbsp;Well I say I've spent an hour and half of my time on this. &nbsp;I think I should be compensated the movie I did get to watch to spend more time to get my account fixed so I can have the right to send Microsoft more money. &nbsp;This is a no
 brainer in customer service a free rental for the possibility of movies purchased and rented in the future. &nbsp;No is the answer. &nbsp;Not well let me talk to my manager or I don't have that ability. &nbsp;Just no. &nbsp;I could have handled no, I wanted a little effort though,
 at least a show instead just flat no.</p>
<p>Excuse me. &nbsp;An hour and half with a promise of at least another half an hour to get this fixed and another phone call and you won't even refund a $4.99 rental. &nbsp;I inform him that I think he's making a poor customer service decision and that I won't be using
 the xbox video service anymore. &nbsp;He says that is my choice and is there anything else he can help me with.</p>
<p>Ok</p>
<p>You win xbox customer service. &nbsp;I've defended Microsoft to my friends and to my co workers. &nbsp;I'v purchased windows phones even though they don't have anywhere close to an app selection that the other phones have. &nbsp;I defended the surface to friends and co
 works and best buy representatives that said the pro would "Make a good hand warmer". &nbsp;I've defended the xbox one even though the voice commands work about 80% of the time which is maddening and there won't be an MLB game on the system and there won't be any
 college football (To be fair on any system) and at 32 years old those are about the only games I play so I have no reason to own this box other than an entertainment device but I bought it anyway out of habit because I always have purchased the new console
 gaming system every cycle and since xbox came out it's been the xbox that I've purchased.</p>
<p>I'm finally open to other ecosystems so let's see what you have android and apple. &nbsp;Here's a customer that can be persuaded with a little bit of common sense because obviously Microsoft has none left.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Touch Bar support which I only had for a couple days on my new Mac in the old Skype, would really like to have text suggestions which I have in pretty much every other app that supports text input.</p>

<h2>            Sound Problems with Cortana</h2>
                    I'm running on Windows 10 home edition with the anniversary edition update. &nbsp; All my drivers are up-to-date, and my mic tests out fine. Sometimes Cortana recognizes my voice, and sometimes she can't "hear" me. &nbsp;The only way I can resolve the issue is by
 clicking on Cortana's settings and turning off the switch marked "Let Cortana respond to Hey Cortana" &nbsp;Then I reopen the settings, switch it to on and Cortana works fine. &nbsp;I can't figure out what is causing this. &nbsp;It's not in the mic settings, because when
 I run the mic test, the mic works fine. &nbsp;

<h2>            Surface Go crashed. Had to reset now its slow</h2>
                    <p>Help please.</p>
<p>. I got my new surface go on Friday. Set up went well. Completed an assignment using MS office yesterday and saved it to One Cloud. A message came up last night to restart computer to finish installing an update which I tried to do. The screen went black
 with a white 4 squares windows logo on it. I tried all the steps advised by the support page and nothing worked. Eventually had to do a reset on the machine. Its now really slow. I can open my assignment from One Cloud but when I try to print it the folders
 in one cloud are all empty. I save it onto the machine but still when I try to print it it is not there. Any help gratefully appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Fiona,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for bringing this up. For us to understand the issue better, let us know more details by answering the following questions:<br />
<br />
• Which Windows version installed on your Surface Go? Is it on Windows 10 S or did you already switch out to Windows 10 Home/Pro?<br />
• You mentioned that you saved your files via One Cloud. Can you clarify if this is a third party app or the Microsoft OneDrive that was included on your Microsoft Office?<br />
• If it's on OneDrive, were you able to synchronize back to your Surface from the cloud storage?<br />
• Since you've experienced slowness of your device after resetting, have you tried restarting your device? Were there any differences?<br />
<br />
To help solve this issue, we suggest that you force shutdown or restart of your Surface. Performing a Forced Shutdown is like removing the battery from a laptop or unplugging a desktop PC. It resets the hardware and clears all the cache and memory for your
 hardware. To do this, here's how:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Press and hold the power button for a full 10 seconds, until the screen turns off, then release the power button.<br />
<em>Note: On some Surface models, the screen may immediately turn off when pressing the power button. If this happens, continue to&nbsp;hold for the full 10 seconds and then release.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>*If that doesn't work, use this shutdown process to make sure your Surface completely turns off. Here’s how:</em><br />
<em>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Press and hold down the power button until your Surface restarts and you see the Windows logo screen (this takes about 20 seconds), then release the power button.</em><br />
<br />
Should you need additional troubleshooting steps, please see below:<br />
<br />
Step 1: Download and run the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong>. It is a self-healing
 tool which looks for potential issues and fixes them, as well as ensures your device is completely up to date. The tool takes about 10-15 mins. to run. Once you run the toolkit, kindly follow the on-screen instructions.<br />
<br />
Step 2: Check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4002019/windows-10-improve-pc-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> on how to optimize the performance of your Surface.<br />

    <title>Music Files Disappeared - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Music Files Disappeared</h2>
                    
<p>After Ripping a Double CD album I found one CD disappeared leaving the last two song only on disc 1. Disc 1 has 20 songs and Disc 2 18. I ripped this twice and same thing happened again. It then occurred to me that both CD's may have the same identifier
 and Media Player thinks there are the same Disc and either ignores first 18 on the 20 Disc or just erases them leaving 2. I can't seem to get both on at the same time. Can anyone Help.</p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As with previous releases, Windows 10 will be available in 32 and 64 bit architectures. Windows 10 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. In fact,
 Windows 10 64 bit supports up to 512 GBs of RAM, while Windows 10 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than 32 bit Windows to accomplish some
 of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 10 64 bit is more secure too, malicious code cannot easily
 infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 10.</span></p>

            <p>Hello JaneteGeren,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;In addition to Palcouk's comment,&nbsp; I have listed the Dell website below for the specific model you indicated that you have.&nbsp; I am only showing Windows XP drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp; First thing is, has your CD/DVD rom played DVD's successfully after you upgraded?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would suggest to uninstall the driver and then reinstall from the link below.&nbsp; Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Games similar to NBA Ballers Phenom</h2>
                    
<p>Many of you may or may not of heard of this Xbox game many years back before the 360 came out</p>

<p>I kind of liked how it was a bit oppen with a few things to do besides customizing and playing street ball.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since we got the 360 and the game cant really be played on the console, I was wondering if there were any games similar to it (there can be other sports)</p>

<p>Ones with a bit of an open world</p>

<p>I just like those types of games, especially if its sports related&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Resident Evil 4 and CV release dates.</h2>
                    
<p>Just tidbits from Comic-con on their games that will be coming out soon(ish).&nbsp; This includes Revelations on the 3DS.&nbsp; I know here is not the place, but I've seen other people posting info on it who are just as interested as I am.&nbsp; Feel free to flame me.&nbsp;
 Also some of this may not be news to you, but it was all news to me.&nbsp; That means it will be news to someone else as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-RE4 will be released on XBLA on September 20th.&nbsp; Code Veronica will be released on Sep. 27th.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Revelations will have underwater gameplay, a first for the RE series.&nbsp; It will have new enemies connected to water, as seen in some of the trailers.&nbsp; The game will have "the return of fan favorite enemies."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Code Veronica will have an upgraded lighting system, naturally.</p>

<p>[/quote]Yeah I bought mine for Ocarina of Time, Revelations, and Starfox.&nbsp; I've also read there's an Assassin's Creed, Batman, and Ninja Gaiden game in the works for it.&nbsp; Give it some time and you'll find something cheaper.&nbsp; They made a large screen version
 of the DS.&nbsp; Maybe a year or two down the road they'll make a larger 3DS which will lower the price of the original ones.&nbsp; They're cool little toys.&nbsp; The 3D with no glasses is pretty sick.</p>

<h2>            Compaq Q2159 Monitor -- not able to select full resolution</h2>
                    I'm using a new desktop with Windows 7 64-bit, ATI Radeon HD 4200 integrated graphics card, and a Compaq Q2159 monitor I've had for a while, connected via VGA. &nbsp;The maximum resolution for the monitor is 1920x1080 at 60Hz refresh rate, but the maximum screen
 resolution offered by Windows is 1600x1200. &nbsp;The graphics card is supposed to support considerably more than 1920x1080 on a VGA connection, and the Microsoft website says that the monitor is fully compatible out of the box, so I'm wondering why I can't see
 any higher resolution options.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>More details:</div>
<div>- The "Screen Resolution" window reads the display as a "Generic Non-PnP Monitor"</div>
<div>- I'm running the monitor through a KVM switch</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

            I've installed the latest driver (8.881.0.0, as of 7/28/11) from AMD, including using the AMD Vision Engine Control Center program, and I also tried plugging the monitor in directly. &nbsp;The system is still locking the max resolution at 1600x1200, even if
 I use the Vision Engine Control Center to force the VGA monitor to have a max resolution of 1920x1080. &nbsp;No luck.

<h2>            Converting Win 7 32 bit OS to 64 Bit in a Mini 1012</h2>
                    I have a Inspiron 17R (N7010) and a Inspiron Mini 1012. I want to install a new SSD in the 1012 and would like to clone my drive in the 17R to the new drive, which would in effect convert my 1012 to 64 bit OS.&nbsp;Will the 1012 support 64 bit OS? It is currently
 32 bit. I have upgraded the RAM in the 1012 to 2gb, the maximum I can do. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp;

            <p>32 vs 64 bit</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions
</p>
<p>Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Installing-and-reinstalling-Windows-7</p>
<p>Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than
 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.</p>
<p>Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.</p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

            <blockquote>Will the 1012 support 64 bit OS? It is currently 32 bit.
<br />
</blockquote>
<br />
According to Dell the 1012 has an Intel Atom N450 Processor:<br />
<a href="http://www.dell.com/us/p/inspiron-mini1012/pd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/us/p/inspiron-mini1012/pd</a><br />
<br />
According to Intel, the Intel Atom N450 Processor is 64 bit:<br />
<a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/42503/Intel-Atom-Processor-N450-%28512K-Cache-1_66-GHz%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ark.intel.com/products/42503/Intel-Atom-Processor-N450-%28512K-Cache-1_66-GHz%29</a><br />
<br />
<br />
But, you need to have 64 bit drivers, and there are none on Dell's website:<br />
<a href="http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/driverslist.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;ServiceTag=&amp;SystemID=INSPIRON1012&amp;os=W732&amp;osl=EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/driverslist.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;ServiceTag=&amp;SystemID=INSPIRON1012&amp;os=W732&amp;osl=EN</a><br />
<br />
Switching to 64 bit would not be recommended.<br />

<h3> davidst charles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help&#33;  10 years worth of family photos stuck on Onedrive</h2>
                    <p>I have an older Dell that I've used to store all of our family photos (I know...don't judge).&nbsp; The good news is I've had them backed up on Onedrive, or so I thought. We received an e-mail back in the fall that Microsoft had changed it's free storage amount
 and that we had to upgrade our storage but never did anything about it.&nbsp; Now, all of the photos still appear in File Explorer on my hard drive but have no file properties.&nbsp; I can't copy them, move them to a thumb drive or anything.&nbsp; When I log into Onedrive,
 most of the folders are present but they're all empty!&nbsp; I've upgraded by storage on Onedrive in hopes that I could sync the photos back up to Onedrive so I could access them but they will not upload (I'm assuming because they're missing file properties).&nbsp;
 I'm at a loss, and don't want to lose all of the memories (and of course I can't get a soul on the phone from Microsoft).&nbsp; Suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE...AS I'M TRYING TO POST THIS WHEN I SELECT ONE DRIVE IT SAYS "THIS FORUM HAS BEEN LOCKED" WTH!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 isn&#39;t managing resources very well</h2>
                    <p>Why is my processor always clocked at 98% when I start up and System and compress memory accountable for up to 70% of it? Does Windows 10 manage resources as well as 7? What's going on here? (My system runs extremely slow because of it, even 8 wasn't this
 bad)</p>

    <title>Windows Update Nags for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mbscjohnp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update Nags for Windows 10</h2>
                    There have now been seven (7) Windows Update KB's regarding Win 10.&nbsp; To keep blocking these off my three (3) computers, I am forced to refrain from using automatic windows updates, in lieu of restricting download installation until I check each update
 for a possible (probable) Win 10 Nag by going on the internet to ask for information regarding each proposed update KB.&nbsp; I will not update to Win 10, as my Win 7's works just fine.&nbsp; By forcing me to check each update, instead of allowing me to automatically
 update, Microsoft is placing my computers at risk, should I miss a legitimate non-Win 10-Nag update.&nbsp; I have had to uninstall these seven (7)&nbsp;KB's from the computers of many friends, neighbors and associated firms, who unwittingly automatically installed them
 and suffered the consequences.&nbsp; As are many users who do not wish to have these nags appear, I am certain that Microsoft is causing itself an unnecessary major consumer nightmare and rebellion.&nbsp; W

            <p>Gina, thanks for the reply and from a MS MVP, too.&nbsp; Looks like a great free tool by a professional who has become a hero by the looks of the comments about the tool.&nbsp; It should help those who do not have the expertise to take care of this problem created
 by Microsoft.&nbsp; </p>
<p>By the way,&nbsp;there are now eleven (11) KB's probably installed on many computers due to this aggressive Microsoft's action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be at least fairer if Microsoft properly identified these as related to their campaign to foist Win 10 on all Microsoft Windows users, whether or not the user is interested.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled (then hidden) all of them and am still on the hunt with every new issuance of an update.&nbsp; KB2952664 was the start of this problem, followed by KB2976978, KB2990214,&nbsp;KB3021917,&nbsp;KB3035583 (a pesky one), KB3050265, KB3068708, KB3080149, KB3093594,
 KB3123862, and the latest KB3135445.&nbsp; John</p>

            <p>Gina, I just found the latest windows update KB for the Win 10 Nag:&nbsp; KB3044374 for Win8 users.&nbsp; I also noted five (5) windows updates that automatically send telemetry information regarding your own usage of your operating system to Microsoft.</p>
<p>KB2882822, KB3022345, KB3068708, KB3080149 (which apparently is an upgrade for the first three), and KB3075249.&nbsp; To some in the community, this ranks among spyware (however we all checked that little box giving permission when we installed Microsoft products).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>My problem, and that of many other savvy folks, is that the average user (old folks included) don't&nbsp;have the know-how&nbsp;to stop this invasion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am going to research the outcome in the European courts regarding these latter matters.&nbsp; John</p>

<h2>            LG Phone not Recognized by PC</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p><span>Ok guys, I have been hammering at this issue for hours and I am resorting to starting my own thread.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I've got an LG G7 Thinq phone, through Google Fi. I am trying to connect it to my HP Windows 10 PC (yes, I have installed all the windows updates) to move photos, although my computer cannot figure out what the device is! I know for a fact the issue
 is with my PC, my phone connects just fine when connected to a different computer, and other phones attempting to connect to my computer also fail. I have tried 2 different cables and multiple USB ports.&nbsp;</span>It also is in file transfer mode on my phone
 settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Weird thing is, in my device manager menu, there isn't even a category for "Portable Devices", as most of the other threads I have read say to look for. Instead, a new "device" pops up under "Other Devices" as "LM-G710" (which is not the model of my
 phone), but it "installs the drivers successfully" when I connect it, and I put that in quotes because it certainly does not. No new drives or devices are detected through my computer. If I try to right-click and update the drivers automatically for the "LM-G710",
 it says it was unable to find drivers for my device.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have tried many things with restarts between each step including:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>-Installed the official LG G7 Thinq drivers from here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lg.com/us/support/software-firmware-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">https://www.lg.com/us/support/software-firmware-drivers</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>-I tried installing the official&nbsp;<span>Media Transfer Protocol Porting Kit from:&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=19153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=19153</span></a>&nbsp;.
 Nothing changed.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>-I tried reinstalling drivers using these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; To re-install this driver, the following can be done:</span></p>
<p><span>On the PC, open File Explorer and navigate to&nbsp;<strong>C:\Windows\INF</strong></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Locate the file&nbsp;<strong>'wpdmtp.inf</strong>', right-click on that file and select&nbsp;<strong>Install</strong></span></li><li><span>The installation should take only a couple of seconds, and MTP should be working as usual.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>-Tried using the LG Bridge software, it can't even detect the phone. When I try to connect it says "[Media device (MTP)] connection is required.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;1. Allow this computer to access your phone data if Android 6.0 Marshmallow or later. 2. Reconnect your phone and try again if previous version." Also some other times when I try to connect through Bridge, it gives me a different message, "The device
 driver cannot be found. Reinstall LG Bridge". I did and it still gives me all of the same errors.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>-I deleted cached data from phone settings.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I even connected my boyfriend's phone (that is the exact same model) to my PC with the same results while it works fine on his PC right next to mine. I am really at a loss here, no thread seems to deal with this same exact problem with these symptoms.
 It's like my phone won't allow MTP devices.</span></p>
<p>

<li>For starters, your laptop is pretty well into its years.&nbsp; Laptops do not last as long as desktops.&nbsp; At 7 years, not more than 20% are still usable.&nbsp; In addition, laptops have far less resources than desktops, in most cases.</li><li>In particular, the hard drive on a laptop has a shorter life span and&nbsp; if yours is the original, statistically speaking it should be beginning to fail soon.</li><li>A full re-install would give it a huge performance boost, if that has not been done yet.&nbsp; And, if you are going to do that, I would advise it be with a new 500G 7200rpm drive.</li><li>You cannot have more than one antivirus program on your computer.&nbsp; They compete with one another.&nbsp; You have&nbsp; McAfee, AND Malwarebytes.&nbsp; Advise you remove Malwarebytes.&nbsp; I use only ADWcleaner for malware removal because it is not an installed program, but
 a scanner.</li><li>On startup all AV programs will&nbsp; run initialization steps and that builds a load</li><li>Online backup programs take up resources when you may not be expecting them to.</li><li>Roxio is nothing short of a resource pig.&nbsp; When I find it on a client computer, I remove it unless my client is certain he uses it.&nbsp; Win7 does most all you need when it&nbsp; comes to burners.</li><li>I am not a gamer, but I do know some games use up a lot of resources, particularly if played online.</li></ol>
<p>One more note.&nbsp; I refuse to work on a PC with any "security suite".&nbsp; They have an antivirus component which is what you really need, but they also include all sorts of other stuff you really do not.&nbsp; That other stuff can make it nearly impossible to diagnose
 problems.&nbsp; I use only pure antivirus programs.&nbsp; The added advantage to that is that they use far less resources.</p>

<p>Tell us more about how you performed this clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you use the VAIO Care to Restore Windows, Recover Computer or something else which you will describe?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was the issue(s) that compelled you to perform a clean install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have Service Pack 1 have you also brought the system up to date with Windows Updates?<br />
<br />
Since this clean install you have installed all those applications listed - that's quite a bit of stuff.<br />
<br />
It is generally not a good idea to have more than one anti program installed at the same time and you seem to have Norton and McAfee both of which are known CPU and system resource hogs - so you have two known system resource hogs installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Choose one of the other but not both (I would choose neither).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you boot the system in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17419/windows-7-advanced-startup-options-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Safe Mode</a> those anti programs (and many others) should not be loaded so as a test how does the system perform in Safe Mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where do you observe these CPU spikes?<br />
<br />
In Task Manager look at the Processes tab and check the box "Show processes from all users", click the CPU column header once or twice to sort from highest to lowest and watch.<br />
<br />
Your desire would be for the System Idle Process to show the highest amount of CPU because this is the amount of free time your CPU has...&nbsp; the more System Idle Process the better.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fddecbe0-b958-4862-8205-493909391e4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fddecbe0-b958-4862-8205-493909391e4c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see a process that is spiking or popping up with high CPU usage what process is that (there may be more than one).<br />
<br />
It could be that you are missing some important patches that affect Windows Update and can cause it to consume large amounts of CPU time.<br />
<br />
A quick test of that theory is to go to Control Panel, Windows Update, Change settings and set Windows Update to Never check for updates, restart your system and see how things look (you can undo that later if it is your desire):</p>

<p>Sorry, I should have been more thorough in my explanation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem itself is the CPU spiking even on idle with nothing running.&nbsp; It will be as low as zero, but then randomly spike to as high as 50%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said that, the problem manifests itself as sound and graphics pausing in game play hence the reasoning behind the reinstall in the first place</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is only used for gaming, and those listed are mostly, and have all run perfectly well in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed malware bytes, I only installed this to do a scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install ... problem resolved itself.. then reappeared, so then i installed Sony vaio care and from there did one of there reinstalls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALL the other software is automatically put on during the Sony Vaio reinstall</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now removed Roxio</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example right now, the only thing "running" is chrome so I can type this post.&nbsp; The CPU usage is typically fluctuating between 1 and 3%.&nbsp; Physical memory shows 23%.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The top process in task manager is chrome.exe at approx 214,220, being run by me</p>
<p>next is svchost run by SYSTEM and is 146k</p>
<p>next is chrome by me but just 80k&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>there are 86 processes in total<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f257400d-5cc1-440a-a390-d39c677d777d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f257400d-5cc1-440a-a390-d39c677d777d" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/923e2682-0d96-4a98-a120-5c43d2133301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/923e2682-0d96-4a98-a120-5c43d2133301" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run all the windows updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will restart now in safe mode and see if it helps</p>

<p>You sorted your Task Manger by Memory column and you need to sort it by CPU column so you can see what pops up that takes 50% of your CPU when the system is idle )or when you think it should be idle).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would consider uninstalling McAfee at least temporarily to see how things look - you can always install it again later, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do this so we can see a few more details:</p>
<p>
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For video device and driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.<br />
<br />
For audio device and driver information, expand the Components, click Sound Device, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />

<h2>            Halo Infinity Multiplayer - Press Release</h2>
                    
<p>In case anyone still checks in here...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>“Halo 4”</b><b><sup> 1</sup> Redefines Iconic Franchise with “Halo Infinity Multiplayer” Experience</b></p>
<p><i>Available for pre-order today, “Halo 4” Limited Edition provides the ultimate multiplayer experience and “Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn” Special Edition</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As millions of fans worldwide eagerly await the return of the Master Chief with the launch of “Halo 4”<b><sup>1</sup></b> on Nov. 6, Microsoft and 343 Industries today revealed all-new details around the year’s most anticipated blockbuster.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Set almost five years after the events of “Halo 3,” “Halo 4” takes the series in a bold new direction and sets the stage for an epic new sci-fi saga, in which the Master Chief returns to confront his destiny and face an ancient evil
 that threatens the fate of the entire universe. In addition to a rich story and campaign, “Halo 4” introduces a groundbreaking new multiplayer offering, called “Halo Infinity Multiplayer,” that builds off of the “Halo” franchise’s rich multiplayer history
 and promises to continue to innovate and redefine the way people think about storytelling and multiplayer experiences.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Introducing “Halo Infinity Multiplayer”</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hub of the “Halo 4” multiplayer experience is the UNSC
<i>Infinity</i> – the largest starship in the UNSC fleet that serves as the centre of your Spartan career. Here you’ll build your custom Spartan-IV supersoldier, and progress your multiplayer career across all “Halo 4” competitive and cooperative game modes.
 Surrounded by the sights, sounds and crew of the biggest vessel in the UNSC fleet, your multiplayer experience will be embedded in the fiction of “Halo” like never before, where your progress and game choices affect your appearance, arsenal, and role on the
 battlefield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b>Spartan Ops</b>. The story of the UNSC <i>Infinity</i> intersects with the “Halo 4” campaign, then continues on in a brand-new, story-driven experience known as
<b>Spartan Ops</b>. A first of its kind and exciting new addition to the “Halo” franchise,<b>
</b>Spartan Ops is an episodic adventure that blends immersive storytelling, high-quality cinematics, and action-packed gameplay to deliver an unprecedented serialized experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through a weekly series of cinematic episodes on Xbox LIVE, Spartan Ops will tell the continuing story of the UNSC
<i>Infinity</i>, following the events of “Halo 4.” These episodes will centre on the UNSC
<i>Infinity</i> leaders and crew, and a new team of Spartans – Majestic Squad. These cinematic episodes will provide the backdrop for the weekly Spartan Ops gameplay missions. Playable in single-player or cooperatively (with up to three friends), explore the
 corners of Requiem in these objective-based missions, and help uncover the secrets of the mysterious Forerunner world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A massive-scale adventure that builds off the “Halo 4” story, access to Spartan Ops is included with “Halo 4” at no additional charge – effectively delivering two campaign experiences in one game.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b>War Games.</b> The competitive multiplayer modes of “Halo 4,” known as
<b>War Games</b>, take place on the combat deck of the UNSC <i>Infinity</i> and revive the visceral and immersive experiences that “Halo” multiplayer is famous for. “Halo 4” introduces fresh, immersive new game modes and strategies to help you progress your
 Spartan-IV career, while also delivering an experience that’s still distinctly and uniquely “Halo.” More details on all the modes of War Games will be released at a later time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b>Total Combat Freedom and Player Progression.</b> “Halo 4” features a vastly expanded suite of new multiplayer modes, weapons, vehicles, armour abilities, a new load-out and player progression system, and a new armour modification system
 that introduces gameplay-enhancing customizations for the first time in a “Halo” game. These advancements can be used in both Spartan Ops and certain War Games matchmaking playlists, empowering player choice, vastly expanding their creative options, and make
 the experience deeper for core fans and more approachable for newcomers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The “Halo 4” player progression system goes beyond simple aesthetic upgrades, encouraging players to invest time and effort to create a Spartan that looks and
<i>plays</i> the way they want. Players can earn and activate combat enhancements called “Specializations” based on the style of play they engage in, from stealth to all-out ****, and everything in between.</p>

            <p>I'll definitely be getting this. Bought all of the Halo games, most of the novels and even some of the Mega Blocks vehicles...for.....um...the kids. Absolutely love the universe. But this may be the final port of call in the Halo universe for me. Hopefully they're only rumours but I'm starting to worry about the direction MS are steering the Xbox brand.</p>

            <p>Ummm....I dont really remember the specifics of this whinge in particular. I'm getting old and real-life is interferring with my virtual lives but will hazard a guess. This may have been about the rumours regarding the 'always on' Xbox live connection, the ability of MS to use Kinect to monitor peoples reactions to advertisements and the thought of having an always-connected camera and microphone in everyones lounge will do to privacy. The suggestion that the next console will be download-only and the continued casualisation of Microsofts first party line-up. Oh and Halo 4s Spartan ops mode will convert me to the darkside to renew my Gold subscription. Grrr! It looks too gosh-darn good. So, nothing major and mostly rumour mill stuff.</p>

<p>Fair enough.</p>

<p>Olá pessoal, estou aqui para tirar uma dúvida se alguém souber de como resolver meu problema ficarei agradecido.</p>
<p>Bom, o problema é a minha conquista do jogo Watch Dogs para XBOX ONE, que eu conclui uma conquista da bebedeira, onde você terá que ter um nível superior dos três adversários no mapa. Cheguei no nível 11 em cada um, só que a conquista não desbloqueou, e
 quando vou lá ver a conquista o processo dela está como "desbloqueando" e nunca desbloqueia. Alguém sabe me informar &nbsp;para mim resolver esse problema da conquista?</p>


<p>Preciso dela desbloqueada para me sentir melhor, essa coisa está me incomodando...</p>


<p>Aguardo suas respostas!</p>
