<p>I have had zero problems with my xbox one, and have had since launch, until after the recent update. &nbsp;My problem is similar but slightly different it seems. &nbsp;Everything still works as it always did, until you are playing a game and quit the game or tell
 the xbox to go home. &nbsp;When you do the screen flickers a little then goes black. &nbsp;You can still give it commands and hear it going through the menus, tell it to watch tv and it will start playing your channel, ect, you can hear all the sounds including tv but
 no picture. &nbsp;The only way I can resolve is to hold power until it goes off, then hold cd eject button and power together for several seconds until it reboots. &nbsp;This has fixed it each time, until I use a game, then it happens again. &nbsp;Never occurred before update,
 so has to be a software glitch, but I still nearly had a stroke when it first happened! &nbsp;Hope they fix soon, and hope this post can help someone.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t send email with smtp.comcast.net in windows live mail</h2>
                    I&nbsp;have been using Live Mail on my laptop for almost two years. Suddenly, it will not send emails (or replies to emails). The last sent mail was March 1st. This is the error message I get:
<p>The connection to the server has failed.</p>
<p>Subject 'Invoice ID: C-284814'<br />
Server: 'smtp.comcast.net'<br />
Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800CCC0E<br />
Protocol: SMTP<br />
Port: 25<br />
Secure(SSL): No<br />
Socket Error: 10013</p>
<p>Why would this suddenly start? I have not made any changes to settings, firewall, antivirus, etc.</p>

<p>Hi Lateral,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question. Unfortunately, no one here on the forums can answer this question. Reason being, is all reports are handled by the Enforcement team specifically. They do not monitor the forums. Here is some information

<h2>            A Way Out crashes on first splash screen</h2>
                    <p>Just bought the game (digital version), and I can't get past the splash screen. I tried everything already:</p><p><br /></p><p>- Deleting and reinstalling</p>





<p>- Clearing saved games&nbsp;</p>



<p>- Clearing cache&nbsp;</p>



<p>- Hard restart&nbsp;</p>



<p>- Starting in offline mode</p>



<p>- Starting with a different profile&nbsp;</p>



<p>- Console reset keeping data</p>



<p>- Console reset without keeping data</p>



<p>- The Offline Update usb stick thing</p><p><br /></p>







<p>Seems to only happen with this game since I used several other games/apps since.</p><p><br /></p>







<p>I also didn't have the option to refund, which is strange because I'm in the EU.</p><p><br /></p>







<p>Is there anyone that can help me either run this game or get a refund?</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently experiencing an issue with my laptop (ASUS) after I chose to shut it down and update it last night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just opened my laptop, let it finish up the updates and then it brought me to the “choose keyboard layout” screen. I chose US and then it asks me to “choose an option” out of contiue, troubleshoot, use a device, turn off or use another operating system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all of these and nothing gets me out of the loop, I cannot restore my PC and using rollback brings me right back here. The update was perdormed 24th of May and I have had Windows 10 for years with no issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help is apprciated. Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, i am attempting to fix the issue using the steps you provided, however I cannot even acsess the “unresponsive desktop.” No matter what I press I come back to the blue “chose an option” screen. &nbsp;Does this mean my laptop cannot be fixed with that method?</p>

            Sorry, looks like you need a clean install or a Factory Reset or wait until MS comes up with a fix. Give startup repair a try:
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.

<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

<p>
</p><p>No luck in doing that, the media creator wouldnt even create the ISO in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, thank you for your help. Do you have any word on how long it might take MS to see to the issue? Sorry to bother, I know you’re just the messenger.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While you might be able to set it up by installing Virtual machine software (E.g., Orac;e/Sun Virtual Box) or XP mode under Windows 7, the best bet for the long haul is to replace the unit.</p>

    <title>How to delete troublesome file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rikokura  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to delete troublesome file</h2>
                    I was moving some music from computer to computer by uploading and downloading from my website (too lazy to clear space on a flash drive), anyway, I have this one .wav file causing me trouble in my downloads folder. When I open my Documents, Pictures,
 etc (any folder in the libraries area), they lag horribly, load slow, sometimes taking 30+ minutes to load, sometimes not loading at all.&nbsp;Other times&nbsp;I simply cancel the loading so I can close it.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How this started was, I clicked the file to play it with windows media player. It tried to load it. When it froze, I CTRL ALT DEL'd WMP and the folder window with the file in it closed as well. Since then its been horribly laggy. It refuses to delete the
 file as well. Right click delete, and hitting del on the keyboard simply pull sup a page that says its processing moving it to the recycle bin, and says its calculating the time, the filesize, and the folder itll be moved to. It sits there&nbsp;indefinitely, until
 I close it.</div>
<div>Try 1: Ive tried restarting my computer 3 times, and each time it restarts, it loads all windows notably slower than it did before this happened. When I open the same folders before, it has a hard time loading them still, but loads nontheless, UNTIL I
 go to my downloads folder, and/or delete ANYTHING else, move anything, rename anything. Its as if editing anything within my libraries now causes it such extreme stress that it stops loading all together.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try 2: I also tried CTRL ALT DEL'd end processing explorer.exe and running/opening it again. All that did was result in any linking to the folder impossible (clicking my documents said something about filepath being broken ; I had to restart my computer
 just to be able to click any folders, shortcuts, or etc).&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try 3: I also tried to delete it using the elevated command prompt. The code I entered was "DEL /A /Q /S "C:\Users\Name\Downloads\Echokick&amp;Chaosturn - Mr.Chair (Echokick Remix).wav". It did nothing, literally, its sitting with that coding there and everything
 below it blank. It wont show the windows\system32 text for the next command signaling its done. Also, once I do this, the insane lag with the folders comes back. What makes it even harder is I cant right click the folder or anything to view its filepath. My
 explorer doesnt show that, it shows User &gt; Downloads at the top, then a search option. It does not show the filepath, let alone the filepath to that specific file. The files name is Echokick&amp;Chaosturn - Mr.Chair (Echokick Remix).wav and it said when it loaded,
 that it was a music file (this im assuming, its a .wav file).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Im completely stumped. I almost did a system restore.. only.. the problem with the system restore that I see in this case is it claims it doesnt touch individual files and folders - meaning this&nbsp;persistent&nbsp;file will still be there to cause me trouble.
 Not to mention the only other time Ive done a system restore, it took it 6+ hours, and then crashed, resulting in me buying this computer, that is only 2 months old..&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help me e.e Im at a loss, and terrified my computer will just suddenly stop working. Ive googled some items and people saying stuff like to "<span>take
 ownership of the file via takeown" resulting in "</span><span>I tried takeown and it worked", but I have no idea how to
 do anything else. I had to google the delete command (and Im not even sure I did that right, since the filename has spaces, and I was under the impression that full filepoath's dont have spaces).&nbsp;</span></div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try these methods and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try to delete the file from safe mode.</p>
Start your computer in safe mode.
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would also suggest you to delete the file after scanning your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner.<br />
</p>
<p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />
<br />
<strong>Important:</strong> While performing scanning on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when scanning tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>

<h2>            programs will not close normally at shutdown</h2>
                    the waiting time for a program to close at computer shutdown is set very low on my computer (1 second). after that specified time, windows forces my programs to close. is there some way i can increase the waiting time for my programs to close to at least
 15 seconds. the last thing i want happening to me right now is having my unsaved files partly or completely lost.

            Hi HoodWizard2009, <br />
<br />
Thank you for using Vista Support forum, <br />
<br />
My suggestion is to exit all your programs normally by using the X button or Exit/Quit under the menu. This allow programs to properly save their data which help prevent data corruption and lost.
<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you might want to try increase the time wait for a program to shut down by edit of the registry. You might want to try the steps below. Backup all your data prior to making change and read all disclaimers.
<strong><span><br />
<br />
NOTE:
<div>Modifying REGISTRY settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of REGISTRY settings can be solved. Modifications of these
 settings are at your own risk.</div>
<br />
1.</span></strong> Open the Start Menu.<br />
<strong><span>2.</span></strong> In the search box, type <strong>
regedit</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>. (See screenshot below)

<strong><span>4.</span></strong> In the right pane, right click on
<strong>WaitToKillServiceTimeout</strong> and click on <strong>Modify</strong>. (See screenshot above)<br />
<br />
<strong><span>5.</span></strong> Type in a number between
<strong>2000-20000</strong> (2-20 seconds) and click on <strong>OK</strong>. (See screenshot below)<br />
<strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong> <em>The default time is

<p>Hey Josh thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to us!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the way to do what you want to do is to buy a physical code and redeem it on the Microsoft account (the child account). What happened here was you bought them onto your account. Not to worry we can get this figured out, the first thing we suggest
 is to fill out our <a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/digital-goods-subscriptions-refund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Request a Refund </a>page so you can get your money back. Once that is done sign into the minor account and purchase the V Bucks from there or add the money to make the purchase from there. Give it a shot and let us know if we can further assist in this or
 any other matter!</p>

            If I were trying to delete files I would click on recycle bin. However I am talking about the mail app in Windows 10 on a pc. After chatting online with Microsoft I was told that in Outlook there is no way to delete more than one email at a time in neither
 the trash folder nor the spam folder, you have to delete each item individually.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Josephbutterly,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the exact error message you receive when tried performing system restore or system repair?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What exactly happens when you try searching for files?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> You may run a Microsoft Security Scanner scan when the computer is in
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe mode with networking</a> since viruses might have caused this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.
 It works with your existing antivirus software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions,
 download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> While scanning the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, the scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on
 that might be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>To fix search related issues, you may run the Microsoft Fixit:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Fix Windows Desktop Search when it crashes or not showing results</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_search/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_search/en-us</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:
</b>I would suggest you to run SFC (System File Checker) scan on the computer to fix the system file errors on the computer.</p>
<p>To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, and then type
<b>cmd</b> in the Start Search box.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b>Right-click cmd</b> in the Programs list, and then click
<b>Run as administrator</b>.</p>
<p>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>At the command prompt, the following line, and then press
<b>ENTER</b>:</p>
<p><b>sfc /scannow</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            If you have SP3 installed and only have a SP1 CD, you will not be doing a repair install since the Service Packs don't match.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
For a future project, you may want to take your genuine bootable XP installation CD with SP1 and "slipstream" yourself a new bootable XP installation CD with SP3 built in.&nbsp; This is a fun project that we can tell you more about if you are interested and I would
 recommend it.<br />
<br />
If you do not have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that has the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack, you will also not be able to complete the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert" advice to run the System File Checker.&nbsp; I can assure
 you with 100% certainty that if you try it, you will see that SFC will complain - alot, and that has nothing to do with your issue(s).<br />
<br />
That is just another one of their Support Engineer "expert" <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild-goose_chase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
wild goose chases</a> and is akin to saying "I have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it", but it is one of their favorites.<br />
<br />
I am not sure what "won't system restore" means, but there are many reasons SR will not work...&nbsp; your system could be afflicted with malicious software or whatever your unspecified antimalware/antivirus software is could be preventing SR from behaving.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You
 need to tell us exactly what happens when you try System Restore and what your antivirus/antimalware applications are.&nbsp; It could also mean that your System Restore is just so afflicted it will never work and you need to reinstall it (not reinstall XP - just
 the System Restore part).<br />
<br />
I have never seen WMI or System Information report "failing to find files/folder", but I have seen it report this:<br />
<br />
Can't Collect Information<br />
Cannot access the Windows Management Instrumentation software.&nbsp; Windows Management files may be moved or missing.<br />
<br />
Is that what you are seeing?<br />
<br />
That is generally not too hard to fix either and I have never heard of or used that KB875605 to fix any WMI System Information problem but you can sure try it... keeping in mind that the KB article suggested by the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "expert"
 applies to Service Pack 2 and you have Service Pack 3 installed.&nbsp; That article describes how to fix a problem collecting information from a remote computer and I don't know why this "expert" suggests that either, but you can sure try it.<br />
<br />
Do see how you get on with these ideas.<br />

I tried various suggestions from above and now my pc wont boot at all ( the last thing i done was locate and rename the repository in the wbem folder,this i did after stopping WMI service) i cannot even format my c drive now, it now looks as if i am or my pc
 is done for now, thank you once again for you and the other members help, joe<br />

            hi again ElderL thank you for the reply, it repeatedly goes into a black background with white witting, it says: we apologise for the inconvenience, but Windows did not start successfully. A recent hardware or software change might have caused this.<br />
<br />
it has these options:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Safe Mode<br />
&nbsp; Safe Mode with Networking<br />
&nbsp; Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
<br />
<br />
Start Windows Normally&nbsp; (highlighted)<br />
<br />
Use up and down arrow keys to move the highlight of your choice<br />
<br />
seconds until Windows starts ( 30&nbsp; )<br />
<br />
none of these choices works it just reverts back to the same screen and even freezes sometimes for ages, the only thing i can get into is the BIOS, thank you again ElerL, joe<br />

            The you should do this:<br />
<br />
<br />
If there is a problem booting, XP is configured to automatically try to boot again and you can get stuck in a loop of just being unable to get past the boot options screen or none of the boot options you choose will work.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when XP has a problem starting or crashes and tries to start again, it will give you a "short" menu of boot options and none of them will seem to be the right ones to get your system going again.&nbsp; Something like this:<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
<br />
You've tried them all!<br />
<br />
The options resemble the XP Advanced Boot Options menu, but the one option you need (Disable automatic restart on system failure) is not offered because XP has gone too far along in the boot process and offers you a limited number of boot options.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, you must manually invoke the Advanced Boot Options menu yourself until you do see the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong><br />
<br />
When you do get to the correct XP Advanced Options Boot menu you want to see, it has options on it like these:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
<br />
Enable Boot Logging<br />
Enable VGA mode<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Directory Services Restore Mode (Windows domain controllers only)<br />
Debugging Mode<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong> <br />
<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
Reboot<br />
Return to OS Choices Menu<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What you need to choose from that menu is the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
</strong><br />
Then if XP fails to boot normally, you will see an error screen with information and clues regarding the problem and then you can decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
If you do not see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option, you need to reset your system and start tapping the F8 key on the keyboard until you do see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you miss the F8 window of opportunity, you need to try again and start tapping the F8 key with more urgency (sooner and more frequently) until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure, then select it.<br />
<br />
You need to keep trying the F8 menu until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure option, and select it.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your system is experiencing a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), we need to know what the screen says:</p>
<p>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</p>
<p><a href="http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techrepublic.com.com/i/tr/downloads/images/bsod_a.jpg</a></p>
<p>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</p>
<p>If it looks like there is some kind of file name listed under the STOP message, send that line too.</p>
<p>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</p>
<p>Respond to the queries and report back the results from the Disable automatic restart on system failure screen and you can decide what to do next.</p>

    <title>Screen becomes dark on certain web-pages - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Screen becomes dark on certain web-pages</h2>
                    
<p>When I visit some web-pages reagrdless of the broswer in use (IE, Chrome, Mozilla, Safari), the whole screen of my Win 7 (not just the browser, but everything) darkens, until I leave this page or switch to another window. It's worth mentioning, that on one
 web-site there maybe several pages, with only some of them causing this effect. I tried to turn off Aero, disable every graphical enhancement, but this won't cancel the fade-out effect.</p>
<p>It's not that the screen becomes totally obscure, but the brightness falls to around 40% of the original value, making the darker parts of the screen very hard to comprehend.</p>
<p>Have you got any clues please?</p>

            <p>I was experiencing this on a webiste today.... it went dim and showed an advert. I closed the advert and the page lit up again. I went to another page on the website again it went to display and ad and went dim. however this time it didnt display the ad.
 I went back and forward again and it was fine. Im wondering whether its the webiste causing the problems rather than your computer.</p>

 I first got Windows 10 upgrade and then it stopped. &nbsp;

<h2>            Regalo 1 mes Xbox Gold usado</h2>
                    
<p>Buenas tardes. Acabo de desprecintar una tarjeta de suscripción de 1 mes que me ha regalado xbox tras enviar mi consola al SAT (con sólo un día de uso). Al intentan canjear el código, me dice que el código esta utilizado.</p>
<p>Microsft regala códigos usados en compensación por arreglarme la consola, la cual sólo ha funcionado un día (luz roja fija en el botón de encendido)?</p>
<p>A ver si alguien se ponen en contacto conmigo.</p>

            This is terrible.&nbsp; Windows Live Mail you can print out your monthly calendar.&nbsp; MS needs to get this right otherwise everyone is going to shift to Apple or Google Calendar and drop MS.&nbsp; This is basic not complicated.&nbsp; Please fix ASAP.

    <title>Microsoft Ultimate Word Game runs hot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lastgas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Ultimate Word Game runs hot</h2>
                    <p>I've been a longtime player of the Wordament game and I also play Microsoft Jigsaw. I noted that my Surface 3 Pro runs cool playing Wordament and it gets hot, almost uncomfortably so, playing Microsoft Jigsaw. The battery is quickly depleted playing the
 latter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now Microsoft has rolled Wordament into its new Microsoft Ultimate Word Game, and it now runs hot like Jigsaw. This is a major problem because the play time (say where I'm stuck somewhere without a power outlet) is greatly reduced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some months back I ran Task Manager alongside these games and my recollection is that Jigsaw didn't run crazy amounts of CPU (but this was on a desktop system).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this just sloppy coding on the part of the game developer, or something unique to the hardware of the Surface Pro 3? Is there any solution?</p>

<p>My surface pro 3 is also running as hot as an oven playing Wordament. Not sure what they have done but, yes, I imagine they have dropped one there.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Xbox One Keyboard freezes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniel d2k1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Keyboard freezes</h2>
                    
<p>So as already said in the title, my console keyboard freezes at time.</p>
<p>(I'm going to do a Power Cycle the next time it happens)</p>
<p>The thing is: I start up my Xbox <em>(I usually unplug the plug, so I plug it back in)</em>, I start up my game
<em><strong>(WARFRAME)</strong></em> then I just enjoy myself. But out of nowhere, I bring up the keyboard and it freezes. I press all the buttons on the controller and nothing occurs, even the Xbox One home button. Lucky the Kinect overrides it. So just saying
<em>"Xbox"</em> or <em>"Xbox Go Home" </em>will bring up the menu, removing the keyboard<em> (Or using the Xbox One Smartglass remote)</em>. This doesn't happen everyday but it happens sometimes.</p>
<p>But why is this happening? I thought if you remove the plug after you shut it off, it clears the ram or cache,
<em>so they say</em>, so when you start it up, the Console is fresh and clean. But this is very odd. Somewhat similar to the case where my Controller would randomly disconnect when I lose connect to a host (Which doesn't happen anymore)</p>
<p>Helpfully it's not a hardware problem, I don't have $300 to $500 on me to buy another one. (I think I have $1.79)</p>

<p>Hey folks... Sharing a link to another thread where I experienced a similar problem.</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4269/p/2098230/5535731.aspx#5535731" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../5535731.aspx</a></p>
<p>In short, it seems a failed(?)/corrupted(?) game install caused my issues. &nbsp;Uninstalling the game corrected my keyboard freeze and restored the ability to use the 'home' button on my controller.</p>
<p>In my case... The game in question that seemed to cause the issue was Project Cars. &nbsp;Why it impacts the keyboard and controller functions in other games is a mystery. &nbsp; I don't necessarily think it was 'Project Cars' itself... But maybe rather the long install
 time that *maybe* caused the Xbox to go into a sleep state during the install... As I had left it unattended during the install.</p>

<p>I am often getting keyboard freezes when I play Warframe because I use the text box a lot, but Iv'e uninstalled and re-installed several times and still nothing has changed. However, Warframe is not the only game that does this, because it'll happen sometimes
 in Fallout when I'm re-naming a weapon or armor piece or in Minecraft when placing text onto a sign. There aren't really any other games I experience this bug on since I rarely use the keyboard function on anything other than Fallout, Warframe, and online
 browsing apps (i.e. YouTube, Microsoft Edge web browser, etc...). I no longer have a kinect to fix the problem and I'm curious as to what else to do. Factory reset has yet to work for longer than a week's time.</p>

<p>We first had this problem last year when the only game we owned was batman, we tried a new controller after a hard reset and it didn't help 'home screen button doesn't respond and virtual keyboard freeze, cant type cant return home'.
</p>
<p>We eventually replaced the entire xb1 with a new 1tb version, all new from plug to tv! we STILL had the same problem on many games 'home screen button doesn't respond and virtual keyboard freeze, cant type cant return home'.
</p>
<p>this is clearly a problem in the xb1 software effected by install problems. XB1 needs to take this seriously and fix it, we have to hard reset every few hours!

<p>Now with the Recent Update my Kinect affects the Keyboard freezing as well. I have this unfortunate hardware issue with my Kinect where it randomly turns off and On by itself. But after the August Update, when I use the Keyboard to type something and my
 Kinect turns off, the Keyboard freezes or lags, until the Kinect turns on again (Turns off and freezes the Keyboard for 2-4 seconds then turns on again)</p>
<p>Example: Typing the word, "Warframe". I would start inputting the letters then when I get to the letter "m" it freezes and I noticed my Kinect just turned off and the Keyboard is stuck (or frozen) on "m" even though you can hear the keyboard noises while
 trying to move to the next letter. But this moment only lasts for 2-4 seconds but can still repeat, even on the same word or even the next letter.
</p>
<p>As a result I have unplugged by Kinect, which is my only main way of talking to others (Only when playing Solo which I do most of the time) as my Xbox Headset broke or died</p>

<p>Hey there Default and D2K1 MasterDoku,</p>
<p>This is a bit of an older thread, what you'll want to do is make sure your controller is fully up to date and then check to see if a

Hard Reset or Power Cycle</a> helps with the situation. <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Windows scanner cannot find the scanner</h2>
                    CanoScan 4200F scanner installed and working with Canon ScanGear Toolbox.&nbsp; When I start Windows 7 Fax Scanner it cannot find the scanner.&nbsp; I have downloaded the Windows drover from Canon but when I try to install it I get an error message saying it is
 not a 32bit software.&nbsp; If I look at the scanner in the hardware window it tells me it is working properly and it is running the latest software 8.6.1.1 from 2006

            The software I see at the Canon website is all dated 2009 and is 8.6.1.1a&nbsp; <br />

<br />
Make sure you have the 32 bit version and not the 64 bit version.&nbsp; You probably also want to get the manual to check on how to use the scanner with a Fax.&nbsp;

    <title>Problems with xbox live billing and support&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with xbox live billing and support&#33; Furious&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I didn't know where else to post this but I am currently very frustrated. First off I was billed for Xbox Live when I shouldn't have been. I had a year of live on my account and xbox auto-renewed anyways so that I had two years of xbox live on my account.
 I called to cancel and somehow because of an error on Xbox's side, the subscriptions got linked together and had to be cancelled together. I was then given a token for 12 months of live that I had originally and was told I would be given a refund for the second
 year of live that was cancelled. Well after waiting a month, my refund never came. So i then contacted Xbox support again, and this time there was "server issues" on their end and they couldn't fully access my account. I was told my problem would be taken
 care of and they acknowledged there was a mistake. I was told I would be contacted by a supervisor and of course never was. So after waiting and again not getting my refund or contacted again, I decided to contact support again. This time after a long wait,
 I was told to e-mail the original e-mail back telling me that I would get a refund back and that they would give me my refund finally and I was assured that everything was taken care of. Well that was a week ago and I still haven't heard back or received my
 refund!!!!! I have been a loyal xbox customer for 8 years now and have never had to deal with anything like this before but I am frustrated and furious. What do I actually do to have to get some help or actually get a refund from an error that should have
 never happened in the first place!! This is ridiculous, I didn't know where else to post this but I am just upset and want some help and maybe somebody knows what I can do to actually finally get my problem solved and my money back!!!!</p>

<p>Ouch, Zelek, sorry to hear about the issue. &nbsp;It does sound like a very frustrating situation. &nbsp;Seems that it turned from something that should have been pretty easy to fix&nbsp;into a bit of a roller coaster, as can happen when there are unforeseen system issues.
 &nbsp;I would recommend calling Xbox Customer Support again, and asking them to ensure that your refund was generated and is being processed, if it's not processed out of their system already. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Make sure to refer to it as a refund for a "stacked subscription".&nbsp; Some agents who aren't familiar with the situation may think the token you received was compensation for a wrongfully cancelled account, and they might think you're not supposed to get a refund.
 &nbsp;Make sure the agent knows you paid twice, and the token is only half of what you should have received back. &nbsp;The financial refund is the other half, and it needs to come back to you in full. &nbsp;In regard to it billing you when it shouldn't have.. chances are,
 it had already renewed before you applied the new 12-Month membership, but it just hadn't processed the payment yet. &nbsp;That's the only type of situation in which I hear of this happening.</p>
