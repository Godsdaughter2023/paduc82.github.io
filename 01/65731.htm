<h2>            Microsoft solitaire </h2>
                    
<p>My Microsoft Solitaire Collection has stopped working. It has been working fine but no longer, just sits at the load screen and goes no further. Any ideas where to start?</p>

<p>Hey there! That does suck!</p>
<p>Firstly have you looked online to see if they is a problem with this game? <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-live-status?xr=shellnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../xbox-live-status</a> This link states anything wrong with services and games on Xbox.</p>
<p>Secondly have you tried uninstalling the game and then reinstalling? This usually fixes issues with loading
</p>
<p>Thirdly have you tried power cycling the console? Hold down the power button for 10 seconds, wait for 30 seconds and restart. This usually deal with most problems on the console</p>
<p>If you're still having problems after attempting all this then contact Xbox Official Support here: &nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/contact-us#3:2:0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../contact-us</a> Wait for it to load and then click Xbox Chat Support.</p>
<p>Hope this helps! Happy gaming! </p>

    <title>Transfer app from Windows 8.1 install to Windows 10 Tech - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Transfer app from Windows 8.1 install to Windows 10 Tech Preview&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 8.1 installed and recently also installed the Windows 10 Tech Preview to see if some older programs I need for work will continue to run properly (YES it did).</p>
<p>Anyway, I decided I really liked 10 and decided to move some other programs and apps I was using under 8.1.
</p>
<p>Well, one of the games/apps I installed did not display properly - but not a big deal at this point, understand what "tech previews" are about.</p>
<p>But another app/game "Gunpowder", which I had previously purchased, now says is it not available through the Windows Store - even though the app's page says I purchased it and the "install" button are there. So, is there any other source to download the
 app or is there a way that I can move the app from the Windows 8.1 install to the Windows 10?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Steve</p>

<p><span>But still if you couldn’t find the game. May be the game “Gunpowder” is not currently available in Windows 10 technical preview store. But once the full version of windows 10 is released
 then you may be able to download the game from windows store. I apologies for the inconvenience.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you need an alternate link to download, the publishers of “Gunpowder” may be able to provide you. So I would suggest you to contact the publisher.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Sreejith,</p>
<p>Maybe I did not explain myself properly.</p>
<p>When I go into the Store App - from the Windows 10 install - and look at my account and my apps, the app in question (Gunpowder) is listed there. I can click on it, but when I get to the app's screen and click on the INSTALL button, the message from the
 store comes up that the app is no longer available from the Store.</p>
<p>(And from what I have read in a Google search, Microsoft has removed various apps from the Store at times.)</p>
<p>So, even though I paid for the game, I can not install it to the Windows 10 Tech Preview. And I would assume that if I ever had to reinstall my Windows 8.1, I would be unable to reinstall it there either. That is why I posed the question of whether there
 is anyway to actually copy the app from one install to the other.</p>

            I am still running Windows 8.1, but I too cannot download this game after doing a System Restore (due to the WiFi driver on my SP3&nbsp;suddenly becoming corrupted for no apparent reason). Has the game been withdrawn from the store altogether? This is pretty
 annoying.

            &nbsp;Hi,<br />
Than you for your update regarding the issue.<br />
However you did not mention if you are using the same Microsoft Account to access the Windows 8\8.1 Operating System as you did to access the
<div>Windows 10 Technical Preview.<br />
Also we need to know if you purchased the app in question in the Microsoft Account for Windows 10 or that of Windows 8\8.1</div>
<div>If you are using different accounts to access the different OSs, I'm afraid, you cannot move purchases between Microsoft accounts.</div>
<div>But if you are indeed using the same Microsoft account, the app in question should in theory get synced once you roll backed your Operating
<div>
<p>System to Windows 8/8.1 from Windows 10 Technical Preview.<br />
If you are unable to perform a download of the app, I suggest that you proceed to the section below:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Run the built in app troubleshooter.<br />
In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, or if you're unable to open the Store, try running the Apps troubleshooter. This tool
 can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store. It's only available in English, but will work on PCs running any language.
</p>
<div>To know more about the Windows app troubleshooter, please follow this link:</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Clear the Windows Store cache.</div>
<div>•Go to the Start Screen or the Windows Modern UI screen<br />
•Type in WSReset.exe</div>
<div>image<br />
•Click on Run as administrator</div>
<div>Windows Store will open and you’ll get a conformation message saying that: The cache for the Store was cleared. You can now browse the Store for apps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;It will the take you back to Windows Store. Now try to install or update the apps or download fresh apps and see if it’s working like it should.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<div>Please get back to us with the updated status on the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Regards.</div>

            Thank you for your response. I have never installed Windows 10 Technical Preview on my SP3. I was running Windows 8.1 when I had to restore my SP3 because it suddenly decided that its wifi driver was corrupted and I couldn't find anywhere to download the
 driver from the internet (not even the manufacturer's website). After the restore, the "Gunpowder" app had a little arrow symbol on it indicating that it had to be re-downloaded but, when I tried to do so, the Windows Store claimed that the app was no longer
 available. The problem mysteriously fixed itself two days later ... the arrow symbol went away and the app was playable.

<h2>            Windows Defender and ATT Internet Security Suite</h2>
                    Recently, I lost all my windows icons on the computer and Dell reversed my system back to its original settings when I bought it. Needless to say I had to re-install my security systems on the laptop for spyware, mallware and virus protection. Since I
 have internet service with ATT and phone service as well, I received free ATT Internet Security Suite which has the same things as Windows Defender. Now each time I open my computer, I get an error message saying that Windows Defender failed to initilize.
 I clicked into Control Panel to try and Open Windows Defender, but I keep getting that error message. What should I do?

<h2>            Downloaded and installed Win 10 but now PC runs REALLY slow</h2>
                    I waited for the final release and installed on my laptop first and made sure it all went well then downloaded on to my PC (the one I spend most of my time working on). The laptop is working beautifully but the PC is awful. The mouse disappears or doesn't
 move. Typing in a URL takes forever. Even putting my password into the Windows Log In screen has some pretty annoying lag.<br />
I really don't want to go back to Win 8.1 so any ideas on what I need to do in order to get this PC working well?<br />
<br />
NB: it worked perfectly with Win 8 and 8.1

            <p>its not an issue with the boot time. In fact the boot time is ok. Its the processing of activities once up and running. It seems to be worse in some apps than others. An web browser, for example is a nightmare. I type something and it takes a few seconds
 before the letters appears. Its like working on a PC from 1988.<br />
</p>
<p>I have looked at the Task Manager and it seems to go through bursts of 75%+ Memory usage. I have 8GB of memory and 1GB dedicated video RAM so I should have more than enough.<br />
<br />
The bursts seems to be used by "System" and "COM Surrogate" and have taken as much as 4.5GB for periods of minute or more and I cannot work out what they are doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this just a case of Win10 setting itself up in the new PC and running a lot of stuff in the background that will settle over time?</p>

<h2>            Startup Repair Cannot Repair This Computer Automatically</h2>
                    
<p>I Was handed a Dell Optiplex 755 to Repair for a client. (32bit Vista, 4GB ram)</p>
<p>No Idea if there have or have not been regular updates, judging from what I've seen, my best guess is that there haven't been. (Based on amount of trash files).</p>
<p>Upon initial boot, I was able to use Startup Repair to gain access to the unit.</p>
<p>After doing some housekeeping (Removing 1+ GB of Temp files) and running a defrag.&nbsp; I rebooted and got the error indicating that startup Repair was unable to make the necessary repair.</p>
<p>I tried Safe Mode, but it rebooted and I tried "Last Configuration that Worked" and it rebooted.&nbsp; After several attempts at Safe mode and Last Config that worked I tried System Restore (twice, once with the oldest restoration point (Result - unable to restore),
 and once with a more recent date - approximately half way down the list (Result - Successful) unfortunately, it rebooted and gave me the option of running the Startup repair tool.</p>
<p>The Information listed by the startup repair tool is:</p>
Problem Event Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; StartupRepairV2<br />
Problem Signature 01:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; AutoFailover<br />
Problem Signature 02:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6.0.6001.18000.6.0.6001.18000<br />

<p>(Don't ya Love Clients who hand you the ONLY unit they have that processes Payments and tell ya they need it yesterday...).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I fix it?</p>
<p>Thanks in Advance...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Are&nbsp; you able to access Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot?<br />
<br />
This coud be a serious error and need tech support from a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks<br />
at a BestBuy or other BigBox Stores) or your System maker's Support.<br />
<br />
Go into Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch screen as you startup. Set the<br />
boot order to CD/DVD to use Vista disks. Remember to set back when done.<br />
<br />
With a Vista or Repair disk try Startup Repair - (the possible fixes are same as these though the titles<br />
are named differently.)</p>
<p>This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or use a Vista Disk<br />

=========================================<br />
<br />
If you do not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy protected. Your
<br />
System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already own Windows. Also you
<br />
can make a repair disk on another computer.<br />
<br />
If you need to make repair disks - these help repair Windows not re-install.<br />

<br />
==========================================<br />
<br />
These "may" help :<br />
<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Vista disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you can retry System Restore from the Recovery or Vista disk.<br />

</a><br />
Or from the Command Prompt :<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\System32\rstrui.exe<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p>It is rare that a ported copy of Windows works on a new motherboard, probably only if the the chips are almost identical. Some image creation products such as Acronis TrueImage include a "Universal Restore" facility which takes stock of all hardware devices
 during the restoration phase. How well this works I do not know.<br />

            Is the&nbsp;Windows 7 licence&nbsp; a retail or an OEM System Builders&nbsp;version of Windows 7? If the latter you will not be able to activate Windows using the new motherboard and will need to purchase a new licence.

            Russhe's keyboard is working 100% correctly without any issues and Debra's advice for him to contact manufacturer of keyboard is absolutely horrendous advice. &nbsp;Russhe has mistakenly pressed a key sequence that has toggled on a setting in Windows that is
 now causing the keys to represent the smaller hyphenated characters instead of the primary characters. &nbsp;This is an issue everyone has encountered at some time and very few people know about the key sequence required to toggle the setting on and off and most
 people simply reboot their computer to get rid of the issue. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I am also looking for the key sequence and it is very sad that Debra being a Microsoft Answers Support Engineer would fail so miserably in answering Russhe's very basic question and
 defer the issue to the&nbsp;manufacturer&nbsp;of the keyboard when the issue is clearly software and not hardware based. &nbsp;I would expect more from a Microsoft support engineer. &nbsp;I am very disappointed and my searc

            <div>My advice for anyone with keyboard issues like Russhe's is to attempt to either disable the Windows Keyboard Accessibility features altogether in Control Panel or to learn the procedure in toggling these features on and off.</div>
<div><br />
<div>One of the "hidden" features in Windows that can throw off the uninitiated is a series of keyboard commands that turn on accessibility functions for the disabled.</div>
<div>These commands are handy for people who might have trouble working a regular keyboard, but they've been known to cause big problems for people who turn them on by accident and don't know how to turn them off. They've led people to think the keyboard has
 a problem, or else the keyboard driver.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The most common accessibility shortcut that gets enabled by accident is StickyKeys. This causes the Shift, Ctrl or Alt keys to remain held down when tapped (so that someone can operate them without needing more than one finger at a time).</div>
<div>StickyKeys is enabled by tapping the Shift key five times in a row, something that might seem difficult to do by accident but which does happen. (I once turned on StickyKeys when idly tapping the Shift key out of boredom, and only after a panicked moment
 realized what I'd done.) And when it does happen, people find that their keyboard seems to be malfunctioning for some inexplicable reason.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft's reason for default-enabling keyboard shortcuts for accessibility options was to allow people with disabilities to sit down at any Windows computer and be able to use it, unhindered. In theory, it's a good idea. But unless you're administering
 machines that are publicly available or that might possibly be used in such circumstances, it might be better to simply disable the accessibility shortcuts by default to prevent someone accidentally triggering them without realizing it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To disable these options through Control Panel, select Accessibility Options | Keyboard, uncheck each of the "Use" boxes, and then click "Settings" for each accessibility option and disable the "Use shortcut" box.</div>

<h2>            Android Microsoft Launcher Note 8</h2>
                    <p>Good Afternoon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just recently bought a new laptop with windows 10. Im trying to utilise the "Continue on PC" service and its not working. I have two different message, the first one is "PC unavailable at this time" or "Sorry something went wrong try again later". I did
 go into the laptop setting, phone, and it doesnt show my phone being connected. I used the same microsoft account for both device, i restarted both phone and laptop multiple times and also uninstalling and reinstalling the app. My microsoft account online
 does show all my devices. An online technician tried to help and his solution was for me to just use my USB cable, this kinda defeat the purpose of the app.</p>

<h2>            Connecting two computers with Ethernet - Can not change network location from Public to Home</h2>
                    
<p>I am using a desktop PC (Win7 x64) with an Asus P5B Deluxe motherboard which has two on-board ethernet adapters:</p>
<p>Marvell Yukon 88E8056 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (Which I will refer to as E8056).</p>
<p>Marvell Yukon 88E8001/8003/8010 PCI Gigabit Ethernet Controller (Which I will refer to as E8001).</p>
<p>My E8056 is connected to a Huawei Echolife BM632 Wimax modem and my internet connection works just fine. I have enabled ICS for this connection.</p>
<p>I tried to connect my E8001 to my Sony VAIO laptop (Win7 x64) which has a Marvell Yukon 88E8057 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller using a standard ethernet cable. I want to share my internet connection with the laptop.</p>
<p>On the laptop, everything is OK and the laptop detects the connection correctly and I have set it's location to home. However, on the desktop, Windows detects it as "Unidentified Network" and I can not change it from Public to Home. The text "Public network"
 is not even click-able.</p>
<p>I have read these forums and it seems many people have had similar problems with their modems/routers, but not with connecting two computers. I have tried several methods, all to no success.</p>

<p>I see the same thing on my computers when ICS is enabled.&nbsp; Everything works, even though the host computer's local area connection is incorrectly identified as Public.&nbsp; Other than that, is everything working on your computers?</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kludge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">kludge</a> that can fix it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the laptop's IP address. </li><li>On the desktop's E8001 connection, set the default gateway address to the laptop's IP adddress.</li></ol>

<p>Thanks Steve, I did as you said and it worked. I have set my network location as Home.</p>
<p>But no internet connectivity on the VAIO yet.</p>
<p>There's something strange about the VAIO's IP though. Using ipconfig, I received this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Connection-specific DNS Suffix&nbsp; . :<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Link-local IPv6 Address . . . . . : fe80::bdfe:ddf9:d062:95ca%11<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Autoconfiguration IPv4 Address. . : 169.254.149.202<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.0.0<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Default Gateway . . . . . . . . . : fe80::ac80:8d66:cea9:6941%11</p>
<p>I'm not sure what this means.</p>
<p>I tried releasing it's IP using ipconfig /release (in an elevated CMD Window) and received the following error message:</p>
<p>An error occurred while releasing interface Loopback Pseudo-Interface 1 : The system cannot find the file specified.</p>

<p>The laptop's <em>Autoconfiguration IPv4 Address</em> shows that ICS isn't working correctly.&nbsp; That address should start with 192.168 and be assigned to the laptop by the desktop computer.</p>
<p>Disable and then enable ICS on the desktop's Wimax modem connection.&nbsp; If it asks what connection to use for the home network, select the E8001 connection.</p>

<p>Ok I tried disabling and re-enabling ICS. No luck, internet is not connected. VAIO's IP is still stuck at 169.254.149.202 and the desktop's IP is 192.168.137.1&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried manual IP configuration on the laptop and set it to 192.168.137.10 and Default Gateway of E8001 to 192.168.137.10 but there was no internet.</p>
<p>I set both of them to auto mode, then tried renewing IP on the laptop: Got two error messages:</p>
<p>An error occurred while releasing interface Loopback Pseudo-Interface 1 : The system cannot find the file specified.</p>
<p>An error occurred while renewing interface Local Area Connection: unable to contact your DHCP server. The connection has timed out.</p>
<p>Tried renewing IP on the desktop for E8001. Got one error message:</p>
<p>An error occurred while renewing interface Local Area Connection: unable to contact your DHCP server. The connection has timed out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now ipconfig shows that E8001 has this IP: 169.254.105.65</p>

<h2>            how can i save programs before upgrading to window 7&#63;</h2>
                    how can i copy/save programs before upgrading to window 7, If I install x86 and then x64 would i be able to save my installed programs that way. I am using vista 32-bit, it asks me for clean installation instead of simple upgrading.

            If you want to install Windows 7 64 bit you must do a clean install, you can not keep your programs - they must be reinstalled.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can use an Upgrade or Full Windows 7 disk to do a custom clean install. This will remove all your programs, but you can save your files and settings to external storage before doing so. You will have to reinstall all your programs after installing Windows
 7. Here are the steps: <br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor - i﻿t scans your PC for potential issues with your hardware, devices, and installed programs, recommends what to do before you upgrade, and whether you can install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Backup all your files and settings to avoid losing docs, photos, and other information. Windows Easy Transfer is a free tool to copy files (not programs) from your PC, and then transfer them back after you install Windows 7. If you don't want to use Windows
 Easy Transfer, you can copy your files to a USB drive, or CD/DVD.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
3. Insert the install disk, restart and boot from the DVD - if prompted to “press any key...” press a key on your keyboard.<br />
4. Click Install Now<br />
5. At the setup screen, click Custom (Advanced)<br />
6. Select a partition to install Windows on.<br />
7. Continue with install.<br />
8. After Windows 7 is installed you can use Windows Easy Transfer (or another backup method you used) to restore your files &amp; settings, and use your program installation disks to reinstall all your programs.<br />

<h3> alex abisaad  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#39;Reboot and select proper Boot device&#39; problem&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I was trying to reset my Toshiba Windows 10 laptop (using the clean hard drive option) and it worked normally until the very last step "Just a moment" which lasted for several hours. I decided to troubleshoot the problem with options from the boot (Refresh,
 Factory Reset etc.) and I messed up. Now, every time I try to boot, I receive the following message 'Reboot and select proper Boot device or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press a key'. I searched blogs and forums and the solution they all suggested
 was to make the HDD the priority in the BIOS menu. I did that but it didn't fix the issue. What can I do? Furthermore, since my laptop is upgraded to Windows 10 (from Windows 8.1) and I don't have a DVD/CD, will downloading Windows 10 from the Media Creation
 Tool as ISO and trying to install it using a USB work?&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I don't care about the files/data on the laptop since I was performing a reset anyway so I just want the laptop to run again with a clean Windows 10 or the original Windows 8.1, it doesn't matter).</p>
<p>Thanks for any help in advance and sorry for the long paragraph!</p>

            Hello, I appreciate your help but it didn't fix the issue. I even tried to install Windows 10 again and it seemed to work until it randomly comes back to the screen where it asks me to choose a language etc. When I try to do a startup repair, it says it
 failed. Now I have Windows 10 installed twice (on "Volume 4") and neither works. Now, the issue is getting worse since it's not working anymore. "No device drivers were found. Make sure that installation media contains the correct drivers, and then click OK."

                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using Skype version 8.26.76.25 and during a call I try to play a video from Youtube and music from Spotify, both muted.</p>
<p>After I open the volume mixer I notice that both apps were muted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was it skype who muted them because I was on a call, or it was something else?</p>
<p>If it was skype, is there an option to disable this behavior? </p>
<p>

 called the Gen4 there is 3 plans you have power then power 1000 I think then another where I live on Ohio power is 59.99 with the equipment lease no matter if you already have equipment they will come out and swap with your dish and modem the speed is 15mbps
 down and up to 1.0mbps upload and 20gb download allowance per month for power I'm not sure about the other 2 I know the fastest one the speed is almost 30mbps I think and 40gb download allowance a month. I called and talked to tech support myself this is a
 new system its being released in fall which is in a couple weeks and from what they said on the phone the problem with online gaming with their network has been resolved and you are now able to do it but only with the the highest pla

<p>No it can but you get alot of lag to the point you get lag kick. That means you have so much lag that the server kicks your out. But you can only play certain games online like GTA IV, Midnight Club Los Angelas any game that isn't a fps or similar to Gears
 Of War (I'm not sure of what they call it but I know it's not a first person shooter) will not work online like for example. I tried Black Ops with it on Hughsnet's basic plan plan with the basic service it will just say searching for players please wait.
 That's all it will do, You can however go to a friends profile and if they are playing hit join session in progress and you can join thru that route BUT this is where the latencey issue comes into play and you will have a ton of lag that you will be in one
 spot one second then somewhere totally different on the map the next second same way with Battlefreild but in that you can join a game thru the menus with no problem but again with the latencey you will lag while moving around but not like Black Ops best waycI
 can explain it is Black ops has random spot on the map lag. It lags you into random spots. Battlefield has inch lag like if your walking you basically lag a few inches from where you originally are. Now Gta IV and Midnight Club work well you lag a little bit
 but not alot I play GTA alot. On that you dont lag other plays lag on your screen while you lag on theirs you can play it normally only problem is while voice chatting you can break out not saying you will it doesn't happen all the time but every now and then
 it will just depends on your connection speed and the other problem is other players if they are driving the same type of car as you they intend to be a little faster and on top of that when you try to kill ppl sometimes it takes a clip or 2 just depends on
 the gun. And you can't join parties at all. Now with Gen 4 its different the connection with GTA IV is alot better it plays normal like your on a cable connection and oh yeah Midnight Club is the same as GTA IV connection ow with games like Black Ops and Battlefeild.
 Black Ops you can join games normally but you still lag just not as bad Battlefeild the lag is a little better but not by much and you can join parties as of games like Gears of War Im not sure I haven't tried it on Gen 4 yet. But you can join parties on it.
 But Gen 4 is screwed up right now on order to be on Xbox live you have to turn off the web accelerator and your supposed to have 15mpbs down and 5mbps up and 80ms for ping (latencey) but hughesnet has Gen 4 screwed up and I have 3.14mbps download and 0.04
 upload and my ping (latencey) jumps between 300ms and 4000ms and Xbox Live requires your ping (latencey) to be 80ms so you dont lag and they aren't fixing it for *** so it's making Gen 4 to go back to be like the basic plan they have and the basic plan the
 modem is the HN9200 the Gen 4 system the modem is a HT1000 and sometimes the connection is so bad with the Gen 4 its just like having an advanced setup of dial up. I dont know what their problem is but it's starting to seem like its not worth it. I have a
 laptop a desktop and a windows phone and if we have only one thing on it for note than 30 minutes it drops signal and the modem shuts off.</p>

<p>This is nonsense. I play on dsl that is only 1.5 mb dl and .3 mb upload and I can play BF3 fine. There are latency issues but no lag spikes or packet loss. Their lowest package is 10 mb dl 1 mb upload for 50 bux but the trouble is that it only has a 20 gb
 per month download.</p>
<p>If I can do it on DSL, the lowest package at $50 dollars a month is fine. If you stream movies, though, you may be unsatisfied with 20 gb cap on data.</p>

<p>Fridge &nbsp;it doesnt matter about the actual speed when it comes to online gaming what matters is PING and DSL is alot diffrent then Hughesnet which is sattilite internet. &nbsp;Ping on dsl is usaully like 2-100ms which is basically what online gaming is designed
 around. &nbsp; Sattilite connections ping is around 600-1000ms which is actually worse the a dial up connection ping. &nbsp; Sattilite internet is made for rural areas so they can surf the web easily, &nbsp; and itl work great for viewering web pages but not gaming. &nbsp; &nbsp;I
 cant really see this new Gen4 being any better for gaming since that large ping is still there.</p>
<p>BTW to anyone forced to have hughenet or dial up id recommend looking into 4g or 3g internet threw cell phone companys, &nbsp;they often have a service where they give you a box that works like a router to give you a wifi connection and &nbsp;it can actully do gaming
 more effectively then sattilite.</p>

<p>[/quote]Going through a cellular network for Xbox live is about as bad as using satellite.&nbsp; Latency is through the roof when playing on them.&nbsp; At least from a 3G point of view.&nbsp; Now assuming they haven't over subscribed 4G somewhere, then it might be viable,
 but I don't know so much about 4G.</p>

<p>I play Black ops 2 with full bars consistantly with Verizons 4G, however i have a 20gb data plan and that plan seems to randomly spike 3gbs in a day when no one in my family has used the MiFi all day. To sum it up I agree with the fact that these cellular
 service data plans are a huge scam and i am switching to the new Hughes net Gen4 because of it, even if i cant play xbox live. But does anyone know if hughes net can support other online games like WOW?</p>

<p>I called Hughes Net support today and they said that the Xbox Live has taken alot of problems last 2 weeks. &nbsp;As for me personally, I cannot play Halo 4 or Black Ops 2, which is especially irritating when they are the only games I really LIKE. Take Halo,
 I will walk down a hallway and after 3 steps, I am zapped back 2 steps. &nbsp;On really bad days, I can't even aim without being zapped around the map. What really bugs me is the last two weeks I cannot even download the updates required to play some of my older
 games because Hughes Net is busted.</p>
<p>Before we moved into our new house, we had Century Link, and we still would if there was an open port still. &nbsp;I swear, you are moved into an apartment for 6 months while a new house gets built, and someone took up our port! &nbsp;UGHH!</p>
<p>Anyway, I am glad it just isnt my luck and I am not the only one suffering.</p>

<p>Online gaming doesn't need a blistering fast Download or upload speed. It's all based on latency/ping. You could be pulling 1000Mbs down and 1000Mbs up, but if your satellite latency is 1000ms plus...good luck playing a F.P.S..</p>

<p>hello everyone, we are testing skype for business broadcast on our environment. receiving below error when we initiate a broadcast meeting.</p>

<p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=4279c438-976c-42f2-aab2-93c307dfef09" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d4279c438-976c-42f2-aab2-93c307dfef09" /></a></p>

<p>i have tested the broadcast with my test tenant ( domain[modified by moderator].com ) which is working fine - so, i believe there is no network restrictions.</p>

<p>existing settings on our tenant for your reference ( settings are similar on both working and non-working tenant )</p>

<p>Hi Rinesh,</p>
<p>To look into the issue, I need some information below:</p>
<p>1. Do you mean that your work account cannot join a Skype for Business Broadcast meeting but can schedule one? If so, please confirm if the access settings allow your account to join the meeting when scheduling it.</p>
<p>2. Can any other users in your organization not join the Skype for Business Broadcast meeting either?</p>
<p>3. The detailed steps about creating the Broadcast Meeting.</p>
<p>4. Is there a detailed error message if you click the “An error occurred during the Skype Meeting”? If so, please provide it to me for troubleshooting.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Larry</p>

<p>Larry, From my work account I can schedule one But cannot initiate one. that's when I receiving the error "An error occurred during the Skype Meeting”</p>
<p>--&gt; I will schedule a meeting</p>
<p>--&gt; Paste the url on the browser</p>
<p>--&gt; Joining the meeting as the event member, it will open up my SFB client and will come up with the error</p>
<p>"An error occurred during the Skype Meeting”</p>
<p>Tried with two different network.</p>
<p>There is no descriptive message when i clicked the error.</p>
<p>Since the event members unable to initiate the broadcast. Attendees obviously receive the message Broad cast not started.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Hi Rinesh,</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay.</p>
<p>I will do some tests to see if the issue can be reproduced on my side and will keep you update as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Hi Rinesh,</p>
<p>After some testing on my side, I can’t reproduce the issue. So I’d like to confirm if you can join the broadcast meeting as an attendee. Also, please provide your Skype for Business version and OS version to me for further troubleshooting.</p>
<p>In addition, try the following steps to see if the issue can be resolved:</p>
<p>1. Check if your SIP address has been added in the Exchange admin center-&gt;recipients-&gt;double click the mailbox you used to join the meeting-&gt;email address. If it hasn’t been added, add it in the Email address box.</p>
<p>2. Revoke your work account’s Skype for Business Online license and then re-assign it.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Larry</p>

<p>Hello Larry,</p>
<p>I was able to join the meeting as Attendee, I joined to the broadcast initiated from my test tenant ( &nbsp;domain[modified by moderator].com)</p>
<p>SFB - Version : ( 16.0.4229.1024) 32-bit</p>
<p>Windows 7 - sp1 - 64 bit machine</p>
<p>1) SIP address is there already.</p>
<p>2) I have tried this broad cast with multiple people on my org. Removing and assigning the license back will not be a feasible solution.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time,</p>
<p>Rinesh Chandran.</p>

<p>Hi Rinesh,</p>
<p>Thanks for your information.</p>
<p>Regarding “I have tried this broad cast with multiple people on my org”, I’d like to confirm whether you have joined the broadcast meeting in different network environments and computers with different OS versions. If no, please try it. This is to confirm
 if the issue is related to specific accounts.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<h2>            i got hacked &#40;or phished&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>i'm thinking they got my login info via the bioware/EA forums that got hacked. Bought a bunch of points - 2 charges were autoreversed by MS, the 3rd was not. I'm being told it takes TWENTY FIVE BUSINESS DAYS to finish this, which is ridiculous. During this
 time, my account will be locked.&nbsp; I want to play Gears 3 when it comes out.</p>
<p>Are there any options to just nuke my old account &amp; start fresh? i really dont care about my gamerscore much, i just want to play, thats it. I've already disputed the remaining CC charge and will be getting a credit - funny how the bank can wrap it up in
 like 2 days.</p>
<p>whats the best,quickest way to get back online? i just want to be able to play. Can i xfer my gold account to a newgamertag or something?

<p>i may give that a try tomorrow - i would hate to be paying for 2 accounts, so that's my issue. Was supposed to get an email outlining the process, but nothing came in yet. maybe when gears comes out they will give some of those month free cards or something,
 could possibly just create a second username or something.</p>

<p>would i have been smarter to just:</p>
<p>(1) change all my xbox live login passwords &amp; such</p>
<p>(2) just dispute the charge on my CC bill, and never contact MS?</p>
<p>seems if i did it that way, i bypass the "30 day shutdown" or whatever it is.</p>

            Hi Shiv,<br />
<br />
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of your TV?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What happens when you connect?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the computer?
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you tried to use different HDMI cable and check if it works?<br />
<br />
</span><br />
<span><span>If your computer's video card has been designed to work well with HDTV, it might come with its own software for setting screen resolution to match the 16:9 formats.<br />
<br />
</span><b>Method 1: </b>I would suggest you to run hardware and devices troubleshooter and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/open-the-hardware-and-devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/open-the-hardware-and-devices-troubleshooter</a></p>
<br />
<b>Method 2:</b><b><span>After you have the right cable (HDMI Cable), follow these steps to connect your computer to your TV.</span></b>
<p><span>Turn off your computer and position it within easy reach of your TV. Disconnect the monitor, but leave the mouse and keyboard connected.</span></p>
<p><span>Connect the appropriate video cable from your computer's output to your TV.</span></p>
<p><span>Turn on your TV and set it to the input that matches the output on your computer. You might need to refer to the user's guide included with your TV for instructions on how to do this.</span></p>
<p><span>Turn on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>You should see Windows displayed on your TV. If the screen looks stretched, or part of the screen seems cut off, you probably need to adjust the screen resolution in Windows.
</span></p>
<p><span>If you can't see Windows on your TV, you might need to reconnect the computer to your monitor and adjust the screen resolution before you connect to your TV.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>To adjust screen resolution refer this step:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Right click on the desktop, select screen resolution; check if the resolution is set to 1</span><span>024x768. If it is not set to
</span><span>1</span><span>024x768, change it to </span><span>1</span><span>024x768. Check with the issue.<br />
<br />
<b>Also refer to the link: </b></span></p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>I’m confident that steps suggested above will help us fix your issue. If you face any further issues, please reply to this post and we'll be happy to
 assist you further.</span><br />
