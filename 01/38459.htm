<h2>            US Cellular Broadband Connect and Win 8</h2>
                    <p>Has anybody else tried to use the US Cellular / Huawei UML397 4G LTE usb laptop modem with Windows 8? I guess the official word from US Cellular is that the Huawei UML397 is not supported in Windows 8; they are working on a software update.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a whole list of devices associated with&nbsp;the UML397 that are&nbsp;installed by Windows 7:
</p>
<p>-usb composite device</p>
<p>-huawei mobile connect - modem</p>
<p>-huawei mobile connect - pc ui interface (com 5)</p>
<p>-huawei mobile connect - application interface (com 3)</p>
<p>-huawei mobile connect - network card</p>
<p>-usb mass storage device</p>
<p>-usb mass storage device</p>
<p>-huawei mass storage usb device</p>
<p>-huawei sd storage usb device</p>

            <p><span>Hi Moses,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>We are glad to know that you have chosen Windows 8 and thank you for asking this question on Microsoft Community.</span></p>

 issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1) What is the exact error message you are receiving when trying to connect?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From the US Cellular website, it looks like the device is not supported by Windows 8 Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.uscellular.com/uscellular/cell-phones/showPhoneDetails.jsp?productId=prod1830119" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.uscellular.com/uscellular/cell-phones/showPhoneDetails.jsp?productId=prod1830119</a></span></p>

            <p>I have tried the US Cellular / Huawei UML397 on Windows 8, even though US Cellular says it is not supported.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The software located on the modem installed without changing the application compatibility level. It will connect to the internet in Windows 8 and seems to function okay most of the time.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program mphonetools.exe did crash once. Windows logged error reports, but I am not able to submit them. When I click on "Check for solutions" in the Action Center, it states I am not connected to the Internet. But I can open Internet Explorer and the
 internet works fine. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have located the report.wer files on my hard drive for the recorded events. Is there another way to submit these windows error reports without using the Action Center?

            US Cellular has an update available for their Broadband Connect software.&nbsp; The UML397 modem came with software version 1.12 and the update is 1.15.&nbsp; It is listed as a 12.08MB update.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully it will resolve the application crashes that have happened
 to me in both Windows 8 and Windows 7.

    <title>Error during printer installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> szante  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error during printer installation</h2>
                    I`m getting an error ISO34 during the installation of Brother MFC-J835DW printer. I called Brother support and they told me to check Start-Run-services.msc-Print Spooler. Print Spooler (and nth else - it says that ActivX is blocked) does not show up on
 the extended list (I`m wondering if thats a problem), but it shows on the standard one and it works properly. The driver installation went half fine - the scanner is working but the installation didn`t finish and the printing option is not working. Brother
 support said that this is problem with the operating system. I would appreciate any help, thank you.

<h2>            Spieler melden und bannen</h2>
                    
<p>Hallo, ich spiele Forza3 und habe gestern ein Auto Ferrari GTO ersteigert.<br />
Danach wurde ich und meine Mutter ect.von dem Spieler&nbsp; [Mod removed] aus extremste beschimpft und beleidigt.<br />
Ich habe ihn hÃ¶fflich erklÃ¤rt das hier auch Kids und junge Teenager auch spielen und er seine sehr extremen Beschimpfungen unterlassen soll und ich eine Beschwerde gegen ihn einreichen werde und ich blieb hÃ¶fflich und sachlich.</p>
<p>So und jetzt kommt das beste, jetzt schreibt er, er sei ein 9 jÃ¤hriges MÃ¤dchen das sich durch mich bedroht fÃ¼hlt usw. Diese Schimpfworte schrieb niemals eine 9 jÃ¤hrige, niemals.<br />
Meine Frage wer wurde von diesem Spieler auch schon beleidigt und wie kann ich eine ausfÃ¼rliche Beschwerde bei XBoxLive einreichen.Die eingebaute Beschwerde Option in der Xbox360 reicht mir nicht, auserdem kann ich dort seine Nachricht mit Drohungen und Beschimpfungen
 an mich nicht an Turn10 weiterleiten. So weiÃ also Turn10 nicht um was es geht. Sondern nur das ich mich Ã¼ber eine Nachricht beschwere.</p>
<p><br />
Ich bin dankbar fÃ¼r jede Antwort und Hilfe.<br />
<br />
</p>

            The link is for Windows 8/8.1 as you say so is of little use in this instance.&nbsp; Fix account doesn't give any options to fix the account so delete account is the only useable option.&nbsp; Re-adding the account gives the same error but the live account works
 fine on full Outlook and on my Lumia 950 running Windows 10.

<h2>            Windows Update unable to connect to MS server</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 7 and I have been unable to download any updates since October because Windows Update kept trying to connect to the MS server. Even after I was able to download updates in October, they all failed during installation. I downloaded and ran
 the Windows Update Troubleshooter and it detected and fixed 3 problems. After that, I tried to download Windows Update and again it was unable to connect to the server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly enough, Windows Security Essential was able to download the latest definitions successfully.</p>

<p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're here to help. When Windows Updates fail to install, it is most likely due to corrupted Windows Update components. In order for us to provide you with a more appropriate resolution, may we know what error code/message comes up when attempting to install
 the affected updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest going through the troubleshooting found in this <strong>

<p>You misunderstood&nbsp;my problem. The problem wasn't with installing the updates. The problem was when I ran Windows Update on my computer, it kept checking for updates forever and nothing was downloaded and installed. I didn't even get a message saying that
 no updates are available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running the Windows Update Troubleshooter again shows that the service&nbsp;registration was missing or corrupt and is fixed. I am able to download the latest update files and they are installed without any probem.</p>

<p>Thank you for the clarification, Gary. Perhaps manually resetting the Windows Update components might help. Here is an
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> on how to manually reset the Windows Update components for your reference. Afterwards, delete the
 SoftwareDistribution folder. The SoftwareDistribution folder stores Windows Update history files. Here's what you need to do:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Win + X</strong>, and then select <strong>
Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Stop the Windows Update service and the Background Intelligent Transfer Service. Type the following commands and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>:<br />
<strong>net stop wuauserv</strong><br />
<strong>net stop bits</strong></li><li>Navigate to the <strong>C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution</strong> folder, and then delete its contents. (You may press
<strong>Ctrl + A</strong> to select all the contents, and then hit <strong>Delete</strong>.)<br />
<em><strong>Note</strong></em>: If you are unable to delete some of the files, restart the PC and then run the above commands again, and then try to delete.</li><li>After deleting, start the Windows Update service and the Background Intelligent Transfer Service by typing the following commands, and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>:<br />
<strong>net start wuauserv</strong><br />
<strong>net start bits</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we suggest a repair upgrade using the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool. A repair upgrade installs within Windows and retains your data. Doing so will surely fix any corruptions in the system. You may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">forum article</a></strong> by Andre Da Costa on how to do so.</p>

    <title>File History Backup on External Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oscargowie  say:</h3>
<h2>            File History Backup on External Drive</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is Windows 8.1. I currently do File History Backup on a Western Digital External Passport Drive (WD). The process is working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, on the Passport Drive, I have some files with Long Path Names problem&nbsp;so I cant delete them; each time I attempted to delete them I get the Long Path Error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am thinking of reformatting the WD passport drive in the following manner:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy the File History Backup files from&nbsp; the Passport Drive to my computer hard drive</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reformat the Passport Drive</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy back the file history backup files to the Passport Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My concerns are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will my backup procedure encounter problems addressing (finding) the backup files for future incremental file history backups?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Will everything work smoothly after the above exercise?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What else should I be mindful of?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me, all input appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
<p>

            <p>If you even open the File History folder, you've destroyed your file history back up and need to re-create it from scratch.&nbsp; The File History can only be used from the Control Panel's file history section to browse the backups.&nbsp; Do not attempt to open, copy,
 or even view the files on the file history drive in the folder directly (tit should block you from even opening it with an administrator block, but many users click "continue" anyway and break their backups.)</p>

                    I am trying to access a Windows 7 driver for an HP Deskjet 5940 printer. When I go to the HP website I am informed that the driver is already installed in Windows 7 but when I try to access it on my computer I get a message that there is no driver installed.
 Any ideas?

<p>You will need to get the driver through Windows Update. &nbsp;The easiest way to do this may be to go the Devices and Printers folder, select Add a Printer, Local Pirnter, LPt1: (or some other dummy port, then select "Windows Update" in the lower right corner
 of the printers list. &nbsp;It will take several minutes for the list to repopulate, after that you should be able to simply connect the &nbsp;printer via its USB cable and have PlugNPlay take over.</p>

</p><p>when my computer is woken up, the camera light goes on, little camera icon appears on the screen along with the text &nbsp;" Turning on camera. &nbsp;Making Sure it's you. Couldn't recognize you ... use pin ..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, despite turning it OFF in sign-in options, Hello and use of camera continue to be on. &nbsp;They just stop recognizing my face.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody knows how to _really_ turn Hello off? &nbsp;(Supposedly it is one of the culprits of my battery drain issues).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Marina</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps. &nbsp;I am on a Surface Book. &nbsp;In sign-in options, I hit "Remove" under "Face" and set "Automatically unlock the screen if we recognize your face to" "OFF".&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have version 1511 (OS Build 10586.36)</p>
<p>
</p><p>While trying a few things out to respond to your post, I both resolved my issue and came across what looks like a bug. &nbsp;Here is the info for a bug report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is what my options screen looked like. &nbsp;Hitting "Remove" did something so that the system no longer recognized me, but it did nothing to change what options screen looked like. &nbsp;In other words the screenshot below remained the same after hitting Remove.
 &nbsp;And I could continue to toggle "Automatically unlock the screen ..." on and off. &nbsp;And while Hello no longer recognized me, it wasn't getting disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way out of this turned out to be to click "Improve recognition", which set up my face recognition all over again. &nbsp;Then come back to this screen and click "Remove", and this time it worked, really disabling Hello.</p>
<p>Why it didn't work the first time - don't know. &nbsp;Maybe some sequence of conditions or actions that prevented it from completing the removal completely the first time and hitting "Remove" again no longer had any effects.</p>

<h2>            Music stop when put surface to sleep.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>as my surface pro is also a tablet, I sometimes want to use it as a music player. But even if I'm using XBOX MUSIC, when I press the sleep button it stops the music! Why? We should be able to listen to music on the go and also to quickly change the music
 on the lock screen and all those features available on iOS and Android.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers guys</p>

            <p>There's an option to have computer not go to sleep when plugged in. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's in your battery options: </p>
<p>
</p><p>- go to desktop and click on the battery icon to the right of the taskbar</p>
<p>- then go to more power options </p>
<p>- a window opens up and on the right click the link that says 'change when the computer sleeps</p>
<p>- in your case, under the plugged-in column choose 'never' for both rows</p>
<p>- save or apply changes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. </p>

            <p>Well, the problem is linked with ConnectedStandby, aka Instant Go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Pro1 and Pro2 users, Instant Go is UNAVAILABLE.</p>
<p>But for Pro3 users, the feature is AVAILABLE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without InstantGo you can't play music while the device is sleeping. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Surface Pro and Pro 2 was built, those Core i5 Proccessors simply don't support InstantGo. But the problem was solved before the Surface Pro 3's release.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, just FYI, ALL BAY TRAIL-T tablets supports the feature too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>================================================</p>
<p>I'm a Pro2 user, so I have a "working" solution for your situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, create a new POWER PLAN in your Control Panel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, choose the "Power Saver Mode" as your base plan. You can modify the details of the paln latter. Now name your plan first. For me, I call it "Insomnia" personnally. ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, DO NOT allow your Surface to sleep when times out. And make the Surface turn off it's screen when not in use for a minute. Now press the "Create" button. Here u go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>------------------</p>
<p>Forth, MODIFY your Advanced Power Plan for "Insomnia". </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not allow your Surface go to sleep when pressing the Power Button, or Covering your keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not allow your Surface go to sleep when timed out.</p>
<p>-----------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this your Surface Pro 2 may play music up to 8-10(or even more, I haven't tested yet) hours if you turn off your WiFi and Bluetooth. It's better be used with a Cover, cause the Cover will disable touchscreen, so you can put ur surface in your bag without
 worrying that it will be "mistouched" .</p>

<h2>            ASUS VIVOBOOK 15 R542UQ-DM153 SUCESSFULLY UPGRADED WITHOUT ANY PROBLEMS TO  WINDOWS 10 ENTERPRISE 1809 64BIT BUILD NO  10.0.17763.1 ON 04-10-2018</h2>
                    <p>My Asus Vivobook 15 R542UQ-DM153 successfully upgraded to the latest Windows 10 October update&nbsp; 1809 64bit on 04-10-2018<br />
I&nbsp; observed few new features arintroduced: ::</p>
<p>
</p><div><br />
1)&nbsp; Microsoft edge settings were changed <br />
2)&nbsp; Isolated browsing&nbsp; features are&nbsp; added under&nbsp; device security<br />
3)&nbsp; new snipping tool features has been added</div>
<div>
<p>many more changes&nbsp; are hidden , but i am looking to discover </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I observed&nbsp; few changes were done by the&nbsp; operating system after upgradtion</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; some of the registry keys were deleted&nbsp; in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control ( i merged the krys from backup )<br />
2)&nbsp; system protection will be turned off automatically<br />
3)&nbsp; background wall paper will be changed as normal<br />
4) DEP&nbsp; optout&nbsp; is&nbsp; changed to&nbsp; optin<br />
5) some of the&nbsp; modified registry keys will be deleted while upgrading <br />
6) Recovery partition may be&nbsp; deleted (&nbsp; in my laptop&nbsp; it was deleted , i knew how to add&nbsp; recovery partition manually)<br />
7) Modified BCD&nbsp; settings&nbsp; will be&nbsp; deleted , instead normal bcd&nbsp; will be added </p>
</div>
<div>
<p>i would recommend the user do some settings&nbsp; after upgradation <br />
1) enable&nbsp; system protection ON C drive<br />
2) create initial restore point<br />
3) adjust&nbsp; page file<br />
4) enable&nbsp; crash control<br />
5) add own backgroud wall paper </p>
<p>6) apply latest device drivers, if&nbsp; your laptop or desktop or motherbaord manufacturers has released compatible driver for october 1809&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I heard some users&nbsp; who installed windows in their&nbsp; laptops have&nbsp; problems after upgradation to 1809<br />
1)&nbsp; BSOD errors due to nvidia graphics drivers<br />
2)&nbsp; BSOD errors due to AMD graphics drivers<br />
3)&nbsp; BSOD errors due to Intel graphics drivers<br />
4)&nbsp; Touchpad&nbsp; not worked <br />
5)&nbsp; Monitors may get flickering<br />
6)&nbsp; Fingerfrint reader not working<br />
7)&nbsp; Some HP printers&nbsp; could not be able to print <br />
8)&nbsp; some canon scanners could&nbsp; not be deteted by windows 10<br />
9)&nbsp; WIreless&nbsp; adapters&nbsp; not working<br />
10) Keyboard not working<br />
11)&nbsp; Bluetooth not detected </div>
<div>
<p>I am&nbsp; saying true , i never got&nbsp; any errors&nbsp; like BSOD issues ,&nbsp; eventhogh&nbsp; i have&nbsp; installed&nbsp; many device&nbsp; drivers&nbsp; from different manufacturers
<br />
Graphics drivers from intel and nvidia , relatek hd audio drivers from&nbsp; other manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I think i am lucky&nbsp; to&nbsp; get this model laptop ,</p>
<p>I say&nbsp; thanks to Asus research development, who designs this laptop motherboard, led monitor keyboard, nvidia base chip , audio chip , tpm chip ,&nbsp; power management chip, intel chip</p>
<p>
</p><p>I LOVE MY LAPTOP VERY MUCH&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Unable to delete a registry key associated with Mcafee - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to delete a registry key associated with Mcafee</h2>
                    <p>How to delete a ghost key?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi, </p>
<p><span>Under the HKLM\Software, there <span>&nbsp;</span>is an empty <span>&nbsp;</span>key named âMcAfeeâ. It is placed between Macromedia and Microsoft keys.</span></p>
<p><span>When I click on it or just pass the cursor over it by using the arrow keys, on the right side an error box is shown, stating an Error Opening Key and also informing something like âMcAfee cannot be opened. An error is preventing this key from being
 opened. Details: The system cannot find the file specifiedâ.</span></p>
<p><span>It seems to me that it is some wasted entry left from an older installation of McAfee Antivirus which came to my laptop and I quickly uninstalled because do not like McAfee apps.</span></p>
<p><span>Well, I have done everything I know so far in order to erase this damed key however I got no success because Windows argues it doesnât exists. But if so, why is it shown on the registry?</span></p>
<p><span>So, my question for you, fellows, is: Is there a secure way to delete this key for once and for all? I mean, the key is not really causing any trouble, but I simply do not like the facts it stands in my registry and I cannot erase it by my own.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Many thanks for any help.</span></p>

    <title>Bluetooth Settings Window - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bluetooth Settings Window</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When i go to Settings to pair my Bluetooth headset the window closes.</p>
<p>All Bluetooth related services are on and drivers up to date. The Bluetooth icon appears. The problem is that the window closes and can't pair anything. Troubleshoot won't work and all drivers in my PC are updated. I no longer know what is wrong this just
 happened randomly and it worked before.</p>

            HI,<br />
<br />
Check with the headset maker's support.<br />
<br />
Try this :<br />
<br />
Turn OFF the Bluetooth device.<br />
<br />
On Computer Start Menu -&gt; Settings -&gt;&nbsp;Devices -&gt; Connected Devices - Add a Device<br />
<br />
HOLD the Power Button on the device for 8+ seconds until the BLUE light starts to flash.<br />
<br />
Device has entered pairing mode - on computer click "Search for Devices"<br />
<br />
Install or update drivers if needed though Windows 10 will have many.<br />
<br />
If paired -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Sound - Playback Devices - set as Default if desired.<br />
<br />
================================<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Check with your System/Motherboard maker and install the latest Bluetooth<br />
Drivers. Ask their support and in their forums about any known issues.<br />
<br />
Also update the BIOS and chipset drivers while there as they can also affect<br />
the Bluetooth operation.<br />
<br />
===========================<br />
<br />
Good idea to update all the major&nbsp;drivers :&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- Double check these </strong>
<br />
<br />
Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates <br />
to&nbsp;the&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate&nbsp;device
<br />
drivers.&nbsp;Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without
<br />
Dump in&nbsp;their name.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Glad you got it fixed however be aware that programs such as Tweaking usually cause a lot more issues than they fix. And all of what they do can be done manually.

<h2>            Recto Verso printing problems on printer OFFICE JET J6410</h2>
                    <p>Good morning</p>
<p>I have an office jet printer J6410 which I primarely used with a computer with Windows XP system. So no problem to use the corresponding CD</p>
<p>Now I'm on another computer (with Windows 7 system) so had to load on HP corresponding new drivers</p>
<p>But it comes that now on my screen, I have several applications when want to print document (manual, left page, right page) but don't get any possibilty to print a document in ''recto_verso''.</p>
<p>I even check in my printer preferences and other but the ''recto-verso(' application is shown as ''non installed''</p>
<p>Can someone help me and tell me how can find the right way and by which means?</p>
<p>Thanks to anyone in advance</p>

            Recto Verso can also be consider "double-sided printing."&nbsp; You need to install the correct Windows 7 drivers in order to get all the features of your printer to work.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
We are not sure why the windows media player has 2 copies of each music file. May be you might have tried to play those files, which might have added it to media player.&nbsp; M4a files are related to iTunes.</p>
<p><br />
You may try manually removing those m4a files from windows media player library.</p>
<p>Go to windows media player library and right-click on the m4a file and select Remove from list. (don't delete it from the library)</p>
<p><br />
Also clear the check mark for Add local media files to library when played and check.</p>
<p><br />
1. Click the Start button, click All Programs, and then click Windows Media Player.</p>
<p><br />
If the Player is currently open and youâre in Now Playing mode, click the Switch to Library button in the upper-right corner of the Player.</p>
<p><br />
2. In the Player Library, click Organize, click Options, and then click the Player tab.<br />
3. To prevent media files on your computer from being added to your Player Library when you play them, clear the Add local media files to library when played check box, and then click OK.</p>
<p><br />
Let us know if this works.</p>

    <title>Installing Windows 8 after 8 years of Linux - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 0x80  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Windows 8 after 8 years of Linux</h2>
                    <p>Hey , i am a Web developer and a full time Linux user for about 8 years .&nbsp; </p>
<p>Recently i had a change in my life that requires me to do a lot of traveling, So i bought myself a Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 14 Ultrabook . Obviously it came with Windows 8.1 Pro installed on it . My plan was to wipe it out and install a Linux system instead.&nbsp;
 But when i turned it on and had a chance to interact with the system for couple of hours, i decided to stick with Windows for a while and make some Windows Phone apps ( as i got a windows 8 phone recently ).
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So here i share my experience with Windows 8.1 after 8 years of Linux only :</strong></p>
<p>First thing i have installed Visual Studio 2013 Community edition , but the installer was crashing for some reason . In addition to that i have noticed that the computer is full of Lenovo software/drivers that pop out every couple of minutes asking for updates
 and popping out various notifications. </p>
<p>I have a 30GB 3G internet plan with my mobile phone provider so it was a pain to disable all the automatic updates of about 12 software packages.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The bottom line , the computer was full of crappy Lenovo and other brands software that just gets in my way and i don't want to use.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even worse after about 2 days some of the bundled Lenovo apps started crashing once in a while. I know this issue is not
 related to microsoft, and i am not blaming them for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the decision was to install a clean Windows 8.1 system . ( Good luck with that ... )</p>
<p>When i came to my office i have downloaded a Windows 8 Installation media from
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a> page . ( btw i was amazed by the fact that i can download an official Windows version from Microsoft ).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i got home i started the Setup process , but it asked me for a product key . As i have found the OEM license model has changed in Windows 8. If you buy a Windows 8 pre-installed computer, you will no longer see a sticker on the back machine with a product
 key printed on it. The key is now embedded in BIOS and can be retrieved automatically during the activation process in Windows 8.&nbsp; With a help of my phone i have found some pre-installation keys on the internet and the setup has continued . In the process
 i have wiped all the partitions i had on my drive because Lenovo had setup a restore partition as really don't want to restore this bloated version ever!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8 Setup was finished and after couple of questions my clean Windows 8.1 Install was ready . But hey .... ! What is going on?</p>
<p>i have no internet access!&nbsp; Device manager shows me 8 Question marks with unknown hardware and my WiFi adapter is part of that list.</p>
<p>This can't be happening! i am on the go and i have no internet .. can you get the picture ? no internet ! and i have a week left until i get back to my office.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm so lucky that i have internet access on my phone , so i rush to Lenovo support site and find the drivers i need , 230mb WiFi driver ! What ?!</p>
<p>Well i have no choice, i am trying to download that, but my phone says to me that exe is not a supported file type and refuses to download it !</p>
<p>At this point i don't care supported or not, i just want to download it and transfer it to my laptop via usb cable , but i am out of luck.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try to find some downloader application in the store but every one of them has a limit of 20mb over cellular connection. Now i am really frustrated and i cannot understand why this should be a hardcoded limit and why can't i disable it if i need. I starting
 to feel that the whole ecosystem is trying to get in my way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decide to leave this stuff for tomorow and just install a Visual Studio from an ISO i have downloaded earlier, just to make time go by . Visual Studio is installed , i start a new Windows Phone JavaScript project, trying to test the code on emulator and
 bam! it tells me that i cannot start emulator without a verified developer account.&nbsp; Now i am really pissed off, i don't want to waste my time any more and i go to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the morning i get on my bike, drive to an internet cafe , download a Live USB with Ubuntu 14.04 , return to my place and Install ubuntu on the whole drive.
</p>
<p>Guess what , Everything works like a charm , WiFi is working , i am able to access the internet , touchscreen and gestures work as expected , all the function buttons do what they should i feel back at home . I start Subleme Text , download some npm packages
 and started writing code.</p>
<p>All of this took me no more than 40 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can't be right , a modern operating system with a 4GB install media has no minimal support for a modern workstation laptop?&nbsp; I remember when the things where the other way around when i just started using Linux , modems where not working, video drivers
 where some black voodoo you need to mess with, but windows had it all working.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well maybe its my carma after using Linux for 8 years, but for me it was a very frustrating experience and i think it is unacceptable for an OS vendor like Microsoft.</p>
<p>I don't expect Windows to be Linux, but hey this is just too much.</p>

            Well to download in Win8 ISO and 20 Drivers to get your system to functions is a shlep.&nbsp; I have been an Windows Enterprise Architect for more then 5 yrs and have now Started at a new Company as a Technical Architect working with only UNIX/LINUX systems
 now.&nbsp; I fell in love with Linux, still getting around Solaris but I have to say ease of use, deployment in Linux is much better then the windows environment. I still run Windows8.1 on my personal lappie for DEV but desktops have all been switched to Ubuntu
 or Centos.

            <p>Yeah, I mean, you could have downloaded the driver at internet cafe to get everything working, this is where it does not make sense. It just means you are quick to judge and you didn't really give Windows a chance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, blame Intel and N-7265 wifi adapter you have in your laptop, not Microsoft. Windows does have a generic driver that works well most of their adapters, but seems like not all of them. That's a question for Intel, why is it not compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Few notes for the future:</p>
<p>1. Always do a fresh install of Windows after you buy a PC. Almost all laptops come with crapware preinstalled. It is just a way for manufacturer to make few extra bucks. Again, blame them, not Microsoft.</p>
<p>2. Don't assume you would have all the drivers bundled with Windows image. Download them from your laptop manufacturer website before you wipe your hard drive, or be sure you can get them downloaded from some other device. Most of drivers are generic and
 you would still need to install proper drivers anyway.</p>

<p>Yep, this is where i got it wrong, i just assume if it works in Linux there is no way it would not work in Windows .<br />

            <p>Wow. You're right. What an epic take down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your one bad experience must be conclusive because you know a lot about computers having used Linux for 8 years. Thanks for letting us all know how after 8 years of using a platform that you seem to have better experiences with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never had that much trouble installing an operating system and getting productive, but I totally get how my never having had the same problem doesn't outweigh your one bad installation experience. I know that I've also never wiped my machine after leaving...civilization...for
 a week, but I'm kind of weird like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of getting rid of the inbox restore method you could have restored and then saved off all the drivers. This is neat...They're in a folder called "DriverStore" in System32. Then you could have blown away the restore partition. Although the key thing...yeah...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an expert with 8 years of Linux usage...it didn't work like you thought it would! Why would the way that it ~actually~ works be different than how you would ~assume~ it works? How dare they!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't build any apps either if they had botched the job this hard the last time that I blindly wiped the drive on my machine while being away from any tools to do a system rebuild...and then decided to write some applications with a completely new platform
 ** to me**.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I think you could have saved yourself more trouble by simply uninstalling the bundled Lenovo software:</p>

 Windows 8 Pro usable without activation? - Super User</span></a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we don't know which SKU of Windows 8 you downloaded at work, could have been Enterprise edition why it did not grab the product key during setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you could have started the install from within the Lenovo installation on the drive, Keep nothing, then updated your drivers through Device manager by pointing to the Windows.old folder at drive C:\</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think downloading the Wi-Fi driver just like downloading the Ubuntu would have just been as easy and you could let Windows Update take care of the rest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing your experience though. I do agree with you, Linux has come a long way since 2003 and my first experiences with Redhat 7.2 and Knoppix. :)</p>

<h2>            BSOD ntosknl.exe and ndis.sys problems</h2>
                    <p>Second time trying to get my new laptop setup for work........first time I did a Dell factory reset, this time it did it again and I'm trying to fix it before doing a reset as I'd like to find out whats causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, it only crashes when the computer is rebooting or shutting down, so I'm thinking the problem is with a driver or a service being shutdown before power off.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I found a problem with WireShark and NCACP drivers causing network errors, even trying to remove the software/drivers caused problems where it would crash, doing a safe mode with no network connection removal of the software fixed it (well I think
 it did, a couple reboots and the problem didn't come back)</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I think I found the problem and continued installing my software programs (mostly 3D printing software, couple work related programs), then went to shutdown the computer and had the same BSOD I was getting before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently trying to figure out whats going on, I installed WhoCrashed and its saying ntosknl.exe and ndis.sys have issues thats causing the crash.........<br />
<br />
I've obviously did a SFC scan, no issues found, checked windows for updates, drivers are new, I'm hoping you people can help out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how to post the dump files or upload them and I'll get them up.<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Hi CT.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.   
<br />
<br />1)  Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Getting error message 823287 when trying to connect to sites</h2>
                    <p>I receive this error message when trying to connect to sites. However, on the Windows support site it gives me&nbsp;3 methods to fix this. I can't seem to use any of them.</p>
<p>Method 1-tells me, locate the MSSQLSERVER service &nbsp;This service may also be listed as MSSQL$SHAREPOINT in the administrative tab under services.
<strong>I don't have this listed anywhere</strong>.</p>
<p>Method 2 -&nbsp; tells me to click Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager in the administrative services tab-
<strong>I don't have that listed either</strong></p>
<p>Method 3 - <strong>same problem</strong> </p>
<p>Now, I have carefully searched for these and don't have them, what to do now?</p>

<p>Hi SlickBison,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The MTU on the router might be too low for xbox live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>MTU</strong>, which needs to meet a minimum of 1384 MTU or higher to play games on Xbox Live. Checking and adjusting your router settings could quickly resolve many gaming issues if this setting is too low.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>This is an old Thread and i think an admin/mod will remove it from the list, if you still have the same problem please submit a new request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
        </p>
