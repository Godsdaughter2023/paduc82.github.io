    <title>MP4 Video File Disappeared - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MP4 Video File Disappeared</h2>
                    <p>I had a video file from a webinar I hosted that was saved as an MP4 video file. &nbsp;This morning, I attempted to upload the file to Google docs by dragging and dropping the file. &nbsp;It seems to have disappeared - it is not showing up in Google, nor am I able
 to find it anywhere on my hard drive. &nbsp;I've searched all files, download folder, recycle bin, everywhere I can think of. &nbsp;Any ideas?? &nbsp;Or am I just doomed?</p>

            <p>Hi Kristen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drag and drop feature on your computer allows you to locate a file from one folder to another. That's why when you moved it to Google docs, the MP4 file was gone from your hard drive. If you're unable to find the file, we suggest that you contact the
 Google Customer Support so that they can give you steps on how to find the file after moving it to Google docs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any other concerns.</p>

    <title>Forza Horizon 4 Online - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 4 Online</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem that I myself cannot solve. With Forza Horizon 3 I could never play online, and now with the release of Forza Horizon 4, my problem continues to exist. Now I have gone through all forums and have tried everything. However, what makes my
 case interesting, is that when viewing my network status in the Xbox app, my teredo qualifies, and there are no issues portrayed. I haven't seen a thread yet on this issue. I have even brought my computer to a friends house and have tried to see if it is my
 internet. It is not because he can play online perfectly fine. Now, the strangest thing is that I can play online if I join a convoy with him. This is the only way I can experience online and I'd really like to be able to play without needing him to bring
 me in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any recommendations or ideas to fix this issue would be dandy.</p>

    <title>USB Flash drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charleshellyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Flash drive</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded to Windows 10 successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to use my USB Flash Drive (500GB) as a backup drive.</p>
<p>It is not accepted by File History and it will not backup to&nbsp;this drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I plug in my flash drive it appears in two menus:</p>
<p>In my File Explorer there are normally&nbsp;four items namely:</p>
<p>OneDrive</p>
<p>This PC</p>
<p>Network </p>
<p>Homegroup</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I plug in my USB Flash Drive it appears as an extra item in File Explorer, but also in the This PC as a label.
</p>
<p>Both seem to show the same content.</p>
<p>Is this normal? and can I copy to either of them assuming that the same image will&nbsp;be identical in both&nbsp;both?</p>

            <p>OK thanks. </p>
<p>The message when trying to create a system image to the USB Flash drive&nbsp;is "the drive is not a valid backup location' . I have managed to create a system image to my external hard drive.
</p>
<p>Previously it threw&nbsp;the USB Flash drive&nbsp;out because it was not NTFS. I have reconfigured it and it is now an NTFS drive with the same result "the drive is not a valid backup location' . I have tried different ports with no change.</p>
<p>I tried the trouble shooter you suggest and it said it found something and fixed&nbsp;it and to try what I was doing again. It did not say what it fixed. I did try again and now&nbsp;File History&nbsp;cannot find the previous drive I was using File History to (under 8.1?)
 and&nbsp;says I must reconnect the drive. The drive is connected but it cannot find it???</p>
<p>
</p><p>So,</p>
<p>1: I have a system image on my external hard drive, but Windows 10 will not create one on my flash drive.</p>
<p>2: It seem to want to create a File History on my flash drive but cannot find the drive that last had a File History (under 8.1) even though that drive is connected. So File History seems to be dysfunctional now and has never been able to run under Windows
 10. How can I reinitiate File History from scratch so that it doesn't look back?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Few reasons as to why&nbsp;you were receiving the error message
</span></span></span><strong>the</strong> <strong>drive is not a valid backup location</strong>

            <p>USB drive <strong>the</strong><strong>drive is not a valid backup location </strong>
for 'create system image' &nbsp;<strong>:</strong></p>
<p>I do not fully understand Sharing. I have tried to set&nbsp;the Flash Drive&nbsp;as shared and only allowed to share with 2 .. this did not fix the problem or change the resulting message.</p>
<p>The size of the image is&nbsp;far smaller than the 500 GB I have available on this flash drive</p>
<p>I believe that File history will now use the drive after repairing 'corruption' which I will refer to later. However, I have not tried it fully. It does not say that it cannot be used for that purpose now.</p>
<p>The drive letter remained the same, and is still listed twice.The
<strong>File History problem</strong> I was experiencing:</p>
<p>I renamed the File History file as '.old' and this has solved the problem on my external hard drive which I now use as my File History drive. I do not believe that you can&nbsp;use two&nbsp;locations for the File History function. This makes sense to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have therefore decided that I will not use the Flash Drive for backup until further notice and have cleared my external&nbsp;hard drive of all other backup other than System images and File History</p>

            Further, I did a Check on the Flash Drive and it said it was corrupted. I ran the repair routine which said it found errors - did the repair and it said it 'is now ready for use' but did not say what it found. Despite this it would still not change it
 from 'not a valid backup location'

<h2>            Unsecured items on the browser.</h2>
                    <p>I use MSN.com as a homepage.&nbsp; Recently I noticed a small i with a circle around it in the address box next to the web address of the page.&nbsp;&nbsp; clicked on it and learned that there is a whole slew of unsecured or non-validated sites or cookies with access to
 the page.&nbsp; On the other hand there are also quite a number of sites or cookies that are "secure".</p>
<p>How can I block the unsecured items from the sites?</p>

            <p>Hi Jessica</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am seeing the indication of secure vs. unsecured origins on Chrome. &nbsp;I was not correct in my initial email that it was sites or cookies that were unsecured. It appears that the message refers to the origin using http or https protocols to access the pages.
 &nbsp;The other browser I use, Edge, doesn't give the whole address in the address bar so I can't tell if it also suffers from the same problem. &nbsp;Back to the unsecured origins - the sites are common and widely used sites such as MSN.com and others such as oft.msn.com
 that I don't recognize. &nbsp;I probably shouldn't block them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand I use att.yahoo.com as another home page and that site as well as others accessed through that site use secured origins - the https protocol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I try to answer your question I find myself even more confused as to what is going on. &nbsp;Can you help me?</p>
<p>

                    I'm running Windows 7 Home Premium Version 6.1 (Build 7600) and it does not show that Service Pack 1 is installed. Windows Update has never offered this update to me, even though it is set on automatic updates. Should I attempt a&nbsp;manual install or does

<h2>            Windows didn&#39;t activate</h2>
                    <p>Heya</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I got this old PC from my school, they were having a clear out. It was running Windows 7 Professional, so I decided to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro, so I got my trusty laptop, created a installation media using Microsoft's official tool, and installed Windows
 10 Pro. Flawless, everything works fine, could it be that I got a working computer?&nbsp;<strong>Windows isn't activated</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I mess something up? Am I just an idiot? More importantly, can this be resolved? I don't wanna have to go back to Ubuntu, I like Windows :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>All help is appreciated, calling me cheap for getting my first desktop through my school is not so appreciated...</p>

            Hi  Flibberfire
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Can you check if there is a COA sticker on the side or top of the unit for Windows 7 Professional?
<br />
<br />Usually organizations and schools will come preinstalled with OEM Windows 7 Professional, unless the systems originally came with Windows Vista Business or Windows XP Professional OEM and were upgraded to the schools volume license copy of Windows 7.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the prompt, type: slmgr.vbs /dlv
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Take a screenshot of the resulting dialog then post in a reply here.
<br />

            Hi Flibber.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The free Upgrade ended almost three years ago.  However there are still reports that it works to activate with the Windows 7 Product Key.  So if you can find one on the COA sticker that's readable you can try inserting that in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change Product Key.   Pay close attention to accuracy, if necessary take a picture with your phone you can blow up, then proofread the input three times.  
<br />
<br />If that fails then you'll need to buy a Product Key to personalize Windows.  You can also ask your school if they have free or discount copies of Windows.  Most a part of a program like Dreamspark that offers this.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Well, thats why you are getting that error. The issue seems to be school was probably using a volume license copy of Windows 7 Professional that was originally upgraded from the preinstalled OEM Windows Vista Business. 
<br />
<br />So, the issue is, the machine doesn't have a valid qualifying license. Unless you are able to get the Windows 7 key from the school (I doubt it); your only option might be to purchase a license for it.

            <p>Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry I should have placed more information on this. When I shut the computer down, it comes up with a blue screen with the following;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>:(</p>
<p>Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.</p>
<p>We're just collecting some error info, and then</p>
<p>we'll restart for you. (0% complete)</p>

<p>If you'd like to know more, you can search online later for this error.</p>

<p>I have done nothing or installed anything new when this started to happen. this is a brand new computer and has just started to do this. it restarts fine, and when it is shut down boots up normally.</p>

            I have been getting this on my surface Rt. I noticed that it only happens sometime after I try to log off. Even before I added two users, I was getting this issue, again when logging off. I have tried to reinstalling the OS thru the settings but after
 a while it happened again.

            Actually, al you have to do is install the latest update to splashtop. I did that this morning, after reading your answer, and then ran through all the scenarios that have caused the BSoD and it hasn't happened at all. At least that's all my problem took
 to fix.<br />

            <p>I have the same problem on two Windows 8 computers. One is the Samsung Slate 7 from PDC. The other is a new Dell XPS-12.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have splashtop installed on either computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;BSoD&nbsp;happens only&nbsp;when you shut down. It's saying that a driver is still holding onto memory when it should have released its resources.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On both machines, if I goto Device Manager and delete the USB drivers (don't need to delete the files), then reboot, the drivers get re-installed and all is well for a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems as though the&nbsp;problem comes back if I plug a new device into a USB.&nbsp; Existing devices can be plugged in and out without problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I have noticed on my Dell XPS-12 that on at least one occasion, the touch screen stopped responding and then I tried to shut down and&nbsp;got this error. The touch drivers are USB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem seems to be a race condition of some sort and seems to be a Microsoft problem, not a Dell or Samsung problem.</p>

            <p>Here are the repro steps that I had (they aren't very consistent but I think they're close):</p>
<p>1. Remote login (mstsc.exe) into the Windows 8 Pro machine where you want to see this error.</p>
<p>2. Ensure you're carrying out some tasks. (I had Visio, Powerpoint and Outlook on and running)</p>
<p>2. Then go to the Windows 8 Pro machine and log into the machine directly at the console.</p>
<p>3. If you're lucky you'll see the "SESSION_HAS_VALID_POOL_ON_EXIT" error message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need the Minidump contact me at work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            I am having the same, exact problem and the same, identical error is popping up on my pc. I have an HP Envy x2 with Windows 8. I just bought it three months ago and love it; however, about three weeks ago, every single solitary time I go to shut down my
 computer, this error pops up and all of the replies within this forum are not very helpful for me at all. I don't understand all the lingo and the computer talk. As for "Splashtop", I don't understand its relevance with this particular issue and error. This
 computer is pretty much brand new and I can't figure out why I would run into issues like this with such a new system. I never had any other problem except for this one, and the newest issue is my Hulu app which I pay every month for has been shutting off
 and going straight to my app start screen completely on its own. My son and I were trying to watch a movie on it and it kept doing this issue, probably did it about 12 time before I finally gave up and told him we would just have to watch a

We were able to test this out on our own machines and didn't run into any trouble, so that we don't repeat any steps, what troubleshoot have you tried already? It may be worth uninstalling the client completely, restarting PC, and then re-downloading it to see if there's any change. Keep us in the loop and thanks a ton for your patience with this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I believe it's actually an issue with how it's calibrated out of the box, and how it's calculating remaining time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did it actually die after 4 hours?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try charging it to 100%, then unplug and leave it running overnight. Might want to temporarily disable automatic sleep/hibernate (change to Never). I did that and it still had 20-30% when I woke up 7 hours later, even though it reported it only had about
 4-5 hours when I went to bed. Then plug it back in and let it charge to 100%. Maybe repeat once or twice, but I'm no battery expert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my battery stats after about 15 minutes unplugged, doing mostly web browsing:</p>

            <p>First and foremost, how do I get promoted content like that :) </p>
<p>
</p><p>what did you do with your display overnight, did it turn off or did you leave it on?&nbsp; Sleep never, hard drive never, what about eh display and what percentage is the brightness at on your display?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine is definitely draining. It is even draining when in hibernate mode. I'll post screen shots shortly. But it seems to be losing 1% per 30 minutes in hibernate mode.&nbsp; 2% an hour.&nbsp; Something is not right here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to do what you're suggest. what are you getting?</p>

            <p>Promoted? I know nothing of that. Heh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I let my display turn off on battery and plugged in, and I didn't change that to do the test/recalibration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You really just need to disable the automatic sleep to do this - as long as it's running it'll sip power from the battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure it's hibernating? Or is it just sleeping? Hibernation means it transfers the RAM content to disk and shuts down, with a flag in the BIOS/OS to restore on startup. So hibernate shouldn't use any power. Sleep, on the other hand, keeps the memory
 alive by using a little power, so 1 or 2% an hour sounds about right.</p>

            <p>I picked up&nbsp;my SB first thing Monday morning the 26th&nbsp;at 10:00 AM.&nbsp; I've been using it literally non-stop ever since.&nbsp; I've only had it on battery&nbsp;a few times for only a couple of hours at a time.&nbsp; &nbsp;I'm a night owl and decided to do a test as I was working
 last night about an hour before I slept.&nbsp; I did lots of looking and note taking in OneNote.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went on battery at 1:18 AM Oct 30.</p>
<p>Noted that screen dimmed the moment charging cord removed.</p>
<p>Brightness is at 60% for the entire test.</p>
<p>95% 7 hours 45 minutes remaining 1:42 AM</p>
<p>90% 7 hours 19 minutes remaining 2:00 AM</p>
<p>83% 6 hours 33 minutes remaining 2:31 AM</p>
<p>(Shutting the lid and going to bed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Will check battery in the AM.)</p>
<p>58% 3 hours 45 minutes remaining 5:33 AM</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>52% 6:00 AM (remaining time not displayed)</p>
<p>47% 3 hours 20 minutes remaining 6:18 AM</p>
<p>(Display Driver has stopped and restarted) 6:27 AM</p>
<p>43% 2 hours 44 minutes remaining 6:32 AM</p>
<p>34% 2 hours 40 minutes remaining 7:09 AM</p>
<p>29% 1 hour 22 minutes remaining 7:31 AM</p>

<p>15% 1 hour 1 minutes 8:10 AM</p>
<p>14% 26 minutes 8:12 AM</p>
<p>12% 23 minutes 8:20 AM</p>
<p>Just a little over 7 hours of battery.</p>
<p>Plugging in…</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't like the drop from 83% to 58% after sleeping for 3 hours and doing nothing other than putting the SB to sleep too.</p>
<p>I was looking forward to getting 12 hours of battery life like Panos said.&nbsp; This is nothing close.&nbsp; Disappointing.</p>

            Guys you need to give it a few days to calibrate. I am getting ~ 4 hours the first day or two because all the file synchronization and indexing. Now it is 5 hr remaining at 50%. I set my display driver to intel HD 520 only. Have not tested auto-select.
 I would expect that will decrease battery life&nbsp;by a couple of hours.

<p>Hi Soph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>The most common cause of an out-of-date account is an incorrect password. Remove your account from the Mail app then change your password. Re-add your account afterwards.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Tip</em></strong>: To change your account password for your account, visit the website of your email provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If the <span>password isn't the problem, you may have a certificate error. If so, there should be another message that says,
<em>"There is a problem with the server's security certificate. The security certificate is not from a trusted certifying authority."</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This error often happens when you don't use SSL to secure your email account. To fix this error, use the following steps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Choose <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Manage Accounts.</strong></li><li>Choose the account that's out-of-date to display the account settings dialog.</li><li>Choose <strong>Change mailbox sync settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced mailbox settings</strong>. You may have to scroll down in the dialog to see
<em>Advanced mailbox settings</em>.</li><li>Check the boxes for<strong> Require SSL for incoming email</strong> and <strong>
Require SSL for outgoing email</strong> then choose <strong>Done </strong>&gt; <strong>
Save</strong>.</li></ol>

                    <p>I am sick of Windows update breaking things on MY PC.&nbsp; Unfortunately, many of the tools I use only run on Windows.&nbsp; I am stuck and MS knows it.&nbsp; One of my machines runs Home.&nbsp; Thank goodness it's only one.&nbsp; But even the Pro version eventually gets broken,
 at least by then I have already fixed things once.&nbsp; What an existence!&nbsp; I never signed up to work for MS.&nbsp; Every time I am notified that Windows has updated and needs to reboot my PC, I am anxious.&nbsp; Something(s) going to break.&nbsp; The only entity up to challenging
 MS is the government.&nbsp; But we see where that goes.</p>

<p>Maybe you should try and find out why your particular combination of hardware and software cause such issues. Do you use utility type programs? Do you edit the registry? Do you use 3rd party anti-virus? Do install/uninstall lots of programs? Is your hardware
 old?</p>
<p>Could be any number of reasons why you are seeing such issues.</p>

<p>So true, I am in the same boat with MANY others who use their machines, customize them by installing things.&nbsp; So, you think it must be my fault?&nbsp; My hardware is about 18 months old.&nbsp; See, on Linux, this isn't a problem at all.&nbsp; When I disable something or
 choose a default, it stays that way (on Linux).&nbsp; So, if it can be done by volunteers, I guess MS could do it if they wanted to.&nbsp; And I have been running a Linux server for about 18 years.&nbsp; I have seldom needed to reboot it, and it's fully patched, and runs
 on a tiny 8-core ARM SBC (the size of a Raspberry Pi) that uses about 22 Watts of power (including the HDD) and is faster than a PC for my purposes.&nbsp; It runs a MySQL database server for my VCS, a web server (Apache), secure sockets, a print server, a file
 server (SMB and NFS), and a mail server on our small network.&nbsp; It just works. Always.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I buy a house and use natural gas, do I have to sign a T&amp;A agreement with the gas company (which actually
<em>is a service</em>), allowing them to enter my property any time (even if I am in the middle of cooking a meal in the cold of winter) and do as they please, then leave without ensuring they haven't broken things in my home?&nbsp; That is what "Windows as a service"
 amounts to.&nbsp; Just read the posts here and elsewhere, along with numerous articles in trade publications.&nbsp; This is why MS allows enterprises to opt-out of automatic updates, BTW.&nbsp; They tacitly admit it breaks things.&nbsp; I am tired of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just now I notice that last night's update broke a Windows App that is used by millions of people all over the planet.&nbsp; It crashed on startup.&nbsp; The previous update caused its icon, which I have pinned to Windows' taskbar, to disappear (now it's, just a blank
 spot).&nbsp; That's on different machines with different hardware/software setups.&nbsp; The icon is still visible where I have pinned it to the start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS needs to fix the foundation of Windows first:&nbsp; I had the nerve to want to use a MP3 file for one of the alarm notifications by Windows' Clocks &amp; Alarms app.&nbsp; With MS' help it broke notifications.&nbsp; That's ridiculous!&nbsp; After hours of wasted time, they gave
 me the instructions to fix them (using an elevated command prompt).&nbsp; I will never try to use a custom alarm sound again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS' "solution" to updates breaking things is to turn on metered service.&nbsp; That's lame.&nbsp; It prevents me from downloading a 1.2GB update to an embedded systems tool I use to develop hardware, and firmware.&nbsp; That's one example of many crippling effects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you buy a car, and plug a phone into it, or connect via bluetooth, should the manufacturer ignore warranty repairs because "your particular combination of hardware and software cause such issues" (with components of the car malfunctioning)?&nbsp; Neither should
 MS make excuses when their updates break things, and reset settings like Cortana being disabled.</p>

<p>Sorry, didn't read your rant, I stopped after the 1st sentence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course you can try to fix it yourself. Make a clean install of the O/S. Only install the one or two apps you absolutely need. Run it for a week, then add another app and see if you can't find one that is causing issues. Be sure to not install any utility
 type programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want to try that then please post your issue in as brief of an explanation as possible and leave out the ranting as it's not going to help you solve your issue with your system and maybe someone will try to assist. It may feel good, but ranting
 is quite pointless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Your WordPad data files are *not* stored in the "old edition." They are probably stored in your documents folder, but it really doesn't matter where they are stored. They were stored *by* WordPad, but they are not part of WordPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These files are probably .rtf files, but they could be some other types too. The important thing to realize is that these files are not WordPad files. In fact they have nothing to do with WordPad other than that WordPad is one of *many* programs that can
 read, edit, and write them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to answer your question, no matter what you do to WordPad (even if you remove it entirely), it has no effect on your existing files. Think of it like a screwdriver that you used to assemble a piece of furniture; if you throw away the screwdriver or replace
 it with a new one, you don't lose the furniture. Losing the tool (the screwdriver or WordPad) that built it doesn't lose what it built (the furniture or&nbsp; data file).</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other point: your question suggests that you don't do regular backups of your important data to external media. If that's the case. you've been playing with fire.&nbsp; A<span><span>lmost everyone should be backing up to external media regularly.
 It is always possible that a hard drive crash, user error, nearby lightning strike, virus attack, even theft of the computer, can cause the loss of everything on your drive. As has often been said, it's not a matter of whether you will have such a problem,
 but when.</span></span> </p>

                    <p>Hello Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a user of Windows 7 and 8 that would like drivers for the Xbox 360 chatpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that Windows 10 has drivers being talked about for the XBone chatpad coming out in November, and being advertised.</p>
<p>Does this additionally mean drivers are available for Windows 7 and 8, and that the XBox 360 chatpad would also work for Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's lots of people that would like working drivers for the chatpad on the Windows platform. The chatpad is a Microsoft product, and we'd like support for it. :)</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>So I just finished the main quest and was like "WTF? That was short!" &nbsp;It took me literally like 3, 4 maybe, MAYBE 5 hours. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>.<br />
<br />
I swear it went like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Solstheim </li><li>Go to weird place and meet Miraak </li><li>Have some Telvanni wizard help you some crap </li><li>Talk to some Skaal people </li><li>Break the 5 stones (or whatever) </li><li>Share Skaal knowledge with Herma Mora (or whatever his name is) </li><li>Go back to weird place and kill Miraak </li></ol>
<p>.</p>
<div>It was just kind of 'meh'. &nbsp;I couldn't believe I was done that quick. &nbsp;Don't get me wrong, there are still plenty of side-missions I still have to complete and many more to unlock but the main quest was kind of shallow.</div>
<div>.</div>
<div>Things I liked</div>
<p>.</p>

<div>
<ul>
<li>Ambient feels like Morrowind (best game in the TES series IMO) </li><li>New land </li><li>Awesome art </li></ul>
</div>


<div>Things I didn't like:</div>
<div>.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>For some reason the land feels a lot smaller than in Morrowind's Bloodmoon (though UESP says it's exactly the same size)
</li><li>Short main quest </li><li>Dragon riding is a gimmick as you have very little control over the dragons </li></ul>

<p>Elder Scrolls DLC contain more than just a main story. I got 25+ hours playing Dragonborn, new armors, a bunch of new unique items, new shouts, the best house in the game (for free), and traders who can actually afford to buy my loot. IMHO, it was well worth
 the full price I spent on it.</p>

<p>I got about 25 hours in it and still have a few things to do. &nbsp;The main quest in the main game is fairly short too. &nbsp;But there is so much more. &nbsp;There are a few random dungeons, piles of side quests, factions, and the new armor quest. &nbsp;The 4 part quest at
 the mine takes a lot of time.</p>

<p>I think the DLC was fairly decent. It served it's purpose and gave us some pretty cool shouts and new equipment. Could it have been bigger? Yes, but it was a DLC and they can only do so much. I'm very, very excited on what they give us next.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><em><strong>Are you kidding me you think this DLC is short??? Your Crazy lol I have a little over 20 hours put into the dragonborn DLC so far and I have only completed one main quest. This DLC is just like the main game there
 is soooooooooooo much more to do then just the main quest-line. I think you need to seriously&nbsp;reevaluate how you play Skyrim if you are disappointed with this DLC because it is amazing and definitely not short.</strong></em></span></p>

<p>One could argue the same with the game's main story using that logic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Escape Helgen dragon attack</p>
<p>Warn Whiterun <br />
<br />
Kill your first dragon and get summoned by Greybeards<br />
<br />
Bump into Delphine and learn about Dragons returning<br />
<br />
Go to kynesgrove and show her you're Dragonborn&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Infiltrate Thalmor Embassy<br />
<br />
Go to Riften and get Esbern<br />
<br />
Return to High Hrothgar, talk to Greybeards and&nbsp;Parthunaax&lt;sp about an Elder Scroll<br />
<br />
Go to Septimus Signus's outpost and get sent to a Dwemer ruin to get Elder Scroll<br />
<br />
Return to Septimus, then go back to read Scroll at 'time wound' and learn Dragonrend shout<br />
<br />
Go back to Whiterun and trap Odahviing<br />
<br />
Travel to Savngarde and defeat Alduin<br />
<br />
<br />
You will probably say that's a bit longer, maybe even a good bit longer... but then again we paid ~ 3X more for it. Putting it all into perspective, I just don't&nbsp;think it's fair to base one's opinion of the DLC or the game itself&nbsp;on the length of the main quest(s).
 That's a bit like eating a plain hamburger patty without a bun, ketchup/mustard, cheese... great, now I'm hungry.&nbsp; &gt;.&lt;

<p>Yes, the main DLC could be a bit short. &nbsp;All the DLC (DragonBorn), it is very long and well worth it. &nbsp;I will say that all of the DLC for this game has added 50+plus hours per DLC "for me". &nbsp;I could not ask for nothing more. &nbsp;Just my opinion.</p>

            <p>I have solved that problem&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open run command by clicking windows button and R key.</p>
<p>2. Type "regedit" in run without quotes.</p>
<p>3. After that it will asks for permission cilck "yes"&nbsp;<br />
4. Now you are in registery editor. Click on HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT &gt; find the Directory option in it &gt; Shell &gt; there should be a file whose path should be pointing to adobe bridge in Windows C , delete the file in shell folder by clicking right click and delete.</p>
<p>6. That's it.</p>

<h2>            WHY IS XBOX LIVE SO FRUSTRATING&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>EB Games had a deal that when you got one Xbox live gold membership for three months&nbsp;it would give you one for free I put in the first one it worked then three months later I put in the second one but it just said sorry this code is invalid so what do I do? I guess&nbsp;Microsoft could issue me out another code THAT WILL ACTUALLY WORK but I doubt they would do that.</p>

            <p>Normally when a code shows as invalid that means at least one of the 25 characters you are putting in is incorrect. </p><p><br /></p><p>Keep in mind when looking at the code that Bs can look like 8s and 5s can look like Ss.</p><p><br /></p><p>One thing you can do with xbox support is contact them by going to support.xbox.com/contact-us and they will send you an email that you can reply to with a picture and see if they can decipher the code for you.</p>
