<p>The "account" is really the Security ID and you can change the Account name applied to that SID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Switch the current Account to a Local Account and allocate a Password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log in as that account then go down the same path and switch back to a Microsoft Account and it should come up with the dialogue to enter Microsoft Account credentials where you can use a different (your wife's) set of user name/password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively you can create a new account for your wife, set it as having administrator privileges and log in as that user. As Admin she can then remove your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally you could completely Reset the computer and let your wife start afresh as if&nbsp;a new computer.</p>

<p>This is not correct. A VPN server can use any connection, i.e. modem, CAT5 wired, wireless:</p>

            dial-up is where the modem calls a phone number, and i have u-verse modem for high speed internet where that does not use proxy setting or a phone number but an ip address.

<p>and i'd like to talk about that for a moment because&nbsp;<span>Insomniac (for me) hit the nail on the head with what i've been thinking about the whole 1080p argument.</span></p>
<p><span>"<span>we made the choice to be at 900 because we wanted to push the level of detail, action, the size of the city and the views you can experience as move around"</span></span></p>
<p>i personally don't care about the resolution, otherwise i'd be playing on PC most of the time, and then playing a game like Ryse that i think looks better than almost all of the 1080p games, i gladly give up some p to have a better gaming experience and
 this is a prime example of that mentality that i'd like to see more of.</p>

<p>thanks for the insightful response Akame ga KiIl &gt;_&gt;;</p>
<p>question is, is 1080p so important to some that they'd give up on bigger worlds, more/smarter enemies, better physics just to have a slightly sharper picture? i personally think it's a shame people prefer resolution over quality.</p>

<p>The problem isn't that people believe games HAVE to have 1080p and nothing else matters. The argument people who hound about the resolution is that the Xbox One should be powerful enough to handle all of those details and larger worlds, AND have 1080p/60
 fps.</p>
<p>I personally feel that I am not missing anything is the resolution is sacrificed for larger worlds, etc., so no, I don't care if a game doesn't reach 1080p. But to those complaining about it, this is not a valid argument.</p>

<p>I think it's great when developers sacrifice resolution for better gameplay. Sure, a good graphicy game is nice to look at but if the gameplay sucks I'm out. I rage quit black chap. Like you said with Ryse, that game had superb graphics and stellar gameplay
 or stellar graphics and superb gameplay? I dunno my big words too well but anyway the game as a whole was great. And yeah its a shame people pick resolution over the quality of a game. That's like saying Borderlands 2 is *** because the graphics were too 'cartoony'.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to this game because I like open world games like this but honestly what else is the guy going to say.
</p>
<p>"we made the choice to be at 900 because we wanted to push the level of detail, action, the size of the city and the views you can experience as move around"</p>
<p>Idealy wouldn't the game be 1080p. He makes it sound as though making the game 900p makes the game look better and I don't think people are actually stupid enough to believe this. He should just say we did the best we could and the game is going to look
 great and be awsome. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I personally think it's&nbsp;a shame people start threads like this, knowing it's almost impossible to keep it from becoming nothing but a war.</p>
<p>I don't blame Akame one bit. What was the name of yesterday's flame bait thread? Something about SOM only being 900p if memory serves... and where is that thread now?
</p>
<p>The intent doesn't matter one bit... the title of this thread alone is screaming 'the war continues here'. Just what we need. Another 'discussion' about resolution... SMH</p>

<p>I don't see a huge issue with it, though surprised it wasn't 1080/30. But if what the devs have done provides a good looking and performing game it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The biggest thing with "res gate" is I am sure there will be those stating it's perfectly fine for this to happen on their particular console of choice, but laugh and bash if the competition does it for one of their games.</p>

<p>@ZTROOPER16 There is a big difference. When last generation consoles first came out not many people had HD tv's yet. Some did but they had 720p displays or 1080i.
</p>
<p>So people were not as concerned because there was no hd standard but we are rolling up on 2015 and just about everybody who owns a X1/PS4 has a 1080p display. So there are certain excpectations at this point.</p>

<p>@Z.....if you don't like it, why not refrain from posting negatively and just ignore it? Ranting and raving is not a good way to get your point across.

<p>@Blue - It's not the threads themselves, but the lack of self restraint of those replying to them that causes them to be deleted or locked.</p>

<p>It could be the black ops 2 server, sometimes they can crash if so many people are on especially during the first 24 hours, Halo 4 crashed but &nbsp;that was fixed. If everything is fine with your account its likely its the server.

                    Why, after I have changed the settings to incoming/POP 995 and outgoing/SMTP 465 do they get changed back after awhile?&nbsp; I have checked the "need authentication" box and checked the SSL enabled boxes, but it keeps changing back after I send a test email
 to myself.&nbsp; I chatted online with Cox and one person told me to use POP 993 which worked with a test email, plus I was able to send an email to a friend without it being returned with the code 550.5.1.1 relaying not allowed.&nbsp; I left it for awhile and when
 I got back to the computer I couldn't send another email.&nbsp; Rechecked the settings and they had changed!&nbsp; Changed them back again, sent a test email and it worked.&nbsp; Why does it keep changing?&nbsp; The second Cox person was not at all helpful, was rude and told
 me that the problem lies with Microsoft.&nbsp; I am tearing my hair out by now.&nbsp; Can you please figure this out?&nbsp; I am using Outlook 2003 on my PC, Windows 7.&nbsp; It is ordinary Cox.net em

<p>Port 993 is an IMAP port. 995 is an Pop3 setting. Whichever account type you want to use, create a new account with those port numbers. Once you create an account and try to change the port numbers, some email clients balk at the change. These are my Pop3
 account settings that I have us4ed with Cox for about 10 years now.</p>

            Thank you, I will try this if&nbsp;I continue to have more problems!&nbsp; Funnily enough, when I checked it today nothing had changed and all the correct boxes were still checked.&nbsp; I can't figure that out, but we'll see what happens.&nbsp; It's not like I send a lot
 of emails, but when I do I don't want to have to change settings every single time.&nbsp;

<h2>            Quicken Starter Edition 2015 Won&#39;t accept passwords</h2>
                    <p>It seems that Quicken Starter edition 2015 will install... however when I went to put in the old password...it did not work. I changed passwords at least 3 times ... and it just keeps asking to send another&nbsp; code so I can change the password again.
</p>
<p>Is this program just not going to work on Windows 10? </p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A compatibility discrepancy between the software and the operating system is a possible cause why Quicken Starter edition 2015 will not work on your Windows 10 PC. As per the operating system required for Quicken Starter edition 2015, the compatible Windows
 versions are Windows 7 (32- and 64-bit), and/or Windows 8 &amp; 8.1 (32-bit and 64-bit). What we recommend is that you either check for the Quicken Starter edition, which is compatible with Windows 10; or you may check with the software developer for further assistance
 regarding Quicken Starter edition 2015. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Feel free to post your query should you need assistance. </p>

<h2>            Blue screen of Death error&#58; WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR&#34; &#40;error 124&#41;, while playing the game, Battlefield 3.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: I keep getting random BSOD with diff. errors</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At first I would just get BSOD when playing BF3 about 30min in. "WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR" (error 124). I managed to stop it by disabling all my audio devices but either way the game would still crash to desktop instead of blue screen. Recently I've gotten
 more blue screens&nbsp; but every time it happens it shows a diff. error. I'm completely clueless on what to do.. I've been monitoring GPU and CPU temps but nothing out of the ordinary, ventilation within the case or dust is not a problem (clean).
<br />

<br />
Most of these were related to 0x124_GenuineIntel_PROCESSOR_CACHE<br />
(CPU)<br />
<br />
<div><strong>Stop 0x124 is a hardware error</strong><br />
<em>If you are overclocking try resetting your processor to standard settings and see if that helps.<br />
If you continue to get BSOD here are some more things you may want to consider.</em><br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is"possible" that
 it is driver related (rare).</span></em><br />
<strong><br />
Stop 0x124 - what it means and what to try</strong><br />
<span>Synopsis:</span><br />
<i>A "stop 0x124" is fundamentally different to many other types of bluescreens because it stems from a hardware complaint.<br />
Stop 0x124 minidumps contain very little practical information, and it is therefore necessary to approach the problem as a case of hardware in an unknown state of distress.<br />
</i><br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;Generic "Stop 0x124" Troubleshooting Strategy:</strong><br />
<br />
<span>1)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Ensure that none of the hardware components are overclocked.</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Hardware that is driven beyond its design specifications - by overclocking - can malfunction in unpredictable
 ways.</span><br />
<span>2)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Ensure that the machine is adequately cooled.</strong><br />
<span>&nbsp;If there is any doubt, open up the side of the PC case (be mindful of any relevant warranty conditions!) and point a mains fan squarely at the motherboard. That will rule out most (lack of) cooling issues.</span><br />
<span>3)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update all hardware-related drivers</strong><span>: video, sound, RAID (if any), NIC... anything that interacts with a piece of hardware.</span><br />
<span>It is good practice to run the latest drivers anyway.</span><br />
<span>4)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Update the motherboard BIOS according to the manufacturer's instructions.</strong><br />
<span>Their website should provide detailed instructions as to the brand and model-specific procedure.</span><br />
<span>5)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Rarely, bugs in the OS may cause "false positive" 0x124 events where the hardware wasn't complaining but Windows thought otherwise (because of the bug).</strong><br />
<span>At the time of writing, Windows 7 is not known to suffer from any such defects, but it is nevertheless important to always keep Windows itself updated.</span><br />
<span>6)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Attempt to (stress) test those hardware components</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>which can be put through their paces artificially.</span><br />
<span>The most obvious examples are the RAM and HDD(s).</span><br />
<span>For the RAM, use the in-built memory diagnostics (run MDSCHED) or the 3rd-party memtest86 utility to run many hours worth of testing.</span><br />
<span>For hard drives, check whether CHKDSK /R finds any problems on the drive(s), notably "bad sectors".</span><br />
<span>Unreliable RAM, in particular, is deadly as far as software is concerned, and anything other than a 100% clear memory test result is cause for concern. Unfortunately, even a 100% clear result from the diagnostics utilities does not guarantee
 that the RAM is free from defects - only that none were encountered during the test passes.</span><br />
<span>7)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>As the last of the non-invasive troubleshooting steps</strong><span>, perform a "vanilla" reinstallation of Windows: just the OS itself without any additional applications, games, utilities, updates,
 or new drivers - NOTHING AT ALL that is not sourced from the Windows 7 disc.</span><br />
<span>Should that fail to mitigate the 0x124 problem, jump to the next steps.</span><br />
<span>If you run the "vanilla" installation long enough to convince yourself that not a single 0x124 crash has occurred, start installing updates and applications slowly, always pausing between successive additions long enough to get a feel for whether
 the machine is still free from 0x124 crashes.</span><br />
<span>Should the crashing resume, obviously the very last software addition(s) may be somehow linked to the root cause.</span><br />
<span>If stop 0x124 errors persist despite the steps above, and the hardware is under warranty, consider returning it and requesting a replacement which does not suffer periodic MCE events.</span><br />
<span>Be aware that attempting the subsequent hardware troubleshooting steps may, in some cases, void your warranty:</span><br />
<span>8)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Clean and carefully remove any dust from the inside of the machine.</strong><br />
<span>Reseat all connectors and memory modules.</span><br />
<span>Use a can of compressed air to clean out the RAM DIMM sockets as much as possible.</span><br />
<span>9)<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>If all else fails, start removing items of hardware one-by-one in the hope that the culprit is something non-essential which can be removed.</strong><br />
<span>Obviously, this type of testing is a lot easier if you've got access to equivalent components in order to perform swaps.</span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>Should you find yourself in the situation of having performed all of the steps above without a resolution of the symptom, unfortunately
 the most likely reason is because the error message is literally correct - something is fundamentally wrong with the machine's hardware.<br />
<br />
<br />
I would also run Prime 95<br />

<div><span>Try this free stress test:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mersenne.org/freesoft/</a>
<div><br />
Prime95 Setup;<br />
- extract the contents of the zip file to a location of your choice<br />
- double click on the executable file<br />
- select "Just stress testing"<br />
- select the "Blend" test.&nbsp; If you've already run MemTest overnight you may want to run the "Small FFTs" test instead.<br />
- "Number of torture test threads to run" should equal the number of CPU's times 2 (if you're using hyperthreading).<br />
The easiest way to figure this out is to go to Task Manager...Performance tab - and see the number of boxes under CPU Usage History<br />
Then run the test for 6 to 24 hours - or until you get errors [b](whichever comes first)<br />
The Test selection box and the stress.txt file describes what components that the program stresses.</div>

If you’re comfortable with registry, you may disable the JIT debugging from there.<br />
<br />
<strong>Important</strong>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For
 added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the windows help article below.

<h2>            Why does my Windows 7  laptop send constant UPNP commands to my router&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
My Windows 7 laptop sends constant UPNP commands to my router (about every 5 seconds).&nbsp; How do I find out what's causing this and stop it?&nbsp; The constant UPNP causes most routers to lock up.&nbsp;
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Most unusual that it happens on more than one router.<br />
<br />
Did you update or re-install the latest network driver? Suspect either the netword driver<br />
and/or the actual hardware of that network device. You could try disabling the WiFi or<br />
NIC (wired) device and use an external. Or try the other one not being used - if using<br />
WiFi try hooking to the router by wire and if by wire try using WiFi.<br />
<br />
Have you been trying to do Port Forwarding? Of have you been trying to access other<br />
network devices not on your physical computer, such as a printer, or even just files on<br />
other networked computers?<br />
<br />
Some older LinkSys and other routers allow configuring UPNP of the router from the
<br />
net however I can't believe that is your issue since you said it happens on other routers.<br />
UPNP is usually controls, enabled or disabled, on the router.<br />
<br />
===============================================================<br />
<br />
Since I have never seen the issue when it wasn't the router itself check with those at<br />
TechNet as some one may have come across the issue?<br />

<p>Saudi Arabia is NOT a Live supported region. It has nothing to do with MS. It has to do with international, copyright, license, local and government laws. The latter two play a large part in wether or not Live is available in each region. Complain to your
 government. </p>

    <title>GroupPolicy folder missing from &#92;System32 - Possible Malware - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mag32  say:</h3>
<h2>            GroupPolicy folder missing from &#92;System32 - Possible Malware Issue&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Short version of this problem, I do not have a GroupPolicy subfolder in my Windows\System32 folder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long Story is that I purchased this laptop (Lenovo Yoga 11S) in 2014 from BestBuy initially running a windows 8 and later Upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; They packaged a Webroot antivirus service with it that I got free for one year.&nbsp; However, after that first
 year I tried to cancel it but couldn't do it through Webroot so I just deleted it.&nbsp; (I got charged for an additional year nonetheless and later have found out that I can only cancel the service through BestBuy or have Webroot turn off auto renew over the phone,
 but I don't have access to my own account, extremely frustrating.)&nbsp; Anyway, sometime in the last few month the Webroot Filter Extension in Chrome has shown back up on my browser (Chrome) and I cannot remove it as it was installed by Enterprise Policy.&nbsp; I worked
 with Webroot Support and they sent a package that was supposed to be a webroot toolbar that I could install then disable the extension, which did not work.&nbsp; I then called them and they said it can only be removed by registry edit and that they would have to
 remote in to my computer to do it.&nbsp; I told them to hold off because I felt I was not getting the full story from them.&nbsp; The guy I was talking to was initially saying problem was something else, but when I mentioned that the Webroot Filtering Extension showed
 up recently he changed his tone and said things like how it was not possible to remove and that I couldn't regedit on my own for proprietary reasons, and that because it was installed by BestBuy (which I told him from the outset) it had to be handled differently.
 Sorry for the lack of specifics, but it wasn't a clear phone call and nothing about the problem was really specified to me, but he had long periods of silence where he was checking into my account or something, and the whole encounter kind of put me off a
 bit, so I told him to hold off on remoting in and that I might call them back. So I attempted the regedit removal of the extension myself.&nbsp; I followed the steps on PCrisk:&nbsp;https://www.pcrisk.com/computer-technician-blog/general-information/7734-remove-chrome-extension-installed-by-enterprise-policy.
 First I deleted the registry key corresponding to the webroot filter extension (kjeghcllfecehndceplomkocgfbklffd) in the regedit tool. Then I deleted the same directory in the AppData folder in both the administrator and user folders (C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User
 Data\Default\Extensions).&nbsp; The next step is to delete the Registry.pol file from the Group Policy folder in Windows\System32.&nbsp; This is where my problem arises as there is no GroupPolicy folder in System32.&nbsp; I've enabled looking at any hidden folders and I've
 looked all around System32 and can't find anything relating to a .pol file (and when I restart the system and chrome, the extension returns).&nbsp; Note I also had some issues with malware in the past and I suspect may still have an issue.&nbsp; I also noticed that
 around the time the webroot extension showed up on my chrome browser I started getting some serious slowdown of my system, having not enough memory to browse multiple tabs on the internet when previously I've never had this problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, and I'm not expert,
 but when I look through Windows System32 folder there seems to be a lot more stuff than I recall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in short, can anyone help me locate the missing Group Policy folder and/or the Registry.pol file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And furthermore, has anyone had experience with Webroot acting this way (like maleware) and/or removing the Webroot Filtering Extension from Chrome?</p>
<p>

            Hi Mag.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is this a company PC?  If not how did Best Buy sell an Enterprise edition of WIndows to a consumer which is illegal since it must be activated via Volume License Keys only used by business and organizations managed by IT departments?  
<br />
<br />With the mess the 3rd party AV has gotten you into I would wipe the drive to do the vastly superior Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thanks Greg for the quick reply!&nbsp; However before I do a complete clean install I was wondering if there's a way to find the registry.pol file and/or the grouppolicy folder that have gone missing.&nbsp; Is this normal? would malware remove or rename these folders
 and files? Also this is not an enterprise version of windows.&nbsp; Merely the webroot filter extension in Google Chrome was installed by enterprise policy, I think meaning that the webroot software I used installed the extension on to Google Chrome, rather than
 me installing it directly.&nbsp; I'm running Windows 10 that as upgraded on my system from the original Windows 8.

<h2>            Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver stops Autoplay working</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a problem with Autoplay not working on a DVD drive which I have traced to the installation of the Intel Rapid Storage driver.<br />
<br />
This is on a new build computer (Asus Hero VIII) and the driver was installed from the motherboard support DVD.<br />
<br />
When the installation of the drivers was started autoplay worked OK when the support DVD was inserted.<br />
<br />
After that autoplay would not work.<br />
<br />
After a lot of testing I discovered that it was the Intel rapid Storage drivers that were installed from the DVD that caused the problem.<br />
<br />
When they were removed autoplay works OK.<br />
When they are re-installed autoplay stops working again.<br />
<br />
Question:<br />
<br />
What is Intel Rapid Storage drivers used for ?<br />
<br />
I have the following drives on my system:-<br />
<br />
1. Samsung SM951 M2 AHCI 256GByte drive for Windows 7 Pro 64bit OS<br />
2. SanDisk 256 GByte SSD<br />
3. 2 off 2, TByte Seagate HD's<br />
4. 2 off, Asus DRW-24F1MT DVD Re-writers.<br />
<br />
I do not use RAID.<br />
<br />
Do I need Intel Rapid Storage installed ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
Nick.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the methods described but had no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify the situation, I have just built a new system based on an Asus Hero VIII motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AutoPlay worked OK when Windows 7 was installed, but after installing the drivers supplied on the Asus support DVD AutoPlay stopped working ON THE DVD DRIVES ONLY.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AutoPlay would still work when a USB flash drive or an external USB hard drive was attached.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a disk was inserted into the DVD re-writer the LED would flash a few times, but then no further action took place - the AutoPlay window which asks what option you want to choose, such as open folder to view files did not appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I then opened "Computer" from the start menu the AutoPlay window would appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way to get the AutoPlay window to appear was to insert a USB flash drive - when that was done two instances of the AutoPlay window would appear, one for the USB flash drive and one for the DVD drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I carried out a system restore to the point before the drivers were installed from the Asus support DVD&nbsp;AutoPlay would work again with the DVD drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By installing the drivers one at a time I was able to find out that it was the Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver that was causing the problem. I then removed it by using a restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted Asus support and they have confirmed that I do not need this driver as it is mostly concerned with RAID setups which I do not have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps there is just an issue with this drivers and the Asus DRW-24F1MT DVD Re-writers which I have.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, as a result I am not going to re-install it - AutoPlay now works fine with DVD's and CD's - nice to have my music CD's playing when I insert them with media player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess the moral of this story is - don't install everything on a support DVD just because they are checked by default - try and find out what they do and&nbsp;if you really need them all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nick.</p>

<p>Hi NickGrundy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is a bit old but, I think I have the solution to your problem, I ran into the same scenario yesterday and found a solution. You see you get an icon in your system tray for Intel rapid storage when it is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ad608e8-b481-45f4-8dfb-788f0729bed1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ad608e8-b481-45f4-8dfb-788f0729bed1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Double click the icon and it will take you to the Intel rapid storage application. Depending on your version of Intel rapid Storage, the interface may be a bit different. Look for a tab labeled "performance".</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/99396e7c-7cf0-4b1c-8ba1-4751d11c36ce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/99396e7c-7cf0-4b1c-8ba1-4751d11c36ce" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This tab lists a feature called link power management which is "enabled" by default. What this does is that it tries to cut out power and put all SATA devices to sleep when they are not in use. When you pop in a disc in you DVD drive, it is most probably
 in sleep mode and takes some time to get active. In the worst case you have to refresh windows explorer in order to make the drive spin and start reading the contents. This also messes with the Autoplay functionality and you don't get the autoplay pop up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simple solution is to to just click on that "Disable" option in the performance tab and then restart your computer. Restart is absolutely important for the changes to work. You will see that the drive will start working normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that most modern laptops and motherboards come with this Intel rapid storage feature. The users just install all the drivers without thinking much. IRST (Intel rapid storage) also gets installed and starts messing with autoplay because for
 some strange reason intel decided to enable link power management by default in IRST. This only affects SATA DVD drives and not the older drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are still many people around the globe who use DVD drives and run into this autoplay problem. Wish I could share this with all of them.</p>
<p>

 by default which is very strange.

<p>Hi Andre</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Skype 8 and this was very challenging to identify Skype Credit remaining, as well as the loss of features I use constantly in Skype 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype number, is non-refundable, whereas I can obtain refunds of Skype Call credits if/when I move to alternative product.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think my best option is to cancel my number as the 12 month renewal is due at the end of the month. If Skype 8 ever reaches the same functionality as 7, I can always move back again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>
