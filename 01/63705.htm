    <title>Color depth limited on external display connected to Surface Book 2 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Color depth limited on external display connected to Surface Book 2 via dock</h2>
                    <p>My setup:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surface Book 2 -&gt; Surface Dock -&gt; Mini-displayport to full-displayport cable -&gt; Displayport input on&nbsp;Dell Ultra HD 4k Monitor P2715Q</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some time in the last few weeks/months I noticed that the color depth on my external monitor had lessened.&nbsp; Shadows on websites, for example, were full of harsh banding instead of smooth gradation.&nbsp; This is only an issue on the external display, not the
 built-in one.&nbsp; When investigating the display properties on the screen, it lists my monitor as "6-bit," and the Surface Book's built-in display as "8-bit."&nbsp; This was definitely not the case until recently, my guess is that it's an artifact of the last firmware/Intel
 driver update.&nbsp; (My Intel graphics driver is ver&nbsp;24.20.100.6136, which appears to match the Surface Book August update.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running the external display at 4k, 60hz, 200% scaling.&nbsp; In an attempt to see if the Surface Dock was to blame, I ran an HDMI cable from the monitor into an HDMI-&gt;USBC adapter (the official MS one) and into the USBC port on the Surface Book.&nbsp; Lo and
 behold, the shadows looked correct, and the monitor was reporting correctly as 8-bit.&nbsp; However, the refresh rate seemed to be capped at 30hz.&nbsp; My guess is that this is because I was using an adapter, I recall reading that the only way to successfully get 4k
 60hz out of this thing is via a direct displayport cable, which is what I've been using on the dock.&nbsp; There's no displayport on the Surface Book 2, though, so using this adapter is my only option for testing alternatives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows version is up-to-date, this issue existed both before and after the October update.&nbsp; It seems like the Firmware update was probably the dividing line.&nbsp; My guess is that the color depth went back to 8-bit when skipping the dock not due to anything
 dock-related, but because my adapter situation limited me to 30hz.&nbsp; I'm imagining some sort of bandwidth limitation where in order to hit 4k 60hz it's capping the color depth, but limiting to 30hz allows for full color depth.&nbsp; I actually just tested that hypothesis,
 and set my monitor to only output at 30hz while connected through the dock, but that didn't restore the color depth so that might be a dead end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an additional data point, I've got a friend with a Surface Book 1 that I attached to my dock and configured to match mine, and the same issue exists there as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else experiencing limited color depth on external displays through the dock after the August firmware/driver update?</p>

<p>
</p><p>This seems to be describing my issue pretty accurately.&nbsp; I first tried manually updating my intel driver to the latest one, which didn't fix the issue.&nbsp; Instead I downgraded my driver to this version:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/27058/Intel-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-15-46-?product=126789</p>
<p>
</p><p>And my color depth issues are now resolved.&nbsp; Now obviously this is not a great fix, I'm a year behind on driver updates, and god knows what other issues I've introduced.&nbsp; So please, Microsoft, work with Intel to get this issue resolved in their latest drivers.</p>

            Hi Tathanen,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for reaching out. Apologies for the delayed response. To understand the issue better, let us know more details by answering the following questions:<br />
<br />
• Were there any changes made prior to this issue aside from installing Windows Updates?<br />
• Can you clarify if you're connecting two monitors or single monitor on your Surface Dock?
<br />
• Have you tried re-adjusting the monitor settings from default back to your customized settings?<br />
• Do the external monitors have firmware updates as well?<br />
<br />
To help solve this issue, we suggest that you update the Surface Dock by downloading the
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Dock Updater</a></strong>. You can check this

<p>I didn't know there was a way to manually update dock firmware, thanks for that link.&nbsp; That said, unfortunately updating the firmware did not help with the issue.&nbsp; I reinstalled the newest intel drivers and the problem came back, and I installed those year-old
 ones and the problem again resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>No changes, just the normal firmware updates that came from windows update</li><li>I'm connecting a single 4k monitor to the dock via a displayport to mini-displayport cable, no monitor beyond that</li><li>I'm not sure what you mean for this one, but I've toggled through a variety of setting in both Windows and on the monitor itself, and none of them have helped</li><li>I checked the monitor firmware earlier today, it's from 2015 but it's indeed the latest version</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I've read plenty about what types of resolution/refresh-rate are supported with what kind of configurations, it's the reason I'm running a pure displayport cable instead of an HDMI one in the first place.&nbsp; I've got 60hz 4k running just fine off the dock,
 since I'm only using a single external display.&nbsp; Everything was fine until the intel driver updates that came with the last batch of Surface firmware updates, and everything is fine again now that I've reverted to intel drivers older than those.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully the next Surface firmware update to be released includes intel drivers that resolve this issue, but I don't have a ton of hope there, since the intel drivers included in surface firmware bundles are usually pretty old, and even the newest-as-of-today
 intel driver that I tried installing (this one, if it helps:&nbsp;https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/28240/Intel-Graphics-Driver-for-Windows-10?product=128199) doesn't seem to include a fix for this 6-bit/8-bit mismatch as described in my original post and
 the dell link in my previous post.&nbsp; If Microsoft's engineers could coordinate with Intel's to make sure a fix gets in for this that'd sure be great!</p>

            Thanks for getting back to us. Were you able to update the Surface Dock as well? In this case, it would be best that you keep your Surface updated and might as well the Surface Dock in order for you to maximize the use of your external display.

<h2>            Mcafee&#47;Guru aid help please</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to know what to do after someone has been given access to our computer. I'm not great with tech stuff so I don't know the procedure. Little info about it-had a problem with anti virus software (Mcafee not installed when we thought it was) mum who
 is very gullible rang them up and somehow got put through to this guru aid thing who told her (or it might've been Mcafee who told her not sure) we had 100s of viruses and they'd need 90 quid to rid our comp of them which she paid. I wasn't there at the time
 and had a fit when I found out-I know these things are a scam, and have told her not to do anything like this but because she rang Mcafee she thought it was genuine. I'm not happy with Mcafee either since when we first had the computer we had a problem and
 rang them up and they said we had a virus then as well and needed 90 quid-at this point we hadn't even been on any site-the internet wasn't even connected so it was impossible to have a virus! Guru aid seems to have good reviews now but I'm reading from others
 it's a scam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far computer seems to be working fine so fingers crossed we just got scammed out of 90 quid and they haven't done anything else to scam us or breach security! Can anyone help on what to do though just to make sure they can't do anything now-I'm changing
 passwords for everything but don't know what else to do. Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi, welcome. Alternatively and as you will have to deal with Group Police Objects Editor, see
<a href="http://4sysops.com/archives/active-directory-and-bitlocker-part-7-tips-and-troubleshooting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>here</span></a> and scroll down
 to “<em><span>Startup option that isn’t supported by BitLocker setup”</span></em>. Regards PS- Before going to deal with BitLocker and Gpedit,
 take as much information as you can to avoid being trapped out by them in the future; TechNet is the right place to start. Rgds.

<h2>            How to add a known file extension to the list in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In my Control Panel default programs, it doesn't give .srt as a possible file extension.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why not? and more importantly how do I add it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently it is an extension known to VLC Media Player for subtitles, so why does Windows 7 not have it on the file extensions list.
</p>
<p>Updating didn't help.</p>

<p>Hello PR ESCRETA,<br />
<br />
<br />
Give the following steps a shot:<br />
•Disconnect your Xbox One console from your network.<br />
•Hold down the power button (on the console) for 5-10 seconds until the console powers off.<br />
•Power the console on again.<br />
•Retry the game install again without connecting to your network. •<br />
Once the game has completed installing, you can reconnect to your network and download any needed updates.<br />
<br />

<p>What do you mean by "when I went on a different game"? Did you change games or another TDM match?</p>
<p>If it was a different game completely then the download would resume when changing discs then stop if the new game had online capabilities.
</p>
<p>Check your "Active Downloads" on your Guide next time you are playing multiplayer and you'll see any DLC at that time will be pending.</p>

<p>When I was still using my 360 I could download DLC and play multiplayer online at the same time. The downloads stopped while the game first loaded, but would resume once I was actually in game. Would need to boot up my 360 to check for sure, but fairly certain
 that there is an option in the settings to allow downloads in the background</p>

<p>i can download too if im on the same game, when i changed games and played mp it stopped downloading then i went back onto the game i was downloading the dlc for and went onto mp and it carried on downloading, cant believe you cannot mess with the one while
 you are installing a game, its next gen and i can do anything on last gen, isnt that something to do with the processor not being able to handle so many opened apps, like a low end pc or something</p>

<p><br />
This is how I fixed my problem (I have Windows 7 64 bit version)</p>
<p>Go to:</p>
<p>Start</p>
<p>Computer</p>
<p>(C) drive</p>
<p>Windows</p>
<p>find the file SysWOW64 and click on it</p>
<p>scroll down to cmd&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then right click on it and "Run as Administrator"</p>
<p>type the following:&nbsp; regsvr32 comctl32.ocx and then press enter on your keyboard</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>that is all I needed and it fixed the problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>What is the name of the 'particular executable'? You need to check with the developer of that program to make sure it works on the 64bit version of Windows 7. Most 32bit programs will work on the 64bit version of Windows, but some do not.<br />
<br />
If this is a 32bit program, Windows 7 will automatically detect this, place the files in the proper folders, and registry the files. However, if you are performing this manually, you need to understand the differences between the 32bit and 64bit versions.</p>
<p><span><span><span>The folder/file structure is a bit different in the 64bit version. Windows 64bit includes an emulator that allows 32bit programs
 to run just as if they were installed on a 32bit version of Windows.<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>In this version you will see a C:\Program Files folder where all 64bit programs are installed.&nbsp;There is also&nbsp;a C:\Program Files
 (x86) folder where all of the 32bit programs are installed.<br />
<br />
There is also a C:\Windows\System32 folder that contains all of the 64bit system files. (This name was retained in the 64bit version because so many 64bit programs were hard coded to&nbsp;look for this folder name)&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You will also see a C:\Windows\SysWOW64 folder which contains all of the 32bit system files that the installed
 32bit programs use. (Just for reference, the WOW in that folder name means 'Windows On Windows)</span></span></p>
<p>These Active X Controls are usually installed by third party programs that use them. If you downloaded this file from another location, are you sure that it's the correct version number for that program?<br />
<br />
The correct location in the 64bit version of Windows 7&nbsp;to place&nbsp;the comctrl32.ocx file&nbsp;is the C:\Windows\SysWOW64 folder.</p>
<p>This also applies to the command prompt when you run the regsvr32 to register this file. You must use the 32bit version of cmd.exe that is also located in the C:\Windows\SysWOW64 folder. You must also run the cmd.exe elevated (right click cmd.exe and select
 the Run As Administrator option).</p>
<p>Please see the following links for more information.</p>

 skype numbers (its not as the call rings out without the option to leave message), 2. Another site said 'Go into Settings' and 3. Another says 'Go to Tools' . None of these are menus that even come up on the screen on the Skype App I downloaded. At the bottom
 of the app is only: Chats:Calls:Camera:Highlights:Contacts.&nbsp; Even from a desktop trying to activate it, it just doesnt work. This is my second time of posting. What do I do please ? Help !&nbsp;</span>

<h2>            Quantum conundrum keeps freezing.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm having a very annoying issue with the game quantum conundrum who keeps freezing every single time the game save, that means i can't complete a single level. It might be a save issue but i can't do anything about that because the save is in the gamer profil
 itself.<br />
<br />
I already did :<br />
<br />
- Cleared the cache a dozen of time.<br />
- Moved the game and profil on another device.<br />
- Recovered my profile twice.<br />
- Redownloaded the game.<br />
- Downloaded the game and recovered my profile on another X360.<br />
- Played offline&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
After all of that the game is still freezing after every save.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions ? Thanks.</p>

<p>Thanks for the answer, i used an official &nbsp;microsoft 250gb hard drive, then i moved my profile and my game on a 4gb hard drive ( it's a 4gb xbox 360 at first ), then i downloaded the game and my profile on a another xbox with an official 60gb hard drive,
 and still the same result.</p>
<p>My theory is my save is corrupted in my profile but i'm not sure i can do anything against that...</p>
<p>I'll try to remove my 250gb hard drive and see what happen though.</p>

            <p>Ok thanks for that. &nbsp;If you are still experiencing the issue the the save may indeed be corrupt. &nbsp;Put the save on another device so you don't lose it just in case and try starting a new game to see what happens.</p>

<p>I can't do that unfortunately &nbsp;because this game has no save that you could manage, the save is in my profile itself. I could install the game on a &nbsp;brand new X360 and my game would still be there if i play with this profile.

<h2>            Access denied to certain files even after taking ownership of the drive.</h2>
                    I recently bought a new mSATA and clean installed Windows 8.1 Professional onto it to use as my new boot drive. I still have my old hdd installed which is running Windows 7 and plan to use it as storage for media. The problem is that even though I have
 already taken ownership of the old hdd by giving myself Full Control, I am still unable to open some files on the hdd. The files are mostly random zips, and pictures within a Dropbox folder located on the hdd. For the files that I am denied access to, the
 security settings do not list my current Windows 8.1 admin account as having ownership of the file. Instead, it show that an unknown (SID) has ownership of the file. Does anyone know what is causing this problem and how I can get access to all of the files
 on my hdd?<br />

            Thanks for the reply. I already know how to access them one by one using the method you provided above but I was wondering why taking ownership of an entire folder does not change the permissions of all the files within the folder? I made sure that the
 permission applies to "This folder, subfolders, and files" but I still do not have access to certain files within the folder unless I change the permissions of the files one by one.

                    I just purchased this Targus USB Bluetooth® Adapter : ACB10US from Office Depot and made sure to check the back of the package to make sure it was functional with Windows 7. It states that it is compatable. I know the adapter works. I've plugged it in
 a free USB2 port and Windows 7 found it and installed the drivers for it. I have a logictec bluetooth mouse that works fine with it. But when I try and pair my Rocketfish Bluetooth RF-MAB2 headset to the laptop. I get errors. When I put the Rocketfish Bluetooth
 RF-MAB2 headset in pairing mode, and have the bluetooth console running searching for bluetooth devises, it finds the headset, and then starts trying to install devise drivers for the headset. It won't find any drivers for the headset and gives me an error.
 I've done a good bit of research looking for the correct driver. I went to the Targus website and looked for drivers for Windows 7 but couldn't find any. I found drivers there for Windows XP, 2000, and even Vista, but not specif

<h2>            Receiving calls from unwanted people.</h2>
                    In my settings I have it set for me to only receive calls from people on my contact list! Why am I still receiving calls from people I don't know. I even have my heading set to call me: 'If you are not a relative or friend, then do not bother me'! So,
 why am I still receiving calls usually from young women I don't know. I am 71 years old and can't imagine a 20 year old woman wanting to talk to me unless it's a scam or looking for a 'sugar daddy'.

 hit that close box, I just get taken&nbsp;back to the same blank screen.&nbsp; I can work with the rest of my computer - Internet Explorer, Windows, etc. I tried to use my Control Panel to uninstall Mozilla, to see if that would straighten it out...but I can't because
 it says I have to close Mozilla first, and&nbsp;Mozilla won't let me close it. Help!&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried shutting down the computer, but that doesn't change it.

            <p>Hi Nancy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have caused due to any settings or compatibility issues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As a first step, I suggest you to shutdown the computer as you did earlier. After an hour, try restarting the computer and then try to uninstall Mozilla Firefox and then try reinstalling it and check if the issues persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If still you are not able to uninstall it, then try contacting Firefox support for further assistance with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to uninstall Mozilla Firefox, then try installing the program in compatibility mode and check if it works for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following Windows 8 article to install program in compatibility mode, the steps for Windows 8.1 applies to Windows 10 as well.

    <title>Windows 10 update resulting in black screen after startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tue gunst  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update resulting in black screen after startup</h2>
                    Hi...<br />
I experience a black screen at login after a recent windows 10 upgrade, and several fix-guides were not able solve my issue.<br />
I already had a working windows 10 installation (updated from windows 8 a few months ago).<br />
After turning on the pc, windows loads with its logo and afterwards goes to a black screen.<br />
The mouse shows up if I move it and I can open the task manager (from ctrl+alt+del).<br />
My pc has an internal Intel graphics controller as well as a main graphics card. All external hardware except for the keyboard and mouse is disconnected.<br />
What I have tried so far without any succees:<br />
1) Open windows in safety mode (from shift+restart) -&gt; still black screen.<br />
2) Open a new task in the taskmanager &gt; explorer.exe -&gt; nothing happened.<br />
3) Changing active screen through windows-key+p followed by down-arrow twice and enter (should duplicate screens)-&gt; still black screen.<br />
4) Trouble shoot&gt;advanced options&gt;revert to previous build -&gt; error stating that it could not return to previous build.<br />
I am running out of ideas so any help will be highly appreciated. I would prefer a solution that enables me to take backup of data to an external harddrive.<br />
Thanks,<br />

            <p>Hi Tue,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing you want to try is to press <strong>Ctrl+Alt+Del </strong>and see if it brings up the Task Manager. If it does, great. Click on File &gt; Run new task. Type
<strong>explorer.exe</strong> and hit Enter. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If this does not work for you, <strong>unplug &amp; remove all external devices</strong> and reboot. If you are able to get a display, it might mean that one of the external hardware is causing the problem. If that is the case, start plugging in external devices
 one by one until you lose display. Remove the last device you plugged in and see if you get the display back.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, don’t use that hardware device until you contact the device’s manufacturer. Check again with other external devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this post helps. Get back to us for further queries on the issue above. We are happy to help!</p>

Hi.<br />
Thanks for your suggestions.<br />
I cannot get to the point where a Start button is visible (due to the black screen).<br />
I can however open the Command Prompt from the menu obtained from ctrl+alt+del followed by holding the shift key down and pressing restart.<br />
I hope that this is equivalent to the suggested procedure.<br />
In the command prompt I can see the version (10.0.10586).<br />
1)"sfc /scannow" performs a verification scan and hereafter returns:<br />
"...<br />
Verification 100% complete<br />
Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation.<br />
"<br />
2) DISM gives the following error from the command "DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth":<br />
"<br />
Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool<br />
Version: 10.0.10586.0<br />
Error: 50<br />
DISM does not support servicing Windows PE with the /Online option.<br />
The DISM log file can be found at X:\windows\Logs\DISM\dism.log<br />
"<br />
<br />
This seems to indicate that windows is trapped in "Pre-installation Environment", so I guess we are getting closer to the error?<br />
Some Registry keys may be wrong but I don't know how to fix this from the command prompt?<br />
Best regards,<br />
Tue<br />

<h2>            Skype for Business Close Immediately</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have problem opening Skype for Business Clients. After finishing installation and open the apps, it suddenly close immediately without any error notification. This looks when I am running the apps, SfB blue splash screen just show in a glimpse and then
 gone or close itself. Any idea?.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi BratacoGroup,</p>
<p>To look into the issue, I’d like to collect the following information:<br />
1.&nbsp;Where did you download the Skype for Business client? Was it downloaded from Office 365 portal?
<br />
2.&nbsp;Hold the windows key +&nbsp;‘R’ from the keyboard to launch the Run command, paste “lync.exe /safe” in the open box to start Lync in safe mode and see if the issue persists.<br />
3.&nbsp;The version of the operating system and the Skype for Business client. Go to Control Pane -&gt; Programs &amp; Features and find the version of Office suite.<br />
4.&nbsp;Try Online Repair and see if there is any update?</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Control Pane -&gt; Programs &amp; Features </li><li>Find your Office version and right click it. </li><li>Click Change, then choose Online Repair. </li><li>After the repair is finished, reboot you PC and re-activate Office if needed.
</li></ul>
<p>Thanks,<br />
Chris</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>At first, I am using the basic client but I have removed it and now going to use the Office 365 version. I will keep you update asap. I am using windows 7 but it's still support isn't it?
</p>
<p>Anyway, could it be any problem if using the 32bit SfB version onto the 64bit OS? Just curious.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi BratacoGroup,<br />
<br />
Firstly, as said in the article below, the extended support for Window 7 is up to January 14<sup>th</sup>, 2020.<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle?C2=14019" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle?C2=14019</a><br />
<br />
Then, commonly, 32-bit Skype for Business client can work well on 64-bit OS. As you will try the suggestions above, please share us with the updates after finishing all the steps above.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>We have install the SfB Office 365 version 32bit but same result so far, rightnow I am trying to use the 64bit one to match the OS. If it's still failed, what should I check next? I still haven't tried the workaround you suggest but I will try if it is still
 failed</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>I am sorry for my late response, the Skype for Business version I am using is 16.0.4351.1001 (It is using basic client and not downloaded from Office 365 portal rather from microsoft download client). I have uploaded the OffCAT you requested.</p>
<p>Anyway, just now I try using Lync 2013 basic client and it works. It is weird though. Maybe Skype for Business client is better supporting Windows 8 &amp; 10 instead Windows 7.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I found that you’re not using the latest version of Skype for Business client. Please make sure all the latest updates are applied to the client and&nbsp;the&nbsp;PC&nbsp;and see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>In addition, I'll send the report to the relevant team. Once I get any update, I’ll let you know.</p>

<h2>            Computer not showing correct amount of RAM</h2>
                    <p>Well, I have this very old computer known as EMACHINES E4264. It have the NVIDIA GTX 210 graphics card. The problem is, that I have just upgraded it from 2GB of RAM to 4GB of RAM, but the only problem is that it only shows 2.75GB with the 4GB in. The OS
 is Windows10 32Bit but the processor is 64Bit but when I upgraded to Windows10, it recognised it as 32Bit, I'm guessing because it only had 2GB of RAM at the current time and you need atleast 4GB of RAM for it to recognise the 64Bit processor. Do I need to
 re-install the OS? And in that case how do I do that? But it might also be the graphics card that's taking away the RAM or it even might be an outdated BIOS firmware version. The Processor is Intel Core 2 Duo if this helps solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, All help counts as I need to know in case I need to take the RAM I bought back.</p>

            <p>Where are you looking at how much memory you have?</p>
<p>Perhaps the Task Manager?</p>
<p>The Task Manager shows you the usable memory, not the memory installed.</p>
<p>If you right click on the Start button and select System, it will show both the installed and usable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now with that out of the way, I will go into why your are not going to 100% of the memory as "usable".</p>
<p>And as you suspect it mostly has to do with your graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The address space of a 32-bit operating system is 4 GB .&nbsp; So even if you put in more memory it will not see it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you would think that if you put 4 GB in a machine you would see 4 GB usable, but that is not the case.</p>
<p>The main reason is because of either the RAM is being "shared" or because the address space is being used for memory mapped I/O.&nbsp; If you are using a graphics chip built into your system it is going to be getting its memory from the system RAM.&nbsp; The more
 dedicated to the video the less for your system.&nbsp; But even with a dedicated video card you can lose "address space".&nbsp; To improve transfer speeds from the video card to CPU some video cards use memory mapped I/O.&nbsp; This basically means that the CPU can access
 it as if it was regular RAM.&nbsp; This again takes up some of the address space that would be used for your system RAM.</p>
<p>There are also a few other devices in the system that use memory mapped I/O, but they tend to take a very small amount of memory space so you hardly notice them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in summary.&nbsp; There is most likely nothing wrong with your system, and you might get more usable system memory by reducing how much memory your video card is using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going to a 64-bit operating system you may gain more usable memory and you may not depending on your video card and motherboard and such.</p>
<p>More information about it here: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/hiltonl/archive/2007/04/13/the-3gb-not-4gb-ram-problem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://blogs.msdn.com/b/hiltonl/archive/2007/04/13/the-3gb-not-4gb-ram-problem.aspx</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to switch to 64-bit beware of the fact that it has to be a clean install, so you will have to backup your data files, do the clean install, install your needed programs, and then restore your data files.</p>

    <title>change Windows 10 scrollbar color&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ks-htk  say:</h3>
<h2>            change Windows 10 scrollbar color&#63;</h2>
                    Is there a way to change the color of the scrollbar in windows 10? I remember being able to change the color of any part of the default windows in in Windows 7 and before.<br />
But I cant seem to find that option in Windows 10. The problem is that it is nearly impossible to see the scrollbar on very long pages. And as my Trackball does not feature a mousewheel I have to use the scrollbar quite a lot.<br />
<br />
Or is there maybe a feature to color the scrollbar in the Windows 10 theme color, as there seems to be a feature to do that for the window titlebars.

<br />
<br />Naviagte to:
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\Colors
<br />

<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>But it seems to not be working.<br />
I can change the values but it does not effect anything. After a restart the values remain as I set them but it does not change the color of the scrollbar.</p>

<h2>            Having My SSD run only my OS but games and applications like Office 2010 still accessible on my HDD&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have just installed a new 60gb SSD drive into my rig.&nbsp; I did a fresh Windows 7 install on it with the disk and then afterwards attached my old 1TB HDD drive onto the motherboard, went into the BIOS and set the SSD as the Primary drive.&nbsp; Windows loads up
 nice and quickly but I am havign problems accessing the information on my HDD and cannot play the vast majority of my games.&nbsp; I don't know what the problem is?&nbsp; I'm certainly no techno whizz but I can find my way about a computer but this is really starting
 to get me down.&nbsp; My plan was to have my OS run really smoothly and improve the overall speed of my computer whilst still having the vast storage capability of my HDD for games.&nbsp; I've read all sorts on forums, mentioning RAIDS (which I assume is where you run
 storage drives in conjunction with one another) and doing all sorts of other things.&nbsp; I get the feeling, its not too difficult to do what I want but I could reaslly do with a hand getting there please.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have an overclocked Intel i5-2500k to 4.5ghz</p>
<p>8 GB corsair RAM</p>
<p>Gigabyte GTX 560TI graphic card</p>
<p>Asus GA-P67A-UD4-B3 Motherboard</p>
<p>Vortex 2 60Gb SSD</p>
<p>Samsung F3 1 TB HDD</p>
<p>And a serious headache..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chris</p>

            <p>Hi Chris</p>
<p>Your idea is a good one, but you are implementing it the wrong way.</p>
<p>By installing a SSD drive that is too small to hold all of the applications, you force yourself to try and install all of the applications on the old, slow platter type, hard drive.</p>
<p>Here is an analogy.</p>
<p>You are preparing to run a marathon. You spend months working out and getting prepared (installing the SSD drive).</p>
<p>When it comes time to run the marathon, you buy a pair of steel running shoes that each weigh 25 pounds (installing the applications on the slow hard drive).</p>
<p>The result is that you finish the race in last place, because you have nullified all of&nbsp;your preparation.</p>
<p><br />
You need to obtain an SSD drive large enough to install the OS and all of the applications.</p>
<p>Use the old hard drive to store all of your personal data and backups that you rarely access.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>
        </p>
