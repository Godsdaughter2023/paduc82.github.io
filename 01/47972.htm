<p>
</p><p>At Skype, we’re committed to creating the best possible app experience for our users. Because we want to provide our users with the best possible Skype experience, necessary changes must be made along the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our commitment to deliver the best possible experiences requires on the platforms of the future. Sometimes this means that we must end support for some devices and operating systems.&nbsp;These decisions are hard to make, but they are necessary as Skype moves
 forward so we can deliver new experiences on devices that have the capability to support them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to be able to continue using Skype, your Dad needs to upgrade his device or update to the latest version of Skype for his platform. If he is unable to update to the latest version, he may be able to use

WELCOME TO THE CLUB.. IF ANYONE HAS A CLUE ABOUT GETTING SOME KIND OF INFO ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON, PLEASE SHARE IT.. A BIG MYSTERY ABOUT WHY SUCH A VIABLE(?) CO. SHOULD BE SO CLOSED-MOUTH ABOUT THEIR SITUATION.. SUBSCRIBERS ARE SHUT DOWN, POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS
 ARE SHUT DOWN.. WHY? WHY CAN'T MP3 OPEN UP? WHAT DO THEY FEAR? WHY CAN'T SOME JOURNALIST DIG INTO THIS STORY AND COME UP WITH SOMETHING? WHY HASN'T THIS STORY ATTRACTED ATTENTION BEFORE NOW? ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO CARE JUST THOSE WHO WANT TO ACCESS THE WEBSITE?
 A CO. SHUTS DOWN WITHOUT NOTICE, WITHOUT WARNING, NOTHING.. WHERE'S THE FREE PRESS? WHERE IS SOMEBODY, ANYBODY?

            I know... I remain astonished that NOT ONE SITE is discussing MP3 Rocket, &amp; MP3 Rocket Pro's sudden disappearance !!!&nbsp; You would think that--- NOT ONLY would MEMBERS (at least) receive notification &amp; an explanation--- (they had ALL our emails, etc)---
 but ALSO, that MP3 Rocket would have @ LEAST left a message on their site, or SOMETHING !!! ALSO, I cannot find any other discussions regarding same... I think many may not yet realize the site is down !!! My MP3 Rocket Pro only stopped working on the download
 a few days ago... Other areas of my app still work... I think many members probably do not go in as often as I did, &amp; may only go in when they hear a song they want to add to their computer... I KNOW there were HUNDREDS/Thousands using MP3 Rocket... Lets hope
 we can discover what happened --- AND PUT TOGETHER an alternative.... &gt;&gt;&gt; YES, VERY WEIRD about NO NOTICE &amp; NOTHING online... SHOCKING...

<p>Hi Super Shadowass. Mine went down the last week of June. In the 13 years I had owned a LIFETIME MEMBERSHIP, it had NEVER not worked !!! Initially, I thought it must be erring for the first time... Never occurred to me that MP3 Rocket &amp; Rocket Pro had DISAPPEARED
 (until I tried to go on the member site &amp; find out what was wrong... :O&nbsp; Well, they disappeared... Hoping we can find out what happened eventually from those who really know, &amp; put together an alternative... Personally, I will need lots of help with that...

<h2>            I cannot install service pack 1 for windows 7 x64</h2>
                    I wanted to update and recently tried to. But the update keeps failing. It doesn't finish even if at 99% it fails each time. The message I get on the bottom of the update box Error(s) found: Code 800B0100 Windows Update encountered an unknown error. This
 is annoying. I'm going to go through some test to see what is going on. Any one have any ideas?

<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you aware of making any changes to the computer prior to the issue?

</p>
<p><b>Method 1:
</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Method 3:
</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Place the computer in clean boot and disable antivirus before installing Service pack 1.
</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1: Clean boot</b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Place the computer in clean boot and check for the issue.</span></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span>Note:</b> Once you are done with clean boot, please follow step 3 in the article to put your computer back to normal

<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 2:
</b><span>Disable antivirus software if installed any and check.</span></p>

</span></b><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

<p>For 64-Bit Windows 7 download: windows6.1-KB976932-X64.exe 903.2MB</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Download, *<b>save</b>*, and install the Service Pack with

<u>disable</u> the fire-wall &amp; <b>close all non-essential</b> process in the <span>

<p>I also recommend taking off USB keys (e.g., flash drives) or any external media as this takes place.

<p>When it is downloaded <b>right-</b>click on the file and select Run As Administrator from the menu.

<p><br />
</p>
<p>• Your computer will restart several times during the installation process:
</p>
<p>Make certain you've saved your work and closed all open applications before beginning the install.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>• The installation process can take an hour or more: If you're installing SP1 on a portable computer, make sure that you plug-in the power cord and have the battery inserted into its bay.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>After the final settings have been made following the reboot, I usually perform an
<b>additional reboot</b> to test out the change and to give the PC a fresh start after applying the service pack.

            Thank you both for the help I have resolved this problem before arriving back at this thread.
<br />
<br />
I tried the readiness tool and then tried it again. Didn't work. When I got to that page I downloaded the ISO made a DVD and then installed it. One extremely annoying thing about the website link for the service pack is the labels. I mean who came up with that?
 While I know my computer is x64 there are quite a few 64 in those file names. It would have been nice if Microsoft told us EXACTLY which files to download. There is a whole list of downloads that just have file names which make no sense to a beginner like
 me. I was going to download the files on the bottom but I wasn't even sure if that was right. Maybe along with the file names they should have specified specifically what each file is actually for. Highly confusing.

<h2>            Brother dcp-j132w, is recognized and added automatically but does not print properly. Is it compatible with Surface RT&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title: </strong>Brother dcp-j132w not compatible? Compatibility Center says it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought a new printer, a&nbsp;Brother dcp-j132w, for my Surface RT. It's recognized and added automatically when I plug it in the USB but unfortunately it does not print properly. Every time I send a print job the printer indicates that it's receiving data
 but never finishes printing. Using the same method to print on my windows 7 machine works fine, so it seems the printer itself is ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought this printer after checking for compatibility in the Compatibility Center. The green check in the following
<a href="http://https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=Windows%208.1&amp;Locale=en-us&amp;Architecture=X64&amp;TextSearch=brother%2Bdcp-j132w%2Ball-in-one%2Bprinter&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>indicates that it is compatible. Although it says the functionality is limited it should still print, as indicated in this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that Micorsoft's Compatibility Center is unreliable? Is there anything I can do to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>

            <p>Hi Babu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time to reply. I already tried running the troubleshooter but that didn't help. There are no pending updates on my Windows RT as it's set to automatically update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The applications I tried printing out from include Notepad, Word, Internet Explorer. None of these tests worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was there a Microsoft employee who actually tested the printer before it was indicated to be compatible? If so, can you get in touch with him or her? Perhaps you can try it out yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

</p><p>Negative. I didn't know you could vote. I am truly curious about the process that brings Microsoft's official site to announce something as compatible. The fact that there's only been one community vote and that that vote indicated it wasn't compatible makes
 that question even more relevant.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There are.&nbsp; More than just Canon.&nbsp; A problem you will have searching is that most of the sites which discuss RT will be looking for support issues about the supported models.&nbsp; I have not been able to find a place where unhappy Canon owners such as yourself
 are congregating for collaborative support.</p>

    <title>Distorted sound when recording DOSbox with Game DVR - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> playstationpaul  say:</h3>
<h2>            Distorted sound when recording DOSbox with Game DVR</h2>
                    <p>The game in question is Heretic with the GZ mod and I'm just recording game audio, no mic. The distortion is very harsh and crackly, sounds like it could be clipping but I'm not 100% sure as it doesn't behave like regular clipping. It only occurs with certain
 in game sounds, particularly gun shots and is often panned left or right. The audio whilst playing is fine, the distortion is only on the captures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reduced audio levels and changed the audio bit rate from within game bar, the problem persists. Not much else I can do as I seem to have exhausted all the settings.&nbsp;It seemed to be OK when I tried a non DOS game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas why this might be happening and what I can do to fix it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>That error message usually has nothing to do with random rebooting. The error message is about networking on a Local Area Network. Random rebooting usually indicates failing hardware but you need to get the Stop Error. Disable the automatic rebooting so
 you can get the Stop Error (Blue Screen). You can then research the Stop Error or post it back here for more help.</p>
<p><span>Control Panel&gt;System&gt;Advanced&gt;Startup and Recovery&gt;Settings and under System Failure uncheck "Automatically Restart".</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>We can't change the font color in Windows. Here are the things you can try to make the text more readable:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Enable High Contrast. Go to <strong>PC Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Ease of Access</strong> &gt;
<strong>High Contrast</strong>.</li><li>You may able enable the <strong>Make everything on your screen bigger</strong> option from time to time.</li><li>Change the text size. <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>Appearance and Personalization</strong> &gt;
<strong>Display </strong>&gt; <strong>Change only the text size</strong>. There's also and option to make it
<strong>Bold</strong>. Check if the available options apply to your situation.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

                    I work in Tech Support, and I don't have Windows Vista installed on my computer (I have XP) when Customers call in for support on Vista I go to Temulator.com so I can tell them exactaly what to click on to get what they need done.<br />
<br />
Now that Windows 7 is out, things have changed slightly and I was hoping there was another website like Temulator.com that has a Java, or Silverlight emulator for windows 7.

    <title>Forza Horizon 4 Install on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samwisedb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forza Horizon 4 Install on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I bought this game yesterday, and after having installed it, I got an error saying "this game is not currently available on your account". After uninstalling the game, I cannot reinstall it as I get an error during the "acquiring license" part of the install,
 and a notification from the store app - "couldn't install, we'll try again later.". I have run WSReset, but that has not solved the issue, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4716e9cc-1dcb-4694-a603-2c27ec0d0a88?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4716e9cc-1dcb-4694-a603-2c27ec0d0a88?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I bought the game through the Microsoft Store, so I can't see it being an issue with the license itself.Is there a way to solve this other than a refund?</p>

<p>I also have tried everything on that list...have a look at this video, there's a response from Microsoft in the comments section.&nbsp; It appears to be a problem on Microsofts end and they claim it should be fixed in 24 hours.</p>

<h2>            Halo 4 freezes on Infinity level.</h2>
                    
<p>I've been having an issues with my campaign freezing during Infinity level. Always at the part where you get to the big door after going through the forest where Cortana says the she detects friendly signatures. The screen goes black like it's going to a
 cut screen but it just stays black and the music cuts out. You can press pause and the pause menu comes up, so does the xbox guide, but if you try to go save and quit the whole system freezes and you have to hard reset the system. I've tried it with both the
 game installed and uninstalled. So thinking it was the disc I took it to walmart to exchange it. New disc same problem, even tried reinstalling the game and starting from the beginning of the level with no luck. Anyone else having this issue? I'm using an
 old model xbox with a 120 GB hdd, but haven't had a problem with any other games.</p>

<p>Try Contacting Xbox Support on the Phone to see if you can request a new game disk (1-800-4my-xbox) the game might be damaged or you are just having some issues with the game saves at time to time they corrupt (like the pre order dlc bug) so you may need
 to try dashboarding and going at it again with that matter.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear this is happening. Let's see if you can get any tips or trick in the
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/console-freeze/xbox-360-screen-freeze" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Screen Freeze Solution</a> to help with this. It might also be worth seeing if the save file is the issue. This unfortunately means that you would have to beat the game up to that point again in order to figure this out but it is sometimes the solution
 to issues like this. Let us know if any of this helps. Thanks!</p>

            Hi Rhonda, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />Usually apps will install an icon in the start menu, so you can simply click Start and type "flight", and Flight Simulator X should show up as an option to select.
<br />
<br />If it doesn't, you can have a look in File Explorer (Windows Key+E) and browse to C:\Program Files (x86), which should contain your Flight Simulator installation directory. In there should be the exe file that you can double-click to run the game.
<br />
<br />You can also right-click it and select Send to-&gt; Desktop to create a shortcut to the game on your desktop.
<br />
<br />Hopefully this helps! Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!       
        </p>

<h2>            adding new printer icon to taskbar in Windows 10</h2>
                    I changed printers, but the printer icon is missing (from the old printer) and I can't figure out how to add the icon for the new default printer to the taskbar. The only instructions seem to be for pinning a program to the taskbar.

    <title>slow login after updating windows 10 to version 1511 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> derek hudson  say:</h3>
<h2>            slow login after updating windows 10 to version 1511</h2>
                    <p>After upgrade to the latest build of windows 10 my login takes 20-30 sec about 3 times what the pc takes to get to this screen I have look it up on the internet and it seems to be a common problem. the 2 fixes I came across consisted of
</p>
<p>(1) I’ve had this problem on 3 computers. The wirelessly connected ones were the worst offenders with 20-30 sec, whereas the wired one only waited for 2-3 sec. All of them using local accounts. Digging around, the solution that worked for me was to create
 a new local account ( Win+R → “control userpasswords2” ). Create a new account and make sure to give it admin privileges (left it as user on one computer and it didn’t work). Right click on the Start button, sign out, sign in to the new user and let it do
 it’s “Lets get started” thing. Sign out. Now feel free to delete the new account. This solved the issue for me in all 3 instances. 1-2 seconds login for the wireless ones and instant login for the faster, wired one.</p>
<p>(2) disabling the autohide from the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the first one didn't work from a fresh boot and was still taking 20-30 sec the second one appears to be working atm and is taking 1-2 secs to get in, I've posted this because I also read that this fix works for a while ie 7-8 logins and then goes back to
 slow I don't recall this issue before the update.&nbsp;&nbsp;If anyone has a long term fix can you pls post it. I notice when I typed in "control userpasswords2" it shows my username twice once as HomeUser and a second time as HomeUser, Administrator; Users is this
 normal ?</p>

</p><p>As Derek Hudson posted: The only thing that&nbsp;cures the problem&nbsp;permanently is&nbsp;to disable the Auto-Hide of the taskbar. The problem first appears after updating&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;to the 1511 build. The problem still persists with an up-to-date system (as of 25th
 of december 2015)&nbsp;and appears&nbsp;whenever the Auto-Hide of the taskbar is again enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the suggested&nbsp;steps (Clean Boot and running of the&nbsp;System Maintenance Troubleshooter) from Suvarna Govinda didn't solve the problem for me neither.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft -&nbsp;please fix that annoying bug already.</p>

            <p>I'll add on to this topic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem only occurs with the taskbar set to autohide.</p>
<p>It is unrelated to hardware, drivers, or really anything else, BUT Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It only started becoming an issue after 1511 was rushed out of the insider program in a very unstable state. I actually have to disable driver updates that go through Windows due to Win10 Pro wanting to install a driver that corrupts itself (literally have
 had it corrupt within 10 minutes of a clean install due to the backwards approach to forcibly installing updates) to the point that even removing said driver doesn't fix that issue, but that is unrelated to the long boot times, and is a completely separate
 matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is also easily replicated on a clean install; unrelated to 3rd party software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always keep my software up to date, it isn't my hardware, and, as stated above, only became an issue once Microsoft pushed 1511 out.</p>

            Typical Microsoft lack of attention to a real problem that users are facing. They have ignored this thread for two weeks now - is there any way of telling if it's a dead thread or whether support are still bothering with it? Is there any way of bumping
 an old thread that they are ignoring?<br />
<br />
Everyone is right in saying that this problem only occurs once update 1511 is installed. I carried out a completely clean Windows Reset and the problem went away, only to reoccur once the updates had downloaded and reinstalled.<br />
<br />
I only have Windows Defender running, currently, with no additional anti-virus software. Using Windows 10 Pro.<br />
<br />
I do not believe that it is a graphics driver issue. I have read a lot about problems with AMD drivers but I am using a simple Intel HD 3000 setup on a notebook, with the latest drivers installed.<br />
<br />
Even going to the lock screen (WIndows Key + L) and logging back in immediately would result in a minute's delay. Therefore, this is not a driver issue, as no drivers are reloaded if you simply lock your screen and log back in.<br />
<br />
Some users elsewhere have fixed this problem by disabling the auto-hide feature on the task bar, or creating a new admin user account, logging into it, logging out, rebooting and deleting the new admin account. Neither of these worked for me.<br />
<br />
I used the Windows assessment tool and found that the delays were always caused by the logon process. (Unfortunately I don't have the technical name of the process as I have subsequently reset my machine again). It appears that the logon process is waiting
 for a response until it times out, which takes about a minute. I disabled all sorts of domain logon functions in settings and in regedit, with no luck.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Eventually, I reset Windows again, making sure that I selected the "I own it" option rather than the business option (although I assume I had chosen this previously) and declining all online options such as feedback, sending info to Microsoft, etc. Update 1511
 has installed and, currently, my logins are instant.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm sorry I can't give an exact explanation of why this has worked or what the problem was. If I could, I would work for Microsoft Technical Support. However, I'm pretty convinced that it is a domain controller or DNS issue.<br />

            <p>This is still a problem and it only appeared after the update, it wasn't there before. The update is the problem, not our other software, computers or whatever. I refuse to "fix" it by disabling auto-hide, I
<em>want</em> the taskbar to auto-hide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, Microsoft, stop evading the issue. It's a huge deal breaker for me, I didn't buy an SSD drive to log in for 30 seconds.</p>

            <p>... I experienced the same strange logon-event with about 30-60 sec duration after updating to 1511.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's not why I use a pretty fast SSD for my OS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But only on my user-profile, not on my admin-profile.</p>
<p>Some workarounds relating to the hybrid-boot and quick shut down-option didn't solve it for more than one restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reading this thread, I realized, that my admin-profile doesn't use an auto-hidden taskbar, while my user-profile does (I need every inch on my screen!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am convinced, that this is actually the issue, I am currently unhide my taskbar and expect it "worked around".</p>
<p>But this is NO FIX, so some real fix on Microsofts side would be really appreciated. This is the first time I started to regret upgrading from Win 7 to Win 10.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message <strong>Windows cannot properly load your Device Install Reboot Required file
</strong>likely occurs due to corrupted Windows registry or device driver. This can also be caused by corrupted download or incomplete installation of Windows. We'll need to gather a bit more information to better identify what's causing this. Kindly answer
 the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which build and version of Windows 10 are you using? To check it, kindly follow the steps provided on this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</li><li>Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</li><li>Can you send us a screenshot of the exact error message that you're getting when using your computer?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>I have the same issue. The taskbar is not operabel. Windows icon and the programm icons not operable (not klickable and not with the windows key)</p>
<p>Key combination and short cuts etc. work (Windows+E;...)</p>
<p>Everything in the window is also operable, excell etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Strg+Alt Delete I can Logout the usere but before I have to force shut down of a task which sais "taskhost...install reboot required".Or similar.
</p>
<p>Then I can login again and all is fine. This happens since a few weeks and not very often. (However when I look into windows update it does not say reboot required)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to find this task in the taksmanager but could not find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Defender offline (just scan from time to time) parallel with Avast Antivirus realtime. At one step I though it could be the update of Defender definitions which is are stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I can I will try to make a printscreen of the task when I have the problem again. This task is stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 1709 (Build 16299.125)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have here the text of the Tastk which is stuck preventing logout, shutdown and certainly blocking the task bar:</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you made any changes prior to experiencing the issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Do you get any error messages?<br />
2. Did you make any recent changes on your system prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> I would suggest you to check if there are any updates or patches available for the game by visiting the manufacturer website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If the issue still persists try to update video drivers from the computer manufacturer website.</p>
<p><strong>Refer:</strong> <span>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 3:</strong> If the issue is still not resolved you may try changing Hardware Acceleration.<br />
<br />
a. Click <strong>Start</strong>, select <strong>Control Panel</strong>, click <strong>
Appearance and Personalization</strong>, click <strong>Personalization</strong>, click
<strong>Display Settings</strong>, and then click <strong>Advanced Settings</strong>.<br />
b. Click the <strong>Troubleshoot tab</strong>, and then click <strong>Change Settings.<br />
Note: </strong>Change Settings will be disabled if the graphics card drivers do not support disabling hardware acceleration.<br />
c. <strong>Move the Hardware Acceleration slider </strong>all the way to the <strong>
right (Full). </strong>This is the basic acceleration setting.<br />
d. <strong>Click OK twice</strong>, and then <strong>close the window</strong>.<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists you may try the next Method.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 4:</strong> Also the error may occur if the video card does not have sufficient memory to run the games. You may check the memory usage in the resource monitor. The memory required for a particular game depends on the game itself.<br />
<br />
Resource Monitor is a tool that you can use to monitor the usage of CPU, hard disk, network and memory in real time.<br />
<br />
a) <strong>Open Resource Monitor </strong>by clicking the <strong>Start button</strong>. In the
<strong>search box,</strong> <strong>type Resource Monitor</strong>, and then, in the list of results, click
<strong>Resource Monitor</strong>. <br />
b) If you're <strong>prompted for an administrator password </strong>or confirmation,
<strong>type the password </strong>or provide confirmation. <br />
<br />
<strong>You may refer to the below link for assistance:</strong><br />

    <title>No audio over mini display port to hdmi using Surface Dock with - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jag88  say:</h3>
<h2>            No audio over mini display port to hdmi using Surface Dock with Surface Book</h2>
                    <p>Please read all the details.<br />
<br />
Ok so I have a Surface Book with the Nvidia dGPU. I am trying to get my Surface Dock (the new one) to work properly and so far no dice. I want to be able to output both video *and audio over the mini display port to my TV. I have the dock setup with a mini
 display port to HDMI adapter and a certified&nbsp;HDMI 2.0b cable and I am able to output video in 4k to the external monitor (Panasonic TV) through the dock, but the audio only plays across the speakers of the Surface Book.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried opening the playback devices from the sound control panel and setting HDMI audio, but it does not show up in the list of playback devices. I also checked device manager and I see no missing drivers, orange triangles, yellow exclamation points
 or anything else wrong in device manager. I also&nbsp;booted&nbsp;into the UEFI settings and made sure the TPM module was enabled. Finally I ran windows update with the dock connected to make sure I had the latest drivers... and yet still no audio over HDMI and no way
 to select it as a playback device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the thing that really annoys me... if I unplug the mini display port adapter with the HDMI cable from the dock and then plug it directly into the Surface Book keyboard audio over HDMI works perfectly fine!! It shows in the playback devices and the
 sound works like it is supposed to... just not when connected through the dock, which is absolute BS (yea I am ticked after spending $150 on the dock just to have it be useless to me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on here, does the Surface Dock not support audio over mini display port!?</p>

<p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far to help resolve the issue? Make sure that your device and dock is up to date. Here are the steps on how to check for updates:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the Windows icon on the bottom left of the screen.<br />
</li><li>Click Settings.<br />
</li><li>Choose Update &amp; security.<br />
</li><li>Click on Check for updates.</li></ol>
<p>Note: Make sure that the dock is connected to your Surface device while checking for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, we suggest that you download the Surface Dock Updater to see if your dock is up to date.
<strong>Here's the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=46703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a></strong>. Once your click Download, check the box for <span><strong>SurfaceDockUpdaterSetup.msi</strong> then click Next.</span></p>
<p><span>The latest version of the Surface Dock Updater resolves an issue with audio over passive display port adapters.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/3162917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Passive adapters may also have a problem</a> when trying to display resolutions above 1920x1200. You may need to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4023468/surface-troubleshoot-surface-dock-and-docking-stations#MiniDisplayPort" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
use a new, preferably active, adapter or a DisplayPort cable</a>, if your monitor supports it.</p>
