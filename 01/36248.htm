<h2>            Controller Audio Desync Xbox One X</h2>
                    There is a slight desync in the audio when I have my headphones connected to the controller. Is there any way to fix this?

<p>Hey there Lord Sethos!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue trying to get your controller to sound the right way.
</p>
<p>I would suggest that if you haven't to try the steps outlined in <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/wired-headset-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox One Chat Headset troubleshooting</a>, though your issue doesn't exactly fit into the categories described on that page, it's still a good idea to make sure that it's alright there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing that you could try is what we call a soft reset. <span>
<span>It's a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Just
 make sure that before you go ahead with it, that you do know all of the sign-in information for any/all of your accounts</span></span><span><span>(as</span></span><span><span>they
 will be removed) </span></span><span><span>and
 have easy access to your internet network</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Its happened before but its always cleared up by restarting the console. Those were bigger desyncs though. this one is barely noticeable. I hear maby a fraction of a second faster then what I see on tv.

<p>hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>at first i would try a power cycle:</p>

<p>then i connect the controller via cable with the console and check for controller updates</p>

<p>after this i would check the audio output:</p>

<p>Hello Sethos,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this only lasts a second or so and you done all the troubleshooting suggested. We recommend waiting for the next update and see if this helps fix the issue. When you update the controller make sure the headset is plugged into the controller.</p>
<p>

<p>There are several changes you can make, take a look at:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Control panel&gt; Display&gt; set medium</p>
<p>Control panel&gt; internet options&gt; fonts, you can pick a font that may be clearer</p>
<p>Start internet explorer (desktop version)&gt; click the gear icon&gt; set zoom as desired</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some additional options in control panel&gt; ease of access center</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a surface pro 3 and have had an issue with the bluetooth module being automatically disabled by Windows 10 whenever I am using the battery. I have to manually open up the device manager to enable bluetooth whenever I use the surface without having
 it plugged in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to prevent Windows from disabling bluetooth when on battery? Or at the least, a way to turn it on without going into the device manager every time?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Take a look at Power Options and your Power plans.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. Win-x O.&nbsp;&nbsp; Another way to make Windows do stuff it might otherwise not do is to use&nbsp; Mobility Center's&nbsp; Presentation&nbsp; mode.&nbsp; (Win-x b, Alt-P).&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice that if you had a Power plan to switch to that
 would do what you want you could also switch to it via Mobility Center.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. I had looked under the power options as well as creating a custom power plan and advanced setting. In none of those areas do I see a "disable bluetooth" function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try turning off "battery saver" altogether, but currently it's only supposed to kick in at 20%, but the "disabling" of my bluetooth device occurs with 100% battery, so I'm not totally hopeful that will do the trick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Window's FAQ recommendation to adjust the bluetooth settings is a toggle in the Action Center, but that's not even available to me as the entire bluetooth driver/device is disabled in device manager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there are any other thoughts, or perhaps someone know the exact path for me to look for the option to disable this "feature"?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I imagine one would be "Wireless Adapter" but I suppose a better point would be that whatever effect Power Options switch from Charging to Battery could have on the Bluetooth drivers could potentially enter an unreliable code path that could otherwise be
 avoided.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also I suppose you could try enabling more detailed events for related categories to get better clues about why it is failing the way you observe.&nbsp; If the problem is easily reproducible you may want to try enabling even more detailed tracing.&nbsp; For
 example, see how many potentially related traces you can list with this PowerShell pipeline:&nbsp; netsh trace sh providers | select-string "BT|Blue"</p>

            <p>Went to the Microsoft store and we tried a few things to no avail. Tech said they'd need to run diagnostics on the surface for a little while to figure out why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under device manager, when the bluetooth driver is enabled, one can click an option for "allow system to turn off to save battery". &nbsp;However, even removing that tick box does not solve the problem. On restart, the driver is already disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing a little digging, it looks like the bluetooth support service is set to manual (Trigger). I think this might be the issue? But I don't know if I change to automatic whether or not I will be able to go back to manual with trigger in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will give it a try as I almost always use a bluetooth mouse with my surface. Plus i have the pen that needs bluetooth for it's little button, so i can't see when I'd want it off..</p>

            Looks like that did it. Can't remember if it was me that turned it to manual. But setting bluetooth support services and removing the tick box combined did the trick. Probably was the manual services start that was the issue. Thanks for the help!

<h2>            Windows security prompt when trying to access wifi network</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to connect to eduroam on Windows 10 and have not been able.&nbsp; I have confirmed my password and username are correct by signing into my university account, but the network prompt will just blank and require I re-enter my credentials everytime.&nbsp;
 After a few failures it says "cannot connect to network".&nbsp; I have tried to setup the network directly by clicking "<strong>Add a new network</strong>" under "<strong>Manage known networks"</strong>. If I do this then when I click connect on eduroam a&nbsp;<strong>Windows
 Security </strong>pop-up will come up.&nbsp; I have a local account and my account name and password, which I use to sign in to my computer, do not work on this prompt.&nbsp; Nor does my eduroam credentials. I even signed into my Microsoft account (so converted my local
 account) and that did not work either.&nbsp; I have also checked that under "EAP MSCHAPv2 Properties" under the eduroam Wireless Network Properties that the box "Automatically use my Windows logon name and password (and domain if any)." is unchecked.&nbsp; Every time
 I have opened that setting it has been unchecked. The "wifi sense" stuff is also all toggled off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read online that performing a <strong>Network Reset</strong> will get rid of this pop-up, but when I do that I am back to square one where I cannot connect to the network.&nbsp; I have also clicked
<strong>Forget</strong> the network numerous times but to no avail.&nbsp; Perhaps I need some specific network configuration for the university I am visiting? I thought not with eduroam...</p>

<p>Hi swipp,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The concern you have encountered with accessing wifi network may be due to a corrupted file or a misconfigured setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, upgrading to newer drivers from the Windows Update Catalog, will let you help sort out the concern. Simply click this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/323166/how-to-download-updates-that-include-drivers-and-hotfixes-from-the-win" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>You may also try following the steps provided on this article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Fix network connection issues in Windows 10</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If all else fails, we suggest to perform a Network Reset. Doing this will make Windows forget the connection credentials for the WiFi, so you'll have to re-enter them after you restart your computer. You may do this as a last resort to sort your concern.
 Simply follow the steps provided by <strong>Regene Jos</strong> on this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/unable-to-connect-to-wifi-network-getting-windows/04ec2c73-d566-4cd3-92ac-480da59c4d35">

    <title>Live Mail recieves some messages then stops - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> illiescu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Live Mail recieves some messages then stops</h2>
                    When I try to receive email, Windows Live Mail will receive some and then one of two things happens before it's done:<br />
1.&nbsp; Window says something like server not responding, do you want to wait 60 seconds.&nbsp; Clicking on Wait, minute after minute, over and over again has no effect.&nbsp; Clicking on Stop makes it start all over downloading duplicate messages of those already received
 for awhile and then it stops again.&nbsp; It <u>doesn't </u>stop on the same message each time.<br />
2.&nbsp; It sometimes stops on downloading one message.&nbsp; The window will say it's downloading a certain message, but it stays stuck on "downloading" that one message for hours.<br />
<br />
Things already tried to solve this problem:<br />
~&nbsp; Reboot computer.<br />
~&nbsp; Calling my service provider, Chater.net&nbsp; -&nbsp; I can send and receive email from their server website, so it's not their problem.<br />
~&nbsp; Delete email account and set up a new one.<br />
~&nbsp; Re-install Windows Live Mail.<br />
~&nbsp; Re-install windows. <br />
~&nbsp; Replace mother board ( computer still under warranty).<br />
<br />
In other words, just trying again doesn't work.&nbsp; Because this has been going on for weeks, I have over a thousand emails backed up on my server.&nbsp; Windows Live Mail is right now stuck on trying to download number 1067, and has been stuck there on that one email
 for over 6 hours.&nbsp; I already have 3 copies of all of the messages it has downloaded before on previous attempts.&nbsp; So I don't want to start over and get a fourth copy of a thousand messages and have it stop a again before it's done.&nbsp; I need an expert in the
 Windows Live Mail program to tell me what to do to get the program to finish downloading message number 1067, and the rest of the messages after that.&nbsp; And I need someone who can fix Windows Live Mail so that is will always download all of the incoming messages
 without stopping.<br />
<br />
I was directed to this site by calling Microsoft.&nbsp; They said this is the only place I can get help from an Microsoft expert on Windows Live Mail.<br />

            <p>When a mail client downloads new messages using POP3, there is a fail-safe mechanism that will re-start the download if it doesn't complete for some reason. There is most probably a corrupt message that can't be downloaded from the server, so the download
 never completes.<br />
<br />
Log&nbsp;in to your account at Charter webmail. Clear out the junk mail and deleted items folders, then create a new folder and move the newest half of the messages in the inbox that haven't yet been downloaded into the new folder. Back in WLMail, use send/receive
 again. If it succeeds, move the oldest half of the messages in the temporary folder back into the inbox and send/receive in WLMail again. Repeat this process, halving the number of messages moved each time,&nbsp;until you can identify the message(s) causing the
 download to stall. Deal with them in webmail.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Library Files Archive Bit reset by wmpshare.exe - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> naiver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Library Files Archive Bit reset by wmpshare.exe</h2>
                    I've been trying to figure out why my differential backup size&nbsp;reverts to nearly full backup&nbsp;size without&nbsp;updating or running a full backup on&nbsp;the affected&nbsp;files. I found that this only affects library files and seems to be due to wmpshare.exe resetting
 the archive bit on these files&nbsp;when windows media center or windows media player has been running. My media libraries are very large and this is causing me problems with maintaining a reasonable backup routine. Can anything be done to prevent wmpshare from
 resetting the archive bit?

<p><span><span>"attrib -a /s"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click the Start button. In the Search box, type command prompt.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. In the list of results, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator.<span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted

            I think I've resolved the issue by removing this pc from the HomeGroup. I don't know about previous versions but in Windows 7, wmpshare.exe seems to work in conjunction with HomeGroup sharing settings. When I removed&nbsp;the music library from the HomeGroup
 settings, the archive bit was left alone on those files, even after running Windows Media Player. I've now&nbsp;opted out of the homegroup altogether and all my library files&nbsp;seem to be retaining their archive bits&nbsp;following a full backup. Time will tell.

<h2>            HDD won&#39;t show up no matter what i do. Stuck in strange void&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A few days ago I tried to factory reset my Windows 10 install. However, while it was reinstalling it came up with an error saying the main files were corrupted. So I took a USB drive and reinstalled Windows 10 through that. My computer is working fine now
 except for one thing. No matter what I do, only one of my two 1TB HDD's are showing up. I have two drives. C: and B: &nbsp;I've checked my computer management &gt; Storage &gt; Disk Management, and B: is my system drive, and C: is my boot drive. B: isn't showing up in
 my My PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since my C: drive is the boot and the B: drive is my system, i can't format either of them. I just wan't my second HDD to work.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a number of possible issues I see...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking that the easiest thing to do would be to reinstall Windows again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any important data you may lose ?... It kind of looks like you already may have if there was any...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would suggest is that you boot from the installation media, do a Custom Install...</p>
<p>Delete all of the partitions on both drives, then choose the drive you want for your Windows 10...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your C:\ Boot partition should actually be where the unallocated 351MB partition is...</p>
<p>The Boot Partition is normally hidden and may be why it will not appear....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The way things are now, your Windows Installation is scattered over both HDDs...</p>

<p>
</p><p>As mentioned... delete everything on it, turn off your machine, and unplug it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>What has happened to you is not all that unusual when more than one drive is hooked up during a installation... Especially if you do a "Standard" install instead of a "Custom"...</p>

            I'm beyond mad right now, i have spent almost 2 hours with a Virtual Help type thing + then talked to a real person on the web...no help at all even after talking to a Live Agent on the phone. I can't sign into the web based help on rewards because of
 all the squigly lines to prove your a real person,...even did the "audio" thing and it sounds like 2 people trying to talk over each other. My Issue being i turned in 6,800 reward points for a free month of Xbox Live, i thought it went through so really didn't
 think they were going to hit my debit card with it (or i would have cancelled auto-renewal). Now my points are gone and i still had to pay for it.

    <title>Removal of code of conduct - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Removal of code of conduct</h2>
                    
<p>I said a naughty word in my Bio and got kicked off for 24hrs. Okay, my&nbsp;fault. &nbsp;However, I have no edit buttons in my profile they simply were gone one day. I phoned Microsoft and the Tech tried but said he could not put the buttons back and said my Bio was
 okay. I guess he was WRONG. This is unfair. It has been well over a month and I still have code of conduct all over my profile. I find it upsetting and embarassing at my age. The Microsoft Techs will not remove the code of conduct. They told me by phone they
 cannot do that. So my question is, How do I get this removed? Its over a month now and I still have this on my profile like I am wearing a scarlet letter. How do I get my buttons back?&nbsp; I want my bio back my location back and my name back. I spend hundreds
 of dollars a year on xbox and this is really upsetting me. I am an old lady who loves her xbox dearly. I just want this matter to be cleared up once and for all and I want my edit buttons back. I promise I won't say any naughty words ever again in my Bio.
 Help please</p>

<p>It is now the end of March and I am still wearing the code of conduct on my profile page. This is a disgrace. For 6 months now I have pleaded for it's removal and it is still there. I cannot change it as I no longer have a bio, location, or name edit buttons
 on my profile settings. Surely to God someone there can remove it. You guys put it there, so you guys know how to remove it. PLEASE do so.</p>

    <title>Lightscribe DVD Burner Windows 10 SOLVED - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mwright69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lightscribe DVD Burner Windows 10 SOLVED</h2>
                    <p>Here is the answer to your Lightscribe troubles in windows 8, 8.1 and 10.</p>
<p>Download the&nbsp;LightscribeSimpleLabeler&nbsp;http://download.cnet.com/LightScribe-Template-Labeler/3000-2192_4-10913864.html</p>
<p>right click on the LightscribeSimpleLabeler installer in your download folder.<br />
choose "Troubleshoot Compatibility"<br />
Let the troubleshooter run, this may take a few minutes.<br />
When the troubleshooter is done detecting issues select "Troubleshoot program"<br />
choose "The program worked in earlier versions of Windows but won't install or run now"<br />
click "Next"<br />
choose "Windows 7"<br />
click "Next"<br />
click "Test the program"<br />
click "Next" when the program has installed<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>you should now be able to use the simple lightscribe labeler.&nbsp;</p>
<p>if you want a more advanced labeler like the Lightscribe Template Labeler, it doesnt work. But you can install Nero. I installed a copy of Nero 9 Essentials the same way i installed the simple labeler, and it labled my disk beautifully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>this works for most problems you have installing apps in Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10</p>
<p />

            <p>This will only work for the simple labeler. Not the template labeler. They are different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After i downloaded the simple lightscribe labeler from the link i provided and did the exact steps i posted above, i was able to label a cd with text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing that i installed a copy of nero9 and ran the compatiblity troubleshooter the same way and was able to install it. I am now able to make advanced template labels.</p>

            <p>I didn't have any luck with that method but I was able to employ another work-around as provided by Steve over at lightscribe.tv. He has a DL link for the system files. You can paste the system files to a USB flash drive or to your PC and run the Simple
 Labeller that way. That solution has not had any effect on my inability to use the Lightscribe feature within Nero Cover Designer.Still can't print labels from that program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also a new development with my LG multi CD/DVD lightscribe burner: Windows10 now telling me my lightscribe disks are not writable format. I can use the labeller but now can't write data to a lightscribe disk.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Well, still had trouble getting the LS software to install,,, then I had one of those "Smack my forehead" moments and said "DOH!!". Turned off my Antivirus, clicked install LS and it went through without any problems. Since I had already created my cover
 in Nero 2016, with picture, I used their cover program, clicked preview and then print LIGHTSCRIBE. Now I have a sore arm from patting myself on my back. :)</p>

            <p>ok so over the past few months we have worked together and solved a common issue. Great job to each of you for your dedication and hard work. The Lightscribe issue appears to have a few easy solutions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. the way I described above</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. the way Chuck_777 did it to get both the simple and template labeler to work. (please describe the steps you took to get the Template Labeler to work, or did you just follow my steps but only with the template labeler instead of the simple labeler)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. with the added knowledge that Clif1 added, Turn off your antivirus before installing any thing you are having issues with.</p>

you can start lightscribetemplatelabeler_1.18.27.10.exe.<br />
After that copy the LightScribe Template Labeler.msi from %temp% to another folder.<br />
Than patch the MSI file with superOrca <a href="http://www.pantaray.com/msi_super_orca.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            how do i fix packet loss in windows 7 home premium 64-bit&#63;</h2>
                    I am a telecommuter and have recently begun doing this. &nbsp;When i am connected to my virtual workstation, i am experiencing a lot of packet loss. &nbsp;It has seriously begun to interfere with my workload. &nbsp;I need serious help with this not band-aid solution.
 &nbsp;Please understand that i do not speak techno jargon. &nbsp;solutions have to be in plain english for me.&nbsp;

            <p>&nbsp;It sounds like you have a low quality connection.&nbsp; I'd check with whoever is providing your connection to the Internet.&nbsp; I'd also check with whoever told you that your problem was packet loss because that's a pretty technical question coming from someone
 who doesn't speak techno jargon.&nbsp; I doubt if someone who doesn't speak techno jargon is going to be able to fix the problem by themself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One X, a 3 week Factory reset cycle</h2>
                    <p><br /></p><p>When I first upgraded to the very beefy Xbox One X, I was impressed with the boot time, load time, and 4k graphics.</p><p><br /></p><p>Sadly, that only lasted a few weeks. Now the system is plagued with "gremlins". Apps will fail to launch (BluRay player, Netflix for example), Games will fail to launch (Monster Hunter World, Fallout 4), and Updates will fail and then DELETE the program it was trying to update. (SRX1432041493ID is my current ticket number)</p><p><br /></p><p>I've tried using Microsoft's 800 support, but the only thing they want to do is Factory reset the Xbox One X. Yes, this does resolve the issue at the moment, 2-3 weeks later they all return. The 800 staff blatantly are reading from scripts, with zero understanding of the product they support once the issue deviates  from those scripts. Sadly, for some reason, no matter how I try to press upon the "Techs" that a 3 week Factory Reset is not a valid resolution to this issue, they flatly refuse to escalate t

            <p>I was actually able to take my defective Xbox One X to the Microsoft store and have it replaced.</p><p><br /></p><p>I did come armed with all of my Support ticket numbers along with the Error code that caused me to own a 500$ brick. During the evening before's Factory Reset of the Xbox One X the device failed, restarted and threw a new error code and would no longer boot past the error.</p><p><br /></p><p>While the Microsoft store did replace the device, I think the whole support experience should shed a light on how horrible their Support service really is.&nbsp; If I treated a client the why Xbox's 800 support handled my trouble tickets, I would be out of a job. I've gotten better assistance via Comcast and AT&amp;T.</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks for the help Saeleth<br /></p>

    <title>Update to Windows 8.1 asking for administrator privileges - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dannymcalear  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update to Windows 8.1 asking for administrator privileges</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new PC, only a couple of days old, running Windows 8. I set up my user account, and updated all required files. I received the notification about upgrading to Windows 8.1 and went to do that upgrade, but got the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<em>Store - You need to use an account with Administrator privileges to install Windows 8.1, try logging in with the user account of an administrator of this PC and trying the update again</em>."</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this is a completely stand-alone PC, not on any Network, Workgroup or Usergroup, I only set up my user account. There are no other users, nor will there ever be. Nowhere was I asked to set up an administrator account, and therefore do not have a password
 to use to log in as such! I have disabled McAfee and tried again, but still with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how can I upgrade or update when the PC is asking me for something I do not have and that was never set up??
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent close to an hour going through other questions and discussions, and could not find an answer to this.</p>

            <p>1) It is the McAfee SecurityCenter that was just activated when I set up the PC a couple of days ago. It expired on February 28. 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) It is a full version of the McAfee SecurityCenter valid for one year.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Please note that i did disable the security and firewall before attempting the update.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I uninstalled the three noted updates (KB2917499, KB2871389&nbsp;and KB2885699) and rebooted. During restart, there was a message saying there was a problem with the updates and it was reverting back. Therefore the updates remained. I tried it a second time
 after a fresh restart, and then received the same message. I could not install any of the three listed updates as they are already installed.</p>

<h2>            Disney-Pixar Brave&#58; The Video Game achievement walkthrough</h2>
                    <p>Disney-Pixar Brave

  </p>

<p>The game is rather linear and while maybe not technically on-rails, your route is predetermined, except for a few short side roads to coins and chest, so I will only point out where you can/will get achievements and where the collectible items are, as well as tips on defeating the guardians. Keep in mind that the collectibles are essentially cosmetic. While most of them offer upgrades, you can choose to use whichever you want as the upgrades are to the characters not the specific items. So, for instance, regardless which sword you use, you’ll have the highest upgraded sword ability earned.

  </p>

<p>Be mindful of your surroundings, you can walk off of ledges and platforms floating in water often sink under your weight. You can also find in a number of fights, a higher ground that your enemies can’t get to because they can’t jump, or other areas where the enemies won’t or can’t go. Use this to your advantage and kill them with your bow / charged shot.

  </p>

<p>There are several achievements that require you to kill 100 and 250 enemies with the different Charms. The same is required of kills with Power Shot and Charged Shot. These two require you to purchase their respective abilities from the Upgrade shop. Depending on your play style, these could come naturally as you play through the game, or you might want to consider switching up your chosen Charm as you play, so that you don’t have to grind these out later. But, as you’ll be grinding out coins for upgrades later, it’s not a huge issue.

  </p>

<p>Some other achievement will come naturally as you play as well: Minimum Wage, Affluent, and Wealthy will all pop as you play through the levels and grind you way to purchasing all of the upgrades. “Mum’s the word” will also pop as you progress through the game and grind coins. Depending on your play style and upgrade choices, “All bunched up” should come naturally as you progress as well (on both my normal playthrough and again when working on the walkthough, I got this in the second level).

  </p>

<p>For your upgrades, I recommend focusing on the “Charged shot: earth” upgrades and the “Charged shot” upgrade that decreases the time it takes to charge charged shots. You will probably also want to upgrade your “Health potions”. You will want to purchase your “Charged shot: fire” and upgrade it at least once before you get to the 6###sup/sup### level, as you’ll need it there. You will want to purchase the dodge ability by the time you start the final level as there is a chest you cannot get without it on that level. You will eventually want to purchase and upgrade the “Power attack” but that just depends on when you want to work on this. Do not waste coins on upgrading the Wisp until you’ve fully upgraded Merida, as the Wisp is only a coop character and these upgrades do not help Merida if you’re playing single player.

  </p>

<p>You really have to options on how to play this: 1) Play on whatever difficulty you want, breezing through to get a bunch of the achievements really quickly, but then playing again to get “Gaelic hero” by playing the whole game on Brave difficulty, or 2) just play on Brave difficulty and switch the difficulty afterwards for grinding; for the most part, it’s not that difficult of a game, especially when using Charged Shot - Earth and upgrading the minions released along with the time it takes to charge it. If, at any time, you choose to quit a level and go back to the ring of stones, you will have to start that level over, so be aware of this when choosing upgrades and deciding stopping points.

  </p>



<p>Prologue

  </p>

<p>This is just the tutorial; it will walk you through movement, jumping, weapons, targets, pressure plates, and other game mechanics. You’ll also choose which one of the two starting outfits (1/5 and 2/5) you’re going to wear. Follow along the path and you will get

  </p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swordful

  </p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bowsome

  </p>

<p>Once the prologue ends, you’ll be taken to Ring of Stones (which is the level select hub). Follow the Will-o-the-wisps to the witch’s hut (which will later become a “Merchant” where you can purchase upgrades) and after the cut scene you will get

  </p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Digging in the dirt

  </p>

<p>Go back to the Ring of Stones and defeat the wolves to open the first level and get

  </p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dirty work

  </p>



<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forest Grove

  </p>

<p>This will be your first chance to get “Ranged Only” though I found level 3 to be a good spot to work on this. Of course, you can always get this later by replaying any level. If you’re playing the “Brave” difficulty, you’ll probably want to use your sword to collect as many coins as possible and then replay a level once you’ve upgraded a little bit. I did use Elinor’s paw swipe once during the bear fight, so this attack may not count against the achievement.

  </p>

<p>If you manage to not get hit for a long stretch in this level, you will also get “Impressive” and “Untouchable” here. If not, don’t worry, you’ll easily get these later.

  </p>

<p>Shortly after the level begins, just after the platform that you create by hitting the Earth Charm symbol, you’ll see your first chest. This contains your first Tapestry piece (1/18) getting you

  </p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Carpet runner

  </p>

<p>Soon you will come to an area covered in a purple miasma (or “Blight” as the game will call it). When you get close enough, this triggers an enemy spawn fight. You’ll often encounter these blight sections throughout the game. Once you’ve defeated all of the enemies, the blight will clear and flowers will grow around the Waystone, signifying that the battle is over.

  </p>

<p>You can access the merchant here (as you’ll be able to do for each of these during the game). Access the merchant and purchase your first upgrade to get

  </p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ante Up

  </p>

<p>The other two will come as you earn/grind coins throughout the game and level replays.

  </p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full of power

  </p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gotta snag ‘em all

  </p>

<p>Once you try to pass through the opening, the portcullis will close and after the cut scene, you’ll begin your first “Triplet Puzzle”, which is rather easy (in fact most are not that complex).

  </p>

<p>/s/ Spoiler

  </p>

<p>Select one of the triplets in the top section and move him to the first pressure plate; move the other triplet to the second pressure plate. Move the lower triplet onto the platforms and once he’s on the middle one, move the first triplet to the last pressure plate. Move the lower triplet to the switch and activate it.

  </p>

<p>\s\ 

  </p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Triple H’s

  </p>

<p>When you get to the swamp area, make sure to use your bow to shoot the pods as they will explode if you get to close to them. After the first lip line in the swamp, jump up the small rise to the right, making sure to shoot the pod. Next to the pod is a chest containing Tapestry piece 2/18.

  </p>

<p>During the bear sequence is your first chance to get “Get out of my way,” but if you don’t get it here, you’ll have plenty of chances to get it later.

  </p>

<p>In the castle, you’ll find the Fire Charm

  </p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Toasty

  </p>

<p>/s/ Spoiler

  </p>

<p>Put all three triplets on the second level of the platform on the left of the screen. Use one to pull the bar out enough to rotate the large piece of wood 90º and then move one triplet across and the other onto the wood. Release the pull bar on the left and pull the one on the right. When it’s up all the way, go activate the switch.

  </p>

<p>\s\

  </p>

<p>Once outside, you can jump up to the first ledge area (The second is blocked by spikes for now) to avoid the wolves while you shoot them with your bow. After this, as you climb the wall jump section you’ll set off some way point sensors (the last one is on the ground on the right once you reach the top). This opens a door to the left, which contains a chest holding Tapestry piece 3/18.&nbsp; When you reach the next wall jump section, make sure to double jump up to the left side to get the last chest in this level (Sword 2/7)

  </p>



<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Coastal Cliffs

  </p>

<p>Just follow the path. Ignore the first chest you see; you can’t get it for now, but will come back later in the level. When you get to the fight at the Waystone under the blight, you’ll want to run back to the bridge as you fight, as the enemies won’t cross it. They’ll actually give up and go back once you reach a certain point. Rinse and repeat until you’ve defeated them all, and then return to defeat the rock golem and clear the blight.

  </p>

<p>When you go inside the castle/keep, you’ll cross a draw bridge into a blight. Immediately, once the fighting starts, back onto the drawbridge. If you didn’t take too long or walk too far, it will still be there and the enemies won’t go onto it. You may still have to jump over projectiles from the Rock golem, but you won’t have to for long.

  </p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone knows it’s windy

  </p>

<p>You’ll come back out of the keep near the start of the level. Now, with the Wind Charm, you can get that chest we passed earlier for Tapestry piece 4/18.

  </p>

<p>After the zip line and the exploding enemies, you’ll see a land bridge with a Wind Charm emblem floating over the water to the right of it. Shoot the emblem and follow this path to a chest with Bow 2/7

  </p>

<p>When you get to the part where the rock golem is across the water from you (you’ll have to shoot a Wind Charm emblem to cross over to him), you’ll notice that there are targets behind him (you can simply shoot him from a distance with the Charged Shot earth), after killing him, shoot those targets for a chest with Tapestry piece 5/18.

  </p>

<p>/s/&nbsp; Spoiler

  </p>

<p>Switch to the 2<sup>nd</sup> triplet and pull the lever, lowering the rock platform. Move the 3<sup>rd</sup> triplet onto the pressure switch, raising a wooden platform. Move the 1<sup>st</sup> triplet onto the stone platform, then switch back to the 2<sup>nd</sup> and move him to the pressure switch behind him. You can now move the 1<sup>st</sup> triplet over to the switch. Once activated, this will lower a stone door, allowing the 3<sup>rd</sup> triplet to activate the final switch, completing the puzzle.

  </p>

<p>\s\

  </p>

<p>Once you regain control of Merida, jump across the gap and immediately look to your right; just next to the castle at the edge you’ll see a chest containing Tapestry piece 6/18. This should be unmissable, as you’ll walk past it to progress through the level. If you haven’t gotten “Impressive” and “Untouchable” yet, this is a good place to get it. Once you reach the area with the blight, there will be a lot exploding minions appearing from stone rings that spawn them. If you don’t get it by the end of your play through, this is probably the best place in the game to come back for it later when you’ve upgraded.

  </p>

<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chilled Creek

  </p>

<p>After the first blight / waystone, you’ll enter a cave. Shortly after you begin through the cave, you’ll see some rocks with purple spots on them. Attack these to break them and reveal a chest with Tapestry 7/18. Shortly after that, you’ll encounter another blighted area. After defeating the enemies, you’ll get the final charm, The Ice Charm, unlocking

  </p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ice to see you

  </p>

<p>This is a good level to work on “Ranged only” if you didn’t do so already, because all of the destructible items can be destroyed with the bow. There is nothing that requires the sword here. 

  </p>

<p>You’ll reach an area where you have to shoot moving ice in the water with the Ice Charm equipped to continue. As you do so, keep heading up (toward the top of the screen) and you’ll reach an area with a sigil on the ground and a sealed cave in front of you. Walk over the sigils in a clockwise fashion starting with the one in the 9 o’clock position (you’ll need to climb the platform/rocks) and you’ll open the cave, revealing a chest with Sword 3/7.

  </p>

<p>When you see the next Waystone, you’ll notice another, short, path leading to it from the right of the path you are on. You can turn back onto this path to reach the chest at the end, which has Tapestry piece 8/18. You probably already saw this chest as you took the path leading to the draw bridge and the Waystone.

  </p>

<p>After you “solve” the “puzzle” requiring you to simply stand on two pressure plates, you’ll enter a small keep so that you can obtain a keystone which will allow you to progress through the level. On a platform to the left of this keystone is a chest you likely already notice. It contains Tapestry piece 9/18.

  </p>

<p>/s/ Spoiler

  </p>

<p>Put all three triplets onto the wood, and have one of them pull the lever on the other side of it until the wood turns 90º. Move one of the other triplets to the right to stand on the pressure plate and the other next to the lever on the left. Then, release the first lever and move that triplet back onto the wood.

  </p>

<p>\s\

  </p>

<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Burried Passage

  </p>

<p>After collecting the keystone, you’ll continue right and into a section with a lower and upper path. Take the upper path and shoot the Earth Charm markers. Use them to open the chest and collect your first outfit (3/5).

  </p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My fair lassie

  </p>

<p>During the Elinor section on this level, I simply hit “B” as soon as I gained control and hit 5 enemies for “Get out of my way”.

  </p>

<p>/s/ Spoiler

  </p>

<p>Change to the left most triplet and back up onto the pressure plate. Now, change to the center triplet and walk him over to the pressure plate. Change to the third triplet and use him to pull the lever. Change back to the center triplet and move him to the switch, but don’t activate it yet. Change to the left triplet and pull his lever. Now you can activate the switch with the center triplet to complete the puzzle.

  </p>

<p>\s\

  </p>

<p>Once you regain control of Merida again, move to the left and use the Ice Charm to freeze the floating platforms allowing you to access the chest. Tapestry piece 10/18.

  </p>

<p>When you encounter the first rock golem as you search for the keystone, you’ll notice a chest glowing in a small cave along the wall at the top of your screen containing Tapestry piece 11/18.

  </p>

<p>When you reach the next waystone, you’ll see the distinctive glow of a chest above it on the screen. You’ll need to follow the Ice Charm platforms to the little rock island about it and shoot the Wind Charm emblem to reach it and Bow 3/7.

  </p>

<p>Then, use the Launchpad to get to one of the most difficult boss battles of the game. When you get to the next Launchpad, which takes you right to the giant rock golem (The rock golem guardian), you’ll want to have your Earth Charm selected, so that you can attack with your little minions. Do your best to avoid the boars and focus on the floating rings so that they stop spawning boars. Don’t try to dodge the rocks that the troll throws; instead jump up when they land to avoid the blast radius. Don’t get too close to the troll, either, as he’ll stomp you. He’ll take you out with only 1 or 2 hits, so be careful. He takes a lot of damage, so you’ll do a fair amount of running and hiding from him as you continuously shoot him with your bow and charged shot. Expect to replay this part a lot. When you finally defeat him and clear the blight, you’ll get

  </p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taking out the trash

  </p>



<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Swamp of Shadows

  </p>

<p>Shortly after the first waystone, you’ll come to a puzzle of concentric circles on the ground, stand on the pressure plate and the black circles will begin rotating. Shoot the target when they’re lined up so that they rotate together. Once they line up with the green circles, a chest will appear containing Tapestry piece 12/18.

  </p>

<p>When you regain control of Merida after the fight as Elinor, jump up the rises on the top left of the screen and shoot the targets to reveal a chest containing Sword 4/7.

  </p>

<p>Shortly after that, right after you shoot 3 Wind Charm emblems to reveal platforms to cross the swamp, you’ll see a glowing chest on the upper left. Jump up the rises and shoot the pods, then open the chest for Tapestry piece 13/18.

  </p>

<p>As you continue along the path, you’ll have a short cut scene with Mor’du. You should be able to see a glowing chest on a small island just off of the path ahead of you after this; it contains Bow 4/7.

  </p>

<p>After clearing the blight at the next waystone, you’ll cross the swamp and see both a Wind Charm and Fire Charm emblem. Shoot the Wind Charm emblem floating above the water in the cave and go stand on the sigil to open the gate blocking the chest. Then go open the chest for Tapestry piece 14/18.

  </p>

<p>/s/ Spoiler

  </p>

<p>Move one of the lower triplets over to the lever and pull it so that the cart moves to the middle target. Have the triplet up top activate the switch, which will power up the ballista on the cart and shoot the middle target, causing the first and third platforms to move. Now, move the third triplet onto the middle platform, activate the switch again, and move the third triplet to the final switch.

  </p>

<p>\s\

  </p>

<p>Depending on how you’re spending your money, you’ll probably get “Full of power” during this level.

  </p>

<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Murky Chasm

  </p>

<p>From the start, go as far right as you can, following the edge until you get to the Fergus coin container. Jump up to it and then wall jump to activate the sigils. When you reach the top and activate the last sigil, a door will slide open, revealing a chest with Tapestry piece 15/18.

  </p>

<p>After activating the keystone, you’ll jump up and come to a section with water. You’ll see three sets of sigils to the right. One of the sigils on the wall will be lit up; stand on the corresponding sigil on the ground. The lit sigil will change when you do this, so stand on each of the ground sigils in turn to reveal a chest containing Bow 5/7.

  </p>

<p>After the next waystone is cleared, a cut scene will show a stone fall to make a bridge. Cross the bridge and jump up to the left, but before continuing on, jump up to the right and follow the rock outcroppings to a stone bridge with a chest on the end containing Sword 5/7.

  </p>

<p>/s/ Spoiler

  </p>

<p>Move the first (left most triplet) back to the pressure plate. Then move the other triplets to pull their respective levers until the black rings line up like in the earlier puzzle. Then have the first triplet activate the swtich.

  </p>

<p>\s\

  </p>

<p>After the triplet puzzle, you’ll reach another blighted area. After clearing the area, hit the Earth and Wind Charm emblems, and then climb up to the green platform between the rocks. You’ll want to go right from here, though you may have to double jump from the left one to get onto the right rock. Jump from this to a rock outcropping that has a chest that contains Outfit 4/5.

  </p>

<p>After the next waystone, you’ll come to an area where you play again as Elinor. This is where I unlocked “Mum’s the word.” Once you regain control of Merida, shoot the Wind Charm emblem floating over by a lip line. Jump onto the new platform and onto a platform against the wall. It may seem like you won’t reach at first, but it’s there directly behind the floating platform. Climb up the wall and go left, past the zip line and you’ll see a cave with a chest in it. This chest contains Tapestry 16/18, which completes your first Tapestry.

<p>Take the zipline down, activate the other charm platforms, and continue to follow the path until you reach the end of the level where you’ll face the Harpy Guardian. Once again, your bow and Charged Shot – earth are your friends. Watch out for her attacks because they do area damage. She will also spawn both birds and the little goblins that spew vomit on you. These little guys might be difficult to see with the game zoomed out, so be careful. Defeat her to unlock

<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frozen Loch

  </p>

<p>Once the level starts, turn around and go left until you get to the rocks with purple slashes on them. Break the rock and open the chest to obtain Tapestry piece 17/18.

  </p>

<p>After the waystone, you’ll cross some water to an island with six sigils on the ground. These you have to walk on in the correct order. I’ll number them clockwise 1-6, with 3 being the leftmost near the target and 4 being the rightmost near the target. Walk over them in this order: 3, 6, 5, 2, 1, 4. Then open the chest that appears for Sword 6/7.

  </p>

<p>Follow the floating ice platforms you make with the Ice Charm clockwise to the ice island and shoot the three targets to make another chest appear. Open it to get Tapestry piece 18/18.

  </p>

<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Wall to wall carpeting

  </p>

<p>When floating across on the iceberg, I’d recommend using Charged shot: fire and shooting to the right when floating. Get as much damage done to the ice peaks that block you as you can before the iceberg stops and enemies start appearing. You’ll have to deal with a constant stream of enemies as well as trying to destroy up to three of these peaks at a time.

  </p>

<p>Just after you play as Elinor, you’ll come to an area with a Triplet puzzle. As you’re walking to this area, you’ll notice a door in the distance; to the right of this door (it opens when you solve the Triplet puzzle) is a chest that contains Bow 6/7.

  </p>

<p>/s/ Spoiler

  </p>

<p>Move one triplet over to the lever (this will move the cart with the ballista on it). Use the next triplet to activate the switch which fires the ballista, making sure to fire at the targets. You can aim at each target individually, or because it fires twice with a pause between, you can aim it at one target, change triplets, and move the ballista towards the next target. Once you’ve created a path, use one of the triplets to jump across the arrows to the switch above and activate it.

  </p>

<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ancient Kingdom

  </p>

<p>After the cutscene with Mor’du, you’ll enter a puzzle room. It’s rather simple, like the rest of the game’s puzzles. Stand on the pressure pads, shoot the targets, and walk on the sigils. One of the areas has two brambles with Fire charm emblems on them. Shoot these and enter to walk on the sigil there and open up the chest with the last sword in it (Sword 7/7).

  </p>

  </p>

<p>Right after the first waystone, you’ll find the final Triplet puzzle.

  </p>

<p>/s/ Spoiler

  </p>

<p>Move the left triplet onto the pressure plate. Next, move the middle triplet onto the pressure plate in his section. Then move the right triplet onto his pressure plate. Move the middle triplet forward onto the stone, then use the left triplet up to pull the lever, lifting the middle triplet. Move the middle triplet onto the next stone and have the right triplet lift him up again by pulling the lever on the right. Finally, have the middle triplet activate the switch to complete the final Triplet puzzle.

  </p>

<p>After the triplet puzzle, you’ll be in an area with a gate in front of you and two targets above it. When you get to the gate, you’ll see 4 sigils on the wall to the right; the third sigil will be lit up. Shoot the left target to activate the first sigil, the shoot the right target to move the “cursor” to the second sigil and shoot the left target again. Shoot the right target twice to select the final sigil, then shoot the left target to complete this puzzle and open the gate. Open the chest to get Bow 7/7.

  </p>

  </p>

<p>After this is a waypoint; if you haven’t purchased it already, purchase the dodge ability. You’ll need it for the final chest. Or, you can go after it later when you replay this level to grind coins. After you turn the next corner, you’ll see another gate in the distance. There will be a pressure plate which will lower a stone that opens the gate. However, boulders will roll down the stairs right at you (double jump over them) and the gate will lower quickly once you get off of the pressure plate. Once it’s up all of the way, repeatedly dodge to get into the gate before it lowers too far to let you in.&nbsp; Open the final chest in the game for Outfit 5/5.

<p>You’ll face off against four Guardians in order to defeat Mor’du. Luckily, after you’ve defeated a guardian, the game gives you a checkpoint, so even if you die facing one, you won’t have to fight them all over again; you’ll just face off against the guardian that killed you. You can use the charged shots for the elements that the guardians are weak against, but I had an easier time just using Charged Shot Earth against them all. Each one will take you a few tries as you fight and try to avoid the minions that they spawn as you attempt to destroy the guardians themselves. They should be the real focus of your attacks; only kill the other enemies when necessary to keep yourself alive. After you defeat a guardian, a pillar will appear in front of you. Destroy it to proceed to the next guardian.

  </p>

<p>The first guardian is the Ice Wolf guardian. He is weak against the Fire Charm. You can use this, if you’ve upgraded the Charged shot: fire enough, or use the fully upgraded Charged Shot: earth.

  </p>

<p>Next is the Fire Boar guardian, who is weak against ice. It’s been suggested that, when fighting the Fire Boar guardian, you keep near the edge of the platform and just walk off before he can hit you with a charging run. I personally never had success with that tactic, despite the fall doing less damage than the Fire Boar guardian (mostly because I just seemed to respawn right where he was and got attacked by him anyways), but if this works for you, use it. This is probably the most difficult of the four guardians.

  </p>

<p>The third guardian is the Harpy guardian, which we faced earlier. Just use the same tactics that you used the first time you fought her, and be careful because the ground has been split apart.

  </p>

<p>The final guardian is our favorite pain: the Rock Golem guardian. The broken ground has now been separated; work your way up to the Rock Golem guardian as quickly as you can and finish him off.

  </p>

<p>Once you’ve defeated him and destroyed the pillar, Mor’du will be defeated.

<p>Clean Up

  </p>

<p>Now, it’s time to grind coins and kills. Go into the difficulty and change the game to Easy. Then replay the last level up to the check point after you play as Elinor. Keep purchasing upgrades, switch between Charms, and make sure to use your Charged shot as much as possible and the power attack whenever you’ve earned it. You’ll have to replay this level several times, but it won’t take too long.</p>
