<p>All of the sudden in event viewer I started receiving:</p>

<h2>            wmiprvse.exe running constantly</h2>
                    wmiprvse.exe is using all my CPU cycles. I have tried running my AVG virus checker and SpeedyPC software, and nothing has changed. How can I stop this CPU hog? Running Windows XP Professional, SP3, all updates installed. Tried stoppin the process in Task
 Manager, and it comes right back. Thanks for your help.

            <p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp; None of the articles or links fixed the problem. Several of them wanted to sell me programs, which also doesn't help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally replaced the wmiprvse.exe file in \wbem with one from a previous XP update, and so far the problem is fixed.&nbsp; Fingers crossed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help, tho.</p>

<h3> majorbeernut  say:</h3>
<h2>            need help with wired connection</h2>
                    
<p>I just changed to a Netgear WNDR4000.&nbsp; I can connect wireless but not wired.&nbsp; I tried setting auto and manual IP's etc even tried copying those from the wireless connection data, but I can't get it to connect through the wire.&nbsp; I assume this has to be a
 router setting, but I am not having any luck getting this set up.&nbsp; When I use auto settings wired&nbsp;I get a funky IP I assume from the provider as if I were connecting straight to the modem instead of&nbsp;one&nbsp;assigned by the router, as well as no DNS settings and
 I can't seem to make the router assign one to the xbox.&nbsp; What setup on this router am I missing to connect via the ethernet port?</p>

                    I had a problem with Windows and had to recover it, it worked and created the Windows.Old folder! as I have little space on my pc he asked to activate something called a storage sensor, I did not accept it, but when I went back up my data from Windows.Old
 folder, it simply disappeared! And I had seen the files in this folder, but after I did the backup they disappeared! I'm desperate, I had important files, I downloaded EaseUs, Recuva but it did not help! What should I do?

            Turns out the touchpad was disabled. I've enabled it again but now only the top, right left of the touchpad works. It won't let me copy and paste and will only click on things if I click from the top left. Do you have any ideas on why this is doing this?
 As this never happened until I downloaded Windows 10.

<h2>            The Desktop Window Manager has encountered a fatal error &#40;0x8898009b&#41; - Windows 7 pro</h2>
                    I get the error "The Desktop Window Manager has encountered a fatal error (0x8898009b)" in Windows 7 pro - when the machine comes out of sleep. The video card is an AMD 760G (intergrated video) - the system is a Shuttle SA76G2 (little shoebox pc) and the
 cpu installed is an AMD Phenom II X4 940 3 GHz. After the error - Aero is disabled and nothing (including restarting DWM) will turn it back on - sans rebooting.<br />
<br />
Aero is fine - very smooth etc, and generally works fine until the machine goes to sleep.<br />
<br />
Anyone else run into this? What is the solution?

<p><span><span>Hi</span><span>
<span>AngelWorks,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Firstly I would suggest you to update the Video card driver from the manufacturer’s website and check if that help.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.amd.com/us/Pages/AMDSupportHub.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.amd.com/us/Pages/AMDSupportHub.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To know more methods for updating drivers follow the link given below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If updating drivers do no resolve the issue you may also put the computer in clean boot state, as at times some third party programs tend to conflict
 while returning from sleep mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind
 of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>The steps to be performed in clean boot are given below:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is
 unavailable.)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting,
 and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points. Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once you boot to the desktop check if the issue persists, follow the steps given in the article and figure out which of the program is causing the
 issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For further information on clean boot please follow the below given link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.

            So I upgraded to the latest ATI catalyst driver, but that didn't seem to solve anything. Its a brand new install (nothing installed) but I'll run through msconfig. I think its a driver bug - can you confirm or deny?

            <p>I have this same problem since upgrading to Windows 7 Ultimate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been&nbsp;getting around this by setting Sleep to never and then in Advanced Options setting a Hibernate After time so that if I do walk away and don't get back in a reasonable time it
 will Hibernate which does recover fine with no loss of the Desktop Window Manager or Aero effects.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After fighting this for 3 weeks I made a new discovery just yesterday.&nbsp; I mistakenly got Sleep enabled again and after a return had lost DWM, Aero Peek, and Tranparency.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't know why but I decided to see if going to Hibernate and back would re-enable
 DWM.&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn't on the return BUT executing&nbsp; from DOS ...&nbsp; NET START UXSMS did actually successfully restart the DWM for the first time ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I now have the following batch file on my Desktop that I can quickly execute after a forced Hibernate should I accidentally get into Sleep mode and lose the DWM.&nbsp;&nbsp; This&nbsp;is faster (about 1 min) than a full restart (3 min or more)&nbsp;but not nearly as nice a
 Sleep recovery (7 sec).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DWM_Restart.bat&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>@echo ****************************************************************************<br />
@echo *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>@echo *&nbsp; You must start this with a Right Click and select Run as administrator&nbsp;
<br />
@echo *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
@echo ****************************************************************************<br />
@net stop uxsms<br />
@net start uxsms<br />
@pause<br />
@exit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it appears that something... no idea what ... actually requires a full power down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suspect it might be the graphics adapter driver that may require a full restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; This leads me to ask of anyone reading this&nbsp;string .....&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any Windows Tool or DOS command that can force a full adapter reset without a power cycle?&nbsp;</p>

            I sort of found an answer to my question.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I found pointers to an image called Newdisp.exe that supposedly will unload/reload the display driver and is supposed to be in the Windows DDK but after doing a full install of&nbsp;
<span>WDK 7600.16385.1</span><span>&nbsp; the image was nowhere to be found.</span>

            <p>I haven't found NEWDISP.EXE but I have found that the Device Manager will Unload and Reload the graphics driver.&nbsp;&nbsp; This does not fix the problem with DWM though as it still&nbsp;will not restart after unloading and reloading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This leads me to believe that the problem is not with the graphics driver.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;It sure would be nice if the DWM.EXE would produce a dump when it stops.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe someone could track down the problem if it did.</p>

            I have this same problem, but I'm not just losing window transparency, once Desktop Windows Manager fails after coming back from sleep, several of my applications have huge problems that all seem to relate to screen repainting. I've confirmed that it the
 cause of the problems I've been having with: Visual Studio 2010, Quickbooks 2010, IE9. I think it also affects Windows Media Player.<br />
<br />
This is a HUGE problem! It is unbelievable to me that this problem hasn't been resolved in the years since its been reported. And no, telling people to disable sleep mode isn't an acceptable answer.<br />
<br />
I purchased a new Video Card earlier this week hoping to solve the problem, it didn't. I did upgrade the drivers of both video cards to the latest. No difference.<br />
<br />
Is anyone else experiencing problems with the above Apps?<br />

    <title>Windows 10 File History - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 File History</h2>
                    <p>Is File History going away or no longer going to be supported ?</p>
<p>I've read several web blogs that suggest that this may be the case very soon.</p>
<p>Can you confirm this ?</p>
<p>If File History is in fact going away or will no longer be supported, does Microsoft plan to replace it with another product ?</p>
<p>If so, what would that product name be and does Microsoft have an anticipated release date ?</p>

            No, there aren't, Microsoft is phasing out a lot of the built in features and encouraging customers to go to third party solutions like Macrium Reflect free.

            <p>Hi Lee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you further,&nbsp;I would like to ask some&nbsp;questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>How are you&nbsp;trying to import&nbsp;photos?</li><li>Are you using Photos App?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned in the post that the system was working fine before, I suggest you to perform a System Restore by following the steps provided below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the login screen, hold the “Shift” key and click on <strong>power icon</strong> and click on
<strong>Restart</strong>.</li><li>Click on Troubleshoot&gt;Advanced Options.</li><li>Click on <strong>System Restore</strong> and follow the prompts to restore the system.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while system restoring. During
 System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead to loss of important
 files as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            WHS 2011 full client restore fails 0xC0000025</h2>
                    <p>I have tried to restore a laptop (Windows 7 x64) that has just got a replacement disk (old one failed). I have tried using a bootable USB disk created today via the WHS DashBoard. I have also tried using the bootable restore CD that came with the product.
 In both cases, the restore continues for about 50 minutes and then 5 minutes from when it says it will complte - bang! The restore&nbsp;fails with 0xC0000025 at address 0xff6fd66d (for the USB process, the program was ClientRestoreWizard_Fresh.exe).</p>
<p>My WHS 2011 system is fully up to date with Microsoft fixes. The network is fine as it wouldn't have restored data for the first 50 or so minutes.</p>
<p>Can anyone give me a solution (that doesn't depend on removing the disk drive, buying some enclosure and restoring from another PC)?</p>
<p>How can WHS 2011 be of any use if all it can do is backup but can not restore? In the UK, it would fail the Trade Description Act as not being "fit for purpose".</p>
<p>BTW - Someone has mentioned that booting from the USB and using the UEFI USB boot worked for them. However, this laptop has no options to set (UEFI or not UEFI) and it wouldn't apply to the bootable CD.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;I feel your pain!&nbsp; Aparently others do too.&nbsp; See</p>
<p><a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/whs2011/thread/0cee8cbe-617b-4844-aa29-217b6380bcd6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/whs2011/thread/0cee8cbe-617b-4844-aa29-217b6380bcd6</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Personally I've been using Norton Ghost for backups on many computers and never had the first problem with it in 8 years.&nbsp; When you recover from your current situation, you might want to give it a try.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>CNET has a lot of backup program reviews at </p>

<p>Some of these are free (last time I checked there were over 300), some have free trials (over 1000), and some are purchase only (over 200).</p>

<p>I hope this helps. Good luck</p>

            Thank you but, unfortunately, knowing that others feel pain doesn't fill me with joy - I am not like that.
<div><br />
<div>I migrated from a perfectly good WHS V1 to WHS 2011 because of the hassle of restoring x64 systems using V1. &nbsp;Now to find WHS 2011 does not&nbsp;fulfil a major raison d'être for its existence is a major stumbling block. &nbsp;Microsoft must fix this.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am also sorry that I do not want to use other products unless they do at least 3 things:</div>
<div>1. Can backup to the WHS 2011 server (I can just use it as a "server", and</div>
<div>2. Ensure no duplication (with 3 PCs and 4 laptops all running Windows and &nbsp;MS Office and my children having their music on their PCs and laptops), I can't afford for multiple copies of the same files,</div>
<div>3. Backups are taken automatically (can't rely on my children remembering until they want a file restored!).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I could probably come up with another 10 requirements.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If WHS 2011 could restore, then I would continue with it. &nbsp;If it can't, then ......</div>

            <p>&nbsp;I can say Ghost could handle your 1 &amp; 3 requirements; don't know about the other 10.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; I don't think it could handle 2, but when you can buy up to 4 TB hard drives these days, I'm not so sure how concerned I'd be about that one.&nbsp; I bought a 2 TB external
 drive about 6 months ago for $80; although prices have gone up since then, but they're still under $150 and slowly coming back down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you can get MS to come up with a resolution, more power to you.&nbsp; I hope you do, but I've seen a lot of folks try and fail with the Windows 7 and earlier versions of their backup programs.&nbsp; I simply don't have the time or energy to fight this battle.&nbsp;
 I need something that I can always rely on, and what I have has served me flawlesly for the last 8 years.&nbsp; Since you're backing up your business files, I'd think reliability would be very important to you too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

            Thanks but the error message says it is an Application Error - hence MS need to fix their application.
<div><br />
<div>I never said I backed up business files. In fact, I specifically mentioned my children and their files. &nbsp;WHS is Windows "Home" Server. If I wanted it for my business, I would probably pick something completely different but I am a (very technical) home
 user.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I were a business user, I would probably have a support contract with MS and pay them to fix their own code - but I am not and could not afford such luxuries.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now if only MS would look at these entries :-(</div>

            <p>I know this is an old thread but the 50 minute thing sounds like the same problem I had a few years ago with WHS 2011. The problem comes when the network lease runs out. WHS 2011 freaks out when its lease runs out and instead of just renewing it and carrying
 on, it fails. (GJ Microsoft....)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to set your DHCP server to renew your lease after 12 hours or more, to allow for very large restores to have enough time to complete. Techies can do it pretty easy, for non techies you should get your router's make (Netgear, DLink, etc) then google
 this: </p>
<p>Netgear set dhcp lease time</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replace Netgear with your router's name. Set the lease time for more than 12 hours (43200 seconds). Then restart your computer to be restored and try the process again. WHS has multiple other issues that need to be addressed and can cause failed restores
 too, but this is the big one for the 50 minute restore problem. Hope that helps someone.

<p>
</p><p>The day before yesterday, I was playing on my computer (MSI GE62 Apache pro 2QD) when it completely froze, the clock was not moving, nor the characters. The only thing not frozen was the music. i was forced to "smother" my computer by turning it off pressing
 the power button. The following day I turned on my computer and the Aptio setup utility showed up, before anything else, I wasn't even allowed to put my password in because the moment it turned on I was on the utility page. And every time I try to exit or
 save &amp; reset, I am sent back to this page. Can anyone help me?</p>

            <p>Hi Eric, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would request you to place the computer in clean boot and then check if it helps.

            <p>Hi Jessen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you don't understand the problem.&nbsp; Eric only has access to the BIOS setup utility.&nbsp; Obviously he can't get to Windows to perform a clean boot.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to find a solution for this problem for a friend's MSI GE62 Apache pro 2QD.&nbsp; After a couple of hours searching, it seems there is no solution.&nbsp; There are literally hundreds of people asking about this problem.&nbsp; None of the proposed solutions
 worked for me.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can run Windows setup from a thumb drive but then he will lose all of his work which defeats the whole purpose.&nbsp; Frankly, a setup utility that can't preserve existing files is clumsy, to be as polite as possible.&nbsp; But that is another issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get to DOS and copy his files but he needs his computer to use some specialty software on it.&nbsp; The BIOS can see his hard disk but won't boot off of it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you&nbsp;or anyone here have any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Tim Litten</p>

<p>Billy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can help with Android syncing but I do not know what you mean by "syncing" to a speaker.&nbsp; If you mean how can you connect your Bluetooth speakers then
</p>
<ul>
<li>see the speaker instructions for how to turn on its <em>I want to connect</em> signal then
</li><li>go to Settings, Devices, Bluetooth to turn on Bluetooth then </li><li>click on Add Bluetooth or other device.&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>It should then detect and "pair" up&nbsp; with the speakers automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use <a href="http://www.fjsoft.at/en/home.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>It works directly between Outlook and the Android.&nbsp; <em>No Outlook.com Calendar needs to be brought into the picture.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I use it to sync using any of these types of connection</p>
<ul>
<li>USB lead from the phone to the computer,</li><li>The phone's WiFi hotspot</li><li>Through my network router [if the phone happens to be connected to my network at the time]</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I think it is the best sync software around.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It can also give you easy access to your phone's SMS messages, Call history &amp; other contents.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>See their <a href="http://www.fjsoft.at/forum/viewtopic.php?t=11454" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 - otherwise go to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fjsoft.myphoneexplorer.client&amp;hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>You must have installed&nbsp;the phone's drivers on your computer beforehand to be able to use a USB connection.&nbsp;
<em>In my case, HTC provide the drivers within their HTC Sync Mgr software so I install that [then uninstall it and it leaves the drivers behind].</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also use MPE to set up specific folders to sync with each other quite outside of Outlook.&nbsp; So, for example,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; I sync&nbsp;some folders containing key files between the computer&nbsp;&amp; the Android - for some of these folders, I set up the option to sync between the folders whilst for others I deliberately set up the option to regard the computer copies as the master copies
 and to overwrite the versions on the Android.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 &nbsp;I use&nbsp;MPE to "sync" audio files to the Android.&nbsp; I normally do this manually but the relevant folders can easily be included in the automatic sync folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3&nbsp; I use MPE to transfer SMS messages from both my phones onto the computer.&nbsp; I also find MPE's user interface the most convenient one for working through deleting redundant SMS messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4&nbsp; I also use it to&nbsp;transfer photos from both my phones onto the computer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use your phone to connect to the internet then you might find my <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/37ef1fe0-272b-483f-a1bc-709a5e083506?threadId=2b55e375-801a-4b0d-b67d-7c181fb79667">

<h2>            Windows 7 upgrade failed, can&#39;t restart without pressing F3</h2>
                    <br />
I tried to upgrade from Vista 64-bit Home Premium to Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium.&nbsp; I bought the software from Staples so it's licensed.<br />
<br />
The upgrade didn't successfully complete.&nbsp; There's a black screen after Windows starts running.<br />
<br />
The only way to boot my laptop is to hit F3 at start-up, select Windows 7 and choose Safe Mode.&nbsp; But I can't reinstall Windows 7 in Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
How can I correct this problem?<br />
<br />

            <p>Please see the following instructions thanks to Amrita M, Microsoft Support, Moderator:</p>
<p>...you may check if you are able to boot in safe mode. To boot in safe mode first remove the Windows 7 DVD from the drive and press F8 key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Check if you are able to boot to the desktop now. If you are able to boot to the desktop without any error message, go to device manager and disable the display adapters and check if you are able to boot into normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you get an error message saying that ‘installation cannot be completed in safe mode’, then press Shift+F10 key. That will open Command Prompt, from command prompt open Device Manager by typing ‘devmgmt.msc’ in the command prompt and then disable the display
 adapters and check if you are able to boot in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If this allows you to boot to the normal mode and complete the installation process then go ahead and first update the display adapter drivers from the manufacturer’s website and check if the computer works fine.</p>
<p>If that does not work<br />
Try rolling back the installation, this require that you power down the system.<br />
Turn it on a again and select the option to rollback the installation to Windows Vista</p>
<p>1. Disable any security software before attempting to upgrade or do a clean install.<br />
2. Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications)<br />
3. Disconnect any external devices before installing.<br />
4. Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Account Control permission<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</p>
<p>Also run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor:<br />

<p>
</p><p>I've been using the Windows 10 Insider Preview for a few months and today when I checked for new updates I downloaded the "Security Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB3074683)" which came out on 27/7/2015. However upon restarting my PC a message
 in the bottom right of the screen appeared saying something along the lines of "Could not finish installing updates". Other updates worked fine but I have tried this one over 20 times and I get the same issue every time. This is particularly frustrating as
 I do believe that it is preventing me from having the latest build. Is there any way to fix this or install the update manually? Thanks.</p>

    <title>Unable to connect a new Windows 10 PC to a pre-existing HomeGroup that - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to connect a new Windows 10 PC to a pre-existing HomeGroup that was set up via a different &#40;still used&#41; Windows 8 PC.</h2>
                    <p>If anyone can help it would be hugely appreciated. I hope I can articulate this in a comprehensible manner!<br />
<br />
I have just purchased a new Windows 10 desktop for my wife, to replace an older device that was performing badly.<br />
<br />
I am still using a trusty old Windows 8.1 system that I am perfectly happy with. I set up a HomeGroup with my own PC several years ago. My wife's older device, and other devices used by both our daughters, still connect to the HomeGroup without issue.<br />
<br />
Since switching my wife over to her new Windows 10 device, I cannot connect this PC to the HomeGroup. When I navigate to her Network Settings, there does not appear to be any option to join a HomeGroup (there is no HomeGroup or HomeGroup option displayed).
 I checked the Windows Firewall and HomeGroup appears in the list of features but was unchecked. Despite checking this feature and saving this amendment, I observe no change in symptoms.<br />
<br />
Also (possibly related)?<br />
<br />
My own device appears in the list of devices in the Network section of her File Navigation window. Years ago I set up a UID and Password for my wife to access my device. This has been working without issue until now. Having switched to her new Windows 10 device,
 if I click on my own device (from her Network Devices list), a pop up window prompts for a password. Despite using the correct UID &amp; PWD the credentials are not accepted/recognized. I wonder if this maybe a consequence of not being able to join the HomeGroup
 first? <br />
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance to any kind soul who may be able to assist.</p>

            Hi Dean
<br />
<br />In Version 1803 of Windows 10, Microsoft suddenly and without explanation removed the Homegroup functionality from Windows 10
<br />
<br />
<br />On the Windows 10 device, make the following changes:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Services and hit Enter
<br />
<br />When the Services app opens, scroll down to find the following services, then double click each one in turn, set their startup type to Automatic and start the service if necessary
<br />
<br />1. Function Discovery Provider Host
<br />
<br />2. Function Discovery Resource Publication
<br />
<br />3. SSDP Discovery
<br />
<br />4. UPnP Device Host
<br />
<br />Save that and close the Services app
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If you get a Network Credentials popup, you should be able to turn off that requirement . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel 
<br />
<br />Go to Network and Sharing Center 
<br />
<br />Select Change advanced sharing settings in the left pane 
<br />
<br />Expand the network you want to disable password protected sharing on by clicking the down arrow on the right of the profile
<br />
<br />Select 'Turn off password protected sharing' and then click Save changes.       
        </p>

            Hi Dave,<br />
<br />
Thank you so much for taking time out of YOUR day to help me with MY problem. I cannot thank you enough. I was just about&nbsp; to turn in for the night when I noticed a message saying you'd replied, so felt I had better say thank you. I will follow your guidance
 tomorrow morning.<br />
<br />
Thanks again - you're a star! :-)&nbsp; <br />

<p>Hello Dave,<br />
</p>
<p>I finally got round to trying your suggested actions. I have amended all four services to 'Automatic' and all four are running.<br />
<br />
When I launch the Network Sharing Center and click to change advanced sharing settings, see a panel with the heading:<br />
<br />
"Change sharing options for different network profiles".<br />
<br />
Under this are three expandable sections:<br />
<br />
Private<br />
Guest or Public (current profile)<br />
All Networks<br />
<br />
The only one of these sections that presents an option to "Turn off password protected sharing" is 'All Networks'. So, I have done this.<br />
<br />
Sadly it has made no difference whatsoever to our situation. I cannot even see a 'HomeGroup' as an option to connect-to, and when I try to access my own PC from my wife's File Explorer (Network), I am prompted to enter a password for my wife's ID. I enter the
 correct password for her ID on my PC and the credentials are not accepted/recognized.
<br />
<br />
Rebooted and still no change. Very frustrating! :-(<br />
<br />
