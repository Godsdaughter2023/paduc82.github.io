            Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
By your post what we understand is that Vista doesn't recognize the network card driver or is not compatible. Is that right?<br />
<br />
Check if there&nbsp;is any exclamation mark on any of the items in the device manager.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Open-Device-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Open-Device-Manager</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
To check if the device is compatible with Vista, please visit this link:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/compatibility/windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/compatibility/windows-vista/</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
To download the latest driver for the device, visit either the device manufacturer website or the system manufacturer website.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Check this link for more information:<br />

<h2>            Pro 4 Screen shakes on startup</h2>
                    My whole screen goes into double vision/shaking upon start up.&nbsp; Not all of the time, but quite a bit.&nbsp; Sometimes it goes away on its own, sometimes restarting solves the problem.&nbsp; Does anyone else have this problem and how can I solve it.&nbsp; Already checked
 for updates and read about the patch, but apparently haven't gotten the patch yet?

            <p>Hi Shane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Have you attempted to reinstall the graphics driver? If not, here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the start button, and click on <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Display adapters</strong>, and right click on Intel HD 520.</li><li>Select uninstall, then restart your device.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we recommend that you perform a two-button shutdown. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then release it.</li><li>Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds, and then release both.
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.
</li><li>After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds. </li><li>Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

    <title>kinect hand gestures on&#47;off switch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> big sui  say:</h3>
<h2>            kinect hand gestures on&#47;off switch</h2>
                    
<p>I have my XBOX ONE set up in the living room and I am using the HDMI pass through with my cable box. I also have small kids and one of the things they do is flail their arms around needlessly. Which sets off the onscreen controls for stop/play and rewind.
 Which I can not control since the xbox is paying attention to my children and not their frantically screaming father yelling, "Xbox, stop listening!"</p>
<p>I would like to know if there is a way to turn this off and if there isn't that it be considered for a future update. &nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Basically, when I first installed windows 10 (unclean install) everything worked amazingly without any hiccups, including game DVR. now, no matter what ive tried, it always comes up with this message</p>
<p>
</p><p>(cant record right now, try again later) video</p>
<p>(cant save the screenshot, try again later) screenshot</p>
<p>
</p><p>everything was working until I stupidly launched ms update and threw caution to the wind. its not like its been out for ages though. Im running a GTX 970, and "the game dvr function worked perfectly before the updates".</p>

=============================================<br />
If the files in question had been edited in Windows Live Photo <br />
Gallery the following info may be useful:<br />
<br />
When you edit a photo with Windows Live Photo Gallery it <br />
saves a copy of the original file (this is how it can revert to the <br />
original version).<br />
<br />
You can find the folder at the following path:<br />
<br />
C:\Users\%Username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows <br />
Photo Gallery\Original Images<br />
<br />
Good luck...<br />

    <title>Surface Pro 2 system issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardwwhite  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 2 system issues</h2>
                    <p>I am running a Surface Pro 2 with build 17134.167.&nbsp; There is an external USB HUB with a Dell monitor, mouse and audio connected to the HUB.&nbsp; After the last 1803 update, the display driver fails to load and the external display is not recognized, although
 it works.&nbsp; The Control Panel Device Manager also shows that the unit is not recognized as a Surface model with the keyboard and unit displaying caution icons.&nbsp; Associated drivers imply that they are for a Surface Pro 4.&nbsp; The system appears to work, but it
 has issues.&nbsp; All updates have been through automatic updates, so I do not understand the Surface Pro 4 designations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to update drivers when allowed and that fails with the system telling me that the installed drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I doomed to perform a reinstall, or is there another solution.&nbsp; Evidentially I have no recovery files, although I am sure that I made some.</p>

<div>You can download a recovery image - </div>
<div>Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; (with a</div>
<div>different Windows computer if yours is not working properly)&nbsp; and download a</div>
<div>recovery image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick formatted FAT32.</div>
<div>Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:</div>
<div>Step 1:&nbsp; &nbsp; Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power</div>
<div>button for 30 seconds).</div>
<div>Step 2:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 3:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the</div>
<div>power button on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 4:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.</div>
<div>Step 5:&nbsp; &nbsp; When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</div>
<div>Step 6:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of</div>
<div>the screen.</div>
<div>Step 7:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This</div>
<div>refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.</div>
<div>Step 8:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.</div>
<div>Step 9:&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Choose Just remove my files.</div>
<div>Step 10:&nbsp; &nbsp; Select Reset.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process</div>
<div>continues (this can take a while).</div>

<p>Interestingly enough, my system restore function is enabled, but when I attempt to restore, the system tells me that there are no restore points.&nbsp; Seems unlikely, but does the 1803 build delete old points?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the system is working, just acting strangely at times. It won't detect an external monitor, but the monitor works.&nbsp; I just can't change resolution or other functions.&nbsp; Likewise it can't detect the keyboard cover, but it works as well.&nbsp; It also doesn't
 recognize the tablet, which is strange.&nbsp; When I look at the drivers, they appear to be for a Surface Pro 4 and I believe that is part of the problem since mine is a Pro 2.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I can't refresh the drivers because the system indicates that they are
 up to date.&nbsp; There is no .msi program available for the Pro 2, so reloading the Pro 2 drivers would be painstaking with little guarantee that I'd catch all of them.</p>
<p>

<p>Sorry, never answered your question earlier regarding the SDT.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I executed the SDT and left it running.&nbsp; When I returned some time later, it had completed and requested a reboot.&nbsp; Upon completion of that, things hadn't changed.&nbsp; &nbsp;Things worked,
 but the drivers were still incorrect.&nbsp; These are mature drivers for this product and I'm confused as to why they should have changed that much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as reloading a new image, I'm concerned that if the update loaded the incorrect drivers, why should I expect the refreshed image to do anything different.&nbsp; I'm under the impression that Microsoft has forsaken the Pro 2 due to its age in favor of the
 Pro 3 and 4 versions.&nbsp; At this point I'd switch to Apple, except that I'm adverse to the Apple ecosystem.</p>
<p>

</p><p>That sounds like a better technique should be tried.&nbsp; E.g. imagine that you have the SP2 drivers still installed, so then you can override Windows 10 choices by using the Browse my computer... Let me pick... method.&nbsp; Similarly this is the way to go for the

<p>I think that I'm getting to the bottom of the problem.&nbsp; I recently did an update to the system BIOS and somehow the BIOS I loaded was for a Surface Pro 4.&nbsp; If I look at the system information, the system thinks that it is a 4.&nbsp; Now the unit thinks that it
 is a Pro 4 but the mounted drivers are for a Pro 2, so when it tries to load a driver I get "Driver not migrated" messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question now is how do I reload the correct BIOS.&nbsp; I've been to several sites and they all say that you cannot manually load a BIOS image.&nbsp; I've downloaded the files, just don't know where to go from here.</p>

            <p>Hi Eagle,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no Service Packs 2 or 3 for any version of Windows 7.&nbsp; You are missing something when reviewing the offerings.&nbsp; Do you have a dual-boot system with XP and perhaps have booted to XP instead of Windows 7?&nbsp; Are you running a Virtual PC with XP installed
 and could they be to upgrade that XP installation&nbsp;while in virtual mode?&nbsp; Could they be for some other Microsoft product?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If checking further into what it's really saying or recognizing the above situations may apply in your situation doesn't resolve the problem, please repost here:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update?page=1&amp;tab=all&amp;tm=1300700638376">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update?page=1&amp;tab=all&amp;tm=1300700638376</a>&nbsp;and include the KB numbers of the the updates to which you are referring.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any doubts, do not install them until you've received expert advice on what they are and whether or not they are needed and why they are needed and how to install them since your question stated as it is with no assumptions would suggest you
 should not install them until you understand more as Windows 7 doesn't have such Service Packs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>Lifecam Cinema - focus issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> permitivity  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lifecam Cinema - focus issue</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I just brought a lifecam cinema.&nbsp; It's running on 32-bit WindowsXP, SP3, with the latest Microsoft webcam software.<br />
<br />
My Lifecam Cinema seems to not be auto-focusing.&nbsp; I'm 3 feet from the webcam, and I'm blurry and unfocused.&nbsp; The objects in the room are also blurry.&nbsp; The only thing that is in focus is if I take an object and hold it about 3 inches from the webcam.&nbsp; The focus
 seems to be right in front of the lens.<br />
<br />
I've tried playing with the focus setting under the microsoft Lifecam software.&nbsp; I've tried it with the "auto" check on the focus setting.&nbsp; I've tried unchecking the auto and manually moving the focus slider bar around and hitting apply.&nbsp; No difference in focus
 - everything behind a few inches of the lens is out of focus.<br />
<br />
I've tried different light levels.&nbsp; I've tried moving locations and setting the webcam up on another XP box.&nbsp; No improvement.<br />
<br />
Is it possible the unit I have is defective, and not auto focusing?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

<br />
I guess the unit is effectively defective, based upon your description. Anyway, before any claim, double check the software requirements for the model.<br />

            Just to close the loop - yes, the webcam was defective.&nbsp; I got a replacement and it focuses fine.&nbsp; So, the first one had auto focus issues.&nbsp; This is just to help those who look this up in the future.

<h2>            Huge DataStore.edb for Windows Updates in Vista causing wuauserv &#40;svchost.exe&#41; to eat huge amount of memory</h2>
                    Basically the same issue as was seen on XP last year and in 2007, which was fixed by an update to Windows Update Agent.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a standalone machine that's never been on WSUS. &nbsp;I'm guessing it had all the standard Toshiba bundles out of the box, but it currently has Office 2003 SBE &amp; Windows Defender along with iTunes, Skype, etc. &nbsp;I've tried clearing out any remnants of
 Norton or McAfee that might have been there, and run Fixit 50202 (KB971058) in aggressive mode, as suggested by
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-windows_update/wuaudtexe-is-really-bogging-down-my-computer/ef18ff87-db7f-4705-8105-33dcf9a9a03b?page=9">
PA Bear</a>.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Disabling Microsoft Update and letting it rebuild SoftwareDistribution makes it only 115MB. &nbsp;However, debugging has shown that it indexes this database in memory, ballooning actual memory usage to about twice that. &nbsp;With Microsoft Update enabled, it reached
 235MB and over 500MB memory usage. &nbsp;TrustedInstaller still runs at 100% CPU for minutes when rebuilding. &nbsp;I can upload logs somewhere if people think that will help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've doubled the memory in this machine, so it no longer swaps itself to death, but don't want re-enable Microsoft Updates yet. &nbsp;Anyone else experienced this on Vista?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cheers,</div>
<div>Mark</div>

<p>1. Does the computer-in-question belong to your or your employer?</p>
<p>2. Is this a sudden, new problem or...?</p>
<p>3. What anti-virus application or security suite is installed and is the subscription current?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>4. Had a Norton or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>5. Is Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1) or SP2 installed? [1]</p>
<p>6. Are ALL of the following updates listed in <strong>View installed updates</strong> (<em>not</em> Update History)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • KB2530548 [or KB2497640], KB2544893, KB2476490, KB2535512, KB2393802; KB2544521 [<em>or Windows Internet Explorer 9</em>]</p>

[1] Support for Vista Gold (no Service Packs) ended on 13 April <em>2010</em> and support for Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1) will end on
<em>Tuesday, 12 July 2011</em>. Computers still running Vista SP1 "will no longer receive software updates [i.e., updates released after 12 July 2011] from Windows Update" until SP2 has been installed (which will require that several Prerequisite Updates be
 installed first).</p>

                    I am trying to upgrade Windows Vista to Windows 7 Home Premium.<br />
<br />
I did everything that I should do before the upgrade, but when I tried to install it, all I got are the two following error messages:<br />
<br />
<em>This appication has failed to start because DU.DLL was not found.<br />
Re-installing the application may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
Windows could not load required file WinSetup.dll. The file may be <br />
corrupt. To install Windows, restart the installation. Error code: 0x7E</em><br />
<br />
I have searched on the internet to find solutions, but I could not find any.<br />
Could anyone please help?!<br />
<br />
God, if only I knew I'd encounter installation problems, I'll probably rather stay with Vista and save my $130 bucks.

            Hi,
<br />they never were needed. They are dangerous programs in fact and can effectively damage Windows up to reinstall will be needed.

            I've never noticed any difference between using and not using registry cleaners. In my opinion, I'm sure they are programs that serve to "deceive" the user, in relation to its functionality.

            I've noticed the difference several times (fortunately not on my own computer). E.g. CCleaner runned by unskilled technician on my father-in-law's  computer killed Internet access. When I worked for Acronis we've got a suggestion to buy one of cleaners. During the first testing this cleaner killed the sound at developer's laptop and so on.
<br />But the registry cleaners make their real job very well - cleaner's developers and sellers always have a thick layer of butter on their bread.

<p>They were *never* needed, and they should always be avoided.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><div><span>Registry cleaning programs are *all* snake oil. Cleaning of the registry isn't needed and is dangerous. Leave the registry alone and don't use any registry cleaner. Despite what many people think, and what vendors
 of registry cleaning software try to convince you of, having unused registry entries doesn't really hurt you.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p><span>The risk of a serious problem caused by a registry cleaner erroneously removing an entry you need is far greater than any potential benefit it may have.</span></p>
<p><span>However, if you insist on using a registry cleaner, note that the one in CCleaner is safer than most of the others. That doesn't mean it's safe--just that the risk of using it is less than with most.</span></p>

            Hi Samantha
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Expand the Network Adapters Section
<br />
<br />Do you see a WiFi device listed there and if so, does it have an exclamation mark beside it and what is the exact Model of that device?
<br />
<br />What is the exact Make and Model No. of your PC - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . . .

<p>There is no Wi-Fi information listed when I go to device manager and then Network Adapters. All that is listed is WAN miniports and one thing with I think the word Fam in it. No Wi-Fi which I thought to be weird. Like o said my laptop was working perfectly
 fine, then it shut itself down while I was using it and restarted itself and it has these problems instantly.&nbsp;</p>

            I have already done this, as well as Microsoft support, but it says that its already installed or there was an error or something like that, but it cant be found anywhere. I've tried many many many things for this issue and have been on the phone multiple
 times for a long period and this issue is still not being resolved. I'm beginning to think a Windows update caused this issue as I have seen many others with this simialr issue and they have mentioned that's what happened to them.&nbsp;

<h3> terishbon  say:</h3>
<h2>            What files should be in the HP_Recovery D&#58; &#63;</h2>
                    Hello everyone, I'm wondering what files were mean't to be in the HP_Recovery D: since, a while ago, I saw this file in "HP_Recovery D: &gt; Desktop &gt; Portal". So I deleted it thinking that I was stupid enough to try to backup my Portal game... right now
 I'm starting to worry if I deleted a critical file which is apart of the HP Recovery Manager.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What files are in HP_Recovery D: as default? And if the Portal file was an important file, how do I create another backup/partition?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>EDIT:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>There was a file of some sort in "HP_Recovery D: &gt; Desktop &gt; Portal". Which was named Desktop.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Upon deleting the Portal file with the Desktop file in it (Please dont get them two muddled up with) HP_Recovery drive. Will it affect anything with the Recovery Manager in any way?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thankyou, Terish.</div>

            <p>The HP recovery partition contains the files required to restore your PC to factory condition, and those required to create the HP recovery disks.</p>
<p>The Portal shortcut is the access to HP Recovery.</p>

<p>If you havent created the HP recovery Disks do so NOW as per HP instructions, in your paperwork or on HP&nbsp;support</p>

            So, I tried creating HP recovery disks. It gave me an error, saying I've already made a set for it. I've found all 3 of them. But I'm unsure whether they work or not. If I request recovery disks from HP, will they work with my computer still? even though
 I already made a set?
<div><br />
<div>Hmm, if my computer did get corrupted and I needed to use HP recovery, but I didn't have either the disks or partition working. Could I simply get it fixed by bringing the computer to the computer shop so they could restore it back?</div>

            <p>If you are really concerned then for peace of mind you need to fully test the recovery disk set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One option would be to get a spare drive for the computer (does not have to be from HP), install the drive and run the recovery disk set. If this then completes you can reinstate the original drive and mount the new one in a caddy and use as an external
 HDD. Alternatively you could keep the new system and mount the old drive in the caddy and recover your files from that into your new clean build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Less definitive but a simple check of the quality of the burn would be create a temporary folder on your hard disk and drag and drop the disk contents into that folder. That would at least prove the whole disk can be read. Or download an ISO creator tool
 such as <a href="http://alexfeinman.com/W7.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ISORecorder</a>&nbsp;to build an ISO of the disk. This would read the entire disk so proving the original and allow you to archive them in a different format.</p>

            <p>For specific information as what is included in the HP Recovery partition and its purpose you might be better asking on the HP forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Precisely how Recovery is implemented will vary for each manufacturer slightly so for example my Dell does not have the Portal\Desktop directory in its recovery directory. It is not directly part of Windows 7.</p>

 have windows xp sp2 and recently I installed a software which unfortunately was or contained a virus . I exactly don't remember the name of the software but it said "setup.exe" around 3 MB . I am using a licenced version software ESET NoD32 and while I was
 intalling the above software the antivirus warned about it but I ignored it.</p>
<p>Whats Happening :</p>
<p>When the windows start and the desktop appears everything freezes , I can use the mouse but cannot do anything. Then using keyboard I open task manager and&nbsp;ends a process (blue one in the image)which eventually ends the freeze. Now I can browse through the
 computer like open drives and folders but can not run a single programme not even a photoviewer (picasa). I have tried using run command but not working,open control pannel not working.Every thing freezes again whenever I try to open a programme even the antivirus.Another
 thing is I cannot open the pc in safe mode(F8), I don't know why!!!!</p>
<p>I don't know the virus name cause cannot do anything to know the virus name,if you know a way then do tell me.</p>
<p>I know the windows in really old but i have some really important stuff in C drive and canot use cut or copy because of the issue.</p>
<p>The help would mean a lot, I am really hoping to hear some solutions.</p>
<p>Any thing else to ask ..please do.</p>

            <p>Sir I do know how to open windows in safe mode as I have done it before and also I used the other method in which shutting down the windows when it loads up so after few seconds (10 sec) when you open it again it automatically asks you to open in safe mode

<p>If so, get F-secure and boot from it. If it find the viruses, it will remove it. After that, you might be able to get into safe mode.</p>

    <title>How to retain older restore points under windows 8&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rsbrux  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to retain older restore points under windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    Since moving up from Windows 7 to Windows 8 I no longer have the problem with VSS errors causing the loss of all restore points.<br />
However, Windows 8 is apparently getting rid of older restore points, even though the space I have reserved for restore points is more than twice the size needed.&nbsp; Even after checking "Show more restore points", System Restore doesn't show anything more than
 a month old.<br />
How can I get Windows 8 to keep restore points up to the limit of the designated storage space, regardless of their age or number?<br />

<p>I frequently make manual restore points.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>The one I made today increased the usage from 3.93 GB to 3.96 GB.</p>
<p>I don't find anything helpful in Ronnie's post.&nbsp; Restore points are being created, but not kept, even though there is plenty of room.</p>
<p>System Restore currently shows 2 restore points by default, 6 if I check the box "Show more restore points".&nbsp; All are less than three weeks old.&nbsp; I would like to keep old restore points for months, not weeks.<br />

Unfortunately, it doesn't help at all.<br />
I would be thrilled if my restore points would last for 90 days.&nbsp; So far none have lasted as much as three weeks.<br />
I performed a complete new installation of WIndows 8, not an upgrade of my existing WIndows 7 installation.&nbsp; I have created many new restore points since installing Windows 8.&nbsp; What should I check?<br />
Thanks for responding.<br />

Thanks for the heads-up!<br />
If this is why my restore points are being thrown out, it would be nice if Microsoft would document this limitation somewhere!<br />

            <p>Yes this is very annoying for me too. I have W7 laptop(s) and a new W8 laptop. All HP. On all my laptops, I set/configure Disk space for restore points, to 20GB's or more. All my W7 laptops, will keep saving restore points and keep them all, until the 20GB
 is reached, then will replace the oldest one, as a new one is needed. BUT with my W8, and my Mums W8.1, only 3 restore points are EVER kept. It never keeps any more than Maybe? 4? restore points. I saw just now, 3 restore points, and one from an old system
 image. (which doesnt count). Only 5GB of the 20GB were used, and is ever used. It has never yet, built up a decent stack of restore points. And as it being such a dodgy unstable system, W8, then I would like it to keep more points. As many as "I" want to keep.
 Something has been done or changed to limit the points to just 3 (+SystemImage Points) I would like it to be like W7 is/was, or to be told why this limit of 3, or how to change it so I can keep how many I like. Please find out or tellme if you know Why? Thank
 you, Bye. Brent Rossiter. </p>

            <p>Sadly, the initial response from John Rubdy completely ignores the technical details provided by rsbrux in the initial post and question: &nbsp;"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Windows 8 is apparently getting rid of older restore points,
 even though the space I have reserved for restore points is more than twice the size needed.</span>" &nbsp;In other words, the end user validated that the size of space being reserved for restore points exceeds the usage of the restore points that the operating
 system is maintaining.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having the same issue.</p>
<p>I have reserved 296-GB of space.</p>
<p>Current system restore points are using only 21-GB of space.</p>
<p>The operating system is maintaining only four system restore points. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is absurd. &nbsp;I want to maintain a much larger history of restore points, say about forty restore points, spanning across the past twelve months. &nbsp;This is why I've granted the OS the 226-GB reservation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Why would the OS blindly ignore what the end-user wants (as observed by the configured space reservation) and maintain but four restore points? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been a "computer guy" since 1980. &nbsp;(just so you have a little confidence in this poster's technical capabilities)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those who would question "why" a person would want to maintain such a long history of system restore points - yes; I use a full back-up solution to regularly back up my computer systems. &nbsp;I've seen instances, however, where it would be beneficial to
 move to a restore point that only affects programs and the like and not documents. &nbsp;This is where system restore points come in handy.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 DirectX Issues... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffjackson6  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 DirectX Issues...</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I updated my PC to Windows 8.1 as soon as I could, and I had no problems with the installation or any issues with my PC since updating. &nbsp;I also messed around my Device Manager a couple days ago, but was very careful to only mess around with Google and
 Samsung drivers... So I don't think that is causing the problem, but I'm not ruling it out (I was messing around with my Samsung Galaxy Nexus phone [installing an Android 4.4 ROM on it] but as I mentioned, I was very careful only to mess with drivers associated
 with Samsung and Google, so I'm thinking/hoping I didn't mess anything up during that process). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyways, I haven't played any video games on my PC since updating to Windows 8.1 a few weeks ago, so I haven't noticed this problem until trying to play this new game I downloaded today. &nbsp;After installing it, I got the error "Could not find any compatible
 Direct3D devices" followed by the error "DXUTCreateDevice failed." &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The first thing I did to troubleshoot was I tried opening another game, and I got a similar sounding error: "Failed to initialize renderer NiXAdapterDesc::GetDeviceCaps() failed." &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Another game, another error: "Alpha blending with D3DFMT_A16B16G16R16F is not supported, which is required to run this game."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried more games, identical and similar errors kept popping up, and I could load no games. &nbsp;Keep in mind, all of these games worked flawlessly on my PC before.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, I tried a system restore. &nbsp;Upon restoring to a restore point October 24th (Oct 24th is the oldest I could restore to, presumably because I think I updated to Windows 8.1 right before that), I got this error message upon restarting the computer:</div>
<div>"System Restore did not complete successfully. &nbsp;Your computer's system files and settings were not changed.</div>
<div>Details:<br />
System Restore failed to extract the file</div>
<div>(C:\Windows\assembly\GAC\Microsoft.DirectX) from the restore point. &nbsp;The restore point was damaged or was deleted during the restore."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, I ran dxdiag, and it said my directX is up to date with no problems detected. &nbsp;I also found out during this process that it doesn't seem possible to update/reinstall DirectX externally - only through a Windows update. &nbsp;My Windows is currently up to
 date. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Finally, I opened Recovery and selected "Refresh your PC without affecting your files." &nbsp;Tried that, said it was missing files (presumably the Microsoft.DirectX file?) and it asked me to input my recovery media. &nbsp;Right then I was SO happy with myself for
 remembering to create a recovery disc a while back. &nbsp;A WINDOWS 8.0 RECOVERY DISC. &nbsp;I just updated to Windows 8.1, so it's saying I put in the wrong disc. &nbsp;I never made a Windows 8.1 recovery disc...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I haven't tried the option "Remove everything and reinstall Windows" yet for two reasons... One, that's a pain. &nbsp;Two, I'm probably still missing the necessary files that I was missing for the "Refresh" option. &nbsp;</div>
<div>I also did not try the "Advanced Startup" option where it will start up from a disc (my recovery disc) because the recovery disc I made is for Windows 8.0 and I'm not sure if it will work now that I am running WIndows 8.1.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;Please know that I did not come to this forum first by any means, and searched the web for quite a while without finding any fixes for my problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance for any help.</div>

            Upon doing some further research, I noticed a lot of people are having DirectX 11.2 issues with Windows 8.1, so I thought I should look into my video card. &nbsp;I have a NVidia GeForce GTX 560 Ti, which according to this
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.593150517373782.1073741844.202190886469749&amp;type=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
post </a>is compatible with Direct X 11.2 on Windows 8.1. &nbsp; However, I went into my Device Manager to check for driver updates, and after searching for drivers it said it found one to install, attempted to install it, and I got this error message:
<div>"Windows found driver software for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install it.<br />
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti<br />
The require line was not found in the INF.</div>
<div>If you know the manufacturer of your device, you can visit its website and check the support section for driver software."</div>
<div><br />
<div>So that's what I did. &nbsp;I downloaded NVIDIA's "GeForce Experience" application which updates drivers and "optimizes settings" and checks to make sure your drivers are up to date. &nbsp;According to the "NVIDIA GeForce Experience" application, my driver is in
 fact up to date, and no issues were detected (no issues were detected in the Device Manager as well).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, apparently the release date for the driver that I'm currently using for my graphics card was released on 11/7/2013, so it seems to be very, very up to date.</div>

            Alright I'm sorry I'm having a conversation with myself here. &nbsp;According to this GeForce Experience application, my driver is version 331.65 and released 11/7/2013. &nbsp;However, according to DxDiag and Device Manager, the driver for my video card was released
 9/12/2013 version 9.18.13.2723 and installed 10/27/2013... &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Also, in DxDiag, the feature leavels include "11.0, 10.1, 10.0, 9.3, 9.2, 9.1" and 11.1 and 11.2 are not listed.

            I apologize. &nbsp;I went to NVIDIA's website and downloaded the driver version that the "GeForce Experience" application said I had (and was up to date), and I uninstalled and reinstalled my video driver to the most up-to-date one from NVidia's website (version
 331.65) and now everything is fixed.
<div><br />
<div>Moral of the story, don't trust Device Manager to update your drivers correctly?</div>

<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.

            If you upgraded within the free upgrade offer to Windows 10 and moved to Windows 8 later, you can still get Windows 10 for free.

            Hi Elizabeth, you have 2 options, upgrade to Windows 10 from 8 or clean install Windows 10
<br />
<br />Clean installing is the preferred method, you will end up with a more stable and responsive system
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers
<br />
<br />Click this link:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br /> to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool or create the ISO file which you can later burn to DVD
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to clean install Windows 10
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS, go into your BIOS and make the following changes:
<br />1.	Insert the Bootable Media
<br />2.	Disable Secure Boot
<br />3.	Enable Legacy Boot
<br />4.	If Available enable CSM
<br />5.	If Required enable USB Boot
<br />6.	Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order
<br />7.	Save BIOS changes and restart your System
<br />
<br />You will have the options to upgrade or clean install once you have booted from the Installation Media
<br />
<br />NOTE: during the installation process, your system will reboot, at that point, you may need to go into your BIOS and change the boot order so your system boots from your Hard Drive, otherwise the installation may start all over again - do not remove the installation media at this point

    <title>How to create a windows 7 boot disk with downloaded files. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to create a windows 7 boot disk with downloaded files.</h2>
                    I am trying to upgrade my laptop with a SSD. I don't want the manufacturer bloatware so what I am trying to do is create a boot disk.&nbsp; I found and downloaded my exact copy of Windows 7 through here. It is Windows 7 Home Premium OA X15-53758 x64. What I
 downloaded was not a .ISO unfortunately but a cluster of very many files. I am getting an error on ImgBurn when trying to burn them into a .ISO on a DVD. The error is basically saying some file exists already and is unable to complete. This isn't making much
 sense to me since i'm burning this on a blank DVD.<br />
I just want to make a bootable DVD of my version of windows that my product key will work for. I am new to this stuff so sorry if this is a dumb question or whatever. If anyone could please explain how I can accomplish this it would be much appreciated.<br />

            <p>What you downloaded was the wrong thing if you are unable to burn it through ImgBurn, here are the appropriate links to .ISO files:</p>
<p>• <a href="http://msft.digitalrivercontent.net/win/X17-58997.iso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

- 32 bit</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ImgBurn - In addtion to supporting the creation of CD's from .ISO files,<br />
it supports a wide range of other image file formats, and it's free.<br />
(BIN, CUE, DI, DVD, GI, IMG, MDS, NRG, PDI and ISO)<br />
