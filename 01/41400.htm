<h2>            Sculpt Touch Mouse Can&#39;t Connect</h2>
                    <span>Hi,</span>
                    <span>Hi,</span>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently got a Microsoft Sculpt Touch mouse. Originally, it connected fine via bluetooth with my laptop (Acer Aspire V7 running Windows 8). However, since then it has been disconnected and no longer works. I<span>&nbsp;</span><i>can</i>&nbsp;connect
 my Android phone to my computer via bluetooth though so the problem seems to be specific to the mouse.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It is listed in the Devices section in the Windows 8 settings menu, but its status is always offline. When I click "Add Device", the mouse does not show up in the list of devices found.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span>Removing the mouse from the devices menu fails with a "Remove Failed" message. I can uninstall the mouse from the bluetooth devices in the Device Manager, but the mouse eventually reappears later on.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I have run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter and it says that "Hardware changes might not have been detected." Running the troubleshooter again gives the same message, so I don't know that it is fixing whatever problem it
 finds.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I have tried reinstalling my bluetooth adapter drivers, but that hasn't helped either. Does anyone have any ideas?</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
<br />
                </div>

            <p>This worked for me. I'm running Win 8.1 on a Sony Vaio Flip 13, and was having endless difficulties getting my Sculpt Comfort to reconnect. I, however, had a lot of difficulty deleting ownership of the keys that rg2k mentions - generally (not exact steps),
 I had to go through the following procedure:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable Administrator account</li><li>Boot into Safe Mode</li><li>Locate the keys</li><li>For each sub-folder to the main key, do the following:
<ol>
<li>Set the owner of the folder to Administrator</li><li>Un-check the box "Replace owner on subcontainers and objects"</li><li>Hit apply. A new permission entry should pop up.</li><li>Click the button "Enable inheritance"</li><li>Hit apply again. A bunch more permission entries should pop up.</li><li>Hit OK.</li></ol>
</li><li>Keep doing this all the way down the tree. My tree looked like:
<ul>
<li>Bluetooth blah blah blah
<ul>
<li>Properties
<ul>
<li>(gibberish letters and numbers)
<ul>
<li>0001</li><li>0002</li><li>etc...</li></ul>
</li><li>(more gibberish)
<ul>
<li>0009</li><li>000A</li><li>etc...</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>I had to do this for every single one of the items in this tree.</strong> Once I'd done that, I was able to delete the keys and restart the computer in normal mode.</li><li>When I restarted, the Sculpt Comfort still showed up. Distaster! All is lost! However, I tried deleting the mouse from Devices and Printers (which worked), and then reconnecting my mouse, which worked! I haven't restarted my computer yet since successfully
 reconnecting, so we'll see if this solution is persistent.</li></ol>
<p>Full disclosure: <strong>I have no idea what I'm doing</strong> -&nbsp;I'm about as well-suited to this task as an ice sculptor doing open-heart surgery. If I've done something dreadful to my registry, or if someone else has a better understanding of what is
 wrong and why what I did worked, please let me know - I'd really appreciate learning more about this.</p>

<p>I do not have other apps and I do not sign in with my Microsoft account password. I do not use Outlook, OneDrive, a MS based OS for smartphone or X-box .I assume that is not a requirement of using a Windows 10 OS. on my pc.

<h2>            Skype Conversation History from &#62;1 year ago</h2>
                    <p>So my boyfriend and I have been using skype for the majority of our relationship, and recently I've been sentimental and wanted to export our history for a Christmas present. Problem is, we started messaging each other around August of 2017, but since Skype
 only saves history from 1 year ago, and I only just decided to try to export the history :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to access this, or contact skype and see if they could help?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Thank you for the information. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since we are already using the cloud infrastructure, it will not show the older messages as with the peer-to-peer architecture.

<p>

<p>The system will try to locate profiles with available chat history. Select the profile and click on

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
<br />
You can activate Windows Defender real-time protection by turning it on in <strong>
Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> &gt;
<strong>Windows Defender</strong>. For additional information with regard to using Windows Defender, you may refer to the link below:<br />
<br />
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17464/windows-defender-help-protect-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Help protect my computer with Windows Defender</a></strong><br />
<br />
However, if you are using a third party antivirus, it will be best to contact the developer, or check on their support website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you require further assistance.</p>

<p>To install XP you need to boot from the Windows XP disk. Insert the CD and restart the computer. If there is a message to "press any key to boot from disk" you must press a key on the keyboard to boot from the CD. You will need to format the Windows 7 install,
 then install XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can't boot from the CD:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BIOS - How to Enter the BIOS and Change Boot Order To Boot From CD/DVD<br />
<br />
The computer may need to be set to boot from the disk drive. <br />
Every computer is different, when you first turn on the computer it should tell you what button to push to enter the BIOS. It's usually one of the following and you must push it within the first 5 seconds:<br />
<br />
F1&nbsp; F2&nbsp; F10&nbsp; F12 ESC&nbsp; DEL <br />
<br />
Once in the BIOS you have to find the menu with the boot order and change it so it boots from the CD/DVD drive first. Every computer is a little different for this process as well so I can't give exact directions.<br />
<br />
If your BIOS settings are correct, when the computer restarts if there is a message to "press any key to boot from disk" you must press a key on the keyboard to boot from the disk.<br />

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>From
 where did you get the Product Identification number?</span></p>
<p><span>Product Identification (PID) number is not the product key that you used to install Windows. Have a look at the following article link to Locate
 PID for Windows:</span></p>

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the exact error message that you get when you try to enter the PID? (If possible, copy and paste the error message)</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>For
 which Microsoft Product Support are you trying to start the request?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 it read as “Windows is activated” just above the PID in “Computer” properties?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Post with the required information so that we can help you better. Look forward to hearing back from you.</span></p>

    <title>Unable to open any exe files, even in safe mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> poodlep6240  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to open any exe files, even in safe mode</h2>
                    
<p>My computer has been working fine until last night. When I switched it on today my Ad-Aware Pro detected multiple attempts to change the registry. I wasn't sure what they were so blocked them. Now the Ad-Watch part of Ad-Aware won't load and I cannot open
 any .exe files at all, it just tells me there's no program associated with performing this action and to create one in folder options. My Windows Explorer seems to be missing (the icon that launches it anyway) and system restore won't work either (get the
 same message - no program etc...). I've downloaded several anti-spyware scanners but I can't run those either!&nbsp;When I rebooted after blocking&nbsp;the suspicious attempts to change the registry&nbsp;it stopped on the Welcome screen with a dialog box that has two little
 black lines in it, a close button (which doesn't work) and an ok button. The boot process will not continue unless you click ok.&nbsp;It does this now on every boot.&nbsp;Also, I've booted in safe mode but nothing works in there either and I cannot 'connect to the server'
 to update my AV. I've tried the run dialog in the start menu to get the command prompt and that doesn't work either, I get the same message about there being no program etc... For the few icons I do click that actually do something, they all open Ad-Aware.
 That's probably my fault - the first time it asked me to associate an icon with a program, I chose to apply it to all files like this. Do&nbsp;you think its a virus?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi PoodleP6240; <span>I
 do not think there were any ill intentions and you have nothing to apologize for. I completely agree with Maurice this is a malware issue. That does not, however, mean you are in the worong forum. I do not analyze Hijack This logs here out of respect. There
 is actually nothing in MS terms of use which prohibit the same. <br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I have no idea what forum you have been to. However, you are welcome to post your issue on the forum on the link below. You will have to create an account to post. This prevents spamming and drive-by posting. If necessary I will personally work with
 you from the chat box there. THe forum is completely free. </span></p>
<p><span>The dll error is certainly due to malware. This is nothing more than the registry calling for the execution of a file which has since been removed by AVG. Your choice but, I have seen and repaired much worse cases than yours.<br />

            Use the browser on the Desktop instead of the start page. Download Chrome and/or Firefox to test those browsers. You can have several browsers. The Desktop is very familiar--much like windows 7. You will be much happier skipping the Start page.&nbsp;

</p><p>But what I don't like is it putting itself on the taskbar. Right-click a blank part of the taskbar and choose Toolbars&gt;HP Support Assistant. That should remove it from the taskbar.</p>

            <p>Thank you Entegy, I assume the thing is not going to be a problem, and using your response as my guide, I removed it from my task-bar.&nbsp; Your guess that I have and HP computer was wrong, but a guess is a guess.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a Gateway and it seems to be doing
 the job, with one exception.&nbsp; My screen will cloud over obscuring the pixels when I watch a movie or video and this lasts about 10 seconds total.&nbsp; During this time, my Gateway computer makes a heck of a harsh racket and sound like a heavy BRRRRRRR.&nbsp; Everything
 then begins to clear, and I can again watch the movie or video.&nbsp; It has been doing this for the last month or two.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; Should I add this comment to the Add Question area?&nbsp; Thanks again for your assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi Todd.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Homegroup is removed in Version 1803.  You shouldn't have to do anything else. 
<br />
<br />What's working most for network detection issues caused by Version 1803 is here:  <a href="https://windowsunplugged.blog/2018/03/27/network-computers-no-longer-present-in-file-explorer-on-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsunplugged.blog/2018/03/27/networ...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over these steps to make sure File Sharing is set up correctly:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>
<br />
<br />There are Changes to file sharing over a network in Windows 10:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4092694/windows-10-changes-to-file-sharing-over-a-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/409269...</a>

<br />
<br />This is the latest fix that's working for Version 1803 breaking networks.  Please try it and report back:   
<br />
<br />- shut all computer and network gear down then start again. 
<br />- Try browsing to some of the computers manually, press Windows key + R, type: \\computername, hit Enter
<br />- Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />1. Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them to Automatic (Delayed Start).
<br />2. When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />If not then start over and set it up again:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>

<br />HomeGroup feature is completely removed from V1803, so you can't modify previously created HomeGroup.

<p>Hello it's Todd Reese again.</p>
<p>I realize that the HomeGroup feature has been disabled in Windows 10 V1803.</p>
<p>Does that mean that I cannot delete old HomeGroup Networks that I accidentally created?.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason that I am asking this question is because I plan to reinstall Windows 10 once again VERY SOON.</p>
<p>I have reinstalled Windows 10 atleast 3 times in recent days to try to resolve another issue that I have encountered recently with a piece of third-party software.&nbsp; Basically, the software WILL NOT update.&nbsp; Since the third-party software WILL NOT update,
 I decided to try to use another SD card in the device, NOW my computer WILL NOT detect the SD card.&nbsp; That is why I decided to reinstall Windows 10, I think that may resolve the problem that I am having with my SD card.&nbsp; However, my hard disk is 2% fragmented
 no matter how I reinstall Windows 10.&nbsp; Every time I open File Explorer the network that I accidentally created with HomeGroup appears when I check Networks.&nbsp; All I can think of is that the Network must be the reason that my Hard disk is fragmented.&nbsp; Even though
 I have had this computer since 2011 the hard disk works quite well.</p>

<p>Well this is why I un-join from the homegroup prior to updating to v1803 on all PC's I work on. Then there is no corruption issues, And fragmented files is not about homegorup now being gone.. There are no Homegroups to delete. Ir is removed from the OS
 in v1803. You can go to previous items you did share and try removing share access to them, even though they are not shared in homegroup without a homegroup, this might help if you are getting some error messages or items opening up automatically. And if you
 have to keep installing Windows all the time, you need to start using the PC in a different way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SD card detection, well that is probably because of windows update. check the drivers for it in device manager.

<p>First I need to clarify something, I really did not think that the disk fragmentation issue that I am facing had anything to do with the&nbsp; HomeGroup connection that I tried to put on my computer as an experiment.&nbsp; The ONLY reason that I suspect that the HomeGroup
 connection was the ONLY new recent change that I had made to my computer BEFORE my disk was showing signs of defragmentation.&nbsp; I try to do basic computer maintenance&nbsp; on a regular basis, and before I experimentally&nbsp; set up the HomeGroup&nbsp; my disk was showing
 0% defragmentation.&nbsp; Since I have installed the HomeGroup&nbsp; my disk is showing anywhere between 1 to 2 percent defragmentation., which is the main reason that I am even trying to delete the HomeGroup that I accidentally created.&nbsp; Once I can get rid of this
 HomeGroup network connection, I am quite confident that I can figure out how to deal with the other issues.&nbsp; I have found a good number of solutions to this problem that would require me to edit the Windows Registry.&nbsp; Since I realize how vital the Windows
 Registry is, I REALLY DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT UNLESS I JUST ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>
<p>Todd</p>

<p>Your C:\ drive will ALWAYS have fragmented files. Some system files can never be moved, therefore they can not be defragmented.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And why are you worrying about even 10 percent fragmented files. You are not going to gain anything by getting it down to 2 or 4 percent.

<p>Since I am using a store-bought computer that I did not assemble myself, I try to keep it as clean as I can, which is why I tend to notice and want to take care of the little things such as disk defragmentation.&nbsp; I have seen so many people who use computers
 eventually get into a huge mess because they fail to do basic maintenance on their computers such as cleaning up their junk files with Disk Cleanup, defragmenting their disks their disks with disk defragmentor, and checking their computers for spyware and
 viruses.&nbsp; Sure doing that kind of stuff can be time consuming, but it does need to be done occasionally, Fortunately these days, it is not necessary to be in front of the computer while it scans for Viruses and Spyware.</p>
<p>Those scans can be quite time consuming which would obviously bore most people.</p>
<p>The point that I am getting at is that, I do not want to be one of those people who gets into trouble because I did not take the time to perform basic system maintenance.&nbsp; That is why I tend to look for small issues like an extra network hanging around that
 should not be there, especially after a reinstall of the operating system.&nbsp; My point is that I do not want to fall victim to system failure, like I have seen so many people do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as a side-note, I do realize that not all files can be defragmented, but I do like to keep my harddisk as close as possible to 0% fragmentation.&nbsp; I was doing an excellent job of that until recently.&nbsp; The only change that I can recall making is the HomeGroup
 Network that I created shortly before the HomeGroup Service was permanently disabled.&nbsp; Even though the HomeGroup Service has been permanently disabled the Network connection is still showing.&nbsp; I do agree with You that the Network connection is probbably not
 the reason for the disk defragmentation that I am experiencing but if that is not the reason then there would have to be something else going on I would think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You for Your help in this matter.</p>

<p>All my PC's are tuned and run great. But defrag is not going to improve anything really. Only if it was really fragmented, then I would defrag it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows I believe does it on a schedule anyways or you can. It only helps apps and system operations open a little faster, and I mean so little there is no difference in today's PC's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I never have to re install the operating system on any of mine or friends and families PC's I work on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, Take Care.</p>

            Hi <span>TeresaBlack,</span><br />
<br />
<p><span>To help you with your concern, we suggest that you reconfigure your account with Windows Live Mail.
<br />
<br />
Just follow the instructions on the link below: <br />

            Hi <span>TeresaBlack</span>,<br />
<br />
The error message that you are getting is cause by the following reasons:<br />
<span><br />
1. Incorrect POP settings (usually the SSL option for SMTP) – please check with your&nbsp;provider if it is required or not.<br />
2. Firewall blocking ports (usually port 25) – could be 3rd party since Windows Firewall generally allows this port through.<br />
<br />
To resolve this, you need to reconfigure your email account to Live Mail to re-establish the connection. Please refer to the solution article below for the steps:<br />
<br />

 account in Windows Live Mail</span></a><span><br />
<br />
I&nbsp;recommend that you folllow the suggestion above so that we can resolve the issue.<br />

<p>Try booting into Safe Mode with networking and see if you get the same message.&nbsp; If not, go to Start / Search Box and type msconfig.exe and enter and double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Go to the Startup Tab and find an entry for acrodist.exe
 and uncheck the box to remove it from startup.&nbsp; Then reboot and see if that resolves the problem.</p>
<p>If not, read on.</p>
<p><span><span>Bluescreen errors typically mean hardware or driver issues (though it could also be software).&nbsp; Read the posts and follow
 the procedures set forth by Spirit MVP in the following thread regarding the Blue Screen of Death.&nbsp; They should help you resolve your problem.</span></span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/3deab2fa-4000-4136-8c78-a3d22b1db009" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistarepair/thread/3deab2fa-4000-4136-8c78-a3d22b1db009</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A
 lot of that is duplicated below but it also offers some other options and explanations of bluescreen errors.&nbsp; What we really need now is the EXACT and ENTIRE text of the bluescreen message - just copy it down and post it in a reply.&nbsp; If the system shuts down
 too fast to copy the message, go to Start / Control Panel / System / Advanced System Settings / Advanced / Startup and Recover / and uncheck the box to Automatically Restart.<span>&nbsp;</span>Also check the box to Write an Event to the System Log and
 select Complete Memory Dump and check Overwrite any existing file.<span>&nbsp;</span>This will freeze the program on the bluescreen so you have time to copy the information.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Can you boot into Safe Mode with networking?<span>&nbsp;</span>Skip
 any steps here or above that require you to be able to boot normally if you can’t stay or get booted (and the same for safe mode if that’s the case there as well).<span>&nbsp;</span>Post back when you’ve done whatever you can.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can also use SkyDrive</span></span><a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://news.softpedia.com/news/SkyDrive-Microsoft-s-Windows-Live-Storage-Service-in-the-Cloud-61977.shtml</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;to
 upload dump and text files related to the error (as you discover them throughout this and the above processes) which may help us identify the problem.&nbsp; Just post back the link to where they are.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.&nbsp; Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information you should
 be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one
 you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps with another computer if necessary).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;startup (Start / Control Panel
 / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To
 fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp; Go to Device Manager by going to start /
 search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click
 on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should get any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft
 Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.<span>&nbsp;</span>You
 may also want to try the Driver Verifier Manager to see if you can identify the driver or device responsible (assuming that is the cause):</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE and only if you can still boot normally).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

            I am not&nbsp;running&nbsp;Vista, will the procedures you have suggested work on the XP Pro. OS? My original bluescreen occured after an MS update and accomapnying restart. After I went to my user desk top&nbsp;I&nbsp;received a blue screen with a stop: message after windows
 start up&nbsp;stating windows needs to shut down to protect the machine from fatal damage (not exact wording)&nbsp;with the following information 0x0000008e (0xc0000005, 0x80551211, 0Xaea27b94, 0x00000000).&nbsp;I did a&nbsp;manual shut down, restarted and got the message I referred
 to in my original communication. Unfortunately I have been unsucessful at getting to a system restore due to the machine locking up. Hardware all appears to be in good order. I can also point to an update to a newer version of Norton 360 at approximately the
 same time frame that the blue screens and error messages began to occur. I have not tried to start up in safe mode yet. Thanks again for your help. Any and all suggestions are greatly apprec

<p>Those procedures and links are specifically for Vista.&nbsp; If used, they may cause harm to your system as compatibility and applicablitilty has not been tested.&nbsp; The concepts may be similar, but the procedures and options and links and donloads may all be different
 with XP.&nbsp; I suggest you ignore these suggestions since they are for the wrong operating system.</p>

            @ brooon:<br />
While DuDe's suggestion won't help you directly (you, having Home Premium,&nbsp;have no GPEdit), you can still check the Registry keys that are affected by the mentioned policies.<br />
(GPEdit is but a nice frontend to various Registry settings, anyways.)<br />
<br />
Take a look at the following keys:<br />
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<span>HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsMediaCenter\MediaCenter<br />
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<span>HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsMediaCenter\MediaCenter</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<br />
</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
A ValueData of 0 = MC can run; 1= MC is disabled.<br />
<br />
Standard warning:&nbsp; incorrect editing of the Windows Registry can have far-reaching consequences, and may result in your system becoming unbootable (possibly requiring reinstalling the operating system.)&nbsp; Be careful!!!!!<br />
<br />
Don't change anything in there yet.&nbsp; Just open regedit, and take a look for those two keys.&nbsp; If they're there, post the ValueData displayed.&nbsp; If they're not there, post that they aren't there.<br />
<br />
